### Subsection: 1.2a The Concept of User Innovation

User innovation is a concept that has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in the field of product development. It refers to the process of innovation by intermediate users (e.g., user firms) or consumer users (individual end-users or user communities), rather than by suppliers (producers or manufacturers). This concept is closely aligned to co-design and co-creation, and has been proven to result in more innovative solutions than traditional consultation methodologies.

Eric von Hippel and others have observed that many products and services are actually developed or at least refined, by users, at the site of implementation and use. These ideas are then moved back into the supply network. This is because products are developed to meet the widest possible need; when individual users face problems that the majority of consumers do not, they have no choice but to develop their own modifications to existing products, or entirely new products, to solve their issues. Often, user innovators will share their ideas with manufacturers in hopes of having them produce the product, a process called free revealing. However, user innovators also generate their own firms to commercialize their innovations and generate new markets, a process called "consumer-led market emergence." For example, research on how users innovated in multiple boardsports shows that some users capitalized on their innovations, founding firms in sports that became global markets.

Based on research on the evolution of Internet technologies and open source software Ilkka Tuomi further highlighted the point that users are fundamentally social. User innovation, therefore, is also socially and socio-technically distributed innovation. According to Tuomi, key uses are often unintended uses invented by user communities that reinterpret and reinvent the meaning of emerging technological opportunities.

The existence of user innovation, for example, by users of industrial robots, rather than the manufacturers of robots, is a core part of the argument against the Linear Innovation Model. This model, proposed by von Hippel, suggests that the traditional linear model of innovation, where suppliers develop products based on their own ideas and then market them to users, is no longer sufficient in today's rapidly changing technological landscape. Instead, user innovation plays a crucial role in the development of breakthrough products and services.

In the next section, we will explore the role of users in the development of breakthrough products and services in more detail.

### Subsection: 1.2b Role of Users in Innovation

The role of users in innovation is a critical aspect of product development. As we have seen in the previous section, users are often the ones who identify the need for a new product or service, and they are the ones who develop and refine these products at the site of implementation and use. This section will delve deeper into the role of users in innovation, particularly in the context of breakthrough products and services.

#### 1.2b.1 User Innovation and Breakthrough Products

Breakthrough products and services are often the result of user innovation. These are products and services that are significantly different from existing ones, and they often create new markets or transform existing ones. User innovation plays a crucial role in the development of these products and services. 

For instance, consider the example of the iPhone. The iPhone was not developed by Apple Inc., the manufacturer, but by users who identified the need for a mobile device that could do more than just make calls. These users developed their own modifications to existing mobile devices, and eventually, Apple Inc. took note and developed the iPhone. This is a clear example of user innovation leading to a breakthrough product.

#### 1.2b.2 User Innovation and Market Emergence

User innovation also plays a crucial role in market emergence. Market emergence refers to the process by which new markets are created. This often happens when users develop their own products or services to meet their needs, and these products or services gain popularity among other users. 

For example, consider the market for multiple boardsports. Research has shown that some users of these sports have developed their own innovations, which they have then commercialized and marketed to other users. This has led to the creation of new markets for these sports, which were previously niche. This is a clear example of user innovation leading to market emergence.

#### 1.2b.3 User Innovation and Social and Socio-Technical Distributed Innovation

User innovation is also closely tied to social and socio-technical distributed innovation. This means that innovation is not just about technology, but also about social interactions and the interpretation and reinvention of technological opportunities by user communities. 

For instance, consider the evolution of Internet technologies and open source software. Research has shown that users are fundamentally social, and they often collaborate to develop and refine these technologies. This is a clear example of socially and socio-technically distributed innovation.

In conclusion, the role of users in innovation is crucial. They are often the ones who identify the need for new products and services, develop these products, and create new markets for them. Their role is particularly important in the development of breakthrough products and services, and in market emergence. Furthermore, their role is closely tied to social and socio-technical distributed innovation.

### Subsection: 1.2c Case Studies of User Innovation

#### 1.2c.1 User Innovation in Industrial Robotics

The case of user innovation in industrial robotics provides a compelling example of how users can drive innovation. Fleck (1988) observed that users, rather than manufacturers, were often the ones who developed and implemented innovative uses of industrial robots. These users were able to identify the need for new capabilities in industrial robots, and they developed their own modifications to existing robots to meet these needs. This user innovation led to the creation of new markets for industrial robots, as these modified robots were able to perform tasks that were previously not possible.

#### 1.2c.2 User Innovation in Multiple Boardsports

The case of multiple boardsports, as studied by Tuomi (2002), provides another example of user innovation leading to market emergence. Users of these sports developed their own innovations, which they then commercialized and marketed to other users. This led to the creation of new markets for these sports, which were previously niche. This case also highlights the social and socio-technical aspects of user innovation, as the users of these sports often collaborated to develop and refine these innovations.

#### 1.2c.3 User Innovation in Internet Technologies and Open Source Software

The case of user innovation in Internet technologies and open source software, as studied by Tuomi (2002), provides a further example of user innovation. Users of these technologies were often the ones who developed and implemented innovative uses of these technologies. This user innovation led to the creation of new markets for these technologies, as users were able to modify and adapt these technologies to meet their specific needs. This case also highlights the social and socio-technical aspects of user innovation, as users often collaborated to develop and refine these innovations.

In conclusion, these case studies highlight the crucial role of users in innovation. They show how users can drive innovation by identifying the need for new products and services, developing their own modifications to existing products, and creating new markets for these products.

### Introduction

In today's fast-paced and competitive business environment, the ability to develop breakthrough products and services is crucial for any organization. These breakthroughs not only help in gaining a competitive edge but also in meeting the ever-changing needs and demands of the consumers. However, understanding and meeting these needs is not always an easy task. It requires a deep understanding of the consumers, their behaviors, and their underlying needs. This is where ethnographic research comes into play.

Ethnography is a research method that involves immersing oneself in the culture of the consumers to understand their needs, behaviors, and values. It is a qualitative research method that provides a rich and in-depth understanding of the consumers, which can then be used to develop solutions that truly meet their needs. In this chapter, we will explore the concept of ethnography and how it can be used to determine the average users' needs. We will also discuss how these needs can then be translated into solutions that can be developed and implemented.

This chapter will be divided into several sections, each covering a specific aspect of ethnographic research and its application in product and service development. We will start by discussing the basics of ethnography, including its definition, principles, and techniques. We will then delve into the process of conducting ethnographic research, including data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Next, we will explore how ethnographic research can be used to understand the needs of the average users. Finally, we will discuss how these needs can be translated into solutions and how these solutions can be developed and implemented.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of ethnographic research and its application in product and service development. They will also have the necessary knowledge and tools to conduct their own ethnographic research and use the findings to develop breakthrough products and services. So, let's dive into the world of ethnography and discover how it can help in developing breakthrough products and services.




### Subsection: 7.1a Introduction to Design Continuum

The Design Continuum is a concept that has been widely used in the field of design, particularly in the development of products and services. It is a theoretical framework that helps designers understand the relationship between different design elements and how they contribute to the overall design. The Design Continuum is based on the idea that design is a continuous process, with no clear beginning or end. It is a dynamic and iterative process that involves a continuous cycle of observation, analysis, and design.

The Design Continuum is divided into three main stages: Discovery, Definition, and Development. Each stage is crucial in the design process and contributes to the overall design in a unique way. In the Discovery stage, designers immerse themselves in the context of the problem and observe the users and their needs. This stage is crucial in understanding the needs and behaviors of the users and identifying the key design opportunities.

In the Definition stage, designers use the insights gained from the Discovery stage to define the design problem and develop a design brief. This stage involves a deep analysis of the user needs and behaviors, as well as the context in which the product or service will be used. The design brief serves as a roadmap for the design process, outlining the key design objectives and constraints.

The Development stage is where the actual design process takes place. Designers use the design brief as a guide and develop a range of design solutions that address the identified design opportunities. These solutions are then evaluated and refined until the most effective one is selected. The selected design solution is then implemented and tested with the users to ensure that it meets their needs and expectations.

The Design Continuum is a powerful tool for designers as it provides a structured and systematic approach to the design process. It allows designers to understand the needs and behaviors of the users, define the design problem, and develop effective design solutions. By following the Design Continuum, designers can ensure that their products and services are user-centric and meet the needs of the average users.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of ethnography and how it can be used to understand the needs of the average users. We will also discuss how these needs can be translated into solutions and how these solutions can be developed and implemented.

# Information asymmetry

### Artificial intelligence

Tshilidzi Marwala and Evan Hurwitz in their study of the relationship between information asymmetry and artificial intelligence observed that there is a reduced level of information asymmetry between two artificial intelligent agents than between two human agents. As a consequence, when these artificial intelligent agents engage in financial markets it reduces arbitrage opportunities making markets more efficient. The study also revealed that as the number of artificial intelligent agents in the market increase, the volume of trades in the market will decrease. This is primarily because information asymmetry of the perceptions of value of goods and services is the basis of trade.

### Management

Information asymmetry has been applied in a variety of ways in management research ranging from conceptualizations of information asymmetry to building resolutions to reduce it. A 2013 study by Schmidt and Keil has revealed that the presence of private information asymmetry within firms influences normal business activities. Firms that have a more concrete understanding of their resources can use this information to gauge their advantage over competitors. In Ozeml, Reuer and Gulati's 2013 study, they found that 'different information' was an additional source of information asymmetry in venture capitalist and alliance networks; when different team members bring diverse, specialized knowledge, values and outlooks towards a common strategic decision, the lack of homogeneous information distribution among the members leads to inefficient decision making.

Firms have the ability to apply strategies that exploit their informational gap. One way they can do this is through impression management, which involves undertaking actions and releasing information to influence stakeholders' and analysts' opinions positively, exploiting information asymmetry as external parties heavily rely on the information released by firms.

#### Conclusion

Innovation is a crucial aspect of any successful business, and it is especially important in today's fast-paced and competitive market. However, despite the desire to innovate, many firms face resistance when trying to adopt radically new innovations. This chapter has explored the various reasons for this resistance and provided strategies for overcoming it.

One of the main reasons for resistance to innovation is the fear of failure. Many firms are hesitant to adopt new technologies or business models because they are unsure of the outcome. This fear can be paralyzing and prevent firms from taking the necessary steps to innovate. To overcome this resistance, firms must create a culture that encourages and supports risk-taking and experimentation. This can be achieved by providing resources and support for innovation, as well as creating a safe space for failure and learning from mistakes.

Another reason for resistance to innovation is the lack of understanding and knowledge about the new technology or business model. This can be due to a lack of expertise or resources within the firm, or a lack of information about the innovation itself. To overcome this resistance, firms must invest in training and education for their employees, as well as conducting thorough research and analysis on the innovation. This will not only increase their understanding and knowledge, but also build confidence in the innovation and its potential for success.

Resistance to innovation can also stem from a lack of alignment between the innovation and the firm's goals and values. This can occur when the innovation is seen as a threat to existing products or processes, or when it goes against the firm's culture or brand image. To overcome this resistance, firms must ensure that the innovation aligns with their overall strategy and values. This can be achieved by involving all stakeholders in the innovation process and clearly communicating the benefits and potential impact of the innovation.

In conclusion, resistance to innovation is a common challenge faced by many firms, but it is not insurmountable. By creating a culture that supports risk-taking and experimentation, investing in training and education, and ensuring alignment with the firm's goals and values, firms can overcome resistance and successfully adopt radically new innovations. This will not only lead to short-term gains, but also position the firm for long-term success in a constantly evolving market.

#### Conclusion

Innovation is a crucial aspect of any successful business, and it is especially important in today's fast-paced and competitive market. However, despite the desire to innovate, many firms face resistance when trying to adopt radically new innovations. This chapter has explored the various reasons for this resistance and provided strategies for overcoming it.

One of the main reasons for resistance to innovation is the fear of failure. Many firms are hesitant to adopt new technologies or business models because they are unsure of the outcome. This fear can be paralyzing and prevent firms from taking the necessary steps to innovate. To overcome this resistance, firms must create a culture that encourages and supports risk-taking and experimentation. This can be achieved by providing resources and support for innovation, as well as creating a safe space for failure and learning from mistakes.

Another reason for resistance to innovation is the lack of understanding and knowledge about the new technology or business model. This can be due to a lack of expertise or resources within the firm, or a lack of information about the innovation itself. To overcome this resistance, firms must invest in training and education for their employees, as well as conducting thorough research and analysis on the innovation. This will not only increase their understanding and knowledge, but also build confidence in the innovation and its potential for success.

Resistance to innovation can also stem from a lack of alignment between the innovation and the firm's goals and values. This can occur when the innovation is seen as a threat to existing products or processes, or when it goes against the firm's culture or brand image. To overcome this resistance, firms must ensure that the innovation aligns with their overall strategy and values. This can be achieved by involving all stakeholders in the innovation process and clearly communicating the benefits and potential impact of the innovation.

In conclusion, resistance to innovation is a common challenge faced by many firms, but it is not insurmountable. By creating a culture that supports risk-taking and experimentation, investing in training and education, and ensuring alignment with the firm's goals and values, firms can overcome resistance and successfully adopt radically new innovations.

#### 16.2c Challenges and Limitations of Marketing

While marketing plays a crucial role in the innovation process, it is not without its challenges and limitations. In this section, we will explore some of the key challenges and limitations of marketing in product development.

##### Lack of Consumer Insight

One of the biggest challenges in marketing is the lack of consumer insight. Marketers often rely on market research and data analysis to understand consumer preferences and behaviors. However, these methods can only provide a limited understanding of consumers, as they cannot capture the complex and often irrational factors that influence consumer decision-making. This lack of consumer insight can lead to marketing strategies that are not aligned with consumer needs and preferences, resulting in failed product launches.

##### Difficulty in Predicting Market Trends

Another challenge in marketing is the difficulty in predicting market trends. Marketers often rely on past data and trends to forecast future consumer behavior. However, the market is constantly evolving, and consumer preferences and behaviors can change rapidly. This makes it challenging for marketers to accurately predict market trends and consumer reactions to new products. As a result, many marketing strategies can be off-target, leading to suboptimal product launches.

##### Resistance to Change

Marketers also face the challenge of overcoming consumer resistance to change. Consumers are often resistant to trying new products, especially if they are already satisfied with their current products. This can make it difficult for marketers to convince consumers to switch to a new product, even if it offers significant benefits. This resistance to change can hinder the success of innovative products, as consumers may be slow to adopt them.

##### Ethical Concerns

Finally, marketing also faces ethical concerns, particularly in the area of green marketing. As consumers become more environmentally conscious, they are demanding products that are environmentally friendly. This has led to an increase in green marketing, where companies promote their products as environmentally friendly. However, there have been instances where companies have been accused of greenwashing, where they exaggerate or misrepresent the environmental benefits of their products. This can lead to ethical concerns and damage a company's reputation.

In conclusion, while marketing plays a crucial role in the innovation process, it also faces several challenges and limitations. Marketers must be aware of these challenges and work to overcome them to ensure the success of their marketing strategies and product launches.

#### 17.1a Introduction to Design

Design is the process of creating a plan or concept for a product, system, or service. It involves understanding the needs and desires of the target market, as well as the technical and practical constraints of the product. Design is not just about making a product look good; it is about creating a product that is user-friendly, efficient, and meets the needs and desires of the target market.

Design is a multidisciplinary field that combines elements of art, science, and engineering. It requires a deep understanding of the target market, as well as the ability to translate their needs and desires into a tangible product. Designers must also consider the technical and practical constraints of the product, such as cost, materials, and manufacturing processes.

There are various types of design, including product design, user interface design, and user experience design. Product design involves creating the physical product, while user interface design focuses on the visual and interactive elements of the product. User experience design, on the other hand, focuses on the overall experience of using the product.

Design plays a crucial role in the product development process. It is involved in every stage, from the initial concept to the final product. Designers work closely with other teams, such as engineering and marketing, to ensure that the product meets the needs and desires of the target market.

Innovation is another important aspect of design. Designers are often tasked with creating breakthrough products and services that stand out in a competitive market. This requires a deep understanding of the target market and the ability to think outside the box. Designers must also be able to translate their ideas into a tangible product that meets the needs and desires of the target market.

The principles of design, such as user-centered design, design thinking, and design for sustainability, play a crucial role in the design process. User-centered design focuses on creating products that meet the needs and desires of the target market. Design thinking is a problem-solving approach that involves understanding the problem, brainstorming solutions, and testing and refining them. Design for sustainability involves creating products that are environmentally friendly and have a positive impact on society.

Designers use various tools and techniques to bring their ideas to life. These include prototyping, user testing, and design sprints.

##### Design and the Function-Behaviour-Structure Ontology

The Function-Behaviour-Structure (FBS) ontology is a useful framework for understanding the role of design in innovation. The FBS ontology conceptualizes design objects in three ontological categories: function (F), behaviour (B), and structure (S). These categories are interconnected, with function connected to behaviour, and behaviour connected to structure. There is no connection between function and structure.

The FBS ontology is the basis for two frameworks of designing: the FBS framework and its extension, the situated FBS framework. These frameworks represent the process of designing as transformations between function, behaviour, and structure, and subclasses thereof.

##### The Function-Behaviour-Structure Framework

The original version of the FBS framework was published by John S. Gero in 1990. It applies the FBS ontology to the process of designing, by further articulating the three ontological categories. In this articulation, behaviour (B) is specialised into "expected behaviour" (Be) (the "desired" behaviour) and "behaviour derived from structure" (Bs) (the "actual" behaviour). In addition, two further notions are introduced on top of the existing ontological categories: "requirements" (R) that represent intentions from the client that come from outside the designer, and "description" (D) that represents a depiction of the design created by the designer.

Based on these articulations, the FBS framework provides a structured approach to designing, with each category representing a different aspect of the design process. Function represents the purpose or goal of the design, behaviour represents the expected performance of the design, and structure represents the physical form of the design. By focusing on these three aspects, designers can create products that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional and efficient.

##### The Situated FBS Framework

The situated FBS framework is an extension of the FBS framework that takes into account the context in which the design is created and used. It recognizes that the design process is not isolated but is influenced by various factors, including the needs and preferences of the users, the constraints of the manufacturing process, and the competitive environment.

The situated FBS framework provides a more comprehensive understanding of the design process, as it considers not only the design itself but also its context. This allows designers to create products that are not only innovative but also relevant and useful to the target market.

In conclusion, design plays a crucial role in innovation, as it is the process of creating something new and different that offers a solution to a problem or meets a need. The FBS and situated FBS frameworks provide a structured approach to designing, with each framework representing a different aspect of the design process. By understanding and applying these frameworks, designers can create breakthrough products and services that set them apart from their competitors.
