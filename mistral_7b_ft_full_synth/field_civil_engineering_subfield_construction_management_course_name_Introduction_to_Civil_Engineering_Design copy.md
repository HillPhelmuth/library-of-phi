##### Nominal Group Technique

The nominal group technique is a structured brainstorming method that involves individual idea generation, group discussion, and final ranking of ideas. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with complex problems that require a deep understanding of the issue at hand.

In the nominal group technique, participants are asked to write their ideas anonymously. The facilitator then collects these ideas and the group votes on each idea. This process, known as distillation, allows the group to focus on the most promising ideas. The top-ranked ideas are then sent back to the group or to subgroups for further brainstorming. This process continues until the group is satisfied with the ideas.

The nominal group technique is particularly effective when dealing with complex problems that require a deep understanding of the issue at hand. It allows for a structured and systematic approach to brainstorming, ensuring that all ideas are given equal consideration. However, it can be time-consuming and may not be suitable for all types of problems.

##### Group Passing Technique

The group passing technique is a more informal brainstorming method that involves passing a piece of paper around a group, with each person adding their ideas as the paper is passed. This technique is particularly useful when generating a large number of ideas in a short amount of time.

In the group passing technique, each person in a circular group writes down one idea, and then passes the piece of paper to the next person. This process continues until everybody gets their original piece of paper back. By this time, it is likely that the group will have extensively elaborated on each idea.

The group passing technique is particularly effective when generating a large number of ideas in a short amount of time. It allows for a more free-flowing and creative approach to brainstorming, but it may not be suitable for all types of problems.

In the next section, we will discuss how to conceptualize these ideas and turn them into a comprehensive design project.

### Environmental review process

#### Initial alternatives analysis

During the alternatives analysis, many alternatives were considered. These included different alignments and several modes of transit (heavy rail, light rail, bus rapid transit and monorail). Most alignments were variations/combinations of two primary alignments: the "Wilshire alignment" and the "West Hollywood alignment."

Other alignments studied involved various deviations from Wilshire Boulevard to allow service to destinations such as Beverly Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and Farmers Market.

The alternatives analysis recommended further study on four alternatives: "No Build," TSM (Transportation Systems Management), the Wilshire Alternative, and a combination Wilshire/West Hollywood Alternative. Both build alternatives use heavy rail (HRT) as their transit mode, primarily because this would allow interconnection to the existing Metro Rail subway system. All proposed alignments involving other transit modes (monorail, LRT, and BRT) were eliminated.

#### DEIR alternatives

The five alternatives considered in the Draft Environmental Impact Report are:

Alternatives 3 and 5 are the build alternatives carried over from the alternatives analysis (AA). In addition, three new alternatives (Alternatives 1, 2, and 4) were added. These new alternatives are variations of the two AA-recommended alternatives which all stop short of Santa Monica. They were added to reflect the realities of limited available funds and the priorities in Metro's Long Range Transportation Plan (LRTP).

The following table shows all potential metro stations and the alternatives for which they apply:

In addition to the five build alternatives, the DEIR identified six sets of options:

##### 9.4c.1 Dam Construction Process

The construction of a dam typically follows a systematic process. The first step is to prepare the site for construction. This involves clearing the area, removing any existing structures, and preparing the ground for the dam's foundation.

The next step is to construct the dam's foundation. This involves building the foundation stratum, which is typically composed of a layer of compacted soil or rock. The foundation is designed to support the weight of the dam and the water.

Once the foundation is complete, the dam structure is built. This involves constructing the dam's body, which is typically composed of a layer of concrete or masonry. The dam's body is designed to withstand the forces exerted by the water and the dam structure.

The final step is to complete the dam. This involves installing any remaining components, such as the spillway or the powerhouse, and testing the dam's functionality.

##### 9.4c.2 Dam Construction Challenges

The construction of dams presents several challenges. These include the need for precise construction, the need for high-quality materials, and the need to work in challenging conditions.

Precise construction is critical in dam construction. Any errors or variations in the construction can significantly affect the dam's performance and stability. Therefore, great care must be taken during the construction process to ensure that the dam is built according to the design specifications.

High-quality materials are also critical in dam construction. The dam must be able to withstand the forces exerted by the water and the dam structure, and this requires materials that are strong, durable, and resistant to corrosion. Therefore, great care must be taken during the material selection process to ensure that the right materials are used.

Finally, dam construction often takes place in challenging conditions. This can include working in remote locations, working in difficult terrain, and working in harsh weather conditions. Therefore, the construction team must be equipped with the necessary skills and equipment to work effectively in these conditions.

##### 9.4c.3 Dam Construction Techniques

There are several techniques used in dam construction. These include the use of concrete, masonry, and earth embankments.

Concrete dams are typically constructed using a technique known as the "upstream method". In this method, the dam is built upstream of the reservoir, and the reservoir is filled as the dam is built. This allows for the dam to be built in sections, with each section being completed before the next section is started.

Masonry dams are typically constructed using a technique known as the "downstream method". In this method, the dam is built downstream of the reservoir, and the reservoir is filled after the dam is completed. This allows for the dam to be built in one continuous operation, with the reservoir being filled as the dam is built.

Earth embankment dams are typically constructed using a technique known as the "hydraulic sluicing method". This method involves using high-pressure streams of water to move soil and other materials, which are then used to build the dam. This method was first used in the construction of the Croton Dam in Michigan in 1907, and it has since been used in several other dam projects.

##### 9.4c.4 Dam Construction Safety

Safety is a critical aspect of dam construction. The construction of dams involves working in hazardous conditions, and it is essential to ensure that all necessary safety measures are in place.

## Fundamental principles

A few examples of the fundamental principles of hydraulic engineering include fluid mechanics, fluid flow, behavior of real fluids, hydrology, pipelines, open channel hydraulics, mechanics of sediment transport, physical modeling, hydraulic machines, and drainage hydraulics.

### Fluid mechanics

"Fundamentals of Hydraulic Engineering" defines hydrostatics as the study of fluids at rest. In a fluid at rest, there exists a force, known as pressure, that acts upon the fluid's surroundings. This pressure, measured in N/m<sup>2</sup>, is not constant throughout the body of fluid. Pressure, p, in a given body of fluid, increases with an increase in depth. Where the upward force on a body acts on the base and can be found by the equation:

where, 

Rearranging this equation gives you the pressure head <math>\frac{p}{\rho g}=y</math>. Four basic devices for pressure measurement are a piezometer, manometer, differential manometer, Bourdon gauge, as well as an inclined manometer.

As Prasuhn states:

### Behavior of real fluids

#### Real and Ideal fluids

The main difference between an ideal fluid and a real fluid is that for ideal flow "p"<sub>1</sub> = "p"<sub>2</sub> and for real flow "p"<sub>1</sub> > "p"<sub>2</sub>. Ideal fluid is incompressible and has no viscosity. Real fluid has viscosity. Ideal fluid is only an imaginary fluid as all fluids that exist have some viscosity.

#### Viscous flow

A viscous fluid will deform continuously under a shear force by the pascles law, whereas an ideal fluid does not deform.

#### Laminar flow and turbulence

The various effects of disturbance on a viscive flow are a stable, transition and unstable.

#### Bernoulli's equation

For an ideal fluid, Bernoulli's equation holds along streamlines.

As the flow comes into contact with the plate, the layer of fluid actually "adheres" to a solid surface. There is then a considerable shearing action between the layer of fluid on the plate and the fluid above it. This shearing action is responsible for the formation of a boundary layer, a thin layer of fluid that forms on the surface of the plate. The boundary layer is important in the study of fluid flow, as it affects the overall flow characteristics of the fluid.

The thickness of the boundary layer is dependent on the Reynolds number, a dimensionless quantity that describes the flow regime of a fluid. The Reynolds number is defined as:

$$
Re = \frac{\rho u L}{\mu}
$$

where $\rho$ is the fluid density, $u$ is the fluid velocity, $L$ is the characteristic length (typically the hydraulic diameter for pipes), and $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.

For laminar flow, the Reynolds number is typically less than 2000. In this regime, the flow is smooth and orderly, with no turbulence. The boundary layer is thin and the flow is dominated by viscous forces. As the Reynolds number increases, the flow becomes more turbulent, with chaotic and unpredictable motion. The boundary layer thickens and the flow is dominated by inertial forces.

The understanding of boundary layer formation and its effects on fluid flow is crucial in the design and analysis of hydraulic structures. The boundary layer can significantly affect the flow characteristics of a fluid, and therefore must be carefully considered in the design process.

The pressure head, <math>\frac{p}{\rho g}=y</math>, is a key concept in fluid mechanics. It represents the height of a fluid column that exerts the same pressure as the fluid at a given point. This concept is used in the design of hydraulic structures, such as dams and spillways, to determine the pressure exerted by the fluid.

#### Behavior of Real Fluids

The main difference between an ideal fluid and a real fluid is that for ideal flow "p"<sub>1</sub> = "p"<sub>2</sub> and for real flow "p"<sub>1</sub> > "p"<sub>2</sub>.

## Chapter 12: Civil Engineering Hydraulics:




### Subsection: 11.2b Principles of Fluid Mechanics

Fluid mechanics is a fundamental branch of physics that deals with the study of fluids, both at rest and in motion. It is a crucial aspect of civil engineering design, as it is used to analyze and design various hydraulic systems such as dams, spillways, and pipelines. In this section, we will delve deeper into the principles of fluid mechanics, focusing on the concepts of fluid statics and dynamics.

#### Fluid Statics

Fluid statics is the study of fluids at rest. It is based on the principle of hydrostatic equilibrium, which states that the pressure at any point in a fluid at rest is the same in all directions. This principle is used to analyze the forces acting on a fluid element, and it is fundamental to the design of dams and other hydraulic structures.

The principle of hydrostatic equilibrium can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial p}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial p}{\partial z} = 0
$$

where $p$ is the pressure, and $x$, $y$, and $z$ are the coordinates of the fluid element.

#### Fluid Dynamics

Fluid dynamics is the study of fluids in motion. It is concerned with the forces acting on a fluid element, and how these forces affect the motion of the fluid. The fundamental equation of fluid dynamics is the Navier-Stokes equation, which describes the motion of viscous fluids.

The Navier-Stokes equation can be written as:

$$
\rho \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v} \right) = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \rho \mathbf{g}
$$

where $\rho$ is the density, $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity, $p$ is the pressure, $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, $\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration, and $\nabla$ is the gradient operator.

The Navier-Stokes equation is a vector equation, and it can be decomposed into three scalar equations, one for each direction. This allows us to analyze the motion of the fluid in three dimensions.

#### Bernoulli's Equation

Bernoulli's equation is a fundamental principle in fluid dynamics that describes the conservation of energy in a fluid flow. It is based on the principle of virtual work, which states that the work done by the fluid forces on a fluid element is equal to the change in the fluid element's potential energy.

Bernoulli's equation can be written as:

$$
\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + p + \rho gh = constant
$$

where $v$ is the velocity, $p$ is the pressure, $h$ is the height, and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration.

Bernoulli's equation is a powerful tool in the analysis of fluid flows, and it is used extensively in civil engineering design. However, it is important to note that it is an idealization, and it assumes that the fluid is inviscid and incompressible. In reality, most fluids are viscous and compressible, and the actual fluid flow may deviate significantly from the predictions of Bernoulli's equation.

#### Applications of Fluid Mechanics in Civil Engineering

The principles of fluid mechanics are used in a wide range of applications in civil engineering. They are used to analyze the flow of water in rivers, the flow of air around buildings, the flow of oil in pipelines, and many other phenomena. In the following sections, we will explore some of these applications in more detail.

#### Hydraulic Systems

Hydraulic systems are an integral part of many civil engineering projects, including dams, spillways, and pipelines. The principles of fluid mechanics are used to design these systems, ensuring that they operate efficiently and safely.

For example, the principle of hydrostatic equilibrium is used to analyze the forces acting on a dam. By applying this principle, engineers can determine the maximum pressure that the dam can withstand, and design the dam structure accordingly.

Similarly, the principles of fluid dynamics are used to design spillways and pipelines. The Navier-Stokes equation, in particular, is used to analyze the motion of the fluid in these systems, and to ensure that the fluid flow is smooth and efficient.

#### Fluid Flow Analysis

Fluid flow analysis is another important application of fluid mechanics in civil engineering. This involves the study of fluid flow in various scenarios, such as in rivers, canals, and sewage systems.

For instance, the principles of fluid dynamics are used to analyze the flow of water in rivers. By applying the Navier-Stokes equation, engineers can predict the velocity and direction of the water flow, and design structures such as bridges and dams that can withstand these forces.

Similarly, fluid flow analysis is used to design sewage systems. By studying the flow of sewage, engineers can determine the optimal size and layout of the sewage pipes, and ensure that the sewage is transported efficiently and safely.

#### Computational Fluid Dynamics

In recent years, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become an increasingly important tool in the field of fluid mechanics. CFD involves the use of computer simulations to analyze fluid flow, and it has been used in a variety of civil engineering applications.

For example, CFD has been used to study the flow of water in the Powell Butte Reservoir, and to design emergency overflows that can handle high flow rates. Similarly, CFD has been used to design the high pressure die casting of thin-walled aluminum components, by optimizing the flow and thermal control methods.

In conclusion, fluid mechanics plays a crucial role in civil engineering design. By understanding the principles of fluid mechanics, engineers can design hydraulic systems, analyze fluid flow, and use computational tools to solve complex engineering problems.

### Subsection: 11.3a Introduction to Hydrology

Hydrology is the study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water throughout the Earth. It is a multidisciplinary field that combines aspects of geography, geology, meteorology, and ecology. Hydrologists study the hydrological cycle, which is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth.

#### The Hydrological Cycle

The hydrological cycle is a fundamental concept in hydrology. It describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. The cycle begins with evaporation, where water is heated by the sun and changes from a liquid to a gas. This water vapor rises into the atmosphere and is transported by winds. When the vapor cools and condenses, it forms clouds. When these clouds release the water through precipitation, it falls back to the Earth as rain, snow, or sleet. Some of this water soaks into the ground and becomes part of the groundwater supply. The rest flows over the land and into rivers, lakes, and oceans. This water then evaporates again and the cycle begins anew.

#### Hydrological Processes

Hydrological processes are the mechanisms by which water moves through the hydrological cycle. These processes include evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, percolation, and runoff. Each of these processes plays a crucial role in the distribution and availability of water on Earth.

#### Hydrological Systems

Hydrological systems are the physical systems through which water moves. These systems include rivers, lakes, wetlands, and groundwater systems. Each of these systems has its own unique characteristics and plays a crucial role in the overall hydrological cycle.

#### Hydrological Models

Hydrological models are mathematical representations of the hydrological cycle. These models are used to simulate the movement and distribution of water on Earth. They are essential tools for hydrologists, allowing them to predict the effects of climate change, land use changes, and other factors on the availability and quality of water.

#### Hydrological Data

Hydrological data is the information collected about the movement and distribution of water on Earth. This data includes information about precipitation, evaporation, river flow, lake levels, and groundwater levels. It is collected through a variety of methods, including weather stations, river gauges, and groundwater monitoring wells.

#### Hydrological Hazards

Hydrological hazards are natural disasters that are related to water. These include floods, droughts, and landslides. Hydrologists study these hazards to understand their causes and effects, and to develop strategies for mitigating their impacts.

#### Hydrological Engineering

Hydrological engineering is the application of hydrological knowledge to solve practical problems. This includes the design and construction of hydraulic structures, such as dams, spillways, and canals, as well as the management of water resources.

#### Hydrological Research

Hydrological research is the scientific investigation of hydrological processes and systems. This research is essential for advancing our understanding of the hydrological cycle and for developing new methods and technologies for managing water resources.




### Subsection: 11.3b Principles of Hydrology

Hydrology is governed by a set of principles that describe the behavior of water in the environment. These principles are based on fundamental laws of physics and chemistry, and they provide a framework for understanding and predicting the movement and distribution of water on Earth.

#### The Law of Conservation of Mass

The Law of Conservation of Mass is a fundamental principle in hydrology. It states that the total mass of water entering a system must equal the total mass of water leaving the system. This principle is expressed mathematically as:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i = 0
$$

where $m_i$ is the mass of water entering or leaving the system at point $i$.

#### The Law of Conservation of Energy

The Law of Conservation of Energy is another fundamental principle in hydrology. It states that the total energy of a system remains constant unless it is added or removed by external forces. This principle is expressed mathematically as:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} E_i = 0
$$

where $E_i$ is the energy of water entering or leaving the system at point $i$.

#### The Law of Superposition

The Law of Superposition is a principle that describes the behavior of water in a system with multiple inputs and outputs. It states that the total response of the system is equal to the sum of the individual responses caused by each input. This principle is expressed mathematically as:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} R_i = R
$$

where $R_i$ is the response of the system to input $i$ and $R$ is the total response of the system.

#### The Law of Continuity

The Law of Continuity is a principle that describes the behavior of water in a system with a single input and output. It states that the rate of water entering the system must equal the rate of water leaving the system. This principle is expressed mathematically as:

$$
Q_{in} = Q_{out}
$$

where $Q_{in}$ is the rate of water entering the system and $Q_{out}$ is the rate of water leaving the system.

#### The Law of Gravity

The Law of Gravity is a principle that describes the behavior of water in a system with a vertical component. It states that the potential energy of water is equal to the product of its mass, acceleration due to gravity, and height. This principle is expressed mathematically as:

$$
E = mgh
$$

where $E$ is the potential energy, $m$ is the mass of water, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the height of the water.

These principles form the foundation of hydrological analysis and design. By understanding and applying these principles, engineers can predict the behavior of water systems and design effective solutions to water-related problems.




### Subsection: 11.3c Applications of Hydrology

Hydrology, as a branch of civil engineering, has a wide range of applications. These applications are not only limited to the design and construction of hydraulic structures but also extend to the management and conservation of water resources. 

#### Hydraulic Structures

Hydrology plays a crucial role in the design and construction of hydraulic structures such as dams, spillways, and culverts. The principles of hydrology are used to analyze the flow of water in these structures and to ensure their safety and efficiency. For instance, the Law of Conservation of Mass is used to ensure that the mass of water entering a dam equals the mass of water leaving it. Similarly, the Law of Conservation of Energy is used to ensure that the energy of water entering a spillway equals the energy of water leaving it.

#### Water Resource Management

Hydrology is also essential in the management and conservation of water resources. It is used to analyze the availability and distribution of water resources, to predict the impact of climate change on these resources, and to design strategies for their sustainable use. For example, the Law of Superposition is used to analyze the impact of multiple water sources on a river system. The Law of Continuity is used to analyze the impact of a single water source on a river system.

#### Flood Forecasting and Control

Hydrology plays a crucial role in flood forecasting and control. It is used to analyze the flow of water in rivers and to predict the impact of rainfall and other factors on this flow. This information is used to issue flood warnings and to design strategies for flood control. For instance, the Law of Conservation of Mass is used to predict the increase in the volume of water in a river due to rainfall. The Law of Conservation of Energy is used to predict the increase in the energy of water in a river due to rainfall.

#### Environmental Impact Assessment

Hydrology is also used in environmental impact assessments. It is used to analyze the impact of proposed developments on water resources and to design strategies for mitigating these impacts. For example, the Law of Superposition is used to analyze the impact of a proposed development on the flow of water in a river system. The Law of Continuity is used to analyze the impact of a proposed development on the rate of water entering a river system.

This field is crucial for the health and well-being of populations, as well as for economic development and social equity.

#### Water Supply Systems

Water supply systems are complex networks of infrastructure that deliver water from a source to consumers. These systems typically include a source of water (such as a reservoir, lake, or groundwater well), a treatment plant to remove impurities, a distribution system to deliver the water to consumers, and a network of pipes, pumps, and valves to control the flow of water.

The design of a water supply system involves a careful consideration of the source of water, the treatment process, the distribution system, and the end-use of the water. For instance, the source of water may be a surface water body (such as a river or lake) or a groundwater source (such as an aquifer). The treatment process may involve physical, chemical, or biological methods to remove impurities. The distribution system may be a network of pipes, or a gravity-fed system. The end-use of the water may be for drinking, irrigation, or industrial use.

#### Water Supply Engineering Challenges

Water supply engineering faces a number of challenges. These include the need to ensure the safety and reliability of the water supply, the need to manage water resources sustainably, and the need to address the impacts of climate change on water resources.

### Subsection: 11.4b Water Supply System Components

Water supply systems are complex networks that involve a series of components working together to deliver clean, safe, and reliable water to consumers. These components can be broadly categorized into three main groups: source, treatment, and distribution.

#### Source

The source of water is the first component of a water supply system. This could be a surface water body such as a river or lake, or a groundwater source such as an aquifer. The choice of source depends on a variety of factors, including the availability of water, the quality of the water, and the cost of extraction and treatment.

Surface water sources are typically more accessible and easier to extract, but they are also more vulnerable to pollution and seasonal variations in water availability. Groundwater sources, on the other hand, are more reliable and less vulnerable to pollution, but they are also more difficult and expensive to extract.

#### Treatment

The treatment component of a water supply system is responsible for removing impurities from the water. This typically involves a series of physical, chemical, and biological processes.

Physical processes include sedimentation, where heavy particles settle to the bottom of a tank, and filtration, where water passes through a porous medium to remove smaller particles. Chemical processes include coagulation, where chemicals are added to the water to clump together and settle out, and disinfection, where chemicals or ultraviolet light are used to kill or inactivate microorganisms. Biological processes include activated sludge, where microorganisms are used to break down organic matter.

#### Distribution

The distribution component of a water supply system is responsible for delivering the treated water to consumers. This typically involves a network of pipes, pumps, and valves.

Pipes are used to transport the water from the treatment plant to the consumers. Pumps are used to overcome pressure losses in the system and to deliver the water to higher elevations. Valves are used to control the flow of water and to isolate sections of the system for maintenance or repair.

The design of a water supply system involves careful consideration of these components, as well as the interactions between them. For example, the choice of source can affect the treatment process, and the design of the distribution system can affect the reliability and efficiency of the system.

In the next section, we will discuss the principles and techniques used in the design of water supply systems.

## Research

Early research (Bathurst and Jarrett, 1988) found that cellular confinement reinforced gravel bases are "equivalent to about twice the thickness of unreinforced gravel bases" and that geocells performed better than single sheet reinforcement schemes (geotextiles and geogrids) and were more effective in reducing lateral spreading of infill under loading than conventional reinforced bases. However, Richardson (2004) (who was onsite at the US Corps of Engineers CCS Vicksburg facility) laments 25 years later on the "near absence of research papers on geocells in all of the geosynthetic national and international conferences."

A comprehensive review of available research literature by Yuu, et al in 2008 concluded that the use of CCS technology in base reinforcement of paved roads, and railways in particular, was limited, due to the lack of design methods, lack of advanced research in the previous two decades and limited understanding of the reinforcement mechanisms. Since then, hundreds of research papers on geocell systems have been published. Extensive research has been conducted on CCS reinforcement for roadway applications to understand the mechanisms and influencing factors of confinement reinforcement, evaluate its effectiveness in improving roadway performance and develop design methods for roadway applications (Han, et al. 2011).
Hedge (2017,) and Hedge, et al (2020) present comprehensive surveys and reviews of latest geocell studies, field testing, state of the art knowledge and present trends and scope of future research directions, validating increased use of geocells in ground reinforcement and infrastructure projects. Han (2013) summarizes comprehensive research conducted at the University of Kansas, including static and cyclic plate loading tests, full-scale moving wheel tests, and numerical modeling on geocell-reinforced base courses with different geocell types and configurations.

### Subsection: 12.2a Introduction to Soil Mechanics

Soil mechanics is a branch of geotechnical engineering that deals with the behavior of soil and its interaction with structures. It is a crucial aspect of civil engineering design, as it provides the foundation for understanding the behavior of soil and its interaction with structures. In this section, we will introduce the fundamental concepts of soil mechanics, including soil properties, soil classification, and soil behavior under different loading conditions.

#### Soil Properties

Soil is a complex mixture of mineral particles, organic matter, air, and water. The properties of soil can vary significantly depending on its composition, structure, and the environmental conditions it experiences. The most important properties of soil for civil engineering design include:

- Soil strength: This refers to the ability of soil to resist deformation or failure under applied loads. It is typically measured by the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) or the direct shear strength.
- Soil permeability: This is a measure of the ability of soil to transmit water. It is typically measured by the coefficient of permeability (k) or the hydraulic conductivity (K).
- Soil density: This is a measure of the mass of soil per unit volume. It is typically expressed as a percentage of the theoretical density (TD) or the maximum theoretical density (MTD).
- Soil moisture content: This is the amount of water present in the soil. It is typically expressed as a percentage of the dry soil weight.
- Soil pH: This is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of the soil. It is typically measured on a scale of 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral.

#### Soil Classification

Soil classification is the process of grouping soils based on their properties. This is important in civil engineering design as it allows engineers to predict the behavior of soil under different loading conditions. The most commonly used soil classification systems include the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) and the AASHTO Soil Classification System.

The USCS classifies soils based on their plasticity and strength. It has four main categories: gravel, sand, silt, and clay. Each category is further divided into subcategories based on the size distribution of the particles.

The AASHTO Soil Classification System is used for highway and airport construction. It classifies soils based on their plasticity, strength, and permeability. It has three main categories: coarse-grained soils, fine-grained soils, and organic soils.

#### Soil Behavior under Different Loading Conditions

Soil behavior under different loading conditions is a critical aspect of soil mechanics. The behavior of soil can be described using various models, such as the critical state soil mechanics model and the plane stress model.

The critical state soil mechanics model is used to describe the behavior of soil under drained conditions. It separates the stress matrix into distortional and volumetric parts, which represent the shear and volumetric strains, respectively. This model is useful for predicting the behavior of soil under different loading conditions, including plane strain and drained states of stress.

The plane stress model is used to describe the behavior of soil under plane stress conditions. It is particularly useful for predicting the behavior of soil under bending and torsional loading conditions. The model can be represented by the following equation:

$$
\sigma=\left[\begin{matrix}\sigma_{xx}&\tau_{xz}\\\tau_{zx}&\sigma_{zz}\\\end{matrix}\right]=\left[\begin{matrix}\sigma_{xx}-\sigma_{hydrostatic}&\tau_{xz}\\\tau_{zx}&\sigma_{zz}-\sigma_{hydrostatic}\\\end{matrix}\right]+\left[\begin{matrix}\sigma_{hydrostatic}&0\\0&\sigma_{hydrostatic}\\\end{matrix}\right]
$$

where $\sigma_{xx}$ and $\sigma_{zz}$ are the normal stresses in the x and z directions, respectively, and $\tau_{xz}$ and $\tau_{zx}$ are the shear stresses in the x and z directions, respectively. $\sigma_{hydrostatic}$ is the hydrostatic stress, which is equal to the average of the normal stresses in the x and z directions.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the behavior of soil under different loading conditions, including drained and undrained conditions, and the effects of external forces such as gravity and seismic forces.




#### 12.2b Principles of Soil Mechanics

Soil mechanics is based on several fundamental principles that govern the behavior of soil under different loading conditions. These principles include:

- Plane stress: This principle is used to describe the state of stress in soil. It is represented by a 2x2 matrix, with the normal stresses on the x and z axes and the shear stress on the xz plane.
- Drained conditions: This principle is used to describe the state of stress in soil under drained conditions, where the pore water pressure is assumed to be zero.
- Plane strain state of stress: This principle is used to describe the state of stress in soil under plane strain conditions, where the stress is uniform in the z direction.
- Separation of Plane Strain Stress State Matrix into Distortional and Volumetric Parts: This principle is used to separate the stress matrix into two parts: the distortional part, which causes deformation, and the volumetric part, which causes volume change.
- Critical state soil mechanics: This principle is used to describe the behavior of soil under critical state conditions, where the soil is at its maximum strength and minimum compressibility.

These principles are used to develop equations and models that can predict the behavior of soil under different loading conditions. They are essential tools for civil engineers in the design and analysis of structures.

#### 12.3a Introduction to Rock Mechanics

Rock mechanics is a specialized field within geotechnical engineering that deals with the study of rock as a material and its behavior under various loading conditions. It is a critical component of civil engineering design, particularly in the design of structures that interact with rock, such as tunnels, foundations, and retaining walls.

Rock is a complex material with unique properties that distinguish it from soil. Unlike soil, which is typically composed of granular particles, rock is composed of crystalline minerals that are bonded together. This gives rock a higher strength and stiffness than soil, but also makes it more brittle. The behavior of rock under different loading conditions is influenced by a variety of factors, including its mineral composition, structure, and the presence of fractures or joints.

The study of rock mechanics involves understanding these properties and behaviors, and applying this knowledge to the design and analysis of civil engineering structures. This includes determining the strength and stiffness of rock, predicting its deformation and failure under different loading conditions, and designing structures that can withstand these conditions.

In this section, we will explore the fundamental principles of rock mechanics, including the concepts of stress and strain, the properties of rock, and the methods used to analyze the behavior of rock under different loading conditions. We will also discuss the applications of rock mechanics in civil engineering design, including the design of tunnels, foundations, and retaining walls.

#### 12.3b Stress and Strain in Rock

The behavior of rock under different loading conditions is governed by the principles of stress and strain. Stress is a measure of the internal forces that develop within a rock due to external loads, while strain is a measure of the deformation that results from these forces.

The stress state in rock can be represented by a 3x3 stress matrix, similar to the stress matrix used in soil mechanics. However, due to the anisotropic nature of rock, the stress matrix in rock is typically non-symmetric. This means that the stress state in rock can be described by three principal stresses and three principal directions.

The strain state in rock can also be represented by a 3x3 strain matrix. However, due to the linear elastic behavior of rock, the strain matrix in rock is typically symmetric. This means that the strain state in rock can be described by three principal strains and three principal directions.

The relationship between stress and strain in rock is governed by Hooke's Law, which states that the strain in rock is directly proportional to the stress, provided the stress is within the elastic limit of the rock. This relationship can be represented by the following equation:

$$
\epsilon = \frac{\sigma}{E}
$$

where $\epsilon$ is the strain, $\sigma$ is the stress, and $E$ is the elastic modulus of the rock.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these concepts and explore the methods used to analyze the behavior of rock under different loading conditions.

#### 12.3b Rock Mechanics in Civil Engineering

The understanding of rock mechanics is essential to ensure the safety and reliability of these structures.

One of the key aspects of rock mechanics in civil engineering is the determination of rock properties. These properties include the strength and stiffness of the rock, as well as its fracture toughness and deformation modulus. These properties are typically determined through laboratory testing of rock samples, which can provide valuable insights into the behavior of the rock under different loading conditions.

Another important aspect of rock mechanics in civil engineering is the analysis of rock behavior under different loading conditions. This includes the prediction of rock deformation and failure under various loading scenarios, such as compressive, tensile, and shear loading. This is typically done using analytical methods, such as the Mohr-Coulomb theory and the Hoek-Brown theory, as well as numerical methods, such as the finite element method.
