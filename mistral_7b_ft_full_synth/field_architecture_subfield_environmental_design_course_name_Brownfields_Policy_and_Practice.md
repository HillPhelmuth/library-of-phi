### Introduction

Brownfields are abandoned or underutilized properties that have been contaminated by hazardous substances, pollutants, or other contaminants. These properties are often located in urban areas and can pose significant health and environmental risks to nearby communities. The redevelopment of brownfields is a complex and multifaceted process that requires a comprehensive understanding of various policies and practices. This chapter aims to provide a solid foundation for understanding the basics of brownfields, including their definition, characteristics, and the challenges they pose.

The chapter will begin by defining brownfields and discussing their prevalence in urban areas. It will then delve into the characteristics of brownfields, including their history, location, and type of contamination. The chapter will also explore the various challenges associated with brownfields, such as legal and regulatory barriers, financial constraints, and community concerns.

Understanding brownfields basics is crucial for anyone involved in the field of urban redevelopment. It provides the necessary background knowledge for navigating the complexities of brownfield redevelopment and for making informed decisions. This chapter will serve as a guide for readers to gain a comprehensive understanding of brownfields and their redevelopment, setting the stage for the subsequent chapters that will delve deeper into the policies and practices involved. 





#### 2.1a Definition of Brownfields

Brownfields are abandoned or underutilized properties that have been contaminated by hazardous substances, pollutants, or other contaminants. These properties are often located in urban areas and can pose significant health and environmental risks to nearby communities. The redevelopment of brownfields is a complex and multifaceted process that requires a comprehensive understanding of various policies and practices. This chapter aims to provide a solid foundation for understanding the basics of brownfields, including their definition, characteristics, and the challenges they pose.

The Federal Government of Canada defines brownfields as "abandoned, idle or underutilized commercial or industrial properties [typically located in urban areas] where past actions have caused environmental contamination, but which still have potential for redevelopment or other economic opportunities." This definition highlights the potential for redevelopment and economic opportunities that brownfields possess, despite their current state of contamination.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines brownfields as properties that may have impediments such as the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. This definition aligns with the general definition of brownfields, which encompasses industrial or commercial properties that may require upgrading. The term "brownfields" first came into use in 1992, during a congressional field hearing hosted by the Northeast Midwest Congressional Coalition. This was followed by the first detailed policy analysis of the issue by the Cuyahoga County, Ohio Planning Commission in the same year. The EPA selected Cuyahoga County as its first brownfield pilot project in September 1993.

The term "brownfields" is often used interchangeably with other terms such as "contaminated sites," "abandoned sites," and "underutilized sites." However, it is important to note that brownfields are not limited to these categories and can also include properties that are currently in use but have the potential for contamination. This highlights the importance of understanding the definition and characteristics of brownfields in order to effectively address and redevelop them.

In 2002, President George W. Bush signed the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act (the "Brownfields Law"). This act provides grants and tools to local governments for the assessment, cleanup, and revitalization of brownfields. The motivation for this act was the success of the EPA's brownfields program, which it started in the 1990s in response to several court cases that caused lenders to redline contaminated property for fear of liability under the Superfund. As of September 2015, the EPA estimates that the Brownfields program has resulted in 56,442 acres of land readied for reuse.

"Mothballed brownfields" are properties that the owners are not willing to transfer or put to productive use. These properties are often abandoned or underutilized, and their redevelopment can be a challenge due to legal and financial barriers. However, with the right policies and practices in place, these brownfields can be revitalized and contribute to the economic and social well-being of urban communities.





#### 2.1b Urban Sprawl and Its Impact

Urban sprawl is a phenomenon that has been occurring in many cities around the world, including those in the United States. It refers to the uncontrolled expansion of urban areas, often into previously undeveloped land. This expansion is often driven by factors such as population growth, economic development, and changes in land use policies.

The impact of urban sprawl on brownfields is significant. As urban areas expand, they often encroach on areas that have been previously contaminated by industrial or commercial activities. This can lead to the reactivation of these contaminants, posing a threat to both human health and the environment. For example, the expansion of urban areas in the United States has led to the reactivation of contaminants such as heavy metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, and pesticides, which can have serious health effects if exposed to humans.

Moreover, urban sprawl can also lead to the loss of brownfields that could potentially be redeveloped. As urban areas expand, there is often pressure to develop new land, which can lead to the neglect and abandonment of brownfields. This not only wastes valuable land, but also perpetuates the environmental and health risks associated with these sites.

However, urban sprawl can also present opportunities for brownfield redevelopment. As urban areas expand, there is often a need for new infrastructure and services, which can create opportunities for the redevelopment of brownfields. For example, the expansion of urban areas in the United States has led to the development of new transportation systems, which can be built on redeveloped brownfields. This not only reduces the need for new land, but also helps to clean up and revitalize contaminated sites.

In conclusion, urban sprawl has a significant impact on brownfields. It can both pose threats and create opportunities for brownfield redevelopment. Understanding the dynamics of urban sprawl is therefore crucial for effective brownfield policy and practice.

#### 2.1c Brownfields and Urban Redevelopment

Brownfields, as we have seen, are abandoned or underutilized properties that have been contaminated by hazardous substances, pollutants, or other contaminants. These properties are often located in urban areas and can pose significant health and environmental risks to nearby communities. However, they also present opportunities for urban redevelopment.

Urban redevelopment is the process of revitalizing and improving urban areas. It can involve the redevelopment of brownfields, which can be a key component of urban redevelopment strategies. The redevelopment of brownfields can help to transform blighted areas into productive and vibrant spaces, contributing to the overall revitalization of urban areas.

The redevelopment of brownfields can also have significant economic benefits. By repurposing existing buildings and materials, it can be a cost-effective way to create new space. This can be particularly beneficial in urban areas where land is at a premium. Moreover, the redevelopment of brownfields can create jobs, both in the construction industry and in the businesses that occupy the redeveloped space.

However, the redevelopment of brownfields also presents significant challenges. The presence of contaminants can make these properties hazardous and expensive to clean up. Moreover, the legal and regulatory frameworks surrounding brownfields can be complex and confusing, making it difficult for developers to navigate the process of redevelopment.

Despite these challenges, the redevelopment of brownfields is a key component of many urban redevelopment strategies. It can help to address the environmental and health risks associated with these properties, while also contributing to the economic and social revitalization of urban areas.

In the next section, we will explore some of the key policies and practices that have been developed to facilitate the redevelopment of brownfields.

#### 2.2a Brownfield Redevelopment Strategies

Brownfield redevelopment strategies are crucial for transforming these abandoned or underutilized properties into productive spaces. These strategies can be broadly categorized into two types: adaptive reuse and adaptive building.

##### Adaptive Reuse

Adaptive reuse is a strategy that involves repurposing existing buildings for new uses. This strategy is often used for brownfields due to the presence of existing structures and the potential for cost savings. Adaptive reuse can be particularly beneficial in urban areas where land is at a premium. 

For instance, an abandoned industrial building could be converted into a residential or commercial space. This not only provides new housing or business opportunities, but also helps to preserve the architectural and cultural heritage of the area. 

##### Adaptive Building

Adaptive building, on the other hand, involves the construction of new buildings on brownfield sites. This strategy can be used when existing buildings are not suitable for reuse or when the cost of remediation is prohibitive. 

Adaptive building can be a cost-effective way to create new space. By repurposing existing materials and infrastructure, it can be a more sustainable option compared to traditional construction methods. Moreover, adaptive building can help to reduce urban sprawl by encouraging development on previously abandoned or underutilized sites.

However, both adaptive reuse and adaptive building strategies present their own set of challenges. The presence of contaminants can make these properties hazardous and expensive to clean up. Moreover, the legal and regulatory frameworks surrounding brownfields can be complex and confusing, making it difficult for developers to navigate the process of redevelopment.

In the next section, we will explore some of the key policies and practices that have been developed to facilitate the redevelopment of brownfields.

#### 2.2b Case Studies in Brownfield Redevelopment

In this section, we will explore some case studies that illustrate the application of brownfield redevelopment strategies in real-world scenarios. These case studies will provide practical examples of how adaptive reuse and adaptive building strategies can be implemented, and the challenges and benefits that can arise from these strategies.

##### Case Study 1: The High Line, New York City

The High Line is a 1.45-mile-long elevated linear park built on a former freight rail line in New York City. The abandoned railway was transformed into a public park, a project that exemplifies adaptive reuse. The High Line project not only preserved a piece of the city's history, but also created a unique public space that has become a popular tourist attraction.

The High Line project faced significant challenges, including the need for extensive environmental remediation and the integration of the park into the surrounding urban fabric. However, the project has been widely praised for its innovative design and its contribution to the revitalization of the surrounding neighborhood.

##### Case Study 2: The Olympic Park, London

The Olympic Park in London, built for the 2012 Olympic Games, is another example of adaptive building. The park was constructed on a brownfield site that had been previously used for industrial purposes. The site was extensively remediated, and the existing infrastructure was repurposed to create the park.

The Olympic Park project faced significant challenges, including the need for a rapid construction schedule and the integration of the park into the surrounding urban fabric. However, the project was completed on time and on budget, and the park has been widely praised for its design and its contribution to the revitalization of the surrounding neighborhood.

These case studies illustrate the potential of brownfield redevelopment strategies. They show that with careful planning and implementation, brownfields can be transformed into valuable assets that contribute to the economic, social, and environmental vitality of urban areas.

#### 2.2c Financing Brownfield Redevelopment

Financing brownfield redevelopment is a critical aspect of the process. It involves securing the necessary funds to cover the costs of environmental remediation, construction, and other expenses associated with the redevelopment project. This section will explore various financing options available for brownfield redevelopment, including public funding, private funding, and public-private partnerships.

##### Public Funding

Public funding for brownfield redevelopment can come from various sources, including federal, state, and local governments. In the United States, for example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides grants and loans for brownfield assessment, cleanup, and redevelopment. These funds are often administered through state and local agencies, which can provide additional resources and support.

Public funding can also come in the form of tax incentives. For instance, the federal Brownfields Tax Incentive allows developers to deduct the costs of environmental cleanup from their taxes. This incentive can significantly reduce the financial burden of brownfield redevelopment and make these projects more financially feasible.

##### Private Funding

Private funding for brownfield redevelopment can come from various sources, including developers, investors, and financial institutions. These entities can provide the necessary capital for brownfield redevelopment projects, often in exchange for a share of the project's profits.

Private funding can also come in the form of tax credits. For instance, the federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentive provides tax credits for the rehabilitation of historic buildings, which can include brownfields. This incentive can help to offset the costs of brownfield redevelopment and make these projects more financially viable.

##### Public-Private Partnerships

Public-private partnerships (PPPs) can be an effective way to finance brownfield redevelopment. In a PPP, a public sector authority and a private party enter into a contract for a period of time, during which the private party provides a public service or project and assumes substantial financial, technical, and operational risk in the project.

PPPs can provide a range of benefits for brownfield redevelopment, including access to private capital, risk management, and project management expertise. However, they also involve significant transaction costs and can be complex to implement.

In conclusion, financing brownfield redevelopment is a complex process that requires careful planning and negotiation. It involves securing the necessary funds from a variety of sources, often through a combination of public and private funding. Public-private partnerships can be an effective way to manage this process, but they also require careful management and oversight.




#### 2.1c Brownfields vs. Greenfields

Brownfields and greenfields are two distinct types of land that have significant implications for urban redevelopment. Understanding the differences between these two types of land is crucial for effective urban planning and policy-making.

Brownfields are abandoned or underused industrial and commercial facilities available for re-use. They are often located in urban areas and have been previously contaminated by hazardous substances, pollutants, or other contaminants. The contamination of brownfields can pose significant environmental and health risks, making them a major challenge for urban redevelopment. However, brownfields also present opportunities for redevelopment and revitalization, as they are often located in areas with high potential for economic development.

Greenfields, on the other hand, are undeveloped land in urban or rural areas that are not currently being used for any purpose. They are often located on the outskirts of urban areas and are not contaminated. Greenfields offer a high degree of freedom for developers, as they are not constrained by existing infrastructure or testing. However, developing on greenfields can be costly and time-consuming, as it often involves building new infrastructure and services from scratch.

The choice between brownfields and greenfields for urban redevelopment depends on a variety of factors, including the specific needs and goals of the community, the availability of resources, and the potential environmental and health risks associated with each type of land. In many cases, a combination of brownfield and greenfield redevelopment may be necessary to achieve the desired outcomes.

#### 2.1c.1 Brownfield Redevelopment

Brownfield redevelopment is a complex process that involves assessing the environmental risks associated with the site, developing a remediation plan, and implementing the plan. The process can be costly and time-consuming, but it can also lead to significant economic and environmental benefits.

One of the main benefits of brownfield redevelopment is the potential for job creation. The redevelopment of brownfields can create jobs in a variety of sectors, including construction, manufacturing, and services. Moreover, brownfield redevelopment can also lead to increased property values and tax revenues, which can benefit the local economy.

From an environmental perspective, brownfield redevelopment can help to reduce urban sprawl. As urban areas expand, there is often pressure to develop new land, which can lead to the neglect and abandonment of brownfields. By redeveloping these sites, we can reduce the need for new development and preserve undeveloped land.

#### 2.1c.2 Greenfield Development

Greenfield development, on the other hand, involves building new infrastructure and services on undeveloped land. This type of development can be costly and time-consuming, but it can also lead to significant economic benefits.

One of the main benefits of greenfield development is the potential for new economic opportunities. By developing new infrastructure and services, we can attract new businesses and create jobs. Moreover, greenfield development can also lead to increased property values and tax revenues, which can benefit the local economy.

However, greenfield development can also have negative impacts on the environment. Building new infrastructure and services from scratch can lead to the loss of natural resources and habitats. Moreover, greenfield development can also contribute to urban sprawl, which can have negative impacts on the environment and quality of life in urban areas.

#### 2.1c.3 Comparing Brownfield and Greenfield Development

Both brownfield and greenfield development have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Brownfield redevelopment offers the potential for job creation, economic benefits, and reduced urban sprawl, but it can also be costly and time-consuming. Greenfield development, on the other hand, can lead to new economic opportunities and increased property values, but it can also have negative impacts on the environment and contribute to urban sprawl.

The choice between brownfield and greenfield development depends on a variety of factors, including the specific needs and goals of the community, the availability of resources, and the potential environmental and health risks associated with each type of land. In many cases, a combination of brownfield and greenfield redevelopment may be necessary to achieve the desired outcomes.




#### 2.2a Role of Transportation in Redevelopment

Transportation plays a crucial role in the redevelopment of brownfields. The location of brownfields, often in urban areas, makes them easily accessible by various modes of transportation. This accessibility can be leveraged to facilitate the movement of people and goods, which is essential for the successful redevelopment of brownfields.

#### 2.2a.1 Transportation and Accessibility

The accessibility of brownfields is a key factor in their redevelopment. Brownfields are often located in urban areas that are well-served by existing transportation infrastructure. This includes roads, highways, public transit systems, and even air and sea ports. The presence of these transportation facilities can significantly reduce the cost and time associated with accessing brownfields, making them more attractive for redevelopment.

Moreover, the accessibility of brownfields can also enhance their economic potential. By providing easy access to brownfields, transportation infrastructure can facilitate the movement of people and goods, which is crucial for the operation of businesses. This can lead to increased economic activity and job creation in the surrounding area.

#### 2.2a.2 Transportation and Environmental Sustainability

Transportation also plays a significant role in the environmental sustainability of brownfield redevelopment. The use of sustainable transportation modes, such as public transit and non-motorized transportation, can reduce the environmental impact of brownfield redevelopment. This is particularly important given the potential environmental risks associated with brownfields, such as contamination of soil and groundwater.

Furthermore, the integration of brownfield redevelopment with sustainable transportation can contribute to the creation of more livable and resilient urban communities. For instance, the redevelopment of brownfields into mixed-use developments, which include residential, commercial, and recreational spaces, can reduce the need for long-distance travel and promote more sustainable patterns of land use.

#### 2.2a.3 Transportation and Policy

Policy plays a crucial role in shaping the relationship between transportation and brownfield redevelopment. Policies can incentivize the use of sustainable transportation modes in brownfield redevelopment, such as through tax credits or grants. They can also facilitate the integration of brownfield redevelopment with existing transportation infrastructure, such as through zoning regulations or transportation planning processes.

Moreover, policy can also address the potential challenges associated with transportation in brownfield redevelopment. For instance, policies can address issues related to transportation equity, such as ensuring that brownfield redevelopment benefits all members of the community, including those with limited access to transportation.

In conclusion, transportation plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment. It provides accessibility, enhances economic potential, contributes to environmental sustainability, and can be shaped by policy. Therefore, understanding the role of transportation in brownfield redevelopment is essential for effective urban redevelopment.

#### 2.2b Transportation and Redevelopment Planning

Transportation planning plays a pivotal role in the redevelopment of brownfields. It involves the strategic planning and management of transportation infrastructure and services to support the redevelopment of brownfields. This section will delve into the role of transportation in redevelopment planning, focusing on the integration of transportation and land use, the use of transportation demand management strategies, and the role of transportation in the creation of sustainable urban developments.

#### 2.2b.1 Integration of Transportation and Land Use

The integration of transportation and land use is a key aspect of brownfield redevelopment planning. This involves the coordination of transportation infrastructure and services with the redevelopment of brownfields. The goal is to create a seamless and efficient transportation system that supports the redevelopment of brownfields and promotes sustainable urban development.

The integration of transportation and land use can be achieved through various means. For instance, the redevelopment of brownfields can be integrated with existing transportation infrastructure, such as roads, highways, and public transit systems. This can be achieved through the provision of transportation facilities within the redeveloped brownfield, such as bus stops or bike lanes.

Moreover, the integration of transportation and land use can also involve the creation of new transportation infrastructure to support the redevelopment of brownfields. This can include the construction of new roads, highways, or public transit systems, or the upgrading of existing ones.

#### 2.2b.2 Transportation Demand Management

Transportation demand management (TDM) is another important aspect of brownfield redevelopment planning. TDM involves the management of transportation demand to reduce the need for motorized travel and promote the use of sustainable transportation modes. This can be achieved through various means, such as the promotion of non-motorized transportation, the implementation of congestion pricing, or the provision of incentives for the use of public transit.

The application of TDM in brownfield redevelopment can help to reduce the environmental impact of redevelopment, by reducing the number of vehicle trips and the associated emissions. It can also help to improve the accessibility of brownfields, by promoting the use of sustainable transportation modes.

#### 2.2b.3 Sustainable Urban Development

The redevelopment of brownfields can contribute to the creation of sustainable urban developments. This involves the integration of brownfield redevelopment with other urban development initiatives, such as urban greening, energy efficiency, or waste management.

Transportation plays a crucial role in this process. The provision of efficient and sustainable transportation infrastructure and services can support the integration of brownfield redevelopment with other urban development initiatives. For instance, the provision of public transit services can support the integration of brownfield redevelopment with urban greening, by providing access to green spaces for residents.

### Section: 3.1 How We Got Here: Law and Liability:

#### 3.1a History of Brownfields Legislation

The history of brownfields legislation in the United States is a complex and evolving one, reflecting the changing attitudes and priorities of society towards environmental protection and public health. The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act, also known as the Brownfields Law, was a significant step forward in addressing the issue of brownfields.

The Brownfields Law was enacted in 2002 as part of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA). It was designed to provide incentives for the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields, which are abandoned or underutilized properties that have been contaminated by hazardous substances. The law was a response to the growing concern over the environmental and health risks posed by these sites, and the need to encourage their cleanup and redevelopment.

The Brownfields Law introduced several key provisions, including the requirement for an "all appropriate inquiry" (AAI) into the previous use of the land. This inquiry is designed to determine whether the land has been contaminated by hazardous substances, and if so, to what extent. The AAI must be carried out by the current landowner, and it must be completed before any cleanup or redevelopment activities can take place.

In addition to the AAI, the Brownfields Law also requires the current landowner to take steps to protect human health and the environment from the contamination on the property. This can include measures such as containment, removal, or remediation of the contamination. The goal is to ensure that the site is safe for future use, whether that be for residential, commercial, or recreational purposes.

Finally, the Brownfields Law requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to make any contamination found on the property publicly available within two years of discovery. This is designed to ensure transparency and accountability in the cleanup and redevelopment process.

The Brownfields Law also includes provisions for funding brownfields revitalization efforts. Section 104(k) and Section 128(a) of the Act establish $250 million per year for brownfields revitalization, with $200 million going towards assessment, cleanup, revolving loans, and environmental job training, and $50 million to assist state and tribal response programs. These funds are crucial for supporting the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields, and they are distributed through a competitive grant process.

The Brownfields Law has been instrumental in promoting the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields across the United States. It has provided a legal framework for addressing the liability and responsibility associated with these sites, and it has provided funding for their cleanup and redevelopment. However, there are still challenges and limitations in the implementation of the Brownfields Law, which we will explore in the next section.

#### 3.1b Legal Liability for Brownfields

The legal liability for brownfields is a complex and multifaceted issue. It is governed by a variety of federal and state laws, including the Brownfields Law, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), and state environmental laws. 

Under the Brownfields Law, landowners are responsible for conducting an "all appropriate inquiry" into the previous use of the land. This inquiry is designed to determine whether the land has been contaminated by hazardous substances, and if so, to what extent. If the inquiry reveals contamination, the landowner is responsible for taking steps to protect human health and the environment from the contamination. This can include measures such as containment, removal, or remediation of the contamination.

The Brownfields Law also requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to make any contamination found on the property publicly available within two years of discovery. This is designed to ensure transparency and accountability in the cleanup and redevelopment process.

In addition to the Brownfields Law, landowners may also be subject to liability under CERCLA. CERCLA is a federal law that provides a legal framework for addressing the cleanup of hazardous substances, including those found on brownfields. Under CERCLA, landowners can be held liable for the costs of cleanup, even if they did not cause the contamination. This is known as "strict liability".

State environmental laws may also impose liability on landowners for brownfields. These laws can vary widely, but they generally require landowners to take steps to address contamination on their property. Failure to do so can result in legal action and penalties.

In conclusion, the legal liability for brownfields is a complex and multifaceted issue. It is governed by a variety of federal and state laws, and it can have significant implications for the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields. Understanding these legal liabilities is crucial for anyone involved in the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields.

#### 3.1c Case Studies in Brownfields Law and Liability

To further illustrate the complexities of brownfields law and liability, let's examine a few case studies. These cases will provide real-world examples of how the legal framework for brownfields operates in practice.

##### Case Study 1: The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act

The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act, also known as the Brownfields Law, was enacted in 2002 as part of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA). This law provides incentives for the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields, which are abandoned or underutilized properties that have been contaminated by hazardous substances.

One of the key provisions of the Brownfields Law is the requirement for an "all appropriate inquiry" (AAI) into the previous use of the land. This inquiry is designed to determine whether the land has been contaminated by hazardous substances, and if so, to what extent. The AAI must be carried out by the current landowner, and it must be completed before any cleanup or redevelopment activities can take place.

In the case of the former Bethlehem Steel site in Lackawanna, New York, the AAI revealed significant contamination from decades of steel production. The site was contaminated with a variety of hazardous substances, including heavy metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, and volatile organic compounds. The AAI also revealed that the site had been used for a variety of industrial activities, including steel production, chemical manufacturing, and waste disposal.

The AAI led to a comprehensive cleanup and redevelopment plan for the site. The cleanup included the removal of contaminated soil and groundwater, as well as the installation of a groundwater treatment system. The redevelopment plan included the construction of a mixed-use development with residential, commercial, and recreational spaces.

##### Case Study 2: The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA)

CERCLA is a federal law that provides a legal framework for addressing the cleanup of hazardous substances, including those found on brownfields. Under CERCLA, landowners can be held liable for the costs of cleanup, even if they did not cause the contamination. This is known as "strict liability".

In the case of the former Ford Motor Company assembly plant in St. Paul, Minnesota, CERCLA was used to address the cleanup of contamination from decades of automobile manufacturing. The site was contaminated with a variety of hazardous substances, including petroleum hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and volatile organic compounds.

The cleanup of the site was a complex and costly process, involving the removal of contaminated soil and groundwater, as well as the installation of a groundwater treatment system. The costs of the cleanup were ultimately borne by Ford Motor Company, despite the fact that the company had ceased operations at the site decades earlier.

These case studies illustrate the complexities of brownfields law and liability. They highlight the importance of conducting an AAI and the potential for strict liability under CERCLA. They also underscore the need for effective policies and practices for brownfields cleanup and redevelopment.




#### 3.1b Liability in Brownfields Redevelopment

The issue of liability has been a significant barrier to the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields. The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act, also known as the Brownfields Law, has attempted to address this issue by providing a legal framework for brownfield redevelopment.

The Brownfields Law has clarified the liability of parties involved in the redevelopment of brownfields. It has established a hierarchy of liability, with the current landowner bearing the primary responsibility for the cleanup of the site. This is followed by the previous landowner, and then by the current tenant. This hierarchy is designed to ensure that those who have the most direct control over the site are responsible for its cleanup.

In addition to this hierarchy, the Brownfields Law has also introduced the concept of "innocent landowners". These are parties who acquire the site after the contamination has occurred, but who are not responsible for the contamination. The Brownfields Law provides protections for innocent landowners, ensuring that they are not held liable for the cleanup of the site.

The Brownfields Law has also introduced the concept of "bona fide prospective purchasers". These are parties who acquire the site with the intention of redeveloping it, but who are not aware of the contamination on the site. The Brownfields Law provides protections for bona fide prospective purchasers, ensuring that they are not held liable for the cleanup of the site.

The Brownfields Law has also introduced the concept of "contiguous property owners". These are parties who own property adjacent to the brownfield site. The Brownfields Law provides protections for contiguous property owners, ensuring that they are not held liable for the cleanup of the site.

The Brownfields Law has also introduced the concept of "good faith efforts". These are efforts made by the current landowner to address the contamination on the site. The Brownfields Law provides protections for parties who make good faith efforts, ensuring that they are not held liable for the cleanup of the site.

The Brownfields Law has also introduced the concept of "innocent purchasers". These are parties who acquire the site without knowledge of the contamination on the site.

### Subsection: 3.1c Evolution of Legal Framework

The legal framework for brownfield redevelopment has evolved significantly over the years. The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act, also known as the Brownfields Law, has been instrumental in this evolution. This law has provided a comprehensive legal framework for brownfield redevelopment, addressing issues of liability, responsibility, and protections for innocent landowners and bona fide prospective purchasers.

#### 3.1c.1 The Brownfields Law

The Brownfields Law was enacted in 2002 as part of the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act. This law was a significant step forward in the legal framework for brownfield redevelopment. It provided a clear hierarchy of liability, establishing the current landowner as the primary responsible party, followed by the previous landowner and then the current tenant. This hierarchy ensures that those who have the most direct control over the site are responsible for its cleanup.

The Brownfields Law also introduced the concept of "innocent landowners". These are parties who acquire the site after the contamination has occurred, but who are not responsible for the contamination. The law provides protections for innocent landowners, ensuring that they are not held liable for the cleanup of the site.

The Brownfields Law also introduced the concept of "bona fide prospective purchasers". These are parties who acquire the site with the intention of redeveloping it, but who are not aware of the contamination on the site. The law provides protections for bona fide prospective purchasers, ensuring that they are not held liable for the cleanup of the site.

The Brownfields Law also introduced the concept of "contiguous property owners". These are parties who own property adjacent to the brownfield site. The law provides protections for contiguous property owners, ensuring that they are not held liable for the cleanup of the site.

#### 3.1c.2 The Evolution of the Legal Framework

The Brownfields Law has been instrumental in the evolution of the legal framework for brownfield redevelopment. Prior to its enactment, the legal framework was fragmented and often unclear. The Brownfields Law provided a comprehensive and consistent legal framework, addressing many of the issues that had been causing confusion and barriers to brownfield redevelopment.

Since its enactment, the Brownfields Law has been amended several times to address specific issues and to clarify certain aspects of the law. These amendments have further refined the legal framework for brownfield redevelopment, making it more effective and efficient.

In addition to the Brownfields Law, other federal and state laws have also contributed to the evolution of the legal framework for brownfield redevelopment. These laws have addressed a variety of issues, including the cleanup of hazardous substances, the protection of human health and the environment, and the promotion of brownfield redevelopment.

The evolution of the legal framework for brownfield redevelopment has been a complex and ongoing process. It has involved the efforts of many stakeholders, including government agencies, industry groups, and environmental organizations. The Brownfields Law has been a key player in this process, providing a solid foundation for the ongoing development and refinement of the legal framework for brownfield redevelopment.

## Chapter 4: Brownfield Redevelopment Strategies and Techniques:




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the market forces and opportunity drivers that play a crucial role in the redevelopment of brownfields. Brownfields, also known as contaminated sites, pose significant challenges to urban redevelopment due to the potential health and environmental risks associated with their use. However, with the right policies and practices in place, these sites can be transformed into valuable assets for communities.

We will begin by discussing the concept of market forces and how they impact the redevelopment of brownfields. Market forces refer to the economic factors that influence the supply and demand of land and property. These forces can include factors such as population growth, economic development, and changes in land use. We will explore how these forces can create opportunities for brownfield redevelopment and how they can also pose challenges.

Next, we will delve into the various opportunity drivers that can motivate the redevelopment of brownfields. These drivers can include regulatory incentives, tax breaks, and community support. We will discuss how these drivers can encourage developers to take on the risks associated with brownfield redevelopment and how they can also facilitate the process.

Finally, we will examine case studies of successful brownfield redevelopment projects and the market forces and opportunity drivers that played a role in their success. These case studies will provide real-world examples of how market forces and opportunity drivers can be leveraged to transform brownfields into thriving urban spaces.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the market forces and opportunity drivers that drive brownfield redevelopment and how they can be harnessed to create sustainable and vibrant urban spaces. 





#### 4.1a Economic Factors in Redevelopment

Economic factors play a crucial role in the redevelopment of brownfields. These factors can include market demand, property values, and economic incentives. In this section, we will explore how these economic factors can influence the redevelopment of brownfields and the potential benefits they can bring to urban areas.

#### Market Demand

Market demand is a key driver of brownfield redevelopment. As urban areas continue to grow and expand, there is a increasing demand for land and property. This demand can create opportunities for brownfield redevelopment, as these sites are often located in prime locations with easy access to transportation and amenities. By repurposing these sites, developers can meet the growing demand for land and property, while also addressing the issue of urban sprawl.

Moreover, market demand can also drive the redevelopment of brownfields through the concept of comparative advantage. As mentioned in the related context, comparative advantage is a key factor in determining the location of economic activity. In the case of brownfields, their location can be seen as a comparative advantage, as they are often located in areas with high market demand. This can make them attractive for redevelopment, as developers can take advantage of the existing market demand to justify the costs of cleanup and redevelopment.

#### Property Values

Property values can also play a significant role in brownfield redevelopment. As brownfields are often located in urban areas with high market demand, their proximity to desirable locations can drive up property values. This can make brownfields more attractive for redevelopment, as developers can expect to see a return on their investment through increased property values.

Furthermore, the redevelopment of brownfields can also lead to an increase in property values in the surrounding area. This is known as the "brownfield effect," where the cleanup and redevelopment of a brownfield can lead to an increase in property values in the surrounding area. This can bring additional economic benefits to the community, such as increased tax revenue and job creation.

#### Economic Incentives

Economic incentives, such as tax breaks and grants, can also play a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment. These incentives can help offset the costs of cleanup and redevelopment, making brownfields more financially feasible for developers. They can also encourage developers to take on the risks associated with brownfield redevelopment, as they can expect to see a return on their investment through these incentives.

Moreover, economic incentives can also help address the issue of environmental justice. As brownfields are often located in low-income and minority communities, the cleanup and redevelopment of these sites can bring economic benefits to these communities. This can help alleviate the environmental and health impacts that these communities have faced for years.

In conclusion, economic factors play a crucial role in the redevelopment of brownfields. Market demand, property values, and economic incentives can all drive the redevelopment of brownfields and bring economic benefits to urban areas. By understanding and leveraging these economic factors, we can create sustainable and vibrant urban spaces through the redevelopment of brownfields.





#### 4.1b Role of Private Sector

The private sector plays a crucial role in the redevelopment of brownfields. As mentioned in the previous section, market demand and property values are key drivers of brownfield redevelopment. The private sector, which includes developers, investors, and other businesses, is responsible for meeting this market demand and taking advantage of the comparative advantage of brownfields.

The private sector is also responsible for driving innovation and efficiency in the redevelopment of brownfields. As they are motivated by profit, they have an incentive to find cost-effective solutions for brownfield cleanup and redevelopment. This can lead to the development of new technologies and techniques for brownfield cleanup, making the process more efficient and sustainable.

Moreover, the private sector is also responsible for creating jobs and stimulating economic growth through brownfield redevelopment. As mentioned in the related context, the private sector is the largest employer in many countries. By redeveloping brownfields, the private sector can create new job opportunities and stimulate economic growth in urban areas.

However, the private sector also faces challenges in brownfield redevelopment. These can include high cleanup costs, regulatory barriers, and uncertainty in the market. To address these challenges, the private sector often works in partnership with government agencies and other stakeholders to access funding, technical assistance, and other resources.

In conclusion, the private sector plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment. Their involvement is essential for meeting market demand, driving innovation and efficiency, and stimulating economic growth. However, they also face challenges that must be addressed through partnerships and collaboration with other stakeholders. 





#### 4.1c Public-Private Partnerships

Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have become increasingly popular in the field of brownfield redevelopment. These partnerships involve collaboration between the public sector, such as government agencies, and the private sector, such as developers and investors. PPPs have been used in a variety of industries, including transportation, healthcare, and education, and have proven to be effective in addressing complex and large-scale projects.

PPPs in brownfield redevelopment have gained traction due to their potential to leverage private sector expertise and resources, while also addressing the challenges and risks associated with brownfield cleanup and redevelopment. The private sector brings valuable skills and knowledge in areas such as project management, financing, and technology, which can be crucial in successfully redeveloping brownfields. Additionally, PPPs can help mitigate the financial risks associated with brownfield redevelopment, as the private sector is often willing to take on a significant portion of the financial burden.

One of the key benefits of PPPs in brownfield redevelopment is the potential for cost savings. By leveraging the resources and expertise of the private sector, PPPs can help reduce the overall cost of brownfield cleanup and redevelopment. This can be achieved through more efficient project management, access to lower-cost financing, and the use of innovative technologies for cleanup and redevelopment.

PPPs also have the potential to address the challenges of regulatory compliance and community engagement in brownfield redevelopment. The private sector is often more familiar with the complex regulatory framework surrounding brownfield redevelopment and can help navigate the process more efficiently. Additionally, PPPs can help address community concerns and involve the community in the redevelopment process, leading to more successful and sustainable outcomes.

However, PPPs in brownfield redevelopment also come with their own set of challenges. One of the main challenges is the allocation of risk and responsibility between the public and private sectors. PPPs require careful structuring and negotiation to ensure that both parties are adequately protected and that the project is financially viable. Additionally, PPPs can be complex and time-consuming to set up and manage, requiring significant resources and expertise.

Despite these challenges, PPPs have proven to be a valuable tool in brownfield redevelopment. They have been used successfully in a variety of projects, including the redevelopment of the former Bethlehem Steel site in Lackawanna, New York, and the redevelopment of the former Naval Air Station Alameda in California. As the demand for brownfield redevelopment continues to grow, PPPs will likely play an increasingly important role in addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by these sites.

# Scarborough Town Centre

## Proposed development

Currently, multiple plans are proposed for the shopping mall and its surroundings.

### Scarborough Subway Extension

The extension of TTC's Line 2 Bloor-Danforth subway line is currently under construction, which will extend the line 7.8 kilometers. The extension will start from Kennedy station and go north towards McCowan Road and Sheppard Avenue with a station at the centre. This will replace the current Line 3 Scarborough that passes through the centre. The extension is expected to be complete around 2030.

### Redevelopment of the centre

A proposal was created by Oxford Properties to redevelop the centre. For the first phase, the existing Cineplex Cinemas would be demolished to create space for the subway extension to the mall and a new transit hub. The current theatre would be replaced with a new movie theatre adjacent to the former Sears location. The Sears location would be renovated and divided into at least 18 retail units with three levels. A pedestrian walkway will connect the mall with the new movie theatre # Birkenhead

## Future

The major redevelopment project under consideration is Peel Holdings' "Wirral Waters". This would allow for £4.5 billion of investment in the regeneration of the dockland area. This equates with an investment of over £14,000 for each of the 320,000 residents of the Wirral. At the East Float and Vittoria Dock, the development would include of new office space and for new residential flats. A retail and leisure quarter at the former Bidston Dock site would encompass another of space. The whole project would create more than 27,000 permanent new jobs, aside from the employment required for construction and other peripheral employment. The development would be expected to take up to thirty years # METRORapid Silver Line

## Expansion

An extension north to Northwest Mall—a future Texas Central Railway station)—and a western extension to the Hillcroft Transit Center have been proposed. This would allow for a more efficient and convenient transportation system for the city. The expansion is still in the planning stages and is expected to be completed in the next few years.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the intersection of brownfields redevelopment and environmental justice and equity. Brownfields, defined as abandoned or underutilized properties with potential environmental contamination, are often located in urban areas and have a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities. The redevelopment of these properties has the potential to bring economic and social benefits, but it also raises important questions about fairness and equity.

We will begin by examining the concept of environmental justice and its relevance to brownfields redevelopment. Environmental justice is a social movement that seeks to address the unequal distribution of environmental benefits and burdens, particularly among marginalized communities. Brownfields, with their history of industrial use and potential contamination, are often located in these communities, making them a key focus of the environmental justice movement.

Next, we will delve into the concept of equity in brownfields redevelopment. Equity refers to fairness and justice in the distribution of benefits and burdens. In the context of brownfields, equity is crucial as these properties have the potential to bring significant benefits, such as job creation and improved property values, to surrounding communities. However, if these benefits are not equitably distributed, it can exacerbate existing inequalities and further marginalize already disadvantaged communities.

Throughout this chapter, we will explore the various policies and practices that have been implemented to address environmental justice and equity in brownfields redevelopment. These include federal and state laws, as well as community-based initiatives and partnerships. We will also examine case studies and best practices to gain a deeper understanding of how these policies and practices are being implemented in real-world scenarios.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the complex and multifaceted issues surrounding environmental justice and equity in brownfields redevelopment. This knowledge will be essential for anyone involved in the planning, implementation, or evaluation of brownfields redevelopment projects, as well as for those interested in the broader social and environmental implications of these projects. 





### Subsection: 6.1a Definition of Environmental Justice

Environmental justice is a concept that has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in the context of brownfields redevelopment. It is a social movement that seeks to address the unequal distribution of environmental benefits and burdens, particularly among marginalized communities. In this section, we will explore the definition of environmental justice and its relevance to brownfields redevelopment.

Environmental justice is typically defined as distributive justice, which is "the equitable distribution of environmental risks and benefits". This means that all individuals, regardless of their race, color, national origin, or income, should have equal access to environmental benefits and be protected from environmental risks. This definition recognizes the historical and ongoing discrimination faced by marginalized communities in accessing clean air, water, and land, and seeks to address these inequalities.

Some definitions of environmental justice also address procedural justice, which is the "fair and meaningful participation in decision-making". This recognizes the importance of including the perspectives and needs of all individuals in environmental decision-making processes. Marginalized communities, particularly those affected by brownfields, have often been excluded from these processes, leading to decisions that do not adequately address their concerns.

Other scholars emphasize recognition justice, which is the "recognition of oppression" and difference in environmental justice communities. This definition recognizes the historical and ongoing oppression faced by marginalized communities in environmental decision-making and seeks to address these systemic inequalities.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines environmental justice as:

> the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.

This definition highlights the importance of including all individuals in environmental decision-making and ensuring that these decisions are fair and equitable.

Environmental justice is also discussed as environmental racism or environmental inequality. These terms recognize the disproportionate impact of environmental degradation and pollution on marginalized communities, particularly those in the Global South. This is due to the historical and ongoing exploitation of these communities for natural resources and the resulting environmental degradation.

In the context of brownfields redevelopment, environmental justice is crucial as these properties have the potential to bring significant benefits, such as job creation and improved property values, to surrounding communities. However, if these benefits are not equitably distributed, it can exacerbate existing inequalities and further marginalize already disadvantaged communities.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of equity in brownfields redevelopment and its importance in addressing environmental justice issues.





### Subsection: 6.1b Environmental Justice and Brownfields

Brownfields, or abandoned or underutilized properties with potential environmental contamination, have been a major issue in urban areas for decades. These properties often pose significant health and safety risks to nearby communities, particularly those that are already disadvantaged. The redevelopment of brownfields presents a unique opportunity to address environmental justice concerns and promote equitable development.

#### 6.1b Environmental Justice and Brownfields

The redevelopment of brownfields has been a key focus of environmental justice efforts. These properties, often located in low-income and minority communities, have been neglected and abandoned for years, leaving behind a legacy of environmental contamination. The redevelopment of these properties can bring new economic opportunities and improve the quality of life for these communities, but it must be done in a way that is equitable and just.

One of the key challenges in brownfield redevelopment is ensuring that the benefits of redevelopment are equitably distributed. This includes not only the economic benefits, but also the environmental benefits. For example, the redevelopment of a brownfield into a park or green space can provide much-needed access to nature and recreational opportunities for nearby communities. However, if these benefits are not accessible to all members of the community, particularly those who have been most affected by the brownfield, then the redevelopment is not truly equitable.

In addition to equitable distribution of benefits, it is also important to ensure that the burdens of brownfield redevelopment are not unfairly placed on marginalized communities. This includes considerations of potential health risks during the redevelopment process, as well as potential gentrification and displacement of low-income residents after redevelopment.

The concept of environmental justice also highlights the importance of meaningful community participation in brownfield redevelopment decisions. Marginalized communities, particularly those affected by brownfields, have often been excluded from decision-making processes. This not only perpetuates inequalities, but also leads to redevelopment plans that do not adequately address the needs and concerns of these communities.

In conclusion, brownfield redevelopment presents a unique opportunity to address environmental justice concerns and promote equitable development. By ensuring the equitable distribution of benefits and burdens, and by involving marginalized communities in decision-making processes, we can create more just and sustainable urban environments.

This knowledge will be valuable for anyone involved in brownfields redevelopment, whether as a developer, investor, or government official. 





#### 9.1a Cost-Benefit Analysis

Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is a systematic approach to estimating the strengths and weaknesses of alternatives in terms of their costs and benefits. It is a crucial tool in the process of brownfields redevelopment, as it allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the economic implications of different redevelopment strategies.

CBA is based on the principle of Pareto optimality, which states that a project is considered beneficial if it results in a net gain in welfare for at least one individual, without causing a net loss in welfare for any other individual. This principle is used to evaluate the overall impact of a project on society, taking into account both the direct and indirect effects of the project.

The process of CBA involves identifying and quantifying the costs and benefits associated with a project. Costs may include cleanup and remediation expenses, as well as any potential legal or regulatory fees. Benefits may include increased property values, job creation, and improved environmental conditions. These costs and benefits are then compared to determine the net benefit of the project.

One of the key advantages of CBA is that it allows for a comparison of different redevelopment strategies based on their economic impacts. This can help decision-makers choose the most cost-effective and beneficial option for the community.

However, CBA also has its limitations. It relies heavily on assumptions and projections, which may not always be accurate. It also does not take into account non-economic factors, such as social or environmental impacts, which may be important considerations in brownfields redevelopment.

Despite its limitations, CBA remains a valuable tool in the process of brownfields redevelopment. It provides a systematic and objective way to evaluate the economic implications of different strategies, and can help guide decision-making towards the most beneficial outcome for the community.





#### 9.1b Financing Redevelopment

Financing is a crucial aspect of brownfields redevelopment, as it can greatly impact the success and sustainability of a project. In this section, we will discuss the various financing options available for brownfields redevelopment and their advantages and disadvantages.

One of the main financing options for brownfields redevelopment is through public funding. This can come from federal, state, or local governments and can include grants, loans, or tax incentives. Public funding can be a valuable resource for brownfields redevelopment, as it can help offset the high costs associated with cleanup and remediation. However, it also comes with strict regulations and may not always be available for every project.

Another financing option is through private funding, which can come from individual investors, venture capitalists, or private equity firms. Private funding can be a more flexible and less bureaucratic option compared to public funding, but it also comes with higher interest rates and may require a more significant equity stake in the project.

In addition to traditional financing options, there are also specialized programs and funds available for brownfields redevelopment. These can include brownfields tax incentives, which allow for the deduction of cleanup costs from taxes, and brownfields revolving loans, which provide low-interest loans for cleanup and redevelopment. These programs can be a valuable resource for brownfields redevelopment, but they may also have specific eligibility requirements and may not always be available for every project.

It is important for developers and investors to carefully consider the financing options available for brownfields redevelopment and to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each. By understanding the financing options and their implications, developers and investors can make informed decisions and increase the chances of success for their brownfields redevelopment projects.

#### 10.1b Legal Liability in Brownfields

The legal liability for brownfields is a complex and evolving area of law. It is important for landowners, developers, and other stakeholders to understand the legal landscape surrounding brownfield redevelopment in order to effectively manage liability and risk.

One of the key aspects of legal liability in brownfields is the concept of "strict liability". Strict liability is a legal doctrine that holds a party strictly liable for harm caused by their product or activity, regardless of their intent or negligence. In the context of brownfields, strict liability can apply to the previous owners or developers of the property, as well as to current landowners. This means that even if a current landowner did not cause the contamination on the property, they may still be held legally responsible for it.

Another important aspect of legal liability in brownfields is the concept of "contributory negligence". Contributory negligence is a legal doctrine that holds a party responsible for a portion of the harm caused by their own negligence. In the context of brownfields, this can apply to current landowners who fail to take reasonable steps to protect human health and the environment from identified contamination. This can result in a reduction of the landowner's legal liability, but does not absolve them of all responsibility.

In addition to these legal doctrines, there are also specific laws and regulations that govern liability in brownfield redevelopment. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) provides a federal "superfund" for the cleanup of hazardous waste sites, including brownfields. Under CERCLA, current landowners can be held jointly and severally liable for the cleanup of contamination on their property, regardless of their involvement in the contamination.

Understanding these legal concepts and regulations is crucial for effectively managing liability and risk in brownfield redevelopment. It is important for landowners, developers, and other stakeholders to work closely with legal and environmental professionals to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and to effectively manage liability and risk in brownfield redevelopment projects.





### Section: 10.2 Risk Management in Redevelopment:

Risk management is a critical aspect of brownfield redevelopment. It involves identifying, assessing, and controlling potential risks that could impact the success of a redevelopment project. These risks can range from financial risks, such as cost overruns or delays, to operational risks, such as safety hazards or regulatory compliance issues.

#### 10.2a Identifying Risks

The first step in risk management is identifying potential risks. This involves a thorough understanding of the project, including its objectives, constraints, and uncertainties. It also requires a deep understanding of the project environment, including the regulatory landscape, market conditions, and potential stakeholders.

Risk identification can be a complex process, as it involves considering a wide range of potential risks. To assist in this process, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) provides a risk identification checklist in Annex A of ISO 31000:2018. This checklist provides a structured approach to identifying risks, and can be a useful tool for brownfield redevelopment projects.

#### 10.2b Assessing Risks

Once risks have been identified, they must be assessed to determine their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence. This involves considering the potential consequences of each risk, as well as the likelihood of those consequences occurring.

The assessment process can be qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative risk assessment involves subjective judgments about the potential impact and likelihood of risks. Quantitative risk assessment, on the other hand, involves numerical methods for assessing risk. This can include techniques such as sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation.

#### 10.2c Controlling Risks

After risks have been identified and assessed, they must be controlled to minimize their potential impact. This can involve a variety of strategies, including risk avoidance, risk reduction, risk sharing, and risk acceptance.

Risk avoidance involves changing the project plan to avoid the risk altogether. Risk reduction involves taking steps to reduce the potential impact or likelihood of the risk. Risk sharing involves sharing the risk with other parties, such as through insurance or partnerships. Risk acceptance involves accepting the risk and preparing for potential consequences.

#### 10.2d Monitoring and Reviewing Risks

Finally, risks must be monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that they are being effectively managed. This involves tracking the effectiveness of risk management strategies, as well as monitoring residual risks and identifying any new risks that may arise.

In conclusion, risk management is a critical aspect of brownfield redevelopment. It involves identifying, assessing, and controlling potential risks, as well as monitoring and reviewing risks on an ongoing basis. By effectively managing risks, brownfield redevelopment projects can be successfully completed, leading to the revitalization of urban areas and the creation of new opportunities for communities.

#### 10.2b Risk Assessment Techniques

Risk assessment is a critical step in the risk management process. It involves evaluating the potential risks identified in the previous step to determine their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence. This information is then used to prioritize risks and develop strategies to mitigate them.

There are several techniques that can be used for risk assessment, including:

- **Qualitative Risk Assessment:** This technique involves subjective judgments about the potential impact and likelihood of risks. It is often used as a first step in the risk assessment process to provide a broad overview of the potential risks.

- **Quantitative Risk Assessment:** This technique involves numerical methods for assessing risk. It can include techniques such as sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation. These methods allow for a more detailed and objective assessment of risks.

- **Check Sheets:** These are simple, structured lists that can be used to identify and assess risks. They can be used for quick assessments or as a supplement to other risk assessment techniques.

- **Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS):** This is a hierarchical breakdown of risks that can be used to organize and prioritize risks. It can be used in conjunction with other risk assessment techniques to provide a more comprehensive assessment of risks.

- **Risk Register:** This is a document that records the results of the risk assessment process. It can include information about the identified risks, their potential impact and likelihood, and the strategies for mitigating them.

- **Risk Burndown Chart:** This is a visual representation of the remaining risk in a project. It can be used to track the progress of risk management and identify any areas that may require additional attention.

- **Risk Heat Map:** This is a visual representation of the risks in a project. It can be used to identify high-risk areas and prioritize risk management efforts.

- **Risk Matrix:** This is a visual representation of the potential impact and likelihood of risks. It can be used to prioritize risks and develop strategies for mitigating them.

- **Risk Scoring Models:** These models use mathematical algorithms to assign scores to risks based on their potential impact and likelihood. They can be used to prioritize risks and develop strategies for mitigating them.

- **Risk Assessment Software:** There are several software tools available for risk assessment, which can automate the process and provide more detailed and objective assessments of risks.

In the next section, we will discuss how to use these risk assessment techniques in the context of brownfield redevelopment.

#### 10.2c Risk Mitigation Strategies

Once the risks have been assessed, the next step in the risk management process is to develop strategies to mitigate these risks. Mitigation strategies are actions taken to reduce the potential impact or likelihood of a risk. They can be proactive, such as implementing risk management measures before a risk event occurs, or reactive, such as responding to a risk event after it has occurred.

There are several strategies that can be used to mitigate risks, including:

- **Risk Avoidance:** This strategy involves avoiding the activity or situation that poses a risk. For example, in the context of brownfield redevelopment, this could involve not redeveloping a site that is deemed too risky due to potential environmental contamination.

- **Risk Reduction:** This strategy involves taking steps to reduce the potential impact or likelihood of a risk. For example, in the context of brownfield redevelopment, this could involve implementing safety protocols to reduce the risk of exposure to environmental contamination.

- **Risk Transfer:** This strategy involves transferring the risk to another party. This can be done through insurance, contracts, or partnerships. For example, in the context of brownfield redevelopment, this could involve purchasing environmental liability insurance or entering into a partnership with a company that specializes in environmental remediation.

- **Risk Acceptance:** This strategy involves accepting the risk and preparing for potential consequences. This can be done by developing contingency plans or by increasing capacity to absorb potential losses. For example, in the context of brownfield redevelopment, this could involve developing a contingency plan for dealing with potential environmental contamination.

- **Risk Exploitation:** This strategy involves taking advantage of a risk to achieve a potential gain. For example, in the context of brownfield redevelopment, this could involve redeveloping a site that poses a risk for environmental contamination, but also has the potential for significant economic benefits.

- **Risk Monitoring and Control:** This strategy involves continuously monitoring and controlling risks to ensure that they are being effectively managed. This can involve regular risk assessments, risk registers, and risk burndown charts. For example, in the context of brownfield redevelopment, this could involve regularly monitoring the progress of environmental remediation efforts and adjusting strategies as needed.

In the next section, we will discuss how to implement these risk mitigation strategies in the context of brownfield redevelopment.

## Chapter: Chapter 11: Financing and Incentives:

### Introduction

The eleventh chapter of "Brownfields Policy and Practice: A Comprehensive Guide to Urban Redevelopment" delves into the critical aspects of financing and incentives in the context of brownfield redevelopment. This chapter is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the financial and incentive mechanisms that drive urban redevelopment, particularly in the context of brownfields.

Brownfields, as we have learned, are abandoned or underused industrial and commercial facilities available for re-use. The redevelopment of these properties can be a complex and challenging process due to potential environmental contamination. However, with the right financing and incentives, these properties can be transformed into valuable assets, contributing to the revitalization of urban areas.

In this chapter, we will explore the various financing options available for brownfield redevelopment, including public and private funding sources. We will also discuss the role of incentives in encouraging brownfield redevelopment, such as tax credits, grants, and loan guarantees. These incentives are often crucial in offsetting the costs associated with environmental cleanup and redevelopment.

Moreover, we will delve into the policy frameworks that govern brownfield redevelopment, examining how these policies influence the financing and incentives available for these projects. We will also discuss the role of various stakeholders, including government agencies, developers, and community groups, in shaping these policies and incentives.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the financing and incentives available for brownfield redevelopment, as well as the policy frameworks that govern these processes. This knowledge will be invaluable for anyone involved in urban redevelopment, whether as a policy maker, a developer, or a community member.




### Section: 10.2 Risk Management in Redevelopment:

Risk management is a critical aspect of brownfield redevelopment. It involves identifying, assessing, and controlling potential risks that could impact the success of a redevelopment project. These risks can range from financial risks, such as cost overruns or delays, to operational risks, such as safety hazards or regulatory compliance issues.

#### 10.2a Identifying Risks

The first step in risk management is identifying potential risks. This involves a thorough understanding of the project, including its objectives, constraints, and uncertainties. It also requires a deep understanding of the project environment, including the regulatory landscape, market conditions, and potential stakeholders.

Risk identification can be a complex process, as it involves considering a wide range of potential risks. To assist in this process, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) provides a risk identification checklist in Annex A of ISO 31000:2018. This checklist provides a structured approach to identifying risks, and can be a useful tool for brownfield redevelopment projects.

#### 10.2b Assessing Risks

Once risks have been identified, they must be assessed to determine their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence. This involves considering the potential consequences of each risk, as well as the likelihood of those consequences occurring.

The assessment process can be qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative risk assessment involves subjective judgments about the potential impact and likelihood of risks. This can be done through brainstorming sessions, expert consultations, or other methods. Quantitative risk assessment, on the other hand, involves using numerical methods to assess the likelihood and impact of risks. This can include statistical analysis, simulation models, or other techniques.

#### 10.2c Mitigating Risks

After risks have been identified and assessed, they must be mitigated to reduce their potential impact. This can be done through various risk management strategies, including risk avoidance, risk reduction, risk sharing, and risk acceptance.

Risk avoidance involves avoiding the activity or project that poses a risk. This may not always be feasible, especially in the case of brownfield redevelopment where there may be significant potential benefits.

Risk reduction involves taking steps to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk. This can include implementing safety protocols, improving project management processes, or investing in additional resources.

Risk sharing involves transferring the risk to another party, such as through insurance or partnership agreements. This can help reduce the potential impact of a risk, but it also involves additional costs and potential loss of control.

Risk acceptance involves acknowledging and accepting the risk without taking any specific actions to mitigate it. This may be appropriate for low-impact risks that are deemed to be acceptable within the project constraints.

#### 10.2d Monitoring and Review

Finally, it is important to monitor and review the risk management process on an ongoing basis. This involves tracking identified risks, assessing their ongoing impact and likelihood, and adjusting the risk management strategy as needed. Regular reviews should also be conducted to ensure that the risk management process is effective and to identify any areas for improvement.

In conclusion, risk management is a crucial aspect of brownfield redevelopment. It involves a systematic process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks to ensure the success of a project. By following a structured approach and regularly monitoring and reviewing the risk management process, brownfield redevelopment projects can effectively manage risks and achieve their objectives.

Brownfields are abandoned or underutilized properties that have been contaminated by hazardous substances, pollutants, or other contaminants. These properties are often located in urban areas and can pose significant health and environmental risks to nearby communities. The redevelopment of brownfields is a complex process that requires a comprehensive understanding of various policies and practices.

In this section, we will review the key concepts related to brownfields and urban redevelopment. We will discuss the history of brownfields, the challenges they pose, and the policies and practices that have been implemented to address them. We will also explore the role of stakeholders and community involvement in the redevelopment process.

#### 11.1b Brownfields Redevelopment Policies and Practices

The redevelopment of brownfields is a multifaceted process that requires the collaboration of various stakeholders. These stakeholders may include government agencies, private developers, community organizations, and environmental consultants. The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act, also known as the Brownfields Law, provides funding and guidelines for brownfield redevelopment.

The Brownfields Law requires landowners to conduct an "all appropriate inquiry" before beginning the redevelopment process. This inquiry involves researching the property's history and conducting environmental assessments to determine the extent of contamination. The law also requires landowners to take steps to protect human health and the environment from the contamination on the property.

#### 11.1c Funding for Brownfields Redevelopment

The Brownfields Law provides two sources of funding for brownfield redevelopment. Section 104(k) and Section 128(a) allocate $250 million per year for brownfield revitalization. Specifically, $200 million per year is allocated for brownfield assessment, cleanup, revolving loans, and environmental job training. Additionally, $50 million per year is allocated to assist state and tribal response programs.

The Environmental Protection Agency's Brownfields Program collaborates with other EPA programs, federal partners, and state agencies to identify and leverage resources for brownfield activities. These collaborations lead to a process of engagement reliant upon public-private partnerships to turn dilapidated properties into viable economic redevelopments or "green-space" throughout the country.

#### 11.1d Criteria for Funding

The funding criteria for brownfield redevelopment include the extent to which the money will be used to protect human health and the environment, spur redevelopment and create jobs, preserve open space and parks, represent a "fair" distribution between urban and rural areas, address "brownfield hotspots," and involve community participation.

In the next section, we will explore the role of stakeholders and community involvement in the brownfield redevelopment process. We will also discuss the importance of collaboration and communication in bringing about successful urban redevelopment.





### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the various aspects of urban redevelopment, from the initial assessment of a brownfield site to the final implementation of a redevelopment plan. We have discussed the importance of understanding the history and context of a site, as well as the need for collaboration and communication among all stakeholders involved in the process. We have also examined the role of policy and regulation in guiding and shaping urban redevelopment efforts.

Through our exploration, we have seen that urban redevelopment is a complex and multifaceted process that requires a comprehensive understanding of various factors and considerations. It is not a one-size-fits-all approach, and each site and project will have its own unique challenges and opportunities. However, by following the principles and practices outlined in this guide, we can ensure that urban redevelopment efforts are successful and sustainable.

As we conclude this chapter, it is important to remember that urban redevelopment is not just about revitalizing abandoned or underutilized spaces.
