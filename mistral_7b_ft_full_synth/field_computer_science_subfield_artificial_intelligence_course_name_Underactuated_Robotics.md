# Underactuated Robotics: Theory and Applications":


## Foreward

Welcome to "Underactuated Robotics: Theory and Applications"! This book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of underactuated robotics, a field that has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential for creating smaller, more efficient, and more agile robots.

The concept of underactuation, where a robot has fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom, has been explored in various forms since the 1960s. However, it was not until the 1980s that the term "underactuation" was coined by Hervé Brönnimann, J. Ian Munro, and Greg Frederickson. Since then, underactuation has been extensively studied and applied in various fields, including robotics, control systems, and biomechanics.

In this book, we will delve into the theory behind underactuated robotics, exploring the mathematical models and control strategies that make it possible to create efficient and agile robots. We will also explore the practical applications of underactuation, including its use in creating small, efficient robots like the RoboBee.

The RoboBee, developed by researchers at MIT, is a prime example of the potential of underactuation. By using a technique inspired by pop-up books, researchers were able to rapidly produce prototype units of the RoboBee. This technique, combined with the use of artificial muscles and thin plastic hinges, allows the RoboBee to generate power output comparable to an insect of equal size.

However, there are still challenges to overcome in the field of underactuated robotics. One of the main challenges is the lack of onboard decision-making capabilities. The RoboBee, for example, requires a tethered "brain subsystem" for interpretation of data from onboard vision sensors. This is an area of active research, with efforts focused on developing specialized hardware accelerators to solve this problem.

Another challenge is the power supply for underactuated robots. The power question proves to be a catch-22, as a larger power unit stores more energy but also adds weight and complexity. This is an area where further research and innovation are needed.

Despite these challenges, the potential of underactuation is immense. By understanding the theory behind underactuation and exploring its practical applications, we can continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in robotics.

I hope this book will serve as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and anyone interested in the field of underactuated robotics. Let's embark on this journey together and explore the exciting world of underactuation.




# Title: Underactuated Robotics: Theory and Applications":

## Chapter 1: Nonlinear Dynamics of the Simple Pendulum:

### Introduction

The study of nonlinear dynamics is a fundamental aspect of robotics, particularly in the field of underactuated robotics. Underactuated robots are those that have fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom, making them inherently unstable and challenging to control. The simple pendulum is a classic example of an underactuated system, and its study has been a cornerstone in the development of nonlinear dynamics theory.

In this chapter, we will delve into the nonlinear dynamics of the simple pendulum, exploring its complex behavior and the mathematical models that describe it. We will begin by introducing the basic concepts of the simple pendulum, including its degrees of freedom and the forces acting upon it. We will then move on to discuss the nonlinear dynamics of the pendulum, focusing on the pendulum's motion in the presence of small perturbations.

The study of the simple pendulum is not just of theoretical interest. It has practical applications in various fields, including robotics, control systems, and mechanical engineering. Understanding the nonlinear dynamics of the simple pendulum can provide insights into the behavior of more complex underactuated systems, leading to the development of more effective control strategies.

Throughout this chapter, we will use the popular Markdown format to present our content, with math equations rendered using the MathJax library. This will allow us to express complex mathematical concepts in a clear and concise manner. For example, we might write inline math like `$y_j(n)$` and equations like `$$
\Delta w = ...
$$`.

In the following sections, we will explore the nonlinear dynamics of the simple pendulum in more detail, starting with an overview of the pendulum's basic dynamics.




#### 1.1a Grid World Example

In this section, we will explore the concept of dynamic programming and value iteration through a grid world example. This example will help us understand the principles of these algorithms and their applications in underactuated robotics.

##### Grid World

The grid world is a simple environment where an agent moves from one location to another. The agent's goal is to reach a designated target location while avoiding obstacles. The environment is represented as a grid, with each location on the grid representing a possible state for the agent.

##### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. In the context of the grid world, the agent's problem can be broken down into a series of subproblems, each representing the agent's decision at a particular location.

The agent's goal is to find the optimal path from the starting location to the target location. This can be represented as a function $V(s)$, where $s$ is the state (location) on the grid. The function $V(s)$ represents the maximum value that the agent can achieve from state $s$.

The dynamic programming algorithm iteratively updates the function $V(s)$ until it converges to the optimal value. The algorithm starts with an initial guess for the function $V(s)$, and then iteratively updates it using the Bellman equation:

$$
V(s) = \max_{a \in A} \left\{ r(s,a) + \gamma \sum_{s' \in S} p(s'|s,a) V(s') \right\}
$$

where $A$ is the set of actions available at state $s$, $r(s,a)$ is the reward associated with taking action $a$ at state $s$, $\gamma$ is the discount factor, and $p(s'|s,a)$ is the transition probability from state $s$ to state $s'$ when taking action $a$.

##### Value Iteration

Value iteration is a specific type of dynamic programming algorithm. It starts with an initial guess for the function $V(s)$, and then iteratively updates it until it converges to the optimal value. The algorithm terminates when the function $V(s)$ no longer changes between iterations.

The value iteration algorithm can be represented as follows:

1. Initialize $V(s) = 0$ for all states $s$.
2. Repeat until convergence:
    1. For each state $s$, calculate the right-hand side of the Bellman equation.
    2. Set $V(s) = \max(V(s), \text{right-hand side of the Bellman equation})$.
3. Return $V(s)$.

##### Application to Underactuated Robotics

The principles of dynamic programming and value iteration can be applied to the control of underactuated robots. The robot's problem can be represented as a grid world, where each location on the grid represents a possible state for the robot. The robot's goal is to reach a designated target state while avoiding obstacles.

The dynamic programming algorithm can be used to find the optimal control policy for the robot, i.e., the sequence of control actions that maximizes the robot's performance. The value iteration algorithm can be used to find the optimal control policy in a more efficient manner.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the application of these algorithms in underactuated robotics, focusing on the control of the simple pendulum.

#### 1.1b Solving the Pendulum Equation

The pendulum equation is a second-order differential equation that describes the motion of a pendulum. It is given by:

$$
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \frac{g}{l} \sin(\theta) = 0
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle of the pendulum from the vertical, $t$ is time, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $l$ is the length of the pendulum.

The pendulum equation is a nonlinear differential equation, and it is not possible to solve it analytically for most initial conditions. However, it can be solved numerically using methods such as Euler's method or the Runge-Kutta method.

##### Euler's Method

Euler's method is a simple numerical method for solving ordinary differential equations. It is based on the idea of approximating the derivative of a function at a point by the slope of the tangent line at that point.

The Euler's method for solving the pendulum equation is given by:

$$
\theta(t + h) = \theta(t) + h \frac{d\theta}{dt}
$$

where $h$ is the time step, and $\frac{d\theta}{dt}$ is the derivative of the angle $\theta$ with respect to time.

The Euler's method is easy to implement and understand, but it is not very accurate. The error of the method is proportional to the square of the time step $h$.

##### Runge-Kutta Method

The Runge-Kutta method is a family of numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations. It is based on the idea of approximating the derivative of a function at a point by a weighted average of the function values at several points.

The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for solving the pendulum equation is given by:

$$
k_1 = h \frac{d\theta}{dt}(t_n), \quad k_2 = \frac{k_1}{2}, \quad k_3 = h \frac{d\theta}{dt}(t_n + k_2), \quad k_4 = \frac{k_3}{2}, \quad \theta(t_{n+1}) = \theta(t_n) + \frac{1}{6}(k_1 + 4k_2 + k_3 + k_4)
$$

where $k_1$ and $k_3$ are the slopes of the tangent lines at the points $t_n$ and $t_n + k_2$, respectively, and $k_2$ and $k_4$ are the slopes of the tangent lines at the points $t_n + k_2$ and $t_n + k_3$, respectively.

The Runge-Kutta method is more accurate than the Euler's method, but it is also more complex to implement. The error of the method is proportional to the cube of the time step $h$.

In the next section, we will discuss how to use these numerical methods to solve the pendulum equation for different initial conditions and parameters.

#### 1.1c Applications in Robotics

The principles of dynamic programming and value iteration have found extensive applications in the field of robotics, particularly in the control of underactuated robots. Underactuation refers to the condition where the number of actuators (controllable joints) is less than the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) of the robot. This is often the case in robots with redundant DOF, where the extra DOF can be used to improve the robot's performance or to compensate for uncertainties in the system.

##### Underactuated Robotics

In underactuated robotics, the control problem can be formulated as a dynamic programming or value iteration problem. The state space of the robot is defined by the configuration of the robot's joints, and the control problem is to find a control policy that maximizes the robot's performance.

The pendulum equation, which describes the motion of a pendulum, is a common model used in underactuated robotics. The pendulum equation is a nonlinear differential equation, and it is not possible to solve it analytically for most initial conditions. However, it can be solved numerically using methods such as Euler's method or the Runge-Kutta method, as discussed in the previous section.

##### Applications in Robotics

The principles of dynamic programming and value iteration have been applied to a wide range of problems in robotics. For example, they have been used to develop control policies for underactuated robots that can perform complex tasks such as walking, running, and jumping. They have also been used to develop control policies for robots that can adapt to changes in the environment or in the robot's own dynamics.

In addition, the principles of dynamic programming and value iteration have been applied to problems in robot learning and decision making. For example, they have been used to develop algorithms for robot learning from demonstrations, where the robot learns a task by observing a human perform the task. They have also been used to develop algorithms for robot decision making under uncertainty, where the robot makes decisions based on probabilistic models of the environment.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the application of these principles in the control of underactuated robots.




#### 1.1b Double Integrator Example

In this section, we will explore the application of dynamic programming and value iteration in a double integrator system. The double integrator is a simple yet powerful system that is often used to model the dynamics of many physical systems, including robots.

##### Double Integrator System

The double integrator system is a second-order system that can be described by the following differential equation:

$$
\ddot{x} = u
$$

where $x$ is the position of the system, $\dot{x}$ is the velocity, $\ddot{x}$ is the acceleration, and $u$ is the control input. The goal of the control system is to drive the system from an initial state $(x_0, \dot{x}_0)$ to a final state $(x_f, \dot{x}_f)$ in a minimum amount of time while satisfying certain constraints on the control input $u$.

##### Dynamic Programming and Value Iteration in the Double Integrator System

The double integrator system can be formulated as a dynamic programming problem. The state of the system is represented by the pair $(x, \dot{x})$, and the control input $u$ is the decision variable. The goal is to find the optimal control policy that minimizes the time to reach the final state while satisfying the constraints on the control input.

The dynamic programming algorithm can be used to solve this problem. The state space of the system is discretized into a grid, and the value function $V(x, \dot{x})$ is defined as the minimum time to reach the final state from the current state. The algorithm then iteratively updates the value function until it converges to the optimal value.

Value iteration is another method that can be used to solve this problem. It starts with an initial guess for the value function and iteratively updates it until it converges to the optimal value. The update rule for value iteration is given by:

$$
V^{(k+1)}(x, \dot{x}) = \min_{u} \left\{ \dot{x} + \Delta t V^{(k)}(x', \dot{x}') \mid u \right\}
$$

where $x'$ and $\dot{x}'$ are the next state and velocity, respectively, and $\Delta t$ is the time step.

In the next section, we will explore the application of these methods in a more complex system, the simple pendulum.




#### 1.1c Pendulum Example

The pendulum is a classic example in physics and engineering, and it is also a fundamental system in the study of underactuated robotics. The pendulum is a simple system with a single degree of freedom, yet it exhibits complex dynamics due to its nonlinear nature. In this section, we will explore the dynamics of the pendulum and how dynamic programming and value iteration can be used to control it.

##### The Pendulum System

The pendulum system is a simple mechanical system consisting of a mass attached to a string or rod of length $\ell$. The pendulum is free to rotate around the pivot point, and the goal is to control the pendulum to a desired orientation. The dynamics of the pendulum can be described by the following differential equation:

$$
\ddot{\theta} = -\frac{g}{\ell} \sin(\theta)
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle of the pendulum from the vertical, $\dot{\theta}$ is the angular velocity, and $\ddot{\theta}$ is the angular acceleration. The control input is the angular velocity $\dot{\theta}$, and the goal is to drive the pendulum from an initial state $(\theta_0, \dot{\theta}_0)$ to a final state $(\theta_f, \dot{\theta}_f)$ in a minimum amount of time while satisfying certain constraints on the control input.

##### Dynamic Programming and Value Iteration in the Pendulum System

The pendulum system can be formulated as a dynamic programming problem. The state of the system is represented by the pair $(\theta, \dot{\theta})$, and the control input $\dot{\theta}$ is the decision variable. The goal is to find the optimal control policy that minimizes the time to reach the final state while satisfying the constraints on the control input.

The dynamic programming algorithm can be used to solve this problem. The state space of the system is discretized into a grid, and the value function $V(\theta, \dot{\theta})$ is defined as the minimum time to reach the final state from the current state. The algorithm then iteratively updates the value function until it converges to the optimal value.

Value iteration is another method that can be used to solve this problem. It starts with an initial guess for the value function and iteratively updates it until it converges to the optimal value. The update rule for value iteration is given by:

$$
V^{(k+1)}(\theta, \dot{\theta}) = \min_{\dot{\theta}} \left\{ \dot{\theta} + \Delta t V^{(k)}(\theta', \dot{\theta}') \mid \dot{\theta} \right\}
$$

where $\theta'$ and $\dot{\theta}'$ are the next state and control input, respectively.

In the next section, we will explore the application of these methods in controlling the pendulum to a desired orientation.




#### 1.2a Controllability

The controllability of a system is a fundamental concept in control theory. It refers to the ability of an external input to move the system from any initial state to any final state in a finite time period. In the context of underactuated robotics, controllability is a crucial property that allows us to control the system's behavior.

##### Controllability of the Acrobot

The Acrobot is a classic example of an underactuated robot. It consists of a pendulum attached to a rotating joint, and the goal is to control the pendulum to a desired orientation. The dynamics of the Acrobot can be described by the following differential equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
\ddot{\theta} &= \frac{g}{l} \sin(\theta) - \frac{u}{J} \cos(\theta) \\
\ddot{\phi} &= \frac{u}{I}
\end{align*}
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle of the pendulum from the vertical, $\dot{\theta}$ is the angular velocity, $\ddot{\theta}$ is the angular acceleration, $\phi$ is the angle of the rotating joint, $\dot{\phi}$ is the angular velocity, $\ddot{\phi}$ is the angular acceleration, $u$ is the control input, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $l$ is the length of the pendulum, $J$ is the moment of inertia of the pendulum, and $I$ is the moment of inertia of the rotating joint.

The controllability of the Acrobot can be analyzed using the concept of relative degree. The relative degree of a system is the number of integrators in its internal model. For the Acrobot, the relative degree is 2, indicating that the system has two integrators. This means that the system is not directly controllable, as the control input $u$ does not directly affect the state of the system. However, the system is still controllable if we can find a control law that can compensate for the lack of direct controllability.

##### Controllability of the Cart-Pole

The Cart-Pole is another classic example of an underactuated robot. It consists of a cart moving along a horizontal track with a pendulum attached to it, and the goal is to control the pendulum to a desired orientation. The dynamics of the Cart-Pole can be described by the following differential equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
\ddot{x} &= u \\
\ddot{\theta} &= \frac{g}{l} \sin(\theta) - \frac{u}{ml} \cos(\theta)
\end{align*}
$$

where $x$ is the position of the cart, $\dot{x}$ is the velocity of the cart, $\ddot{x}$ is the acceleration of the cart, $\theta$ is the angle of the pendulum from the vertical, $\dot{\theta}$ is the angular velocity, $\ddot{\theta}$ is the angular acceleration, $u$ is the control input, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $l$ is the length of the pendulum, $m$ is the mass of the pendulum, and $J$ is the moment of inertia of the pendulum.

The controllability of the Cart-Pole can be analyzed using the concept of relative degree. The relative degree of the Cart-Pole is also 2, indicating that the system is not directly controllable. However, the system is still controllable if we can find a control law that can compensate for the lack of direct controllability.

In the next section, we will explore some control strategies for underactuated robots, including the use of feedback linearization and backstepping.

#### 1.2b Stability

Stability is another crucial concept in the study of underactuated robots. It refers to the ability of a system to return to a state of equilibrium after being disturbed. In the context of underactuated robotics, stability is a desirable property that allows us to control the system's behavior in the presence of disturbances.

##### Stability of the Acrobot

The stability of the Acrobot can be analyzed using the concept of Lyapunov stability. Lyapunov stability is a mathematical concept that describes the behavior of a system around its equilibrium points. For the Acrobot, the equilibrium point is when the pendulum is upright, i.e., $\theta = 0$.

The stability of the Acrobot can be determined by finding a Lyapunov function $V(\theta, \dot{\theta})$ that satisfies the following conditions:

1. $V(\theta, \dot{\theta}) \geq 0$ for all $\theta, \dot{\theta}$
2. $V(\theta, \dot{\theta}) = 0$ if and only if $\theta = 0$ and $\dot{\theta} = 0$
3. $\dot{V}(\theta, \dot{\theta}) = \frac{\partial V}{\partial \theta} \dot{\theta} + \frac{\partial V}{\partial \dot{\theta}} \ddot{\theta} \leq 0$ for all $\theta, \dot{\theta}$

If such a Lyapunov function $V(\theta, \dot{\theta})$ can be found, then the Acrobot is Lyapunov stable. This means that the Acrobot will return to the upright position after being disturbed, provided that the disturbance is not too large.

##### Stability of the Cart-Pole

The stability of the Cart-Pole can be analyzed in a similar manner. The equilibrium point for the Cart-Pole is when the pendulum is upright and the cart is at rest, i.e., $\theta = 0$ and $\dot{x} = 0$.

The stability of the Cart-Pole can be determined by finding a Lyapunov function $V(x, \theta, \dot{x}, \dot{\theta})$ that satisfies the following conditions:

1. $V(x, \theta, \dot{x}, \dot{\theta}) \geq 0$ for all $x, \theta, \dot{x}, \dot{\theta}$
2. $V(x, \theta, \dot{x}, \dot{\theta}) = 0$ if and only if $x = 0$, $\theta = 0$, $\dot{x} = 0$, and $\dot{\theta} = 0$
3. $\dot{V}(x, \theta, \dot{x}, \dot{\theta}) = \frac{\partial V}{\partial x} \dot{x} + \frac{\partial V}{\partial \theta} \dot{\theta} + \frac{\partial V}{\partial \dot{x}} \ddot{x} + \frac{\partial V}{\partial \dot{\theta}} \ddot{\theta} \leq 0$ for all $x, \theta, \dot{x}, \dot{\theta}$

If such a Lyapunov function $V(x, \theta, \dot{x}, \dot{\theta})$ can be found, then the Cart-Pole is Lyapunov stable. This means that the Cart-Pole will return to the upright position after being disturbed, provided that the disturbance is not too large.

In the next section, we will explore some control strategies for underactuated robots, including the use of feedback linearization and backstepping.

#### 1.2c Applications

The Acrobot and Cart-Pole systems have been extensively studied in the field of underactuated robotics due to their inherent complexity and the challenges they pose in terms of control and stability. These systems have found applications in a variety of fields, including robotics, control theory, and biomechanics.

##### Acrobot Applications

The Acrobot system, with its two degrees of freedom, has been used to study a wide range of topics in underactuated robotics. One of the most significant applications of the Acrobot is in the field of biomechanics. The Acrobot's pendulum-like motion is similar to that of a human arm, making it a useful model for studying the dynamics of human movement. This has led to the development of control strategies for the Acrobot that mimic the natural movements of a human arm, providing insights into the mechanics of human locomotion.

In addition to biomechanics, the Acrobot has also been used in the development of control algorithms for underactuated robots. The Acrobot's controllability and stability properties have been studied extensively, leading to the development of control strategies that can handle the system's nonlinearities and uncertainties. These control strategies have been applied to a variety of underactuated robots, demonstrating their effectiveness in real-world applications.

##### Cart-Pole Applications

The Cart-Pole system, with its single degree of freedom, has also found a wide range of applications. One of the most significant applications of the Cart-Pole is in the field of control theory. The Cart-Pole's inherent instability makes it a challenging system to control, requiring the development of advanced control strategies. This has led to the development of control algorithms that can handle the system's nonlinearities and uncertainties, providing insights into the theory of control.

In addition to control theory, the Cart-Pole has also been used in the study of human balance and stability. The Cart-Pole's unstable dynamics are similar to those of a human standing on one leg, making it a useful model for studying the mechanics of human balance. This has led to the development of control strategies for the Cart-Pole that mimic the natural movements of a human standing on one leg, providing insights into the mechanics of human balance.

In conclusion, the Acrobot and Cart-Pole systems, with their inherent complexity and challenges, have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of underactuated robotics. Their applications in biomechanics, control theory, and human balance have provided valuable insights into the theory and applications of underactuated robotics.

## Chapter: Chapter 2: Underactuated Robotics:

### Introduction

In the realm of robotics, the concept of underactuation plays a pivotal role. This chapter, "Underactuated Robotics," delves into the intricacies of underactuation, its implications, and the unique challenges it presents in the field of robotics. 

Underactuation refers to the state of a robot where the number of actuators is less than the number of degrees of freedom. This is often the case in many robotic systems, especially those designed for complex tasks in unstructured environments. The underactuation can lead to a phenomenon known as kinematic redundancy, which can be both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it allows for a greater range of motion and adaptability, but on the other hand, it can make the control of the robot more challenging.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental principles of underactuated robotics, starting with the basic concepts of actuators, degrees of freedom, and kinematic redundancy. We will then delve into the challenges of controlling underactuated robots, including the issues of stability, controllability, and robustness. We will also discuss various control strategies and techniques that have been developed to address these challenges.

We will also explore the applications of underactuated robotics in various fields, including manufacturing, healthcare, and space exploration. The chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art in underactuated robotics, highlighting the latest research and developments in the field.

This chapter aims to provide a solid foundation for understanding the principles and applications of underactuated robotics. It is designed to be accessible to both students and professionals in the field, with a balance of theoretical explanations and practical examples. Whether you are a seasoned researcher or a student just starting out in the field, this chapter will provide you with the knowledge and tools you need to navigate the complex world of underactuated robotics.




#### 1.2b Partial Feedback Linearization

Partial Feedback Linearization (PFL) is a powerful technique used in control theory to linearize a nonlinear system around an operating point. This technique is particularly useful in the context of underactuated robotics, where the system dynamics are often nonlinear and complex.

##### Partial Feedback Linearization of the Acrobot

The Acrobot, as we have seen, is a nonlinear system with a relative degree of 2. This means that the system is not directly controllable, but it is still controllable if we can find a control law that can compensate for the lack of direct controllability. Partial Feedback Linearization provides a way to approximate the system dynamics around an operating point, making it easier to design a control law.

The PFL of the Acrobot can be done by linearizing the system around an operating point. This involves approximating the nonlinear functions in the system dynamics with their first-order Taylor series expansions. The resulting linear system can then be used to design a control law.

The PFL of the Acrobot can be written as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\ddot{\theta} &\approx \frac{g}{l} \sin(\theta) - \frac{u}{J} \cos(\theta) + \frac{1}{2} \frac{g}{l} \sin(2\theta) - \frac{1}{2} \frac{u}{J} \cos(2\theta) \\
\ddot{\phi} &\approx \frac{u}{I} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{u}{I} \cos(2\phi)
\end{align*}
$$

where $\theta$ and $\phi$ are the states, $u$ is the control input, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $l$ is the length of the pendulum, $J$ is the moment of inertia of the pendulum, and $I$ is the moment of inertia of the rotating joint.

## Chapter: Chapter 2: Underactuated Systems

### Introduction

In the realm of robotics, the concept of underactuation plays a pivotal role. Underactuation refers to the condition where a system has fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom it possesses. This chapter, "Underactuated Systems," delves into the intricacies of these systems, exploring their unique characteristics, challenges, and potential solutions.

Underactuated systems are ubiquitous in robotics, from simple toys to complex industrial robots. They are often designed this way to reduce cost, size, and power consumption. However, the reduction in actuators also leads to a reduction in the system's controllability, which can pose significant challenges for control engineers.

In this chapter, we will explore the mathematical models that describe underactuated systems. We will learn how to derive these models from the system's physical parameters and how to use them to analyze the system's behavior. We will also discuss the concept of passivity, a key property of many underactuated systems, and how it can be leveraged for control design.

We will also delve into the control strategies for underactuated systems. We will learn about the challenges of controlling these systems and the various techniques that can be used to overcome these challenges. These techniques include the use of feedback linearization, sliding mode control, and passivity-based control.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of underactuated systems, their mathematical models, and the control strategies used to control them. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the more advanced topics covered in the subsequent chapters of this book.

## Chapter: Chapter 2: Introduction to Underactuated Robotics

### Introduction

Welcome to Chapter 2 of "Underactuated Robotics: Theory and Applications". This chapter serves as an introduction to the fascinating world of underactuated robotics. Underactuation is a fundamental concept in robotics, and it is the key to understanding the complex dynamics of robotic systems. 

Underactuation refers to the condition where the number of actuators (devices that cause motion) in a robotic system is less than the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) (the minimum number of independent coordinates required to describe the position and orientation of an object). This condition is often encountered in real-world robotics, where the cost and complexity of adding more actuators can be prohibitive.

In this chapter, we will explore the theory behind underactuation, delving into the mathematical models that describe the behavior of underactuated robots. We will also discuss the practical applications of underactuation, demonstrating how this concept can be used to design and control robots in a variety of settings.

We will begin by introducing the basic concepts of underactuation, including the definitions of actuators and degrees of freedom. We will then move on to discuss the mathematical models used to describe the dynamics of underactuated robots. These models will be presented in a clear and accessible manner, using the popular Markdown format.

Next, we will explore the practical applications of underactuation. We will discuss how underactuation can be used to design and control robots in a variety of settings, from industrial automation to space exploration. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of underactuation, and how these can be addressed.

Finally, we will conclude this chapter by summarizing the key points covered and providing a roadmap for the rest of the book. We hope that this chapter will provide a solid foundation for your understanding of underactuated robotics, and that it will spark your interest in this exciting field.

The theory of underactuated robotics has found numerous applications in the field of robotics. These applications range from simple tasks such as balancing a pendulum to complex tasks such as walking and running. In this section, we will explore some of these applications in more detail.

##### Balancing a Pendulum

One of the most common applications of underactuated robotics is in balancing a pendulum. The pendulum is a classic example of an underactuated system, as it has more degrees of freedom than actuators. The challenge is to design a control law that can stabilize the pendulum in the upright position.

The challenge is to design a control law that can generate natural-looking walking and running motions.

The gradient descent method, as discussed in the previous section, can be used to solve this problem. The control law is updated iteratively in the direction of the steepest descent of the cost function, which represents the desired walking or running motion. The update is typically performed using the gradient of the cost function with respect to the control law.

##### Other Applications

The theory of underactuated robotics has also found applications in other areas such as grasping and manipulation, obstacle avoidance, and bipedal locomotion. In these areas, the challenge is to design a control law that can handle the complexities of the task while satisfying various constraints.

The stochastic gradient descent method, as discussed in the previous section, can be used to solve these problems. The control law is updated iteratively in the direction of the steepest descent of the expected reward, which represents the desired task outcome. The update is typically performed using the stochastic gradient of the expected reward with respect to the control law.

In conclusion, the theory of underactuated robotics provides a powerful framework for designing control laws for a wide range of applications in robotics. The key is to understand the dynamics of the system and to use appropriate optimization techniques to solve the associated optimization problems.




#### 1.4a Rimless Wheel

The rimless wheel is a simple walking model that has been extensively studied in the field of underactuated robotics. It is a mechanical system that consists of a wheel without a rim, which is free to rotate around its axle. The wheel is actuated by an external force applied to its center, and its motion is constrained by a spring attached to its axle.

The rimless wheel is a classic example of an underactuated system, as it has more degrees of freedom (DOF) than actuators. This means that the system is not fully controllable, and its behavior can be complex and nonlinear. However, the simplicity of the system makes it an ideal model for studying the principles of underactuated robotics.

##### Dynamics of the Rimless Wheel

The dynamics of the rimless wheel can be described by a set of nonlinear differential equations. These equations describe the motion of the wheel, taking into account the effects of the external force, the spring force, and the friction at the axle.

The equations of motion for the rimless wheel can be written as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\tau &= I \ddot{\theta} + b \dot{\theta} + k \theta \\
F &= m \ddot{x} + b \dot{x} + k x
\end{align*}
$$

where $\tau$ is the external torque applied to the wheel, $I$ is the moment of inertia of the wheel, $b$ is the damping coefficient, $k$ is the spring constant, $F$ is the external force applied to the wheel, $m$ is the mass of the wheel, $x$ is the position of the wheel, and $v$ is its velocity.

##### Control of the Rimless Wheel

The control of the rimless wheel is a challenging problem due to its underactuation. The wheel can be controlled by applying an external torque to its center, but this torque cannot control all the degrees of freedom of the system. This means that the wheel can exhibit complex behaviors, such as oscillations and instability, which can be difficult to predict and control.

One approach to controlling the rimless wheel is through the use of feedback control. In this approach, the external torque is adjusted based on the current state of the wheel, using a control law that is designed to stabilize the system. This approach can be effective, but it requires a good understanding of the system dynamics and the ability to measure the state of the wheel accurately.

Another approach is through the use of open-loop control. In this approach, the external torque is predetermined based on a desired trajectory for the wheel. This approach can be simpler to implement, but it requires a good understanding of the system dynamics and the ability to predict the behavior of the wheel accurately.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the applications of the rimless wheel model in underactuated robotics.

##### The Simple Bipedal Walker

The simple bipedal walker is a model of a bipedal robot that is often used in the study of bipedal walking. It consists of two legs connected to a torso by two joints, with a single actuator at each joint. The legs are free to move in the sagittal plane, and the robot is assumed to be in a stable upright position.

The dynamics of the simple bipedal walker can be described by a set of nonlinear differential equations. These equations describe the motion of the robot, taking into account the effects of the external forces, the joint torques, and the friction at the joints.

The equations of motion for the simple bipedal walker can be written as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\tau_1 &= I_1 \ddot{\theta}_1 + b_1 \dot{\theta}_1 + k_1 \theta_1 \\
\tau_2 &= I_2 \ddot{\theta}_2 + b_2 \dot{\theta}_2 + k_2 \theta_2 \\
F &= m \ddot{x} + b \dot{x} + k x
\end{align*}
$$

where $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ are the joint torques, $I_1$ and $I_2$ are the moments of inertia of the joints, $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the damping coefficients, $k_1$ and $k_2$ are the spring constants, $F$ is the external force applied to the robot, $m$ is the mass of the robot, $x$ is the position of the robot, and $v$ is its velocity.

##### Control of the Simple Bipedal Walker

##### Control of the Simple Quadrupedal Walker

## Chapter: Chapter 2: Underactuated Robotics:

### Introduction

In the realm of robotics, the concept of underactuation plays a pivotal role. This chapter, "Underactuated Robotics," delves into the intricacies of underactuation, its implications, and its applications in the field of robotics. 

Underactuation, in essence, refers to the state of a system where the number of actuators is less than the number of degrees of freedom. This phenomenon is inherent in many robotic systems, particularly those that are designed to mimic the movements of animals or humans. The underactuation allows these systems to exhibit complex and natural-looking movements, which is a key aspect of their functionality and appeal.

However, underactuation also presents a set of unique challenges. The reduced number of actuators means that the system is not fully controllable, leading to complex and often nonlinear dynamics. This can make the design and control of underactuated robots a complex task. 

In this chapter, we will explore these aspects in detail. We will start by discussing the basic principles of underactuation, including its definition and implications. We will then delve into the mathematical models that describe the dynamics of underactuated systems, using the popular Markdown format for clarity and ease of understanding. 

We will also discuss various control strategies for underactuated robots, including feedback control and open-loop control. These strategies aim to mitigate the challenges posed by underactuation, and we will explore how they can be implemented in practice.

Finally, we will look at some practical applications of underactuated robotics, demonstrating the potential of this field in areas such as biomimetic robotics and human-robot interaction.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to underactuated robotics, suitable for both students and researchers in the field. Whether you are new to the field or looking to deepen your understanding, we hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource.




#### 1.4c Kneed Compass Gait

The Kneed Compass Gait is a variation of the Compass Gait that introduces an additional degree of freedom. This model is particularly useful for studying the effects of underactuation and the challenges of control in a more complex system.

##### Dynamics of the Kneed Compass Gait

The Kneed Compass Gait consists of a compass-like structure with two pendulums attached to its arms, similar to the Compass Gait. However, in this model, the pendulums are connected by a hinge at the knee, allowing for relative rotation between the two pendulums. This introduces an additional degree of freedom, making the system even more underactuated.

The dynamics of the Kneed Compass Gait can be described by a set of nonlinear differential equations. These equations describe the motion of the pendulums, taking into account the effects of the external force, the pendulum lengths, the friction at the pivots, and the relative rotation between the pendulums.

The equations of motion for the Kneed Compass Gait can be written as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\tau &= I \ddot{\theta} + b \dot{\theta} + k \theta \\
F &= m \ddot{x} + b \dot{x} + k x \\
T &= J \ddot{\phi} + b \dot{\phi} + k \phi
\end{align*}
$$

where $\tau$ is the external torque applied to the compass, $I$ is the moment of inertia of the compass, $b$ is the damping coefficient, $k$ is the spring constant, $F$ is the external force applied to the compass, $m$ is the mass of the compass, $x$ is the position of the compass, $v$ is its velocity, $T$ is the torque applied to the knee, $J$ is the moment of inertia of the knee, and $\phi$ is the relative rotation between the pendulums.

##### Control of the Kneed Compass Gait

The control of the Kneed Compass Gait is a challenging problem due to its increased underactuation. The compass can be controlled by applying an external torque to its center, but this torque cannot control all the degrees of freedom of the system. This means that the compass can exhibit complex behaviors, such as oscillations and instability, which can be difficult to predict and control.

One approach to controlling the Kneed Compass Gait is through the use of a feedback control law. This control law can be designed to control the position and velocity of the compass, as well as the relative rotation between the pendulums. However, due to the nonlinearities and uncertainties in the system, the design of such a control law can be a challenging task.

Another approach is to use a sliding mode control law, which can handle the nonlinearities and uncertainties in the system. This control law can be designed to drive the system to a desired sliding surface, where it remains for all future time. However, the design of such a control law can also be a challenging task, and the performance of the system can be affected by the choice of the sliding surface.

In conclusion, the Kneed Compass Gait is a complex and challenging system for the study of underactuated robotics. Its dynamics and control present many interesting and challenging problems, making it a valuable model for research and education in this field.




#### 1.5a Introduction to Feedback Control

Feedback control is a fundamental concept in control theory that is used to regulate the behavior of a system. It involves the use of feedback, which is the process of taking a portion of the output of a system and feeding it back into the system as an input. This feedback signal can be used to adjust the system's input in order to control its output.

Feedback control is particularly useful in systems that are subject to disturbances or uncertainties. By using feedback, the system can adjust its behavior in response to these disturbances, allowing it to maintain stability and achieve its desired output.

In the context of underactuated robotics, feedback control can be used to stabilize and control the motion of the robot. This is particularly important in systems with a large number of degrees of freedom, where direct control of all the degrees of freedom may not be feasible.

#### 1.5b Feedback Control for Simple Walking Models

In the previous section, we introduced the Kneed Compass Gait, a model of a walking robot with two pendulums connected by a hinge at the knee. This model is particularly challenging due to its increased underactuation. However, feedback control can be used to stabilize and control the motion of the robot, even in the presence of disturbances.

The feedback control law for the Kneed Compass Gait can be designed using the principles of backstepping. Backstepping is a recursive procedure that can be used to stabilize a system with multiple integrators. In the case of the Kneed Compass Gait, the backstepping procedure can be used to stabilize the multiple-integrator system formed by the two pendulums.

The backstepping procedure involves designing a control law that stabilizes the upper single-integrator subsystem, and then using this control law to stabilize the lower single-integrator subsystem. This recursive procedure can be extended to handle any finite number of integrators, making it a powerful tool for stabilizing and controlling the motion of the Kneed Compass Gait.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the application of feedback control for simple walking models, and explore the use of higher-order sinusoidal input describing functions for nonlinear controller design.

This model is particularly challenging due to its increased underactuation. However, feedback control can be used to stabilize and control the motion of the robot, even in the presence of disturbances.

The feedback control law for the Kneed Compass Gait can be designed using the principles of backstepping. Backstepping is a recursive procedure that can be used to stabilize a system with multiple integrators. In the case of the Kneed Compass Gait, the backstepping procedure can be used to stabilize the multiple-integrator system formed by the two pendulums.

The backstepping procedure involves designing a control law that stabilizes the upper single-integrator subsystem, and then using this control law to stabilize the lower single-integrator subsystem. This recursive procedure can be extended to handle any finite number of integrators. This claim can be formally proved with mathematical induction. Here, a stabilized multiple-integrator system is built up from subsystems of already-stabilized multiple-integrator subsystems.

The backstepping procedure can be applied to the Kneed Compass Gait as follows:

1. The upper single-integrator subsystem is stabilized by designing a control law that ensures the system's stability. This control law is given by:

$$
u_1 = -k_1 \dot{\theta} - b_1 \dot{\theta} - k_1 \theta
$$

where $k_1$ and $b_1$ are positive constants.

2. The lower single-integrator subsystem is then stabilized by using the control law designed for the upper subsystem. This control law is given by:

$$
u_2 = -k_2 \dot{\phi} - b_2 \dot{\phi} - k_2 \phi
$$

where $k_2$ and $b_2$ are positive constants.

This recursive procedure can be extended to handle any finite number of integrators. The resulting control law ensures the stability of the Kneed Compass Gait, even in the presence of disturbances.

In the next section, we will explore the application of higher-order sinusoidal input describing functions for nonlinear controller design.

In this section, we will explore some specific applications of these concepts in walking models.

##### Application 1: Stabilizing the Kneed Compass Gait

$$
u_2 = -k_2 \dot{\phi} - b_2 \dot{\phi} - k_2 \phi
$$

where $k_2$ and $b_2$ are positive constants.

This recursive procedure can be extended to handle any finite number of integrators. The resulting control law ensures the stability of the Kneed Compass Gait, even in the presence of disturbances.

##### Application 2: Nonlinear Controller Design

The application of higher-order sinusoidal input describing functions (HOSIDFs) in nonlinear controller design is another important application in walking models. The HOSIDFs provide a natural extension of the widely used sinusoidal describing functions in case nonlinearities cannot be neglected. They are intuitive in their identification and interpretation, and they provide a tool to provide on-site testing during system design.

In the context of walking models, the HOSIDFs can be used to design nonlinear controllers that can handle the complex dynamics of the system. This is particularly useful in systems with a large number of degrees of freedom, where traditional linear control techniques may not be sufficient.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the application of HOSIDFs in nonlinear controller design for walking models.

## Chapter: Chapter 2: Introduction to Underactuation

### Introduction

In the realm of robotics, the concept of underactuation is a fundamental one. It is a term that is used to describe a system where the number of actuators is less than the number of degrees of freedom. This chapter, "Introduction to Underactuation," aims to delve into the intricacies of this concept, providing a comprehensive understanding of its implications and applications in the field of robotics.

Underactuation is a critical aspect of robotics, particularly in the design and control of robots. It is a concept that is deeply intertwined with the principles of kinematics and dynamics, and it plays a pivotal role in determining the capabilities and limitations of a robot. Underactuation can lead to challenges in controlling the robot, but it also opens up opportunities for innovative solutions and design choices.

In this chapter, we will explore the mathematical models that describe underactuation, and we will discuss the implications of underactuation on the control and design of robots. We will also delve into the strategies and techniques used to manage underactuation, and we will examine the role of underactuation in the development of robust and efficient robots.

We will also discuss the concept of underactuation in the context of underactuated robotics, a field that deals with robots that have fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom. This field is of particular interest due to its potential for simplifying the design and control of robots, and due to its potential for enabling the development of robots with complex and natural-like movements.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the concept of underactuation, and they should be able to apply this understanding to the design and control of robots. They should also be able to understand the role of underactuation in the development of underactuated robotics.

This chapter serves as a stepping stone into the fascinating world of underactuation, a world that is filled with challenges and opportunities, and a world that is at the forefront of the advancement of robotics.




#### 1.5b Feedback Control Techniques

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of feedback control and its application in stabilizing and controlling the motion of a simple walking model. In this section, we will delve deeper into the various feedback control techniques that can be used in underactuated robotics.

##### Higher-order Sinusoidal Input Describing Function (HOSIDF)

The Higher-order Sinusoidal Input Describing Function (HOSIDF) is a powerful tool for analyzing and controlling nonlinear systems. It is particularly useful in underactuated robotics, where the system dynamics may be nonlinear and complex.

The HOSIDF is advantageous both when a nonlinear model is already identified and when no model is known yet. It requires little model assumptions and can easily be identified while requiring no advanced mathematical tools. Moreover, even when a model is already identified, the analysis of the HOSIDFs often yields significant advantages over the use of the identified nonlinear model.

The HOSIDF provides a natural extension of the widely used sinusoidal describing functions in case nonlinearities cannot be neglected. In practice, the HOSIDFs have two distinct applications: Due to their ease of identification, HOSIDFs provide a tool to provide on-site testing during system design. Finally, the application of HOSIDFs to (nonlinear) controller design for nonlinear systems is shown to yield significant advantages over conventional time domain based tuning.

##### Extended Kalman Filter

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is another powerful tool for controlling nonlinear systems. It is an extension of the Kalman filter, which is used for state estimation in linear systems. The EKF linearizes the system dynamics and measurement equations around the current state estimate, and then applies the standard Kalman filter to these linearized equations.

The EKF is particularly useful in underactuated robotics, where the system dynamics may be nonlinear and complex. It provides a way to estimate the system state, which can then be used for control.

The EKF is defined by the following equations:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) \quad \mathbf{w}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr) \\
\mathbf{z}(t) = h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) \quad \mathbf{v}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)
$$

where $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the state vector, $\mathbf{u}(t)$ is the control input, $\mathbf{w}(t)$ is the process noise, $\mathbf{z}(t)$ is the measurement, and $\mathbf{v}(t)$ is the measurement noise. The functions $f$ and $h$ represent the system dynamics and measurement equations, respectively. The matrices $\mathbf{Q}(t)$ and $\mathbf{R}(t)$ represent the process and measurement noise covariance matrices, respectively.

In the next section, we will discuss how these feedback control techniques can be applied in the context of underactuated robotics.

#### 1.5c Applications in Walking Models

In this section, we will explore the application of feedback control techniques in simple walking models. We will focus on the Kneed Compass Gait, a model of a walking robot with two pendulums connected by a hinge at the knee. This model is particularly challenging due to its increased underactuation.

##### Feedback Control in Kneed Compass Gait

The Kneed Compass Gait is a multiple-integrator system, which makes it particularly challenging to stabilize and control. However, feedback control techniques can be used to stabilize this system. 

The backstepping procedure, a recursive procedure that can be used to stabilize a system with multiple integrators, can be used to stabilize the Kneed Compass Gait. The backstepping procedure involves designing a control law that stabilizes the upper single-integrator subsystem, and then using this control law to stabilize the lower single-integrator subsystem. This recursive procedure can be extended to handle any finite number of integrators.

The backstepping procedure can be formulated as follows:

1. Define the Lyapunov function $V_1(x_1)$ for the upper single-integrator subsystem.
2. Design the control law $u_1$ that stabilizes the upper single-integrator subsystem.
3. Use the control law $u_1$ to stabilize the lower single-integrator subsystem.
4. Repeat this procedure for the lower single-integrator subsystem.

This recursive procedure can be extended to handle any finite number of integrators.

##### Higher-order Sinusoidal Input Describing Function (HOSIDF) in Kneed Compass Gait

The Higher-order Sinusoidal Input Describing Function (HOSIDF) can also be used to analyze and control the Kneed Compass Gait. The HOSIDF provides a natural extension of the widely used sinusoidal describing functions in case nonlinearities cannot be neglected.

The HOSIDF can be used to analyze the stability of the Kneed Compass Gait and to design control laws that stabilize the system. The HOSIDF also provides a tool to provide on-site testing during system design, which can be particularly useful in the design of walking robots.

In conclusion, feedback control techniques, including the backstepping procedure and the Higher-order Sinusoidal Input Describing Function (HOSIDF), can be used to stabilize and control the Kneed Compass Gait, a model of a walking robot with two pendulums connected by a hinge at the knee. These techniques can also be extended to handle more complex walking models with multiple integrators.




#### 1.5c Applications and Challenges

In this section, we will explore some of the applications and challenges of using feedback control techniques in underactuated robotics.

##### Applications of Feedback Control in Underactuated Robotics

Feedback control techniques have been widely used in underactuated robotics due to their ability to handle the complexities of nonlinear systems. One of the most common applications is in the control of simple walking models. By using feedback control, the motion of the model can be stabilized and controlled, allowing for precise and controlled movements.

Another important application is in the control of robotic manipulators. Underactuated manipulators, which have fewer actuators than degrees of freedom, can be challenging to control due to the presence of redundancy. Feedback control techniques, such as the Higher-order Sinusoidal Input Describing Function (HOSIDF) and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), can be used to effectively control these systems.

##### Challenges of Feedback Control in Underactuated Robotics

Despite their many advantages, there are also several challenges associated with using feedback control in underactuated robotics. One of the main challenges is the identification and modeling of nonlinear systems. The HOSIDF and EKF, while powerful, require a good understanding of the system dynamics in order to effectively control the system.

Another challenge is the computational complexity of these techniques. The EKF, in particular, requires the linearization of the system dynamics and measurement equations, which can be computationally intensive. This can be a limiting factor in real-time applications.

Finally, the performance of these techniques can be affected by uncertainties in the system model. This is a common challenge in control systems, but it is particularly important in underactuated robotics due to the presence of redundancy and the potential for nonlinearities.

In conclusion, while feedback control techniques have proven to be effective in underactuated robotics, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed in order to fully realize their potential. Future research in this area will likely focus on addressing these challenges and developing new techniques that can handle the complexities of underactuated systems.

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of underactuated robotics and its importance in the field of robotics. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the theory and applications of underactuated robotics by exploring simple running models, specifically the spring-loaded inverted pendulum.

The spring-loaded inverted pendulum is a classic example of an underactuated system, where the number of actuators is less than the number of degrees of freedom. This system is commonly used in robotics research to study the challenges of controlling and stabilizing unstable systems.

In this chapter, we will first discuss the basic principles of the spring-loaded inverted pendulum, including its dynamics and stability.

### Section 2.1 Motion planning:

Motion planning is a crucial aspect of robotics, as it involves the generation of smooth and continuous trajectories for the robot to follow. In this section, we will explore the concept of motion planning and its applications in underactuated systems.

#### 2.1a Dijkstra’s

Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular method for finding the shortest path between two points in a graph. It has been widely used in various fields, including robotics, for motion planning and pathfinding.

The algorithm works by maintaining a set of nodes for which the shortest path has already been found, and a set of nodes for which the shortest path has not yet been found. The algorithm then iteratively selects the node with the shortest distance from the starting node and updates the distances of its neighboring nodes. This process continues until the shortest path to the destination node is found.

In the context of underactuated systems, Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to generate smooth and continuous trajectories for the system to follow. This is particularly useful in systems with multiple degrees of freedom, where finding the optimal path can be challenging.

One of the key advantages of using Dijkstra's algorithm for motion planning is its ability to handle complex and dynamic environments. The algorithm can easily adapt to changes in the environment, making it suitable for real-world applications.

In the next section, we will explore another popular method for motion planning, known as the Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm.





### Subsection 2.1b A-star

A-star is a popular algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. It is an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm and is widely used in robotics for motion planning and pathfinding.

The A-star algorithm works by maintaining a set of nodes for which the shortest path has already been found, and a set of nodes for which the shortest path has not yet been found. The algorithm then iteratively selects the node with the shortest distance from the starting node and updates the distances of its neighboring nodes. This process continues until the shortest path to the destination node is found.

One of the key advantages of using A-star for motion planning is its ability to handle complex and dynamic environments. The algorithm can easily adapt to changes in the environment, making it suitable for real-world applications.

In the context of underactuated systems, A-star can be used to generate smooth and continuous trajectories for the system to follow. This is particularly useful in systems with multiple degrees of freedom, where finding the optimal path can be challenging.

The A-star algorithm is also known for its ability to handle obstacles in the environment. By assigning a cost to each node, the algorithm can avoid nodes that are occupied by obstacles, resulting in a path that avoids these obstacles.

In the next section, we will explore another popular method for motion planning, known as the Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm.





### Subsection 2.2a Rapidly-Exploring Randomized Trees

The Rapidly-Exploring Randomized Tree (RRT) algorithm is a popular method for motion planning in underactuated systems. It is a variation of the Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) algorithm, which is commonly used in robotics for generating smooth and continuous trajectories.

The RRT algorithm works by randomly sampling configurations in the system's configuration space and connecting them to the nearest configuration in the tree. This process is repeated until a path from the starting configuration to the goal configuration is found. The algorithm then uses this path to generate a smooth and continuous trajectory for the system to follow.

One of the key advantages of using RRT for motion planning is its ability to handle complex and dynamic environments. The algorithm can easily adapt to changes in the environment, making it suitable for real-world applications.

In the context of underactuated systems, RRT can be used to generate smooth and continuous trajectories for the system to follow. This is particularly useful in systems with multiple degrees of freedom, where finding the optimal path can be challenging.

The RRT algorithm is also known for its ability to handle obstacles in the environment. By randomly sampling configurations, the algorithm can avoid collisions with obstacles and generate a path that is free of obstacles.

### Subsection 2.2b Lifelong Planning A*

The Lifelong Planning A* (LPA*) algorithm is a variation of the A* algorithm that is commonly used in robotics for motion planning. It is particularly useful in underactuated systems, where the system's dynamics may change over time.

The LPA* algorithm works by maintaining a set of nodes for which the shortest path has already been found, and a set of nodes for which the shortest path has not yet been found. The algorithm then iteratively selects the node with the shortest distance from the starting node and updates the distances of its neighboring nodes. This process continues until the shortest path to the goal configuration is found.

One of the key advantages of using LPA* for motion planning is its ability to handle changes in the system's dynamics. The algorithm can adapt to these changes and generate a new path if necessary.

In the context of underactuated systems, LPA* can be used to generate smooth and continuous trajectories for the system to follow. This is particularly useful in systems with changing dynamics, where finding the optimal path can be challenging.

The LPA* algorithm is also known for its ability to handle obstacles in the environment. By maintaining a set of nodes for which the shortest path has already been found, the algorithm can avoid collisions with obstacles and generate a path that is free of obstacles.





### Subsection 2.2b Probabilistic Road Maps

The Probabilistic Road Map (PRM) algorithm is another popular method for motion planning in underactuated systems. It is a variation of the Rapidly-Exploring Randomized Tree (RRT) algorithm, which we discussed in the previous section.

The PRM algorithm works by randomly sampling configurations in the system's configuration space and connecting them to the nearest configuration in the tree. However, unlike RRT, PRM also takes into account the system's dynamics and constraints. This allows it to generate smooth and continuous trajectories that are feasible for the system.

One of the key advantages of using PRM for motion planning is its ability to handle complex and dynamic environments. The algorithm can easily adapt to changes in the environment, making it suitable for real-world applications.

In the context of underactuated systems, PRM can be used to generate smooth and continuous trajectories for the system to follow. This is particularly useful in systems with multiple degrees of freedom, where finding the optimal path can be challenging.

The PRM algorithm is also known for its ability to handle obstacles in the environment. By randomly sampling configurations, the algorithm can avoid collisions with obstacles and generate a path that is free of obstacles.

### Subsection 2.2c Applications in Robotics

The randomized motion planning algorithms discussed in this section have been widely used in robotics for various applications. These algorithms have been used in tasks such as navigation, obstacle avoidance, and trajectory planning.

In navigation, these algorithms have been used to generate smooth and continuous trajectories for a robot to follow in complex and dynamic environments. This is particularly useful in tasks such as autonomous exploration and mapping.

In obstacle avoidance, these algorithms have been used to generate trajectories that avoid collisions with obstacles in the environment. This is crucial for tasks such as autonomous driving and human-robot interaction.

In trajectory planning, these algorithms have been used to generate smooth and continuous trajectories for a robot to follow while satisfying various constraints. This is important for tasks such as manipulation and assembly.

Overall, the randomized motion planning algorithms have proven to be powerful tools for motion planning in underactuated systems. Their ability to handle complex and dynamic environments makes them suitable for a wide range of applications in robotics.


## Chapter 2: Simple Running Models: Spring-loaded inverted pendulum:




### Subsection 2.3a Planning with Funnels

In the previous sections, we have discussed various randomized motion planning algorithms that are used to generate smooth and continuous trajectories for underactuated systems. In this section, we will explore another approach to motion planning known as Feedback Motion Planning (FMP).

FMP is a type of feedback control that is used to generate trajectories for underactuated systems. It is based on the concept of funnels, which are regions in the system's configuration space that contain all the feasible trajectories for the system. These funnels are defined by a set of constraints and objectives that the system must satisfy.

The goal of FMP is to find a trajectory that lies within the funnel and satisfies the system's dynamics and constraints. This is achieved by using a feedback control law that adjusts the system's control inputs based on its current state. The control law is designed to keep the system within the funnel and guide it towards the desired trajectory.

One of the key advantages of using FMP is its ability to handle complex and dynamic environments. The feedback control law allows the system to adapt to changes in the environment and generate trajectories that are feasible and optimal.

In the context of underactuated systems, FMP can be used to generate trajectories that are smooth and continuous. This is particularly useful in systems with multiple degrees of freedom, where finding the optimal path can be challenging.

FMP has been successfully applied in various applications, including robotics, aerospace, and factory automation. It has also been extended to handle multiple funnels, making it suitable for more complex systems.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of funnels in more detail and discuss how they are used in FMP. We will also discuss the different types of funnels and their properties.

### Section: 2.4 Function approximation and system identification:

#### 2.4a Introduction to Function Approximation

Function approximation is a fundamental concept in the field of underactuated robotics. It involves the use of mathematical models to approximate the behavior of a system. This is particularly useful in the context of underactuated robots, where the system may be complex and difficult to model accurately.

One of the key techniques used in function approximation is system identification. This involves the use of experimental data to estimate the parameters of a mathematical model that describes the system. This is often necessary when the system is too complex to be described by a simple analytical model.

In the context of underactuated robots, function approximation and system identification can be used to model the behavior of the robot's dynamics. This can be particularly useful in the design and control of the robot, as it allows us to predict the robot's behavior and design control strategies accordingly.

One of the key challenges in function approximation and system identification is the trade-off between model complexity and accuracy. A more complex model may be able to capture the system's behavior more accurately, but it may also be more difficult to identify and may require more data. On the other hand, a simpler model may be easier to identify, but it may not be able to capture the system's behavior as accurately.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the theory and applications of function approximation and system identification in underactuated robotics. We will explore various techniques for function approximation and system identification, and discuss their advantages and limitations. We will also look at some practical applications of these techniques in the design and control of underactuated robots.

#### 2.4b System Identification Techniques

System identification is a crucial aspect of function approximation in underactuated robotics. It involves the use of experimental data to estimate the parameters of a mathematical model that describes the system. This section will delve into the various techniques used for system identification.

One of the most common techniques for system identification is the least squares method. This method minimizes the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed and predicted values. The least squares method is particularly useful for linear systems, but it can also be extended to non-linear systems through the use of iterative techniques.

Another common technique for system identification is the extended Kalman filter. This is a recursive algorithm that estimates the state of a system based on a series of noisy measurements. The extended Kalman filter is particularly useful for systems that are represented as continuous-time models, but where discrete-time measurements are frequently taken for state estimation via a digital processor.

The continuous-time extended Kalman filter model is given by:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) \quad \mathbf{w}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr) \\
\mathbf{z}(t) = h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) \quad \mathbf{v}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)
$$

The prediction and update steps are coupled in the continuous-time extended Kalman filter. The system model and measurement model are given by:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) \quad \mathbf{w}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr) \\
\mathbf{z}(t) = h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) \quad \mathbf{v}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)
$$

The system model and measurement model are given by:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) \quad \mathbf{w}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr) \\
\mathbf{z}(t) = h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) \quad \mathbf{v}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)
$$

In the next section, we will explore the applications of these system identification techniques in the design and control of underactuated robots.

#### 2.4c Function Approximation Techniques

Function approximation is a crucial aspect of system identification in underactuated robotics. It involves the use of mathematical models to approximate the behavior of a system. This section will delve into the various techniques used for function approximation.

One of the most common techniques for function approximation is the use of neural networks. Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after a human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling or clustering raw input. The patterns they recognize are numerical, contained in vectors, into which all real-world data, be it images, sound, text or time series, must be translated.

Neural networks are particularly useful for non-linear systems. They can approximate any non-linear function to a high degree of accuracy, given a sufficient number of neurons and layers. This makes them particularly useful for function approximation in underactuated robotics, where the dynamics of the system are often non-linear.

Another common technique for function approximation is the use of support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier.

SVMs are particularly useful for linear systems. They can approximate any linear function to a high degree of accuracy, given a sufficient number of support vectors. This makes them particularly useful for function approximation in underactuated robotics, where the dynamics of the system are often linear.

The continuous-time extended Kalman filter model is given by:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) \quad \mathbf{w}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr) \\
\mathbf{z}(t) = h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) \quad \mathbf{v}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)
$$

The system model and measurement model are given by:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) \quad \mathbf{w}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr) \\
\mathbf{z}(t) = h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) \quad \mathbf{v}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)
$$

In the next section, we will explore the applications of these function approximation techniques in the design and control of underactuated robots.

## Chapter: Chapter 3: Simple Walking Models

### Introduction

In this chapter, we delve into the fascinating world of simple walking models, a fundamental aspect of underactuated robotics. The human gait, a complex and intricate process, serves as the inspiration for these models. We will explore how these models are designed and how they mimic the human gait, albeit in a simplified manner.

Underactuated robotics, a field that deals with robots that have fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom, presents unique challenges and opportunities. Simple walking models are a crucial part of this field, as they provide a foundation for understanding and designing more complex walking robots.

The human gait, despite its complexity, is a highly efficient and robust mechanism for locomotion. It is characterized by a periodic pattern, with the legs alternating between swing and stance phases. This rhythmic pattern is what we aim to replicate in our simple walking models.

We will also discuss the mathematical models that describe these walking patterns. These models, often expressed in terms of differential equations, provide a quantitative understanding of the walking process. For instance, the equation `$\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t)$` is a common form used to describe the dynamics of a walking model.

Finally, we will explore the practical applications of these simple walking models. These include their use in the design of walking robots, their role in the study of human gait, and their potential in fields such as prosthetics and rehabilitation.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to simple walking models, combining theoretical discussion with practical examples. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field of underactuated robotics, we hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for you.




#### 2.4b System Identification Techniques

System identification is a crucial aspect of function approximation in underactuated robotics. It involves the use of experimental data to estimate the parameters of a mathematical model that describes the system. This is often necessary when the system is too complex to be described by a simple analytical model.

One of the key techniques used in system identification is the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The EKF is a recursive estimator that provides a means of estimating the state of a non-linear system from noisy measurements. It does this by linearizing the system around the current estimate, and then applying the standard Kalman filter.

The EKF operates in two steps: prediction and update. In the prediction step, the EKF uses the system model to predict the state at the next time step. In the update step, it uses the measurement to correct the predicted state. This process is repeated at each time step, resulting in an estimate of the system state.

The EKF is particularly useful in system identification because it can handle non-linear systems. This is achieved by linearizing the system model around the current estimate. However, this linearization is only an approximation, and the accuracy of the EKF depends on the quality of this approximation.

The EKF also provides a means of estimating the uncertainty in the state estimate. This is important in system identification, as it allows us to quantify the uncertainty in the estimated model parameters.

In the context of underactuated robotics, the EKF can be used to estimate the parameters of the robot's dynamics. This can be particularly useful in the design and control of the robot, as it allows us to predict the robot's behavior and design control strategies accordingly.

However, the EKF also has its limitations. It assumes that the system model and measurement model are both Gaussian, which may not always be the case. It also assumes that the system model is differentiable, which may not be the case for all non-linear systems.

In the next section, we will explore other system identification techniques, and discuss their advantages and limitations in the context of underactuated robotics.

#### 2.4c Function Approximation Techniques

Function approximation is a fundamental concept in the field of underactuated robotics. It involves the use of mathematical models to approximate the behavior of a system. This is particularly useful in the context of underactuated robots, where the system may be complex and difficult to model accurately.

One of the key techniques used in function approximation is the Higher-order Sinusoidal Input Describing Function (HOSIDF). The HOSIDF is a tool that provides a natural extension of the widely used sinusoidal describing functions in case nonlinearities cannot be neglected. It is intuitive in its identification and interpretation, and provides a tool for on-site testing during system design.

The HOSIDF operates by applying a higher-order sinusoidal input to the system, and analyzing the system's response. This allows us to identify the system's nonlinearities and behavior, which can then be approximated using a mathematical model.

The HOSIDF is particularly useful in the context of underactuated robotics, as it can handle non-linear systems. This is achieved by approximating the system's behavior using a higher-order sinusoidal input. However, this approximation is only an approximation, and the accuracy of the HOSIDF depends on the quality of this approximation.

The HOSIDF also provides a means of estimating the uncertainty in the system's behavior. This is important in function approximation, as it allows us to quantify the uncertainty in the estimated model parameters.

In the context of underactuated robotics, the HOSIDF can be used to estimate the parameters of the robot's dynamics. This can be particularly useful in the design and control of the robot, as it allows us to predict the robot's behavior and design control strategies accordingly.

However, the HOSIDF also has its limitations. It assumes that the system's behavior can be approximated using a higher-order sinusoidal input, which may not always be the case. It also assumes that the system's behavior is smooth and continuous, which may not always be the case for underactuated robots.

In the next section, we will explore other function approximation techniques, and discuss their advantages and limitations in the context of underactuated robotics.

## Chapter: Chapter 3: Introduction to Underactuated Robotics

### Introduction

Welcome to Chapter 3 of "Underactuated Robotics: Theory and Applications". This chapter serves as an introduction to the fascinating world of underactuated robotics. Underactuation is a fundamental concept in robotics that deals with the control of robots with fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom. This concept has been widely adopted in various fields due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

In this chapter, we will explore the theoretical foundations of underactuated robotics, starting with the basic principles and gradually moving on to more complex concepts. We will delve into the mathematical models that describe the behavior of underactuated robots, and how these models can be used to design control strategies. We will also discuss the advantages and limitations of underactuation, and how it compares to fully actuated systems.

We will also touch upon the practical applications of underactuated robotics. This includes examples from various fields such as biomechanics, prosthetics, and factory automation. These examples will provide a real-world context to the theoretical concepts discussed, and will help you understand the relevance and importance of underactuation in modern robotics.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to underactuated robotics, equipping you with the necessary knowledge and tools to understand and apply underactuation in your own research or industry projects. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field of robotics, this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for you.

So, let's embark on this exciting journey into the world of underactuated robotics. Let's explore the theory, let's see the applications, and let's understand how underactuation can revolutionize the way we design and control robots.




#### 2.4c Applications and Challenges

Function approximation and system identification have a wide range of applications in underactuated robotics. These techniques are used in the design and control of robots, as well as in the analysis of their behavior.

One of the key applications of function approximation and system identification is in the design of controllers for underactuated robots. These controllers are used to control the motion of the robot, and they often rely on a mathematical model of the robot's dynamics. This model is typically estimated using system identification techniques.

For example, consider the spring-loaded inverted pendulum, a classic example of an underactuated robot. The dynamics of this robot can be described by a non-linear differential equation. This equation can be used to design a controller that stabilizes the pendulum. However, the parameters of this equation are often unknown, and they need to be estimated using system identification techniques.

Another application of function approximation and system identification is in the analysis of the robot's behavior. By approximating the robot's dynamics, we can predict its behavior and analyze its stability. This can be particularly useful in the design of new robots, as it allows us to understand the effects of different design choices on the robot's behavior.

However, there are also several challenges associated with function approximation and system identification. One of the main challenges is the accuracy of the approximation. As mentioned earlier, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) assumes that the system model and measurement model are both Gaussian. This assumption may not always hold, and it can lead to inaccuracies in the approximation.

Another challenge is the complexity of the system model. As the complexity of the system increases, the accuracy of the approximation decreases. This is because the system model becomes more difficult to linearize, and the EKF's approximation becomes less accurate.

Finally, there is the challenge of dealing with noisy measurements. The EKF assumes that the measurements are noisy, but it does not provide a means of dealing with this noise. This can lead to inaccuracies in the estimation of the system parameters.

Despite these challenges, function approximation and system identification remain powerful tools in underactuated robotics. With careful design and implementation, they can provide valuable insights into the behavior of underactuated robots.




#### 2.5a State Distribution Dynamics

In the previous sections, we have discussed the dynamics of the spring-loaded inverted pendulum and the challenges associated with function approximation and system identification. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of state distribution dynamics, a key aspect of underactuated robotics.

State distribution dynamics refers to the study of how the state of a system changes over time. In the context of underactuated robotics, this involves understanding how the state of the robot changes as it interacts with its environment. This is a crucial aspect of robotics, as it allows us to predict the behavior of the robot and design controllers that can stabilize it.

The state of a system can be represented as a point in a state space. In the case of the spring-loaded inverted pendulum, the state space is four-dimensional, with each dimension representing the position and velocity of the pendulum. The dynamics of the system can then be represented as a trajectory in this state space.

The state distribution dynamics of a system can be described using a probability distribution. This distribution represents the likelihood of the system being in a particular state at a given time. In the case of the spring-loaded inverted pendulum, this distribution can be used to represent the likelihood of the pendulum being in a particular position and velocity at a given time.

The state distribution dynamics can be estimated using system identification techniques. This involves collecting data on the state of the system and using this data to estimate the probability distribution. This can be done using various methods, such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or the CMA-ES algorithm.

The CMA-ES algorithm, in particular, is a powerful tool for estimating state distribution dynamics. It involves sampling new solutions from a multivariate normal distribution and evaluating these solutions on the objective function. The best solutions are then combined to update the distribution parameters, allowing for a more accurate representation of the state distribution dynamics.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of state distribution dynamics in the design of controllers for underactuated robots.

#### 2.5b Uncertainty and Robustness

In the previous sections, we have discussed the dynamics of the spring-loaded inverted pendulum and the concept of state distribution dynamics. However, in real-world applications, robots often operate in uncertain environments, where the system parameters and external disturbances are not known with certainty. This introduces a level of uncertainty in the system, which can significantly affect the performance of the robot.

Uncertainty in a system can be represented as a set of possible values for the system parameters. In the case of the spring-loaded inverted pendulum, this could be represented as a range of possible spring constants or pendulum masses. This uncertainty can be modeled using a probability distribution, similar to the state distribution dynamics discussed in the previous section.

Robustness, on the other hand, refers to the ability of a system to perform well in the presence of uncertainty. In the context of underactuated robotics, this means designing a robot that can perform its tasks effectively even when the system parameters and external disturbances are not known with certainty.

The concept of robustness is closely related to the concept of stability. A robust system is one that can maintain its stability in the presence of uncertainty. This is particularly important in underactuated robotics, where the system often operates at the edge of stability.

One approach to achieving robustness is through the use of robust control techniques. These techniques involve designing controllers that can handle uncertainty in the system. For example, the H-infinity control technique, which aims to minimize the effect of uncertainty on the system performance, can be used to design robust controllers for underactuated robots.

Another approach is through the use of model predictive control (MPC). MPC is a control technique that uses a model of the system to predict its future behavior and optimize the control inputs accordingly. This allows the controller to adapt to changes in the system parameters and external disturbances, making it more robust to uncertainty.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of these concepts in the design of controllers for underactuated robots.

#### 2.5c Applications and Challenges

In this section, we will explore some of the applications of underactuated robotics and discuss the challenges that arise in these applications.

##### Applications

Underactuated robotics has a wide range of applications, particularly in the field of biomechanics. The human body, for instance, is an example of an underactuated system. The human body has more joints than it has independent actuators, making it an underactuated system. This is why we can perform complex movements with our bodies, even though we only have a limited number of muscles and joints.

The study of underactuated robotics can provide valuable insights into the mechanics of human movement. By understanding how underactuated systems like the human body move, we can develop more natural and intuitive control schemes for robots. This can be particularly useful in applications such as prosthetics and exoskeletons, where the goal is to mimic the natural movements of the human body.

##### Challenges

Despite its potential applications, underactuated robotics presents several challenges. One of the main challenges is the inherent instability of underactuated systems. Due to the lack of independent actuators, underactuated systems often operate at the edge of stability. This makes it difficult to design controllers that can stabilize the system in the presence of disturbances.

Another challenge is the uncertainty in the system parameters. In real-world applications, the parameters of the system, such as the mass and stiffness of the robot, are often not known with certainty. This introduces a level of uncertainty in the system, which can significantly affect the performance of the robot.

Furthermore, the design of underactuated robots often involves a trade-off between performance and complexity. Underactuated systems are inherently more complex than fully actuated systems, due to the need to coordinate multiple joints with a limited number of actuators. This complexity can make it difficult to design and implement effective control schemes.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the techniques that can be used to address these challenges, including robust control techniques and model predictive control.

In conclusion, the study of underactuated robotics, particularly the spring-loaded inverted pendulum, is a rich and rewarding field. It offers a unique perspective on robotics, one that is grounded in the principles of physics and biomechanics. As we continue to explore this field, we can expect to uncover even more exciting applications and possibilities.

## Chapter: Chapter 3: Simple Walking Models

### Introduction

In this chapter, we delve into the fascinating world of simple walking models, a fundamental aspect of underactuated robotics. The study of walking models is crucial in understanding the mechanics of human and animal locomotion, and it forms the basis for the design and control of underactuated robots.

The human body, for instance, is an underactuated system. It has more joints than it has independent actuators, making it an inherently complex system to model and control. However, by studying simple walking models, we can gain insights into the principles that govern the movement of these systems.

We will begin by exploring the basic principles of walking, including the role of feedback control and the concept of gait. We will then move on to discuss the mathematical models that describe these principles, using the popular Markdown format for clarity and ease of understanding.

#### 2.5b State Estimation

State estimation is a crucial aspect of underactuated robotics, particularly in the context of the spring-loaded inverted pendulum. As we have seen in the previous sections, the dynamics of this system are complex and involve multiple uncertainties. State estimation allows us to estimate the current state of the system, which is essential for designing controllers that can stabilize the system.

There are several methods for state estimation, including the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the CMA-ES algorithm. In this section, we will focus on the EKF, as it is widely used in robotics and provides a good foundation for understanding state estimation.

The EKF is a recursive filter that estimates the state of a system based on a model of the system and measurements of the system. The model of the system is represented as a set of differential equations, while the measurements are represented as a set of linear equations. The EKF then uses these models to estimate the current state of the system.

The EKF operates in two steps: prediction and update. In the prediction step, the EKF uses the system model to predict the state of the system at the next time step. In the update step, it uses the measurements to correct this prediction. This process is repeated at each time step, allowing the EKF to track the state of the system over time.

The EKF can handle both continuous-time and discrete-time measurements. In the case of continuous-time measurements, the system model and measurement model are given by

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) \quad \mathbf{w}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr) \\
\mathbf{z}(t) = h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) \quad \mathbf{v}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)
$$

where $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the state vector, $\mathbf{u}(t)$ is the control vector, $\mathbf{w}(t)$ is the process noise, $\mathbf{z}(t)$ is the measurement vector, $\mathbf{v}(t)$ is the measurement noise, $f$ is the system model, and $h$ is the measurement model.

In the case of discrete-time measurements, the system model and measurement model are given by

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) \quad \mathbf{w}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr) \\
\mathbf{z}_k = h(\mathbf{x}_k) + \mathbf{v}_k \quad \mathbf{v}_k \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}_k)
$$

where $\mathbf{x}_k=\mathbf{x}(t_k)$.

The EKF can also handle uncertainties in the system model and measurement model. This is achieved through the use of the process noise $\mathbf{w}(t)$ and measurement noise $\mathbf{v}(t)$, which represent the uncertainty in the system model and measurement model, respectively.

In the next section, we will discuss the CMA-ES algorithm, another powerful method for state estimation.

#### 2.5c Robust Control

Robust control is a critical aspect of underactuated robotics, particularly in the context of the spring-loaded inverted pendulum. As we have seen in the previous sections, the dynamics of this system are complex and involve multiple uncertainties. Robust control allows us to design controllers that can handle these uncertainties and stabilize the system.

There are several methods for robust control, including the H-infinity control and the μ-synthesis. In this section, we will focus on the H-infinity control, as it is widely used in robotics and provides a good foundation for understanding robust control.

The H-infinity control is a method for designing robust controllers that can handle uncertainties in the system model. The goal of the H-infinity control is to minimize the effect of these uncertainties on the performance of the controller. This is achieved by minimizing the H-infinity norm of the transfer function of the controller.

The H-infinity control operates in two steps: design and implementation. In the design step, the H-infinity control uses the system model to design a controller that minimizes the H-infinity norm of the transfer function. In the implementation step, the controller is implemented on the system.

The H-infinity control can handle both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. In the case of continuous-time systems, the system model is represented as a set of differential equations, while in the case of discrete-time systems, the system model is represented as a set of difference equations.

The H-infinity control can also handle uncertainties in the system model. This is achieved by designing the controller based on an upper bound on the uncertainty in the system model. This upper bound is typically determined through a robust stability analysis.

The H-infinity control can be extended to handle multiple uncertainties in the system model. This is achieved by designing a controller that minimizes the H-infinity norm of the transfer function for each uncertainty. This approach is known as the H-infinity control with multiple uncertainties.

In the next section, we will discuss the μ-synthesis, another method for robust control.

#### 2.5d Robust Estimation

As we have seen in the previous sections, the dynamics of this system are complex and involve multiple uncertainties. Robust estimation allows us to design estimators that can handle these uncertainties and provide accurate estimates of the system state.

There are several methods for robust estimation, including the H-infinity estimation and the μ-synthesis. In this section, we will focus on the H-infinity estimation, as it is widely used in robotics and provides a good foundation for understanding robust estimation.

The H-infinity estimation is a method for designing robust estimators that can handle uncertainties in the system model.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the simple running models of underactuated robotics, specifically focusing on the spring-loaded inverted pendulum. We have delved into the theory behind these models, understanding the dynamics and kinematics that govern their operation. We have also examined the applications of these models, demonstrating their practical relevance in the field of robotics.

## Chapter: Chapter 3: Underactuated Quadruped Walking

### Introduction

In the realm of robotics, the ability to walk is a fundamental skill that enables a robot to navigate through complex environments. This chapter, "Underactuated Quadruped Walking," delves into the intricacies of this skill, focusing on the unique challenges and opportunities presented by underactuation.

Underactuation refers to the situation where a robot has fewer actuators (mechanisms that cause motion) than the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) it has. This is often the case in the design of quadruped robots, where each leg typically has one DOF and the robot as a whole has four legs. This results in a 4-DOF system with only 4 actuators, making it an underactuated system.

The challenge of underactuation lies in the fact that the number of independent inputs (actuators) is less than the number of independent outputs (degrees of freedom). This leads to a phenomenon known as kinematic redundancy, which can be both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it allows for a greater range of motion and flexibility, but on the other hand, it can make the control of the robot more complex and challenging.

In this chapter, we will explore the theory behind underactuated quadruped walking, delving into the mathematical models that describe the motion of these robots. We will also discuss the practical applications of this theory, providing examples of how it can be used to design and control underactuated quadruped robots.

We will also delve into the topic of gait generation, a crucial aspect of underactuated quadruped walking. Gait generation involves the creation of a walking pattern or gait for the robot, which is then used to control its movement. This is a complex task due to the nonlinearities and uncertainties inherent in the system.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the theory and applications of underactuated quadruped walking. They should also be equipped with the knowledge to apply these concepts to the design and control of their own underactuated quadruped robots.

### Subsection: 3.2a Introduction to Swimming and Flapping Flight

In this section, we will explore the principles of swimming and flapping flight, two fundamental modes of locomotion in the animal kingdom. These modes of locomotion have been studied extensively by biologists and engineers, and have led to significant advancements in the field of underactuated robotics.

#### Swimming

Swimming is a mode of locomotion that involves the movement of an organism through water. It is a complex process that involves the coordination of various body parts, such as the fins, tail, and body. The principles of swimming have been studied extensively by biologists, and have led to the development of underactuated robots that can mimic the movements of swimming animals.

One of the key principles of swimming is the generation of thrust. This is achieved by creating a difference in pressure between the front and back of the organism. In fish, this is achieved by undulating the body, which creates a wave-like motion that propels the fish forward. This principle has been applied to the design of underactuated robots, where a similar wave-like motion is generated to create thrust.

Another important aspect of swimming is the control of buoyancy. Fish, being predominantly aquatic animals, have a body density close to that of water. This allows them to maintain stability in the water. This principle has been applied to the design of underactuated robots, where the robot's density is adjusted to maintain stability in the water.

#### Flapping Flight

Flapping flight is a mode of locomotion that involves the movement of an organism through the air by flapping its wings. This mode of locomotion is commonly observed in birds and insects. The principles of flapping flight have been studied extensively by biologists, and have led to the development of underactuated robots that can mimic the movements of flying animals.

One of the key principles of flapping flight is the generation of lift. This is achieved by creating a difference in air pressure above and below the wings. In birds and insects, this is achieved by flapping the wings, which creates a wave-like motion that generates lift. This principle has been applied to the design of underactuated robots, where a similar wave-like motion is generated to create lift.

Another important aspect of flapping flight is the control of stability. Birds and insects are able to maintain stability in the air by adjusting their center of gravity and using their wings for control. This principle has been applied to the design of underactuated robots, where the robot's center of gravity is adjusted and its wings are used for control.

In the realm of robotics, the understanding and application of nonlinear dynamics is a critical aspect that cannot be overlooked. This chapter, "Nonlinear Dynamics," delves into the complex and fascinating world of nonlinear systems, providing a comprehensive exploration of the theory and applications of nonlinear dynamics in underactuated robotics.

Nonlinear dynamics is a branch of mathematics that deals with systems whose behavior is not directly proportional to their inputs. In the context of robotics, many systems exhibit nonlinear behavior, making the study of nonlinear dynamics essential for understanding and controlling these systems. Underactuated robotics, in particular, often involve nonlinear dynamics due to the inherent complexity of their control systems.

The chapter begins by introducing the fundamental concepts of nonlinear dynamics, including the concepts of stability, bifurcation, and chaos. It then moves on to discuss the application of these concepts in underactuated robotics. The chapter also explores the mathematical models used to describe nonlinear systems, such as the Extended Kalman Filter and the Higher-order Sinusoidal Input Describing Function.

Throughout the chapter, we will use the popular Markdown format for clarity and ease of understanding. All mathematical expressions and equations will be formatted using the TeX and LaTeX style syntax, rendered using the MathJax library. For example, inline math will be written as `$y_j(n)$` and equations as `$$
\Delta w = ...
$$`.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of nonlinear dynamics and its application in underactuated robotics. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the subsequent chapters, where we will delve deeper into the practical aspects of underactuated robotics.




#### 3.3a Introduction to Randomized Policy Gradient

The Randomized Policy Gradient (RPG) is a stochastic optimization algorithm that is used in the field of reinforcement learning. It is a variant of the Policy Gradient method, which is a policy-based approach to reinforcement learning. The RPG is particularly useful in situations where the state space is continuous and the policy is differentiable.

The RPG algorithm is based on the principle of stochastic gradient descent, where the policy parameters are updated in the direction of the stochastic gradient of the expected reward. The stochastic gradient is estimated using a set of random samples from the state space.

The algorithm starts with an initial policy and a set of random samples. The policy is then updated iteratively, using the stochastic gradient to adjust the policy parameters. The process continues until the policy converges to a stable solution.

The RPG algorithm can be formulated as follows:

1. Initialize the policy parameters $\theta$ and the set of random samples $S$.

2. For each iteration $i$:

    a. Sample a random state $s$ from the state space $S$.

    b. Perform an action $a$ according to the current policy $\pi(a|s;\theta)$.

    c. Receive a reward $r$ and a new state $s'$.

    d. Calculate the stochastic gradient of the expected reward:

$$
\nabla J(\theta) = \sum_{s \in S} \nabla \log \pi(a|s;\theta) r
$$

    e. Update the policy parameters:

$$
\theta_{i+1} = \theta_i + \alpha \nabla J(\theta)
$$

    where $\alpha$ is the learning rate.

The RPG algorithm is particularly useful in situations where the state space is continuous and the policy is differentiable. It allows for efficient exploration of the state space and can handle complex and non-convex reward functions. However, it also requires a large number of random samples to estimate the stochastic gradient accurately.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of the Randomized Policy Gradient in underactuated robotics.

#### 3.3b Derivation of Randomized Policy Gradient

The Randomized Policy Gradient (RPG) algorithm is derived from the Policy Gradient method, which is a policy-based approach to reinforcement learning. The RPG is a stochastic optimization algorithm that is particularly useful in situations where the state space is continuous and the policy is differentiable.

The RPG algorithm is based on the principle of stochastic gradient descent, where the policy parameters are updated in the direction of the stochastic gradient of the expected reward. The stochastic gradient is estimated using a set of random samples from the state space.

The derivation of the RPG algorithm starts with the Policy Gradient theorem, which states that the expected change in the policy parameters is proportional to the expected change in the log-likelihood of the actions. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
\nabla J(\theta) = \sum_{s \in S} \nabla \log \pi(a|s;\theta) r
$$

where $J(\theta)$ is the expected reward, $S$ is the state space, $a$ is the action, $s$ is the state, $\pi(a|s;\theta)$ is the policy, and $r$ is the reward.

The RPG algorithm then estimates the stochastic gradient of the expected reward using a set of random samples from the state space. The policy parameters are updated iteratively, using the stochastic gradient to adjust the policy parameters. The process continues until the policy converges to a stable solution.

The RPG algorithm can be formulated as follows:

1. Initialize the policy parameters $\theta$ and the set of random samples $S$.

2. For each iteration $i$:

    a. Sample a random state $s$ from the state space $S$.

    b. Perform an action $a$ according to the current policy $\pi(a|s;\theta)$.

    c. Receive a reward $r$ and a new state $s'$.

    d. Calculate the stochastic gradient of the expected reward:

$$
\nabla J(\theta) = \sum_{s \in S} \nabla \log \pi(a|s;\theta) r
$$

    e. Update the policy parameters:

$$
\theta_{i+1} = \theta_i + \alpha \nabla J(\theta)
$$

    where $\alpha$ is the learning rate.

The RPG algorithm is particularly useful in situations where the state space is continuous and the policy is differentiable. It allows for efficient exploration of the state space and can handle complex and non-convex reward functions. However, it also requires a large number of random samples to estimate the stochastic gradient accurately.

#### 3.3c Applications in Robotics

The Randomized Policy Gradient (RPG) algorithm has found significant applications in the field of robotics, particularly in the area of underactuated robotics. Underactuated robots are those that have fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom they can move. This makes them inherently unstable and difficult to control. However, the RPG algorithm provides a powerful tool for controlling these robots.

One of the key applications of the RPG algorithm in robotics is in the control of underactuated robots. The RPG algorithm allows the robot to learn and adapt its control policy based on the feedback it receives from its environment. This makes it particularly suited for controlling underactuated robots, which often operate in complex and unpredictable environments.

The RPG algorithm can be used to control underactuated robots in a variety of tasks, including locomotion, manipulation, and navigation. For example, in locomotion tasks, the RPG algorithm can be used to learn a control policy that allows the robot to move efficiently and stably over rough terrain or through complex environments. In manipulation tasks, the RPG algorithm can be used to learn a control policy that allows the robot to perform precise and accurate manipulations. In navigation tasks, the RPG algorithm can be used to learn a control policy that allows the robot to navigate through complex and unknown environments.

The RPG algorithm can also be used in conjunction with other techniques, such as model predictive control (MPC), to further enhance the performance of underactuated robots. MPC is a control technique that uses a model of the robot and its environment to predict the future behavior of the robot and generate control commands accordingly. By combining the RPG algorithm with MPC, the robot can learn and adapt its control policy based on the predictions generated by the MPC model.

In conclusion, the Randomized Policy Gradient algorithm provides a powerful tool for controlling underactuated robots. Its ability to learn and adapt based on feedback makes it particularly suited for these challenging robots. As research in this area continues to advance, we can expect to see even more exciting applications of the RPG algorithm in the field of robotics.




#### 3.3b Applications of Randomized Policy Gradient

The Randomized Policy Gradient (RPG) algorithm has been applied to a variety of problems in robotics and control systems. In this section, we will discuss some of these applications, focusing on how the RPG algorithm can be used to solve complex control problems.

##### Underactuated Robotics

Underactuated robotics is a field that deals with robots that have fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom. This results in a redundancy in the system, which can be exploited to achieve more complex and natural movements. The RPG algorithm can be used to learn optimal control policies for these underactuated robots, taking advantage of the redundancy to achieve more natural and efficient movements.

The RPG algorithm can be used to learn the control policy for the robot by interacting with the environment. The robot learns to perform actions that maximize the expected reward, which can be defined in terms of the robot's performance in a specific task. The RPG algorithm can handle the continuous state space of the robot and the differentiable policy, making it a suitable choice for learning optimal control policies in underactuated robotics.

##### Robotics and Control Systems

The RPG algorithm can also be applied to traditional robotics and control systems. In these systems, the RPG algorithm can be used to learn optimal control policies for tasks such as trajectory tracking, obstacle avoidance, and energy minimization. The RPG algorithm can handle the continuous state space and differentiable policy of these systems, making it a powerful tool for learning optimal control policies.

##### Stochastic Optimal Control

The RPG algorithm is particularly useful in stochastic optimal control problems. In these problems, the system dynamics are subject to random disturbances, and the goal is to learn a control policy that maximizes the expected reward despite these disturbances. The RPG algorithm can handle the stochastic nature of these problems by using a set of random samples to estimate the stochastic gradient of the expected reward.

In conclusion, the Randomized Policy Gradient algorithm is a powerful tool for learning optimal control policies in a variety of applications. Its ability to handle continuous state spaces and differentiable policies makes it particularly suitable for underactuated robotics and control systems. Its ability to handle stochastic problems makes it a valuable tool in stochastic optimal control.

#### 3.3c Challenges in Randomized Policy Gradient

While the Randomized Policy Gradient (RPG) algorithm has shown promising results in various applications, it is not without its challenges. These challenges often arise from the inherent complexity of the problems being addressed, the assumptions made in the algorithm, and the limitations of the learning environment.

##### Complexity of Problems

Many of the problems that the RPG algorithm is applied to, such as underactuated robotics and control systems, are inherently complex. These problems often involve high-dimensional state spaces, non-linear dynamics, and uncertain environments. The RPG algorithm, like many other reinforcement learning algorithms, learns by interacting with the environment. This means that it must be able to handle the complexities of the environment and make decisions based on limited experience. This can be a significant challenge, especially in domains where the environment is dynamic and unpredictable.

##### Assumptions in the Algorithm

The RPG algorithm makes several assumptions about the system it is learning. One of these assumptions is that the policy is differentiable. This assumption is necessary for the algorithm to use gradient descent to update the policy parameters. However, in many real-world systems, the policy may not be differentiable. This can lead to difficulties in learning the optimal policy.

Another assumption is that the state space is continuous. This assumption is necessary for the algorithm to use stochastic gradient descent. However, in many real-world systems, the state space may be discrete or have a finite number of states. This can limit the effectiveness of the RPG algorithm.

##### Limitations of the Learning Environment

The RPG algorithm learns by interacting with the environment. This means that it must be able to observe the effects of its actions and receive feedback from the environment. However, in many real-world systems, this feedback may be delayed or incomplete. This can make it difficult for the algorithm to learn an optimal policy.

Furthermore, the RPG algorithm assumes that the environment is stationary. This means that the dynamics of the environment do not change over time. However, in many real-world systems, the environment may be non-stationary, with dynamics that change over time. This can make it difficult for the algorithm to learn an optimal policy that is robust to these changes.

In conclusion, while the RPG algorithm has shown promising results in various applications, it is important to be aware of these challenges and to consider them when applying the algorithm to real-world problems.

## Chapter 4: Model Predictive Control

### Introduction

Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful control strategy that has found widespread application in various fields, including robotics. This chapter will delve into the theory and applications of MPC in the context of underactuated robotics. 

Underactuated robotics refers to robots that have fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom. This results in a redundancy in the system, which can be exploited to achieve more complex and natural movements. However, controlling these systems can be challenging due to the non-linearities and uncertainties inherent in the system. 

Model Predictive Control provides a systematic approach to control these systems. It uses a mathematical model of the system to predict its future behavior and then uses this prediction to calculate the control inputs. This approach allows for the incorporation of constraints and the optimization of performance metrics, making it particularly suited to underactuated robotics.

In this chapter, we will first introduce the basic principles of Model Predictive Control, including its mathematical formulation and key components. We will then explore how these principles can be applied to underactuated robotics. We will discuss the challenges and opportunities presented by the use of MPC in this context, and provide examples of its application in real-world scenarios.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the theory and applications of Model Predictive Control in underactuated robotics. They should be able to apply these principles to their own work in this field, and should be equipped with the knowledge to explore further developments in this exciting area of research.




#### 3.3c Challenges and Limitations

While the Randomized Policy Gradient (RPG) algorithm has shown promising results in various applications, it is not without its challenges and limitations. In this section, we will discuss some of these challenges and how they can be addressed.

##### Computational Complexity

The RPG algorithm is a gradient-based method, which means it requires the computation of the gradient of the cost function with respect to the policy parameters. This can be computationally intensive, especially for complex systems with high-dimensional state spaces. The computational complexity can be reduced by using approximation methods, such as finite difference approximations, but this can lead to inaccuracies in the gradient estimates.

##### Policy Convergence

The RPG algorithm relies on the policy parameters to converge to a solution. However, in practice, this may not always happen due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm. The policy parameters may oscillate or fail to converge, leading to suboptimal solutions. Techniques such as policy smoothing and regularization can be used to improve policy convergence.

##### Robustness to Noise

The RPG algorithm is sensitive to noise in the system dynamics. Small perturbations in the system can lead to large variations in the gradient estimates, making it difficult to learn an optimal policy. Techniques such as robust optimization and adaptive filtering can be used to mitigate the effects of noise.

##### Generalization to Different Tasks

The RPG algorithm is designed to learn a policy for a specific task. It may not generalize well to other tasks, especially if the tasks have different dynamics or reward functions. Techniques such as transfer learning and policy distillation can be used to improve the generalization ability of the RPG algorithm.

Despite these challenges and limitations, the RPG algorithm remains a powerful tool for learning optimal control policies in a wide range of applications. By understanding and addressing these challenges, we can continue to improve and expand the applications of the RPG algorithm in underactuated robotics and beyond.




#### 3.4a Temporal Difference Learning

Temporal Difference Learning (TD Learning) is a type of model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that is used to approximate the value function of a system. The value function is a function that maps states to their expected future reward. TD Learning is particularly useful in systems where the dynamics are not fully known or are too complex to model accurately.

##### Basic Concepts

The TD Learning algorithm operates on the principle of temporal difference, which is the difference in reward between successive time steps. The algorithm maintains an estimate of the value function, denoted as $V(s)$, for each state $s$ in the system. The estimate is updated at each time step $t$ based on the temporal difference $\delta_t = r_t + V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)$, where $r_t$ is the reward received at time $t$ and $s_{t+1}$ is the next state.

The update rule for the value function estimate is given by:

$$
V(s_t) \leftarrow V(s_t) + \alpha \delta_t
$$

where $\alpha$ is the learning rate, which controls the step size of the update.

##### Policy Evaluation

The TD Learning algorithm can be used for policy evaluation, which is the process of evaluating the performance of a policy. The policy is represented by a set of state-action pairs $(s, a)$, where $s$ is the current state and $a$ is the action taken. The value function is updated for each state-action pair based on the temporal difference.

The update rule for the value function estimate is given by:

$$
V(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow V(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \delta_t
$$

where $\delta_t = r_t + V(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) - V(s_t, a_t)$.

##### Policy Improvement

The TD Learning algorithm can also be used for policy improvement, which is the process of improving the policy based on the current value function estimate. The policy is improved by selecting the action that maximizes the value function estimate at each state.

The update rule for the policy is given by:

$$
\pi(s_t) \leftarrow \arg\max_{a \in A} V(s_t, a)
$$

where $A$ is the set of available actions at state $s_t$.

##### Advantages and Limitations

The TD Learning algorithm has several advantages. It is a model-free algorithm, which means it does not require a model of the system. It is also able to handle non-stationary systems, where the dynamics change over time. However, it can be sensitive to noise and may not converge to the optimal policy.

#### 3.4b Q-Learning

Q-Learning is another popular model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that is used to approximate the action-value function of a system. The action-value function is a function that maps states and actions to their expected future reward. Q-Learning is particularly useful in systems where the dynamics are not fully known or are too complex to model accurately.

##### Basic Concepts

The Q-Learning algorithm operates on the principle of action-value, which is the expected future reward for taking a particular action in a given state. The algorithm maintains an estimate of the action-value function, denoted as $Q(s, a)$, for each state-action pair $(s, a)$ in the system. The estimate is updated at each time step $t$ based on the temporal difference $\delta_t = r_t + Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) - Q(s_t, a_t)$, where $r_t$ is the reward received at time $t$ and $s_{t+1}$ and $a_{t+1}$ are the next state and action, respectively.

The update rule for the action-value function estimate is given by:

$$
Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \delta_t
$$

where $\alpha$ is the learning rate, which controls the step size of the update.

##### Policy Evaluation

The Q-Learning algorithm can be used for policy evaluation, which is the process of evaluating the performance of a policy. The policy is represented by a set of state-action pairs $(s, a)$, where $s$ is the current state and $a$ is the action taken. The action-value function is updated for each state-action pair based on the temporal difference.

The update rule for the action-value function estimate is given by:

$$
Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \delta_t
$$

where $\delta_t = r_t + Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) - Q(s_t, a_t)$.

##### Policy Improvement

The Q-Learning algorithm can also be used for policy improvement, which is the process of improving the policy based on the current action-value function estimate. The policy is improved by selecting the action that maximizes the action-value function estimate at each state.

The update rule for the policy is given by:

$$
\pi(s_t) \leftarrow \arg\max_{a \in A} Q(s_t, a)
$$

where $A$ is the set of available actions at state $s_t$.

##### Advantages and Limitations

The Q-Learning algorithm has several advantages. It is a model-free algorithm, which means it does not require a model of the system. It is also able to handle non-stationary systems, where the dynamics change over time. However, it can be sensitive to noise and may not converge to the optimal policy.

#### 3.4c Applications in Robotics

The reward function is defined as the distance between the robot's hand and the ball. The robot learns to move its hand towards the ball, and to adjust its position and orientation based on the ball's trajectory.

Another application of TD Learning in robotics is in the development of a robot that can learn to navigate through a cluttered environment. The robot uses TD Learning to learn the optimal policy for navigating through the environment, which is represented as a sequence of actions. The reward function is defined as the distance between the robot's current position and its goal position. The robot learns to navigate through the environment by taking small steps and adjusting its position based on the feedback from the environment.

##### Q-Learning in Robotics

The robot learns to manipulate objects by taking small actions and adjusting its actions based on the feedback from the environment.

Another application of Q-Learning in robotics is in the development of a robot that can learn to interact with humans. The robot uses Q-Learning to learn the optimal policy for interacting with humans, which is represented as a sequence of actions. The reward function is defined as the success rate of the interaction task. The robot learns to interact with humans by taking small actions and adjusting its actions based on the feedback from the environment.

In conclusion, reinforcement learning algorithms, such as TD Learning and Q-Learning, have proven to be powerful tools in the field of robotics. They allow robots to learn complex tasks without the need for explicit knowledge about the environment. This makes them particularly useful in underactuated robotics, where traditional control methods are difficult to implement.

## Chapter: Chapter 4: Feedback Control

### Introduction

In the realm of robotics, feedback control plays a pivotal role. It is a control system where the output is measured and used to adjust the input. This chapter, "Feedback Control," will delve into the intricacies of this concept, its importance, and its application in underactuated robotics.

Underactuated robotics, as we have learned in previous chapters, deals with robots that have fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom. This results in a significant challenge in controlling the robot's movements. Feedback control, with its ability to adjust the input based on the output, provides a solution to this challenge.

In this chapter, we will explore the principles of feedback control, its implementation in underactuated robotics, and the benefits it offers. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of feedback control in underactuated robotics, and how these can be addressed.

The chapter will also cover the mathematical models and equations that govern feedback control. For instance, the transfer function of a feedback control system can be represented as `$G(s) = \frac{K}{Ts + 1}$`, where `$K$` is the gain and `$T$` is the time constant.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of feedback control and its role in underactuated robotics. They should be able to apply this knowledge to design and implement feedback control systems in their own underactuated robots.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of feedback control, making it an essential read for anyone interested in the field of underactuated robotics. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field, this chapter will equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to navigate the complexities of feedback control in underactuated robotics.




#### 3.4b Q-Learning

Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that is used to approximate the action-value function of a system. The action-value function is a function that maps states and actions to their expected future reward. Q-Learning is particularly useful in systems where the dynamics are not fully known or are too complex to model accurately.

##### Basic Concepts

The Q-Learning algorithm operates on the principle of learning the optimal policy by iteratively updating the Q-values, which represent the expected future reward for taking a particular action in a given state. The Q-values are updated based on the temporal difference between the expected and actual reward.

The Q-values are represented as a table, where each entry $Q(s,a)$ represents the Q-value for state $s$ and action $a$. The Q-values are updated at each time step $t$ based on the temporal difference $\delta_t = r_t + V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)$, where $r_t$ is the reward received at time $t$ and $V(s_{t+1})$ is the value of the next state.

The update rule for the Q-values is given by:

$$
Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \delta_t
$$

where $\alpha$ is the learning rate, which controls the step size of the update.

##### Policy Evaluation

The Q-Learning algorithm can be used for policy evaluation, which is the process of evaluating the performance of a policy. The policy is represented by a set of state-action pairs $(s, a)$, where $s$ is the current state and $a$ is the action taken. The Q-values are updated for each state-action pair based on the temporal difference.

The update rule for the Q-values is given by:

$$
Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \delta_t
$$

where $\delta_t = r_t + V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)$.

##### Policy Improvement

The Q-Learning algorithm can also be used for policy improvement, which is the process of improving the policy based on the current Q-values. The policy is improved by selecting the action that maximizes the Q-value for each state.

The update rule for the policy is given by:

$$
\pi(s_t) \leftarrow \arg\max_{a \in A(s_t)} Q(s_t, a)
$$

where $A(s_t)$ is the set of actions available in state $s_t$.

#### 3.4c Applications in Robotics

Q-Learning and other model-free value methods have found extensive applications in the field of robotics. These methods are particularly useful in situations where the robot's environment is dynamic and unpredictable, making it difficult to develop a detailed model of the environment.

##### Robot Navigation

One of the most common applications of Q-Learning in robotics is in the field of navigation. Robots often need to navigate through complex environments to reach a desired goal. Q-Learning can be used to learn the optimal policy for navigation, by updating the Q-values for each state-action pair based on the temporal difference between the expected and actual reward.

For example, consider a robot navigating through a maze. The robot's state is represented by its current position in the maze, and the actions available to the robot are the possible movements (e.g., north, south, east, west). The reward for the robot is the distance to the goal, which is represented as a negative value (smaller is better). The Q-Learning algorithm can be used to learn the optimal policy for navigation, by iteratively updating the Q-values for each state-action pair based on the temporal difference between the expected and actual reward.

##### Robot Manipulation

Q-Learning can also be applied to robot manipulation tasks, where the robot needs to learn how to interact with its environment to achieve a desired goal. For example, consider a robot trying to pick up an object. The robot's state is represented by its current position and orientation, and the actions available to the robot are the possible movements of its end-effector. The reward for the robot is the success of the pick-up task, which is represented as a binary value (1 for success, 0 for failure).

The Q-Learning algorithm can be used to learn the optimal policy for the pick-up task, by iteratively updating the Q-values for each state-action pair based on the temporal difference between the expected and actual reward. This allows the robot to learn how to interact with its environment to achieve the desired goal.

##### Robot Learning

In addition to navigation and manipulation, Q-Learning can also be used for robot learning, where the robot needs to learn how to perform a complex task by interacting with its environment. For example, consider a robot learning to play a game. The robot's state is represented by its current position and the game state, and the actions available to the robot are the possible moves in the game. The reward for the robot is the score in the game, which is represented as a numerical value.

The Q-Learning algorithm can be used to learn the optimal policy for the game, by iteratively updating the Q-values for each state-action pair based on the temporal difference between the expected and actual reward. This allows the robot to learn how to play the game by interacting with its environment.

In conclusion, Q-Learning and other model-free value methods have proven to be powerful tools in the field of robotics, enabling robots to learn how to navigate, manipulate, and learn in complex and dynamic environments.

## Chapter: Chapter 4: Robot Dynamics

### Introduction

The study of robot dynamics is a critical aspect of underactuated robotics. This chapter, "Robot Dynamics," delves into the fundamental principles and theories that govern the movement and behavior of robots. It is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the forces and torques that act on a robot, and how these forces and torques are influenced by the robot's environment and its own physical characteristics.

Underactuated robotics, as the name suggests, deals with robots that have fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom they possess. This is a significant departure from traditional robotics, where the number of actuators and degrees of freedom are typically equal. The study of robot dynamics in the context of underactuated robotics is therefore particularly challenging and rewarding.

In this chapter, we will explore the mathematical models that describe the dynamics of robots. These models, expressed in terms of differential equations, provide a quantitative description of the forces and torques acting on a robot. We will also discuss the concept of equilibrium and stability, and how these properties are influenced by the dynamics of the robot.

We will also delve into the practical applications of these theories. For instance, we will discuss how the principles of robot dynamics can be used to design and control underactuated robots. We will also explore how these principles can be used to solve real-world problems, such as robot navigation and manipulation.

It provides a solid foundation in the theory of robot dynamics, while also highlighting its practical applications. Whether you are a student seeking to understand the fundamentals, or a researcher looking to deepen your understanding, this chapter will serve as a valuable resource.

As we delve into the world of robot dynamics, we will encounter a variety of mathematical concepts and equations. These will be formatted using the TeX and LaTeX style syntax, rendered using the MathJax library. For example, inline math will be written as `$y_j(n)$` and equations as `$$

## Chapter 4: Analytical Optimal Control:




### Section: 4.1 Analytical optimal control with the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman sufficiency theorem:

#### 4.1a Introduction to Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Sufficiency Theorem

The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) sufficiency theorem is a fundamental result in the field of optimal control theory. It provides a necessary and sufficient condition for optimality, and is particularly useful in the context of underactuated robotics.

The theorem is named after the mathematicians William Rowan Hamilton, Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, and Richard Bellman. Hamilton and Jacobi contributed to the development of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes the evolution of a system's state over time. Bellman, on the other hand, introduced the principle of optimality, which states that an optimal control policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are, the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with regard to the state resulting from the first decision.

The HJB sufficiency theorem can be stated as follows:

If a function $V(x,t)$ satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation

$$
\min_u \left\{ \mathcal{A} V(x,t) + C(t,x,u) \right\} = 0,
$$

where $\mathcal{A}$ represents the stochastic differentiation operator, and subject to the terminal condition

$$
V(x,T) = D(x)\,\!,
$$

then $V(x,t)$ is a solution of the primal problem.

In other words, if a function $V(x,t)$ satisfies the HJB equation and the terminal condition, then $V(x,t)$ is a solution of the primal problem. This means that $V(x,t)$ represents the optimal value function, and the optimal control policy can be obtained by minimizing the right-hand side of the HJB equation.

The HJB sufficiency theorem is particularly useful in the context of underactuated robotics, where the number of control inputs is less than the number of system states. In such cases, the HJB equation can be used to derive the optimal control policy, which can then be used to control the robot in a way that minimizes a certain cost function.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the HJB sufficiency theorem and its applications in underactuated robotics. We will also discuss some of the key concepts and techniques that are used in the context of the HJB sufficiency theorem, such as the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, the principle of optimality, and the stochastic HJB equation.

#### 4.1b Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Necessary Conditions

The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) necessary conditions are a set of conditions that must be satisfied by the optimal control policy in order to be optimal. These conditions are derived from the HJB sufficiency theorem and provide a necessary condition for optimality.

The HJB necessary conditions can be stated as follows:

If a function $V(x,t)$ satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation

$$
\min_u \left\{ \mathcal{A} V(x,t) + C(t,x,u) \right\} = 0,
$$

where $\mathcal{A}$ represents the stochastic differentiation operator, and subject to the terminal condition

$$
V(x,T) = D(x)\,\!,
$$

then $V(x,t)$ is a solution of the primal problem.

In other words, if a function $V(x,t)$ satisfies the HJB equation and the terminal condition, then $V(x,t)$ is a solution of the primal problem. This means that $V(x,t)$ represents the optimal value function, and the optimal control policy can be obtained by minimizing the right-hand side of the HJB equation.

The HJB necessary conditions are particularly useful in the context of underactuated robotics, where the number of control inputs is less than the number of system states. In such cases, the HJB equation can be used to derive the optimal control policy, which can then be used to control the robot in a way that minimizes a certain cost function.

The HJB necessary conditions are also closely related to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, which describes the evolution of a system's state over time. The Hamilton-Jacobi equation is a key component of the HJB equation, and its solutions provide a way to solve the HJB equation.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman necessary conditions and their applications in underactuated robotics. We will also discuss some of the key concepts and techniques that are used in the context of the HJB necessary conditions, such as the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, the principle of optimality, and the stochastic HJB equation.

#### 4.1c Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Sufficiency Theorem in Robotics

The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) sufficiency theorem is a powerful tool in the field of robotics, particularly in the context of underactuated systems. It provides a mathematical framework for deriving optimal control policies that can be used to control a robot in a way that minimizes a certain cost function.

The HJB sufficiency theorem is based on the principle of optimality, which states that an optimal control policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are, the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with regard to the state resulting from the first decision. This principle is fundamental to the HJB sufficiency theorem and is used to derive the necessary conditions for optimality.

The HJB sufficiency theorem can be stated as follows:

If a function $V(x,t)$ satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation

$$
\min_u \left\{ \mathcal{A} V(x,t) + C(t,x,u) \right\} = 0,
$$

where $\mathcal{A}$ represents the stochastic differentiation operator, and subject to the terminal condition

$$
V(x,T) = D(x)\,\!,
$$

then $V(x,t)$ is a solution of the primal problem.

This means that $V(x,t)$ represents the optimal value function, and the optimal control policy can be obtained by minimizing the right-hand side of the HJB equation.

We will also discuss some of the key concepts and techniques that are used in the context of the HJB sufficiency theorem, such as the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, the principle of optimality, and the stochastic HJB equation.

#### 4.1d Applications in Robotics

The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) sufficiency theorem has found extensive applications in the field of robotics, particularly in the context of underactuated systems. This section will explore some of these applications, focusing on the use of the HJB theorem in the control of robotic systems.

One of the key applications of the HJB theorem in robotics is in the design of optimal control policies. The HJB theorem provides a mathematical framework for deriving these policies, which can then be used to control a robot in a way that minimizes a certain cost function. This is particularly useful in underactuated systems, where the number of control inputs is less than the number of system states.

The HJB theorem is also used in the design of optimal control policies for robotic systems with stochastic dynamics. In these systems, the state of the system is not fully observable, and the control policy must be designed to account for this uncertainty. The HJB theorem provides a way to do this, by incorporating the stochastic dynamics into the control policy.

Another important application of the HJB theorem in robotics is in the design of optimal control policies for robotic systems with nonlinear dynamics. The HJB theorem can be extended to handle nonlinear dynamics, making it a powerful tool for the control of these systems.

The HJB theorem is also used in the design of optimal control policies for robotic systems with time-varying dynamics. In these systems, the dynamics of the system change over time, and the control policy must be designed to account for this. The HJB theorem provides a way to do this, by incorporating the time-varying dynamics into the control policy.

In addition to these applications, the HJB theorem is also used in the design of optimal control policies for robotic systems with multiple objectives. In these systems, the control policy must be designed to optimize multiple objectives simultaneously. The HJB theorem provides a way to do this, by incorporating the multiple objectives into the control policy.

In conclusion, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman theorem is a powerful tool in the field of robotics, with a wide range of applications. Its ability to handle underactuated systems, stochastic dynamics, nonlinear dynamics, time-varying dynamics, and multiple objectives makes it an essential tool for the design of optimal control policies in robotics.




#### 4.1b Applications of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Sufficiency Theorem

The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) sufficiency theorem has a wide range of applications in various fields, including underactuated robotics. In this section, we will explore some of these applications, focusing on the use of the HJB theorem in the context of underactuated robotics.

##### Underactuated Robotics

In underactuated robotics, the number of control inputs is less than the number of system states. This is often the case in robotic systems where the number of actuators is limited, but the system requires precise control. The HJB theorem provides a powerful tool for deriving the optimal control policy in such cases.

Consider a robotic system with $n$ states and $m$ control inputs. The system dynamics can be represented as:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr)
$$

where $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the state vector, $\mathbf{u}(t)$ is the control vector, and $f$ is the system dynamics function. The goal is to find the control policy $\mathbf{u}^*(t)$ that minimizes the cost function $J(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u})$:

$$
\mathbf{u}^*(t) = \arg\min_{\mathbf{u}(t)} J(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u})
$$

The HJB theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for optimality. If a function $V(\mathbf{x},t)$ satisfies the HJB equation:

$$
\min_{\mathbf{u}(t)} \left\{ \nabla V(\mathbf{x},t) \cdot f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}) \right\} = 0
$$

where $C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u})$ is the cost function, and the terminal condition $V(\mathbf{x},T) = D(\mathbf{x})$ is satisfied, then $V(\mathbf{x},t)$ is the optimal value function, and the optimal control policy is given by:

$$
\mathbf{u}^*(t) = \arg\min_{\mathbf{u}(t)} \left\{ \nabla V(\mathbf{x},t) \cdot f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}) \right\}
$$

This approach allows us to derive the optimal control policy for underactuated robotic systems, taking into account the system dynamics and the cost function.

##### Stochastic Control Problems

The HJB theorem can also be extended to stochastic control problems. In these problems, the system dynamics and the cost function are stochastic, and the goal is to find the optimal control policy that minimizes the expected cost.

Consider a stochastic control problem with $n$ states and $m$ control inputs. The system dynamics can be represented as:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t)
$$

where $\mathbf{w}(t)$ is the stochastic disturbance. The cost function is given by:

$$
J(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}) = E\left[ C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}) \right]
$$

The HJB theorem for stochastic control problems is given by:

$$
\min_{\mathbf{u}(t)} \left\{ \nabla V(\mathbf{x},t) \cdot f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + E\left[ C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}) \right] \right\} = 0
$$

subject to the terminal condition $V(\mathbf{x},T) = D(\mathbf{x})$. This equation represents the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.

In conclusion, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman sufficiency theorem is a powerful tool for solving optimal control problems in various fields, including underactuated robotics and stochastic control problems. Its applications are vast and continue to be explored in ongoing research.




#### 4.1c Case Studies

In this section, we will explore some case studies that illustrate the application of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) sufficiency theorem in underactuated robotics. These case studies will provide a practical understanding of the concepts discussed in the previous sections.

##### Case Study 1: Optimal Control of a Two-Degree-of-Freedom Robotic Arm

Consider a two-degree-of-freedom robotic arm with two revolute joints. The arm is controlled by two torque inputs, one for each joint. The goal is to move the arm from an initial configuration to a desired final configuration in minimum time, while minimizing the joint torque.

The system dynamics can be represented as:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} \dot{\theta}_1(t) \\ \dot{\theta}_2(t) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \tau_1(t) / I_1 \\ \tau_2(t) / I_2 \end{bmatrix}
$$

where $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the state vector, $\tau_1(t)$ and $\tau_2(t)$ are the joint torques, and $I_1$ and $I_2$ are the moments of inertia of the joints. The cost function is given by:

$$
C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \tau_1^2(t) + \tau_2^2(t) \right) + \frac{1}{2} \left( (\theta_1(t) - \theta_1_{des})^2 + (\theta_2(t) - \theta_2_{des})^2 \right)
$$

where $\theta_1_{des}$ and $\theta_2_{des}$ are the desired joint angles. The HJB equation for this system is:

$$
\min_{\mathbf{u}(t)} \left\{ \nabla V(\mathbf{x},t) \cdot \begin{bmatrix} \tau_1(t) / I_1 \\ \tau_2(t) / I_2 \end{bmatrix} + C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}) \right\} = 0
$$

The optimal control policy is then given by:

$$
\mathbf{u}^*(t) = \arg\min_{\mathbf{u}(t)} \left\{ \nabla V(\mathbf{x},t) \cdot \begin{bmatrix} \tau_1(t) / I_1 \\ \tau_2(t) / I_2 \end{bmatrix} + C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}) \right\}
$$

##### Case Study 2: Optimal Control of a Three-Degree-of-Freedom Robotic Hand

The system dynamics can be represented as:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} \dot{\theta}_1(t) \\ \dot{\theta}_2(t) \\ \dot{\theta}_3(t) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \tau_1(t) / I_1 \\ \tau_2(t) / I_2 \\ \tau_3(t) / I_3 \end{bmatrix}
$$

where $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the state vector, $\tau_1(t)$, $\tau_2(t)$, and $\tau_3(t)$ are the joint torques, and $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$ are the moments of inertia of the joints. The cost function is given by:

$$
C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \tau_1^2(t) + \tau_2^2(t) + \tau_3^2(t) \right) + \frac{1}{2} \left( (\theta_1(t) - \theta_1_{des})^2 + (\theta_2(t) - \theta_2_{des})^2 + (\theta_3(t) - \theta_3_{des})^2 \right)
$$

where $\theta_1_{des}$, $\theta_2_{des}$, and $\theta_3_{des}$ are the desired joint angles. The HJB equation for this system is:

$$
\min_{\mathbf{u}(t)} \left\{ \nabla V(\mathbf{x},t) \cdot \begin{bmatrix} \tau_1(t) / I_1 \\ \tau_2(t) / I_2 \\ \tau_3(t) / I_3 \end{bmatrix} + C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}) \right\} = 0
$$

The optimal control policy is then given by:

$$
\mathbf{u}^*(t) = \arg\min_{\mathbf{u}(t)} \left\{ \nabla V(\mathbf{x},t) \cdot \begin{bmatrix} \tau_1(t) / I_1 \\ \tau_2(t) / I_2 \\ \tau_3(t) / I_3 \end{bmatrix} + C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}) \right\}
$$

These case studies illustrate the application of the HJB theorem in underactuated robotics. The HJB theorem provides a powerful tool for deriving the optimal control policy in such cases, taking into account the system dynamics, cost function, and desired state.




#### 4.2a Introduction to Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle

The Pontryagin's minimum principle is a cornerstone in the field of optimal control theory. It provides a set of necessary conditions for an optimal control. The principle is named after the Russian mathematician Lev Pontryagin who, along with his students, first introduced it.

The principle is based on the Hamiltonian function, which is a function that combines the system dynamics, the cost function, and the control inputs. The Hamiltonian function is defined as:

$$
H(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{p}) = f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}) + g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{p})
$$

where $\mathbf{x}$ is the state vector, $\mathbf{u}$ is the control vector, $\mathbf{p}$ is the costate vector, $f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u})$ is the system dynamics, and $g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{p})$ is the cost function.

The Pontryagin's minimum principle states that for an optimal control $\mathbf{u}^*(t)$, the Hamiltonian $H(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{p})$ must be minimized over all controls $\mathbf{u}(t)$ at each time $t$. This can be formally written as:

$$
H(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}^*(t),\mathbf{p}(t)) \leq H(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}(t),\mathbf{p}(t))
$$

for all $\mathbf{u}(t)$ and all $t$.

The principle also introduces the costate equation, which describes the evolution of the costate vector $\mathbf{p}(t)$. The costate equation is given by:

$$
-\dot{\mathbf{p}}(t) = \frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{x}}(t)
$$

The Pontryagin's minimum principle is a powerful tool in optimal control theory. It provides a systematic way to find the optimal control and the corresponding state trajectory. However, it is important to note that the principle only provides necessary conditions for optimality. Therefore, satisfying the conditions does not guarantee optimality, but violating them rules out optimality.

In the next section, we will explore the application of the Pontryagin's minimum principle in underactuated robotics.

#### 4.2b Optimal Control with Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle

The Pontryagin's minimum principle is a powerful tool for finding optimal controls in a wide range of applications. In this section, we will delve deeper into the application of the principle in underactuated robotics.

Consider a dynamical system with state vector $\mathbf{x}(t)$ and control vector $\mathbf{u}(t)$, such that the state evolves according to the system dynamics $f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u})$. The goal is to find the optimal control $\mathbf{u}^*(t)$ that minimizes the cost function $g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{p})$.

The Pontryagin's minimum principle provides a set of necessary conditions for the optimal control. These conditions are derived from the Hamiltonian function $H(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{p})$, which combines the system dynamics, the cost function, and the control inputs.

The principle states that for an optimal control $\mathbf{u}^*(t)$, the Hamiltonian $H(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}^*(t),\mathbf{p}(t))$ must be minimized over all controls $\mathbf{u}(t)$ at each time $t$. This can be formally written as:

$$
H(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}^*(t),\mathbf{p}(t)) \leq H(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}(t),\mathbf{p}(t))
$$

for all $\mathbf{u}(t)$ and all $t$.

In addition to the minimization of the Hamiltonian, the principle also introduces the costate equation, which describes the evolution of the costate vector $\mathbf{p}(t)$. The costate equation is given by:

$$
-\dot{\mathbf{p}}(t) = \frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{x}}(t)
$$

The costate equation provides a way to compute the costate vector $\mathbf{p}(t)$ as the system evolves. This is crucial for the implementation of the Pontryagin's minimum principle, as the optimal control $\mathbf{u}^*(t)$ is determined by the costate vector $\mathbf{p}(t)$.

In the next section, we will explore the application of the Pontryagin's minimum principle in a specific example of underactuated robotics.

#### 4.2c Case Studies

In this section, we will explore some case studies that illustrate the application of the Pontryagin's minimum principle in underactuated robotics. These case studies will provide a practical understanding of the concepts discussed in the previous sections.

##### Case Study 1: Optimal Control of a Two-Degree-of-Freedom Robotic Arm

Consider a two-degree-of-freedom robotic arm with state vector $\mathbf{x}(t) = [x_1(t) \quad x_2(t)]^T$ and control vector $\mathbf{u}(t) = [u_1(t) \quad u_2(t)]^T$. The system dynamics are given by:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} x_2(t) \\ -x_1(t) + u_1(t) \end{bmatrix}
$$

The cost function is defined as:

$$
g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{p}) = \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{x}^T(t) \mathbf{Q} \mathbf{x}(t) + \mathbf{u}^T(t) \mathbf{R} \mathbf{u}(t)
$$

where $\mathbf{Q}$ and $\mathbf{R}$ are positive-definite matrices. The Hamiltonian is then given by:

$$
H(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{p}) = \mathbf{x}^T(t) \mathbf{Q} \mathbf{x}(t) + \mathbf{u}^T(t) \mathbf{R} \mathbf{u}(t) + \mathbf{p}^T(t) \begin{bmatrix} x_2(t) \\ -x_1(t) + u_1(t) \end{bmatrix}
$$

The Pontryagin's minimum principle can be applied to find the optimal control $\mathbf{u}^*(t)$ and the corresponding costate vector $\mathbf{p}^*(t)$. The optimal control is determined by the costate vector $\mathbf{p}^*(t)$, which satisfies the costate equation:

$$
-\dot{\mathbf{p}}(t) = \frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{x}}(t) = \mathbf{Q} \mathbf{x}(t) + \mathbf{p}^T(t) \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_2(t) \\ -x_1(t) + u_1(t) \end{bmatrix}
$$

The optimal control $\mathbf{u}^*(t)$ is then given by:

$$
\mathbf{u}^*(t) = \begin{bmatrix} u_1^*(t) \\ u_2^*(t) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -p_1^*(t) \\ p_2^*(t) \end{bmatrix}
$$

where $p_1^*(t)$ and $p_2^*(t)$ are the components of the costate vector $\mathbf{p}^*(t)$.

##### Case Study 2: Optimal Control of a Three-Degree-of-Freedom Robotic Hand

Consider a three-degree-of-freedom robotic hand with state vector $\mathbf{x}(t) = [x_1(t) \quad x_2(t) \quad x_3(t)]^T$ and control vector $\mathbf{u}(t) = [u_1(t) \quad u_2(t) \quad u_3(t)]^T$. The system dynamics are given by:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} x_2(t) \\ x_3(t) \\ -x_1(t) + u_1(t) \end{bmatrix}
$$

The cost function and Hamiltonian are defined similarly to the previous case study. The Pontryagin's minimum principle can be applied to find the optimal control $\mathbf{u}^*(t)$ and the corresponding costate vector $\mathbf{p}^*(t)$. The optimal control is determined by the costate vector $\mathbf{p}^*(t)$, which satisfies the costate equation:

$$
-\dot{\mathbf{p}}(t) = \frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{x}}(t) = \mathbf{Q} \mathbf{x}(t) + \mathbf{p}^T(t) \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_2(t) \\ x_3(t) \\ -x_1(t) + u_1(t) \end{bmatrix}
$$

The optimal control $\mathbf{u}^*(t)$ is then given by:

$$
\mathbf{u}^*(t) = \begin{bmatrix} u_1^*(t) \\ u_2^*(t) \\ u_3^*(t) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -p_1^*(t) \\ p_2^*(t) \\ p_3^*(t) \end{bmatrix}
$$

where $p_1^*(t)$, $p_2^*(t)$, and $p_3^*(t)$ are the components of the costate vector $\mathbf{p}^*(t)$.

These case studies illustrate the application of the Pontryagin's minimum principle in underactuated robotics. The optimal control and costate vector can be computed using numerical methods, and the resulting control law can be used to control the robotic system.




#### 4.2b Applications of Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle

The Pontryagin's minimum principle is a powerful tool in the field of optimal control theory. It has been widely applied in various fields, including robotics, aerospace engineering, and economics. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of the Pontryagin's minimum principle in underactuated robotics.

##### Underactuated Robotics

Underactuated robotics is a field that deals with robots that have fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) of their end-effector. This results in a redundancy in the system, which can be exploited to achieve more complex and natural movements. The Pontryagin's minimum principle can be used to find the optimal control inputs that will result in the desired end-effector trajectory.

Consider a simple example of a two-DOF underactuated robot. The robot has only one actuator, which controls the position of the end-effector. The goal is to move the end-effector from an initial position to a final position in the shortest time possible. The Pontryagin's minimum principle can be used to find the optimal control inputs that will minimize the time required to reach the final position.

The Hamiltonian for this system can be written as:

$$
H(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{p}) = \dot{\mathbf{x}}^2 + \lambda \left( \mathbf{x}_{des} - \mathbf{x} \right)
$$

where $\mathbf{x}$ is the position of the end-effector, $\mathbf{u}$ is the control input, $\mathbf{p}$ is the costate vector, $\mathbf{x}_{des}$ is the desired position, and $\lambda$ is the costate associated with the desired position.

The Pontryagin's minimum principle then states that the control input $\mathbf{u}^*(t)$ that minimizes the Hamiltonian must satisfy:

$$
\frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{u}} = 2\dot{\mathbf{x}} + \lambda = 0
$$

This equation gives the optimal control input as:

$$
\mathbf{u}^*(t) = -\frac{1}{2}\lambda
$$

The costate equation can be used to find the evolution of the costate $\lambda(t)$. The solution to this equation gives the optimal control inputs and the corresponding end-effector trajectory.

In conclusion, the Pontryagin's minimum principle is a powerful tool in the field of underactuated robotics. It allows us to find the optimal control inputs that will result in the desired end-effector trajectory. This principle has been widely applied in various fields and continues to be a topic of research in the field of optimal control theory.

#### 4.2c Challenges in Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle

While the Pontryagin's minimum principle is a powerful tool in the field of optimal control theory, it is not without its challenges. These challenges often arise due to the complexity of the systems being controlled and the assumptions made in the formulation of the principle.

##### Complexity of Systems

The Pontryagin's minimum principle is often applied to complex systems with many degrees of freedom. These systems can exhibit nonlinear dynamics and may be subject to external disturbances. The complexity of these systems can make it difficult to accurately model them and to determine the optimal control inputs.

For example, in the case of underactuated robotics, the redundancy in the system can lead to complex dynamics. The Pontryagin's minimum principle can be used to find the optimal control inputs, but these inputs may not always be feasible due to the complexity of the system dynamics.

##### Assumptions in Formulation

The Pontryagin's minimum principle is based on several assumptions, including the assumption that the system dynamics are continuous and differentiable. These assumptions may not always hold for real-world systems.

For instance, in the case of underactuated robotics, the system dynamics may involve discontinuities due to friction or other non-smooth effects. These discontinuities can make it difficult to apply the Pontryagin's minimum principle.

##### Computational Challenges

The Pontryagin's minimum principle involves solving a set of differential equations, which can be computationally intensive. This can be a challenge for systems with many degrees of freedom or for systems with complex dynamics.

For example, in the case of underactuated robotics, the optimal control inputs must be determined for each degree of freedom of the robot. This can involve solving a set of differential equations for each degree of freedom, which can be computationally demanding.

Despite these challenges, the Pontryagin's minimum principle remains a powerful tool in the field of optimal control theory. With careful formulation and appropriate modifications, it can be applied to a wide range of systems, including underactuated robots.




#### 4.2c Case Studies

In this section, we will explore some case studies that demonstrate the application of the Pontryagin's minimum principle in underactuated robotics.

##### Case Study 1: Underactuated Robotics in Factory Automation

In the field of factory automation, underactuated robots are often used to perform complex tasks that require precise positioning and movement. The Pontryagin's minimum principle can be used to find the optimal control inputs that will result in the desired end-effector trajectory.

Consider a simple example of a two-DOF underactuated robot used in a factory automation task. The robot has only one actuator, which controls the position of the end-effector. The goal is to move the end-effector from an initial position to a final position in the shortest time possible. The Pontryagin's minimum principle can be used to find the optimal control inputs that will minimize the time required to reach the final position.

The Hamiltonian for this system can be written as:

$$
H(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{p}) = \dot{\mathbf{x}}^2 + \lambda \left( \mathbf{x}_{des} - \mathbf{x} \right)
$$

where $\mathbf{x}$ is the position of the end-effector, $\mathbf{u}$ is the control input, $\mathbf{p}$ is the costate vector, $\mathbf{x}_{des}$ is the desired position, and $\lambda$ is the costate associated with the desired position.

The Pontryagin's minimum principle then states that the control input $\mathbf{u}^*(t)$ that minimizes the Hamiltonian must satisfy:

$$
\frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{u}} = 2\dot{\mathbf{x}} + \lambda = 0
$$

This equation gives the optimal control input as:

$$
\mathbf{u}^*(t) = -\frac{1}{2}\lambda
$$

The costate equation can be used to find the evolution of the costate $\mathbf{p}(t)$:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{p}} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{x}} = -2\dot{\mathbf{x}}
$$

Solving these equations simultaneously will give the optimal control inputs and the evolution of the costate, which can be used to control the underactuated robot in the factory automation task.

##### Case Study 2: Underactuated Robotics in Glass Recycling

Underactuated robots are also used in the challenging field of glass recycling. The Pontryagin's minimum principle can be used to find the optimal control inputs that will result in the desired end-effector trajectory in this complex and dynamic environment.

Consider a two-DOF underactuated robot used in a glass recycling plant. The robot has only one actuator, which controls the position of the end-effector. The goal is to move the end-effector from an initial position to a final position in the shortest time possible while avoiding collisions with other objects in the plant. The Pontryagin's minimum principle can be used to find the optimal control inputs that will minimize the time required to reach the final position while avoiding collisions.

The Hamiltonian for this system can be written as:

$$
H(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{p}) = \dot{\mathbf{x}}^2 + \lambda \left( \mathbf{x}_{des} - \mathbf{x} \right) + \mu \left( \mathbf{x}_{coll} - \mathbf{x} \right)
$$

where $\mathbf{x}$ is the position of the end-effector, $\mathbf{u}$ is the control input, $\mathbf{p}$ is the costate vector, $\mathbf{x}_{des}$ is the desired position, $\mathbf{x}_{coll}$ is the position of the nearest collision object, and $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are the costates associated with the desired position and collision avoidance, respectively.

The Pontryagin's minimum principle then states that the control input $\mathbf{u}^*(t)$ that minimizes the Hamiltonian must satisfy:

$$
\frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{u}} = 2\dot{\mathbf{x}} + \lambda \left( \mathbf{x}_{des} - \mathbf{x} \right) + \mu \left( \mathbf{x}_{coll} - \mathbf{x} \right) = 0
$$

This equation gives the optimal control input as:

$$
\mathbf{u}^*(t) = -\frac{1}{2}\lambda \mathbf{x}_{des} - \frac{1}{2}\mu \mathbf{x}_{coll}
$$

The costate equations can be used to find the evolution of the costates $\mathbf{p}(t)$ and $\mathbf{q}(t)$:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{p}} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{x}} = -2\dot{\mathbf{x}} - \lambda \left( \mathbf{x}_{des} - \mathbf{x} \right) - \mu \left( \mathbf{x}_{coll} - \mathbf{x} \right)
$$

$$
\dot{\mathbf{q}} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{x}_{coll}} = -2\dot{\mathbf{x}} - \mu \left( \mathbf{x}_{coll} - \mathbf{x} \right)
$$

Solving these equations simultaneously will give the optimal control inputs and the evolution of the costates, which can be used to control the underactuated robot in the glass recycling plant.




#### 4.3a Introduction to Trajectory Optimization

Trajectory optimization is a powerful tool in the field of underactuated robotics. It allows us to find the optimal trajectory for a robot to follow, given certain constraints. This is particularly useful in underactuated systems, where the number of actuators is less than the number of degrees of freedom. In such systems, the control inputs are often limited, and trajectory optimization can help us make the most of these limited resources.

The basic idea behind trajectory optimization is to find the control inputs that will result in the desired trajectory, while satisfying certain constraints. These constraints can be on the control inputs themselves, on the state of the system, or on the trajectory of the system. The goal is to find the control inputs that minimize a certain cost function, which represents the performance of the system.

The cost function can be defined in various ways, depending on the specific application. For example, in the case of a factory automation task, the cost function might be the time required to reach the final position. In other applications, the cost function might be the energy consumed by the robot, or the distance traveled by the robot.

The trajectory optimization problem can be formulated as a constrained optimization problem. The control inputs $\mathbf{u}(t)$ and the state of the system $\mathbf{x}(t)$ are the decision variables, and the constraints and the cost function are the objective function. The goal is to find the optimal values of the decision variables that minimize the objective function.

The Hamiltonian for the trajectory optimization problem can be written as:

$$
H(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{p}) = \dot{\mathbf{x}}^2 + \lambda \left( \mathbf{x}_{des} - \mathbf{x} \right)
$$

where $\mathbf{x}$ is the state of the system, $\mathbf{u}$ is the control input, $\mathbf{p}$ is the costate vector, $\mathbf{x}_{des}$ is the desired state, and $\lambda$ is the costate associated with the desired state.

The Pontryagin's minimum principle can be used to find the optimal control inputs and state trajectory that minimize the cost function. The Hamiltonian must be minimized with respect to the control inputs and the state trajectory, while satisfying the constraints. This results in a set of differential equations for the state trajectory and the costate vector, known as the Hamiltonian equations.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the theory and applications of trajectory optimization in underactuated robotics. We will discuss various techniques for solving the trajectory optimization problem, and explore some real-world applications.

#### 4.3b Techniques for Trajectory Optimization

There are several techniques for trajectory optimization, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. In this section, we will discuss some of the most commonly used techniques in underactuated robotics.

##### Pontryagin's Minimum Principle

As mentioned in the previous section, the Pontryagin's minimum principle is a powerful tool for trajectory optimization. It provides a set of differential equations, known as the Hamiltonian equations, that describe the optimal control inputs and state trajectory. The Hamiltonian equations are given by:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{p}}, \quad \dot{\mathbf{p}} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{x}}, \quad \dot{\mathbf{u}} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{x}}
$$

where $\mathbf{x}$ is the state of the system, $\mathbf{u}$ is the control input, $\mathbf{p}$ is the costate vector, and $H$ is the Hamiltonian.

The Pontryagin's minimum principle can be used to find the optimal control inputs and state trajectory that minimize the cost function, while satisfying the constraints. However, it requires the Hamiltonian to be continuously differentiable, which may not always be the case in underactuated systems.

##### Lagrange Multiplier Method

The Lagrange multiplier method is another popular technique for trajectory optimization. It involves introducing a new variable, known as the Lagrange multiplier, to incorporate the constraints into the cost function. The resulting optimization problem is then solved using standard techniques.

The Lagrange multiplier method can handle non-smooth cost functions and constraints, which makes it particularly useful in underactuated systems. However, it can be computationally intensive, especially for high-dimensional problems.

##### Genetic Algorithms

Genetic algorithms are a class of evolutionary computation techniques that can be used for trajectory optimization. They involve generating a population of potential solutions, and then evolving this population over generations using genetic operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation.

Genetic algorithms can handle non-convex and non-smooth cost functions and constraints, which makes them suitable for a wide range of underactuated systems. However, they can be slow to converge, and the quality of the solutions depends heavily on the initial population.

In the next section, we will discuss some applications of these techniques in underactuated robotics.

#### 4.3c Case Studies

In this section, we will explore some case studies that demonstrate the application of the techniques discussed in the previous section. These case studies will provide a practical understanding of how trajectory optimization is used in underactuated robotics.

##### Case Study 1: Quadrotor Helicopters

Quadrotor helicopters are a common example of underactuated systems. They have four rotors and three actuators, making them redundant and capable of performing complex maneuvers. Trajectory optimization is often used to compute trajectories for quadrotor helicopters, particularly for applications such as flying through a hoop or tossing a pole between two quadrotors.

The Pontryagin's minimum principle can be used to find the optimal control inputs and state trajectory for a quadrotor helicopter. The Hamiltonian for the system can be defined as:

$$
H(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{p}) = \frac{1}{2}m\mathbf{v}^2 + \frac{1}{2}I\mathbf{\omega}^2 + \mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{M}\mathbf{u}
$$

where $\mathbf{x}$ is the state vector, $\mathbf{u}$ is the control input vector, $\mathbf{p}$ is the costate vector, $m$ is the mass of the quadrotor, $\mathbf{v}$ is the linear velocity, $I$ is the moment of inertia, $\mathbf{\omega}$ is the angular velocity, and $\mathbf{M}$ is the mass matrix.

The constraints for the system can be defined as:

$$
\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{R}\mathbf{\omega} \times \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{u}
$$

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{v}
$$

$$
\dot{\mathbf{\omega}} = \frac{1}{I}\mathbf{M}\mathbf{u}
$$

where $\mathbf{R}$ is the rotation matrix.

##### Case Study 2: Manufacturing

Trajectory optimization is also used in manufacturing, particularly for controlling chemical processes and computing the desired path for robotic manipulators. The Lagrange multiplier method can be used to handle the constraints in these systems.

For example, consider a manufacturing process that involves moving a robot arm to a specific location. The cost function for this system can be defined as:

$$
J(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}) = \frac{1}{2}m\mathbf{v}^2 + \frac{1}{2}I\mathbf{\omega}^2 + \mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{M}\mathbf{u}
$$

The constraints for the system can be defined as:

$$
\mathbf{x}(0) = \mathbf{x}_0
$$

$$
\mathbf{x}(T) = \mathbf{x}_T
$$

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{v}
$$

$$
\dot{\mathbf{\omega}} = \frac{1}{I}\mathbf{M}\mathbf{u}
$$

where $\mathbf{x}_0$ and $\mathbf{x}_T$ are the initial and final positions of the robot arm, respectively.

The Lagrange multiplier method can be used to solve this optimization problem and find the optimal control inputs and state trajectory for the robot arm.

##### Case Study 3: Walking Robots

Trajectory optimization is also used in the field of walking robots. For example, one paper used trajectory optimization of bipedal gaits on a simple model to show that walking is energetically favorable for moving at a low speed and running is energetically favorable for moving at a high speed.

The Pontryagin's minimum principle can be used to find the optimal control inputs and state trajectory for a walking robot. The Hamiltonian for the system can be defined as:

$$
H(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{p}) = \frac{1}{2}m\mathbf{v}^2 + \frac{1}{2}I\mathbf{\omega}^2 + \mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{M}\mathbf{u}
$$

The constraints for the system can be defined as:

$$
\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{R}\mathbf{\omega} \times \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{u}
$$

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{v}
$$

$$
\dot{\mathbf{\omega}} = \frac{1}{I}\mathbf{M}\mathbf{u}
$$

where $\mathbf{x}$ is the state vector, $\mathbf{u}$ is the control input vector, $\mathbf{p}$ is the costate vector, $m$ is the mass of the walking robot, $\mathbf{v}$ is the linear velocity, $I$ is the moment of inertia, $\mathbf{\omega}$ is the angular velocity, and $\mathbf{M}$ is the mass matrix.

These case studies demonstrate the versatility and power of trajectory optimization in underactuated robotics. By using techniques such as the Pontryagin's minimum principle, the Lagrange multiplier method, and genetic algorithms, we can find optimal trajectories for a wide range of underactuated systems.




#### 4.3b Techniques for Trajectory Optimization

There are several techniques for trajectory optimization, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. In this section, we will discuss some of the most commonly used techniques in underactuated robotics.

##### Genetic Algorithms

Genetic algorithms (GAs) are a class of evolutionary algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection. They are particularly well-suited to trajectory optimization problems due to their ability to handle a wide range of constraints and cost functions.

The basic idea behind genetic algorithms is to evolve a population of potential solutions to the trajectory optimization problem. Each individual in the population represents a possible trajectory, and is evaluated based on a fitness function that represents the performance of the trajectory. The fittest individuals are then selected to reproduce, creating a new population. This process is repeated over multiple generations, with the hope that the population will evolve towards better solutions.

The fitness function in genetic algorithms can be defined in various ways, depending on the specific application. For example, in the case of a factory automation task, the fitness function might be the time required to reach the final position. In other applications, the fitness function might be the energy consumed by the robot, or the distance traveled by the robot.

##### Extended Kalman Filter

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is a popular technique for trajectory optimization in underactuated systems. It is an extension of the Kalman filter, which is a recursive algorithm for estimating the state of a system based on noisy measurements.

The EKF is particularly well-suited to underactuated systems due to its ability to handle non-linearities in the system dynamics. It does this by linearizing the system dynamics around the current estimate of the state, and then applying the standard Kalman filter.

The EKF can be used for both state estimation and control. In the context of trajectory optimization, it can be used to estimate the state of the system, and then use this estimate to compute the control inputs that will result in the desired trajectory.

##### Multiple Collaborative Evolutionary Algorithms

Multiple Collaborative Evolutionary Algorithms (MCACEA) is a recent approach to trajectory optimization that combines the strengths of evolutionary algorithms with the ability of collaborative search.

In MCACEA, multiple evolutionary algorithms (EAs) collaborate to solve a single problem. Each EA is responsible for a part of the problem, and the solutions of the other EAs are shared with the other EAs. This allows the EAs to exploit the solutions of the other EAs, leading to faster convergence and better solutions.

MCACEA has been used for finding and optimizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) trajectories when flying simultaneously in the same scenario.

##### Extended Kalman Filter with Continuous-time Model

The Extended Kalman Filter can also be used with a continuous-time model, which is particularly useful for systems with continuous-time measurements. The continuous-time model is given by:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) \quad \mathbf{w}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr) \\
\mathbf{z}(t) = h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) \quad \mathbf{v}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)
$$

where $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the state vector, $\mathbf{u}(t)$ is the control vector, $f(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t))$ is the system dynamics, $\mathbf{w}(t)$ is the process noise, $\mathbf{Q}(t)$ is the process noise covariance, $\mathbf{z}(t)$ is the measurement vector, $h(\mathbf{x}(t))$ is the measurement model, $\mathbf{v}(t)$ is the measurement noise, and $\mathbf{R}(t)$ is the measurement noise covariance.

The Extended Kalman Filter with continuous-time model is particularly useful for systems with continuous-time measurements, as it allows for the incorporation of both process and measurement noise. This can lead to more accurate state estimates, and therefore better solutions to the trajectory optimization problem.

#### 4.3c Applications in Robotics

Trajectory optimization techniques have been widely applied in the field of robotics, particularly in the area of underactuated robotics. Underactuated robots are those that have fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom, making them inherently unstable and challenging to control. Trajectory optimization provides a powerful tool for designing control inputs that can stabilize these systems and guide them along desired trajectories.

##### Factory Automation

One of the most common applications of trajectory optimization in robotics is in factory automation. In this context, the goal is to design a trajectory that minimizes the time required to reach the final position, while satisfying various constraints such as avoiding obstacles and respecting joint limits. Genetic algorithms and the Extended Kalman Filter have been particularly successful in this application, due to their ability to handle a wide range of constraints and cost functions.

##### Underactuated Robotics

In underactuated robotics, trajectory optimization is often used to stabilize the system and guide it along desired trajectories. The Extended Kalman Filter, with its ability to handle non-linearities and continuous-time measurements, is particularly well-suited to this task. Multiple Collaborative Evolutionary Algorithms (MCACEA) can also be used, leveraging the strengths of evolutionary algorithms and collaborative search.

##### Simultaneous UAV Trajectory Planning

Another interesting application of trajectory optimization in robotics is the simultaneous planning of multiple UAV trajectories in the same scenario. This is a challenging problem due to the potential for collisions and the need to optimize the trajectories of all UAVs simultaneously. MCACEA has been used for this task, dividing the problem into smaller subproblems that are solved simultaneously by each Evolutionary Algorithm (EA).

In conclusion, trajectory optimization plays a crucial role in the field of robotics, particularly in the area of underactuated robotics. Its applications range from factory automation to simultaneous UAV trajectory planning, and various techniques such as genetic algorithms, the Extended Kalman Filter, and MCACEA have been developed to tackle these challenges.




#### 4.3c Applications and Challenges

Trajectory optimization has a wide range of applications in underactuated robotics. In this section, we will discuss some of these applications and the challenges associated with them.

##### Factory Automation

One of the most common applications of trajectory optimization in underactuated robotics is in factory automation. Underactuated robots are often used in these settings due to their ability to perform complex tasks with a limited number of actuators.

The trajectory optimization problem in this context involves finding the optimal path for the robot to follow to perform a given task. This can be a challenging problem due to the presence of obstacles, constraints on the robot's motion, and the need to minimize the time and energy required to complete the task.

##### Biomechanics

Trajectory optimization also has applications in the field of biomechanics. For example, it can be used to study the optimal trajectories of human movements, which can provide insights into the mechanics of human locomotion and help in the design of rehabilitation devices.

In this context, the trajectory optimization problem involves finding the optimal path for a human or animal to follow to perform a given task. This can be a challenging problem due to the complexity of the human or animal's musculoskeletal system, the presence of constraints on the motion, and the need to minimize the energy required to complete the task.

##### Challenges

Despite its many applications, trajectory optimization in underactuated robotics presents several challenges. One of the main challenges is the presence of non-linearities in the system dynamics, which can make it difficult to find an analytical solution to the optimization problem.

Another challenge is the need to handle constraints on the robot's motion. These constraints can be due to the physical properties of the robot, the environment in which it operates, or the task it needs to perform. Handling these constraints can require the use of advanced optimization techniques, such as genetic algorithms or the Extended Kalman Filter.

Finally, there is the challenge of balancing the trade-off between performance and robustness. In many applications, it is important for the robot to be able to perform the task even in the presence of disturbances or uncertainties. However, this can conflict with the goal of optimizing the performance of the robot, which may require a detailed knowledge of the system and the environment.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the techniques that can be used to address these challenges.

#### 4.3d Future Directions

As the field of underactuated robotics continues to evolve, there are several areas of research that hold promise for the future. These include the development of more sophisticated trajectory optimization techniques, the integration of machine learning methods, and the exploration of new applications in areas such as healthcare and environmental monitoring.

The development of advanced trajectory optimization techniques is a key area of research in underactuated robotics. These techniques could be used to handle more complex and realistic scenarios, such as those involving multiple interacting robots or dynamic environments. They could also be used to optimize the trajectory of the robot in real-time, taking into account feedback from sensors and the environment.

One promising approach is the use of differential dynamic programming (DDP), a method that combines the strengths of both gradient descent and dynamic programming. DDP has been successfully applied to a wide range of control problems, and it could be adapted to the context of underactuated robotics.

##### Integration of Machine Learning Methods

The integration of machine learning methods into underactuated robotics is another promising direction. Machine learning techniques, such as reinforcement learning and deep learning, could be used to learn the optimal trajectory for a given task from experience. This could be particularly useful in situations where the dynamics of the system are complex and difficult to model accurately.

For example, reinforcement learning could be used to learn the optimal trajectory for a robot performing a task in a dynamic environment. The robot would learn the trajectory by interacting with the environment and receiving feedback on its performance. This approach could be particularly useful in situations where the dynamics of the system are complex and difficult to model accurately.

##### Exploration of New Applications

The exploration of new applications for underactuated robotics is another important direction. Underactuated robots have the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, from healthcare to environmental monitoring. For example, underactuated robots could be used to assist with patient care in hospitals, or to monitor and collect data about the environment.

In the field of healthcare, underactuated robots could be used to assist with patient care, such as by helping patients to move or by delivering medication. In the field of environmental monitoring, underactuated robots could be used to collect data about the environment, such as by monitoring air quality or detecting changes in the environment.

In conclusion, the future of underactuated robotics is promising, with many opportunities for research and development. By developing more sophisticated trajectory optimization techniques, integrating machine learning methods, and exploring new applications, we can continue to advance the field and unlock the full potential of underactuated robotics.

#### 4.4a Introduction to Feasible Motion Planning

Feasible motion planning is a critical aspect of underactuated robotics, particularly in the context of trajectory optimization. It involves the computation of feasible motions, i.e., motions that satisfy all the constraints of the system. This is a challenging problem due to the non-linearities in the system dynamics and the presence of constraints on the robot's motion.

#### 4.4b Feasible Motion Planning Techniques

There are several techniques for feasible motion planning, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. These include:

##### Grid-based Search

Grid-based search is a simple and intuitive technique for feasible motion planning. It involves overlaying a grid on the configuration space and assuming each configuration is identified with a grid point. The robot is allowed to move to adjacent grid points as long as the line between them is completely contained within the free configuration space. This is tested using collision detection techniques.

The main advantage of grid-based search is its simplicity and intuitive nature. However, it can be computationally expensive and may not be suitable for high-dimensional systems.

##### Sampling-based Algorithms

Sampling-based algorithms are currently considered state-of-the-art for feasible motion planning in high-dimensional spaces. They work by randomly sampling the configuration space and testing each sample for feasibility. The feasible samples are then used to construct a feasible path for the robot.

The main advantage of sampling-based algorithms is their ability to handle high-dimensional systems and complex constraints. However, they can be computationally intensive and may not guarantee the existence of a feasible path.

#### 4.4c Challenges in Feasible Motion Planning

Despite the advances in feasible motion planning techniques, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed. These include:

##### Computational Efficiency

Many feasible motion planning techniques, particularly sampling-based algorithms, can be computationally intensive. This can be a major limitation in real-world applications where time and computational resources are limited.

##### Guaranteeing the Existence of a Feasible Path

While sampling-based algorithms can find feasible paths in high-dimensional spaces, they do not guarantee the existence of a feasible path. This can be a major limitation in applications where the existence of a feasible path is crucial.

##### Handling Non-linearities

Many underactuated robotic systems exhibit non-linearities in their dynamics. This can make it difficult to find analytical solutions to the feasible motion planning problem.

In addition to grid-based search and sampling-based algorithms, there are several other techniques for feasible motion planning. These include:

##### Potential Field Methods

Potential field methods are a class of techniques that use a potential field to guide the robot's motion. The potential field is a function of the robot's position and orientation, and it is designed to attract the robot towards the goal and repel it from obstacles.

The main advantage of potential field methods is their ability to handle complex constraints and non-linearities in the system dynamics. However, they can be prone to local minima and may not guarantee the existence of a feasible path.

##### Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP)

DDP is a gradient-based technique for feasible motion planning. It works by iteratively performing a backward pass to generate a new control sequence and a forward pass to evaluate its performance. The control sequence is then updated to minimize the performance index.

The main advantage of DDP is its ability to handle non-linearities and constraints in the system dynamics. However, it can be computationally intensive and may not guarantee the existence of a feasible path.

##### Model Predictive Control (MPC)

MPC is a control technique that uses a model of the system to predict its future behavior and generate a control sequence that optimizes a performance index. The control sequence is then applied to the system and the process is repeated at each time step.

The main advantage of MPC is its ability to handle constraints and non-linearities in the system dynamics. However, it can be computationally intensive and may not guarantee the existence of a feasible path.

#### 4.4c Applications and Challenges in Feasible Motion Planning

Feasible motion planning has a wide range of applications in underactuated robotics. These include:

##### Robot Navigation

Feasible motion planning techniques can be used to navigate a robot through a complex environment. This is particularly useful in applications such as autonomous vehicles, where the robot needs to navigate through a cluttered environment while avoiding obstacles.

##### Robot Manipulation

Feasible motion planning techniques can be used to plan the motion of a robot's end-effector. This is particularly useful in applications such as robotic assembly, where the robot needs to perform a series of precise movements to assemble a product.

##### Robot Path Planning

Feasible motion planning techniques can be used to plan the path of a robot in a given environment. This is particularly useful in applications such as robot path planning, where the robot needs to navigate through a complex environment while avoiding obstacles.

Despite its many applications, feasible motion planning presents several challenges. These include:

##### Computational Efficiency

Many feasible motion planning techniques, particularly sampling-based algorithms, can be computationally intensive. This can be a major limitation in real-world applications where time and computational resources are limited.

##### Guaranteeing the Existence of a Feasible Path

While feasible motion planning techniques can find feasible paths in many cases, they do not guarantee the existence of a feasible path. This can be a major limitation in applications where the existence of a feasible path is crucial.

##### Handling Non-linearities

Many underactuated robotic systems exhibit non-linearities in their dynamics. This can make it difficult to find feasible paths, particularly using gradient-based techniques such as DDP and MPC.

##### Integration with Other Robot Control Techniques

Feasible motion planning techniques need to be integrated with other robot control techniques, such as model predictive control and differential dynamic programming. This can be challenging due to the different assumptions and requirements of these techniques.

This includes developing hybrid control techniques that combine the strengths of different control techniques, and exploring the use of reinforcement learning to learn the control policies for these hybrid systems.

##### Extending to Multi-Robot Systems

Finally, researchers are exploring ways to extend feasible motion planning techniques to multi-robot systems. This includes developing techniques for coordinating the motion of multiple robots, and exploring the use of swarm robotics to perform complex tasks.

In conclusion, feasible motion planning is a critical aspect of underactuated robotics. It involves the computation of feasible motions, i.e., motions that satisfy all the constraints of the system. Despite the challenges, there are several promising directions for future research in this area.




#### 4.4b Techniques for Feasible Motion Planning

In the previous section, we introduced two common techniques for feasible motion planning: grid-based search and sampling-based algorithms. In this section, we will delve deeper into these techniques and explore other advanced techniques for feasible motion planning.

##### Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP)

Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) is a gradient-based optimization technique that can be used for feasible motion planning. It iteratively performs a backward pass to generate a new control sequence and a forward pass to evaluate the new trajectory. The backward pass involves performing a variation of the Newton's method to minimize the cost-to-go function, which is the minimum cost-to-go from the current state to the goal state. The forward pass involves simulating the new trajectory and evaluating its cost.

The main advantage of DDP is its ability to handle non-linear and non-convex systems. However, it can be computationally intensive and may not guarantee the existence of a feasible path.

##### Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT)

Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) is a sampling-based algorithm that explores the configuration space by randomly sampling the joint space and testing each sample for feasibility. The feasible samples are then used to construct a tree of feasible motions.

The main advantage of RRT is its ability to handle high-dimensional systems and complex constraints. However, it can be computationally intensive and may not guarantee the existence of a feasible path.

##### Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM)

Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) is a sampling-based algorithm that explores the configuration space by randomly sampling the joint space and testing each sample for feasibility. The feasible samples are then used to construct a roadmap of feasible motions.

The main advantage of PRM is its ability to handle high-dimensional systems and complex constraints. However, it can be computationally intensive and may not guarantee the existence of a feasible path.

##### Feasible Motion Planning in Underactuated Robotics

In underactuated robotics, the number of control inputs is less than the number of degrees of freedom. This makes the motion planning problem more challenging, as the robot may not have enough control to reach the desired goal state. However, it also allows for more complex and natural-looking motions.

The techniques for feasible motion planning in underactuated robotics are similar to those for fully actuated robotics, but with some modifications to account for the underactuation. For example, the DDP algorithm can be modified to handle the constraints imposed by the underactuation, and the RRT and PRM algorithms can be modified to explore the joint space in a way that respects the underactuation.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of these techniques in various fields, including factory automation infrastructure and kinematic chains.

#### 4.4c Applications in Robotics

Feasible motion planning techniques have found extensive applications in the field of robotics. These techniques are used to plan and execute complex motions for robots, particularly in underactuated systems where the number of control inputs is less than the number of degrees of freedom. 

##### Factory Automation Infrastructure

In factory automation infrastructure, feasible motion planning techniques are used to design and implement robotic systems that can perform a variety of tasks. For instance, the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) is a software package that implements several sampling-based algorithms for motion planning, including the Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) and the Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM). These algorithms are particularly useful for planning motions in high-dimensional spaces, which is often the case in factory automation systems.

##### Kinematic Chains

Kinematic chains are a common type of underactuated system in robotics. They consist of a series of rigid bodies connected by joints, with each joint having a limited range of motion. Feasible motion planning techniques are used to plan motions for these systems, taking into account the constraints imposed by the joints.

For example, the Lifelong Planning A* (LPA*) algorithm is a variant of the A* algorithm that is particularly suited for planning motions in kinematic chains. LPA* shares many of the properties of A*, including optimality and completeness, but it also incorporates a heuristic function that helps guide the search towards feasible motions.

##### Underactuated Robotics

In underactuated robotics, the number of control inputs is less than the number of degrees of freedom. This makes the motion planning problem more challenging, as the robot may not have enough control to reach the desired goal state. However, it also allows for more complex and natural-looking motions.

Feasible motion planning techniques are used to handle the constraints imposed by underactuation. For instance, the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) algorithm can be modified to handle the constraints, and the Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) and Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) algorithms can be modified to explore the joint space in a way that respects the underactuation.

In conclusion, feasible motion planning techniques play a crucial role in the field of robotics, enabling the design and implementation of complex robotic systems that can perform a variety of tasks.

## Chapter: Chapter 5: Feedback Control

### Introduction

In the realm of robotics, control systems play a pivotal role in determining the behavior and performance of robots. Chapter 5, "Feedback Control," delves into one of the most critical aspects of control systems, focusing on the principles and applications of feedback control in underactuated robotics.

Feedback control is a fundamental concept in control theory, where the output of a system is used to influence its input. In the context of robotics, feedback control is used to regulate the behavior of robots, ensuring they perform tasks accurately and efficiently. This chapter will explore the theory behind feedback control, its implementation in underactuated robotics, and its practical applications.

Underactuated robotics, as the name suggests, involves robots with fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom. This presents unique challenges in terms of control, as the robot may not be able to move in all desired directions. Feedback control, with its ability to adjust the input based on the output, provides a powerful tool for managing these challenges.

The chapter will also discuss the mathematical models and algorithms used in feedback control, such as the Kalman filter and the PID controller. These tools are essential for understanding and implementing feedback control in underactuated robotics.

In addition to the theoretical aspects, this chapter will also cover practical applications of feedback control in underactuated robotics. These include tasks such as trajectory tracking, obstacle avoidance, and task execution under uncertainty.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of feedback control and its role in underactuated robotics. They should also be able to apply this knowledge to design and implement feedback control systems in their own underactuated robots.

### Subsection: 4.5a Introduction to Global Policies

In the previous sections, we have discussed the concept of feasible motion planning and its applications in various fields. In this section, we will delve into the concept of global policies, which is a crucial aspect of optimal control.

#### 4.5a.1 Global Policies

Global policies refer to the overall control strategy that is applied to a system. In the context of underactuated robotics, global policies are used to control the motion of the robot in a global sense, taking into account the entire system dynamics and constraints.

#### 4.5a.2 Local Policies

Local policies, on the other hand, refer to the control strategy applied to a specific part of the system. In underactuated robotics, local policies are used to control the motion of individual joints or subsystems.

#### 4.5a.3 Global Policies from Local Policies

The concept of global policies from local policies is a key aspect of optimal control. It involves the integration of local policies to form a global policy. This is particularly relevant in underactuated robotics, where the system is often composed of multiple subsystems or joints that need to be controlled in a coordinated manner.

#### 4.5a.4 Challenges in Global Policy Formulation

Formulating a global policy from local policies can be a challenging task. This is because the local policies may conflict with each other, leading to instability or poor performance. Furthermore, the global policy needs to take into account the system dynamics and constraints, which can be complex and nonlinear.

#### 4.5a.5 Techniques for Global Policy Formulation

There are several techniques that can be used to formulate a global policy from local policies. These include hierarchical control, where the local policies are organized in a hierarchical structure, and decentralized control, where the local policies are coordinated through a decentralized control law.

#### 4.5a.6 Applications in Underactuated Robotics

The concept of global policies from local policies has numerous applications in underactuated robotics. For instance, it can be used to control the motion of a robot with multiple joints, where each joint has its own local policy. It can also be used to control the motion of a robot in a cluttered environment, where the robot needs to interact with the environment in a coordinated manner.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of global policies and discuss some specific techniques for formulating global policies from local policies.




#### 4.5b Deriving Global Policies from Local Policies

The process of deriving a global policy from local policies involves several steps. These steps are outlined below:

##### 4.5b.1 Identifying Local Policies

The first step in deriving a global policy is to identify the local policies that need to be integrated. This involves understanding the dynamics and constraints of each subsystem or joint in the underactuated robot.

##### 4.5b.2 Conflict Resolution

Once the local policies have been identified, the next step is to resolve any conflicts that may exist between them. This can be achieved through various techniques such as hierarchical control, where the local policies are organized in a hierarchical structure, and decentralized control, where the local policies are coordinated through a decentralized control law.

##### 4.5b.3 Integration of Local Policies

After resolving any conflicts, the local policies are integrated to form a global policy. This involves determining the overall control strategy that will be applied to the system.

##### 4.5b.4 Validation and Verification

The final step in deriving a global policy is to validate and verify the policy. This involves testing the policy to ensure that it meets the desired performance criteria and that it is robust to disturbances and uncertainties.

##### 4.5b.5 Challenges in Deriving Global Policies

Deriving a global policy from local policies can be a challenging task. This is because the local policies may conflict with each other, leading to instability or poor performance. Furthermore, the global policy needs to take into account the system dynamics and constraints, which can be complex and nonlinear.

##### 4.5b.6 Techniques for Deriving Global Policies

There are several techniques that can be used to derive a global policy from local policies. These include hierarchical control, where the local policies are organized in a hierarchical structure, and decentralized control, where the local policies are coordinated through a decentralized control law. Other techniques include reinforcement learning, where the global policy is learned through trial and error, and model predictive control, where the global policy is determined by optimizing a cost function.

##### 4.5b.7 Applications in Underactuated Robotics

The concept of deriving a global policy from local policies is particularly relevant in underactuated robotics. Underactuated robots often have multiple subsystems or joints that need to be controlled in a coordinated manner. By deriving a global policy from local policies, we can ensure that the individual subsystems or joints are controlled in a way that is optimal for the overall system. This can lead to improved performance, stability, and robustness in underactuated robots.

## Chapter: Underactuated Robotics: Theory and Applications

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the topic of feedback control in underactuated robotics. Underactuation refers to the condition where a robot has fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) it possesses. This can be due to various reasons such as cost, size, or complexity. As a result, the robot may not be able to fully control its movements, leading to challenges in achieving desired trajectories and stability.

Feedback control is a crucial aspect of underactuated robotics as it allows the robot to adjust its movements in real-time based on feedback from its sensors. This is especially important in underactuated systems where the robot may not have complete control over its movements. By using feedback control, the robot can compensate for the lack of actuators and achieve desired performance.

In this chapter, we will cover the theory behind feedback control, including the different types of feedback controllers and their applications in underactuated robotics. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of feedback control in underactuated systems. Additionally, we will explore real-world applications of feedback control in various fields such as biomechanics, haptics, and prosthetics.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of feedback control in underactuated robotics. By the end, readers will have a solid foundation in the theory and applications of feedback control, allowing them to apply this knowledge to their own research and projects in the field of underactuated robotics.

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of underactuated robotics, including the theory and applications of this field. We have discussed the challenges and limitations of traditional control methods in underactuated systems, and have introduced the concept of model-free policy search as a promising alternative. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of model-free policy search, exploring its theory and applications in underactuated robotics.

Model-free policy search is a type of reinforcement learning that does not require a mathematical model of the system. This makes it particularly useful in underactuated systems, where the dynamics are often complex and difficult to model accurately. The goal of model-free policy search is to find a policy, or a set of actions, that maximizes a reward signal. This policy is then used to control the system, with the reward signal acting as a guide for the system's behavior.

In this chapter, we will first provide an overview of model-free policy search, discussing its key concepts and principles. We will then explore the theory behind model-free policy search, including its mathematical foundations and algorithms. We will also discuss the advantages and limitations of model-free policy search in underactuated systems.

Next, we will delve into the applications of model-free policy search in underactuated robotics. We will discuss how this approach has been used to control a variety of underactuated systems, from simple robots to complex biological systems. We will also explore the challenges and future directions in this field, as well as potential extensions and improvements to model-free policy search.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of model-free policy search and its applications in underactuated robotics. They will also have the necessary knowledge to apply this approach to their own underactuated systems, and to further explore this exciting and rapidly advancing field.

### Subsection: 5.1a Introduction to Stochastic Optimal Control

Stochastic optimal control is a branch of optimal control theory that deals with systems that are subject to random disturbances. In the context of underactuated robotics, this is particularly relevant as these systems often operate in uncertain and unpredictable environments. Stochastic optimal control aims to find a control policy that optimizes the system's performance in the presence of these disturbances.

#### Stochastic Control in Discrete Time

In discrete time, the decision-maker observes the state variable, possibly with observational noise, in each time period. The objective may be to optimize the sum of expected values of a nonlinear (possibly quadratic) objective function over all the time periods from the present to the final period of concern, or to optimize the value of the objective function as of the final period only. At each time period, new observations are made, and the control variables are to be adjusted optimally.

The discrete-time case with uncertainty about the parameter values in the transition matrix (giving the effect of current values of the state variables on their own evolution) and/or the control response matrix of the state equation, but still with a linear state equation and quadratic objective function, a Riccati equation can still be obtained for iterating backward to each period's solution even though certainty equivalence does not apply.

#### Example

A typical specification of the discrete-time stochastic linear quadratic control problem is to minimize

$$
E_1 \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{S-1} (y_t^T Q y_t + u_t^T R u_t) \right]
$$

where $E_1$ is the expected value operator conditional on $y_0$, superscript $T$ indicates a matrix transpose, and $S$ is the time horizon, subject to the state equation

$$
y_{t+1} = A_t y_t + B_t u_t
$$

where $y$ is an $n \times 1$ vector of observable state variables, $u$ is a $k \times 1$ vector of control variables, $A_t$ is the time $t$ realization of the stochastic $n \times n$ state transition matrix, and $B_t$ is the time $t$ realization of the stochastic $n \times k$ matrix of control multipliers. The matrices $Q$ ($n \times n$) and $R$ ($k \times k$) are known symmetric positive definite matrices.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the theory and applications of stochastic optimal control in underactuated robotics. We will explore various algorithms and techniques for solving stochastic optimal control problems, and discuss their advantages and limitations in the context of underactuated systems.




### Subsection: 5.1b Techniques for Stochastic Optimal Control

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of stochastic optimal control in discrete time. In this section, we will delve deeper into the techniques used for solving stochastic optimal control problems.

#### Stochastic Differential Dynamic Programming (SDDP)

Stochastic Differential Dynamic Programming (SDDP) is a powerful technique used for solving stochastic optimal control problems. It is an extension of the deterministic Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) and is particularly useful for problems with continuous state and control spaces.

The SDDP algorithm iteratively performs a backward pass on the nominal trajectory to generate a new control sequence, and a forward pass to compute and evaluate a new nominal trajectory. The algorithm continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as when the change in the cost function is below a predefined tolerance.

The SDDP algorithm can be summarized as follows:

1. Initialize the control sequence $u_0, ..., u_{T-1}$ and the nominal trajectory $y_0, ..., y_{T}$ with some initial guess.

2. Perform a backward pass on the nominal trajectory to generate a new control sequence $u_0', ..., u_{T-1}'$.

3. Perform a forward pass to compute and evaluate a new nominal trajectory $y_0', ..., y_{T}'$.

4. Update the control sequence and the nominal trajectory:

$$
u_0, ..., u_{T-1} \leftarrow u_0', ..., u_{T-1}', \quad y_0, ..., y_{T} \leftarrow y_0', ..., y_{T}'.
$$

5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met.

#### Stochastic Linear Quadratic Control (SLQC)

Stochastic Linear Quadratic Control (SLQC) is another technique used for solving stochastic optimal control problems. It is particularly useful for problems with linear state and control equations, and quadratic cost functions.

The SLQC algorithm iteratively performs a backward pass on the nominal trajectory to generate a new control sequence, and a forward pass to compute and evaluate a new nominal trajectory. The algorithm continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as when the change in the cost function is below a predefined tolerance.

The SLQC algorithm can be summarized as follows:

1. Initialize the control sequence $u_0, ..., u_{T-1}$ and the nominal trajectory $y_0, ..., y_{T}$ with some initial guess.

2. Perform a backward pass on the nominal trajectory to generate a new control sequence $u_0', ..., u_{T-1}'$.

3. Perform a forward pass to compute and evaluate a new nominal trajectory $y_0', ..., y_{T}'$.

4. Update the control sequence and the nominal trajectory:

$$
u_0, ..., u_{T-1} \leftarrow u_0', ..., u_{T-1}', \quad y_0, ..., y_{T} \leftarrow y_0', ..., y_{T}'.
$$

5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of these techniques in underactuated robotics.

### Subsection: 5.2a Introduction to Model-Free Value Methods

Model-free value methods are a class of reinforcement learning algorithms that do not require a model of the environment. These methods are particularly useful in situations where the environment is complex and difficult to model accurately. In this section, we will provide an introduction to model-free value methods and discuss their applications in underactuated robotics.

#### 5.2a.1 Basic Concepts

Model-free value methods are based on the principle of reinforcement learning, which involves an agent learning from its interactions with the environment. The agent receives rewards or punishments based on its actions, and it learns to make decisions that maximize its long-term reward.

The key concept in model-free value methods is the value function, which represents the expected future reward for each state. The value function is typically represented as a table or a neural network, and it is updated based on the agent's experiences.

#### 5.2a.2 Model-Free Value Methods in Underactuated Robotics

Underactuated robotics involves the control of robots with fewer actuators than degrees of freedom. This is often the case in biomimetic robots, where the goal is to mimic the movements of real animals. Model-free value methods can be particularly useful in underactuated robotics, as they can handle the complexities of the environment and the non-linearities in the system dynamics.

One of the key advantages of model-free value methods in underactuated robotics is their ability to handle uncertainty. In many real-world scenarios, the system dynamics may not be known exactly, and there may be uncertainties in the system parameters. Model-free value methods can handle these uncertainties by learning from the agent's experiences, without the need for a precise model of the environment.

#### 5.2a.3 Model-Free Value Methods in Robotics

Model-free value methods have been successfully applied in various areas of robotics, including locomotion, manipulation, and navigation. In locomotion, these methods have been used to develop controllers for bipedal and quadrupedal robots, allowing them to walk and run in complex environments. In manipulation, these methods have been used to develop controllers for robotic hands, allowing them to perform complex tasks such as grasping and manipulating objects. In navigation, these methods have been used to develop controllers for autonomous vehicles, allowing them to navigate in complex and uncertain environments.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the different types of model-free value methods and discuss their applications in more detail.




### Subsection: 5.2b Techniques for Model-Free Value Methods

Model-free value methods are a powerful tool for solving complex control problems, particularly in the field of underactuated robotics. In this section, we will discuss some of the techniques used in model-free value methods, including the use of implicit data structures and the Simple Function Point method.

#### 5.2b.1 Implicit Data Structures

Implicit data structures are a key component of many model-free value methods. These structures allow for efficient storage and retrieval of data, which is crucial for the learning process. The Simple Function Point method, for example, uses an implicit data structure to store and retrieve data efficiently.

The Simple Function Point method is a technique used in software engineering to estimate the size and complexity of a software system. It is based on the concept of function points, which are a measure of the functionality provided by a software system. The Simple Function Point method uses an implicit data structure to store and retrieve function point data, allowing for efficient estimation of system size and complexity.

#### 5.2b.2 Extended Kalman Filter

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is another technique used in model-free value methods. The EKF is a generalization of the Kalman filter, which is used for state estimation in linear systems. The EKF is used in non-linear systems, and it is particularly useful in model-free value methods due to its ability to handle non-linearities in the system dynamics.

The EKF uses a linear approximation of the system dynamics to compute the state estimate. This approximation is updated at each time step, allowing for the estimation of the system state even in the presence of non-linearities. The EKF is also used in the prediction and update steps of the continuous-time extended Kalman filter, which is used for state estimation in continuous-time systems.

#### 5.2b.3 Continuous-Time Extended Kalman Filter

The continuous-time extended Kalman filter is a generalization of the discrete-time extended Kalman filter. Unlike the discrete-time filter, the prediction and update steps are coupled in the continuous-time filter. This allows for more accurate state estimation in continuous-time systems.

The continuous-time extended Kalman filter is particularly useful in model-free value methods due to its ability to handle continuous-time measurements. Most physical systems are represented as continuous-time models, while discrete-time measurements are frequently taken for state estimation via a digital processor. The continuous-time extended Kalman filter allows for the integration of these two representations, making it a powerful tool for state estimation in model-free value methods.

#### 5.2b.4 Further Reading

For more information on model-free value methods and the techniques discussed in this section, we recommend the publications of Hervé Brönnimann, J. Ian Munro, and Greg Frederickson. These authors have made significant contributions to the field of model-free policy search, and their work provides valuable insights into the theory and applications of these methods.

#### 5.2b.5 External Links

For further reading on model-free value methods, we recommend the introduction to Simple Function Points (SFP) from IFPUG. This resource provides a comprehensive overview of the Simple Function Point method and its applications in software engineering.

Additionally, the Gauss–Seidel method and the implicit k-d tree are two other techniques that have been applied in model-free value methods. The Gauss–Seidel method is an iterative technique used for solving linear systems, while the implicit k-d tree is a data structure used for efficient storage and retrieval of data. Both of these techniques have been applied in various areas of model-free value methods, and their applications continue to be explored.




### Subsection: 5.2c Case Studies

In this section, we will explore some case studies that demonstrate the application of model-free value methods in underactuated robotics. These case studies will provide a practical understanding of the concepts discussed in the previous sections.

#### 5.2c.1 Case Study 1: Underactuated Quadcopter

Consider an underactuated quadcopter, a type of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is controlled by only three of its four rotors. This underactuation introduces a degree of freedom, allowing the quadcopter to perform complex maneuvers. However, it also makes the control problem more challenging due to the non-linearities in the system dynamics.

A model-free value method, such as the Simple Function Point method, can be used to solve the control problem for this underactuated quadcopter. The method uses an implicit data structure to store and retrieve data efficiently, allowing for the learning of the system dynamics without the need for a detailed model.

#### 5.2c.2 Case Study 2: Underactuated Bionic Knee

Another application of model-free value methods is in the control of an underactuated bionic knee. The bionic knee is a prosthetic device that mimics the movement of a natural knee joint. It is controlled by only two of its three degrees of freedom, making it an underactuated system.

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) can be used in this case to handle the non-linearities in the system dynamics. The EKF uses a linear approximation of the system dynamics to compute the state estimate, which is updated at each time step. This allows for the estimation of the system state even in the presence of non-linearities, making it suitable for the control of the underactuated bionic knee.

#### 5.2c.3 Case Study 3: Underactuated Robotic Arm

A third application of model-free value methods is in the control of an underactuated robotic arm. The robotic arm is controlled by only two of its three joints, making it an underactuated system.

The continuous-time extended Kalman filter can be used in this case to handle the non-linearities in the system dynamics. The filter uses a continuous-time model of the system dynamics to compute the state estimate, which is updated at each time step. This allows for the estimation of the system state even in the presence of non-linearities, making it suitable for the control of the underactuated robotic arm.

In conclusion, these case studies demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of model-free value methods in solving control problems for underactuated robotic systems. They provide a practical understanding of the concepts discussed in the previous sections and serve as a basis for further exploration in this field.




### Subsection: 5.3a Introduction to Model-Free Policy Search

Model-free policy search is a powerful technique in the field of robotics, particularly in the context of underactuated systems. It allows for the learning of control policies without the need for a detailed model of the system dynamics. This is particularly useful in situations where the system dynamics are non-linear and complex, making it difficult to develop an accurate model.

#### 5.3a.1 Basic Concepts

Before delving into the details of model-free policy search, it is important to understand some basic concepts. A policy is a mapping from states to actions. In the context of robotics, the states are the system states, and the actions are the control inputs. The goal of policy search is to find a policy that maximizes a certain performance criterion.

In model-free policy search, the policy is learned directly from the system dynamics. This is achieved through a process of trial and error, where the policy is iteratively updated based on the feedback from the system. The policy is typically represented as a function of the system states, and it is learned using a learning algorithm.

#### 5.3a.2 Learning Algorithms

There are several learning algorithms that can be used for model-free policy search. These include gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and reinforcement learning.

Gradient descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function. In the context of policy search, it is used to update the policy parameters in the direction of steepest descent of the performance criterion.

Stochastic gradient descent is a variant of gradient descent that uses a stochastic approximation of the gradient. This makes it more suitable for problems with a large number of parameters.

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment. In the context of policy search, it is used to learn the policy by trial and error, where the policy is updated based on the feedback from the environment.

#### 5.3a.3 Challenges and Future Directions

Despite its potential, model-free policy search faces several challenges. One of the main challenges is the lack of a model of the system dynamics, which makes it difficult to guarantee the convergence of the learning process. Another challenge is the need for a large number of interactions with the system, which can be time-consuming and expensive.

Future research in this area will likely focus on addressing these challenges. This includes developing more efficient learning algorithms and techniques for handling non-linear and complex system dynamics. It also includes exploring the potential of model-free policy search in other areas of robotics, such as humanoid robotics and biomimetic robotics.

### Subsection: 5.3c Case Studies

In this section, we will explore some case studies that demonstrate the application of model-free policy search in real-world scenarios. These case studies will provide a deeper understanding of the concepts discussed in the previous sections and will highlight the practical relevance of model-free policy search in underactuated robotics.

#### 5.3c.1 Robotic Manipulation

One of the most common applications of model-free policy search is in robotic manipulation. The goal is to learn a policy that allows the robot to manipulate objects in its environment. This is a challenging task due to the high-dimensional state and action spaces, as well as the non-linearities and uncertainties in the system dynamics.

In this case study, we will use the CDC STAR-100, a robotic manipulator with five degrees of freedom. The policy will be learned using a combination of gradient descent and reinforcement learning.

### Subsection: 5.4a Introduction to Actor-Critic Methods

Actor-critic methods are a class of model-free policy search algorithms that combine elements of stochastic control and reinforcement learning. They are particularly useful in underactuated robotics, where the system dynamics are often non-linear and uncertain, and the control policy needs to adapt to changing conditions.

The basic idea behind actor-critic methods is to learn a policy (the "actor") and a value function (the "critic") simultaneously. The actor learns to take actions that maximize the value function, while the critic learns to estimate the value of the current state and the expected future reward.

The actor-critic algorithm can be formulated as follows:

1. Initialize the actor and critic with random parameters.

2. Repeat until convergence:

    a. The actor takes an action $a$ in the current state $s$.

    b. The critic estimates the value of the current state $V(s)$ and the expected future reward $Q(s,a)$.

    c. The actor updates its parameters to maximize the value function.

    d. The critic updates its parameters to minimize the error between the estimated and actual value.

The actor-critic algorithm is particularly useful in underactuated robotics, where the system dynamics are often non-linear and uncertain, and the control policy needs to adapt to changing conditions. It allows the robot to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward, even in the presence of noise and uncertainty.

In the next sections, we will delve deeper into the theory and applications of actor-critic methods in underactuated robotics. We will discuss the different types of actor-critic methods, their properties, and how to choose the appropriate method for a given task. We will also explore some case studies that demonstrate the application of actor-critic methods in real-world scenarios.




#### 5.4b Techniques for Actor-Critic Methods

Actor-critic methods are a powerful class of model-free policy search algorithms that have been successfully applied to a wide range of problems in underactuated robotics. In this section, we will discuss some of the techniques that can be used to enhance the performance of actor-critic methods.

##### 5.4b.1 Variational Inequality Methods

Variational Inequality (VI) methods are a class of optimization techniques that can be used to solve the optimization problems that arise in actor-critic methods. The basic idea behind VI methods is to find a solution to an optimization problem by iteratively improving an initial guess until a stopping criterion is met.

In the context of actor-critic methods, VI methods can be used to solve the optimization problems that arise when updating the actor and critic parameters. For example, the actor can be updated by solving the following VI problem:

$$
\min_{a} \max_{v} \langle a, v \rangle - \langle \nabla \log \pi(a), \nabla V(a) \rangle
$$

where $\pi(a)$ is the actor policy, $V(a)$ is the critic value function, and $\nabla$ denotes the gradient. Similarly, the critic can be updated by solving the following VI problem:

$$
\min_{v} \max_{a} \langle a, v \rangle - \langle \nabla \log \pi(a), \nabla V(a) \rangle
$$

##### 5.4b.2 Implicit Data Structure

The implicit data structure is a technique that can be used to represent and manipulate large datasets in a compact and efficient manner. In the context of actor-critic methods, the implicit data structure can be used to represent the state space of the system.

The implicit data structure is particularly useful in underactuated robotics, where the state space can be high-dimensional and complex. By representing the state space implicitly, we can reduce the memory requirements of the actor-critic algorithm and make it more scalable.

##### 5.4b.3 Extended Kalman Filter

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is a popular technique for state estimation in continuous-time systems. In the context of actor-critic methods, the EKF can be used to estimate the state of the system and the uncertainty in the state estimate.

The EKF is particularly useful in underactuated robotics, where the system dynamics are often non-linear and uncertain. By using the EKF, we can incorporate the uncertainty in the system dynamics into the actor-critic algorithm and make it more robust.

##### 5.4b.4 Multimodal Interaction

Multimodal interaction is a technique that involves the use of multiple modalities (e.g., visual, auditory, tactile) to interact with the environment. In the context of actor-critic methods, multimodal interaction can be used to gather more information about the environment and make more informed decisions.

Multimodal interaction is particularly useful in underactuated robotics, where the robot needs to interact with the environment in a complex and dynamic manner. By using multimodal interaction, the robot can gather more information about the environment and make more informed decisions, leading to better performance.

##### 5.4b.5 Continuous-Time Extended Kalman Filter

The Continuous-Time Extended Kalman Filter (CTEKF) is a generalization of the EKF for continuous-time systems. In the context of actor-critic methods, the CTEKF can be used to estimate the state of the system and the uncertainty in the state estimate in continuous time.

The CTEKF is particularly useful in underactuated robotics, where the system dynamics are often non-linear and uncertain, and the state needs to be estimated in continuous time. By using the CTEKF, we can incorporate the uncertainty in the system dynamics and the continuous-time nature of the system into the actor-critic algorithm, making it more robust and accurate.

## Chapter: Underactuated Robotics: Theory and Applications

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the topic of underactuated robotics, specifically focusing on the theory and applications of this field. Underactuated robotics is a branch of robotics that deals with the control and manipulation of robots with fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) they have. This is in contrast to fully actuated robots, which have one actuator for each DOF. Underactuated robots are often used in applications where cost, size, and weight are important factors, as they require fewer actuators and therefore are more compact and lightweight.

The theory behind underactuated robotics involves understanding the dynamics and control of these systems. This includes studying the effects of underactuation on the stability and performance of the robot, as well as developing control strategies to overcome the challenges posed by underactuation. We will also discuss the various types of underactuated robots, such as serial and parallel robots, and their unique characteristics.

In terms of applications, underactuated robotics has a wide range of uses in various industries. One of the most common applications is in the field of prosthetics, where underactuated robots are used to create lightweight and natural-looking prosthetic limbs. Underactuated robots are also used in factory automation, where they are used to perform tasks such as picking and placing objects with high precision. Additionally, underactuated robots are being explored for use in space exploration, where their compact size and low weight make them ideal for use in spacecraft.

Overall, this chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of underactuated robotics, covering both the theory and applications of this field. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by underactuated robotics, and how this field is shaping the future of robotics.

## Chapter: Underactuated Robotics: Theory and Applications

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the topic of underactuated robotics, specifically focusing on the theory and applications of this field. Underactuated robotics is a branch of robotics that deals with the control and manipulation of robots with fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) they have. This is in contrast to fully actuated robots, which have one actuator for each DOF. Underactuated robots are often used in applications where cost, size, and weight are important factors, as they require fewer actuators and therefore are more compact and lightweight.

The theory behind underactuated robotics involves understanding the dynamics and control of these systems. This includes studying the effects of underactuation on the stability and performance of the robot, as well as developing control strategies to overcome the challenges posed by underactuation. We will also discuss the various types of underactuated robots, such as serial and parallel robots, and their unique characteristics.

In terms of applications, underactuated robotics has a wide range of uses in various industries. One of the most common applications is in the field of prosthetics, where underactuated robots are used to create lightweight and natural-looking prosthetic limbs. Underactuated robots are also used in factory automation, where they are used to perform tasks such as picking and placing objects with high precision. Additionally, underactuated robots are being explored for use in space exploration, where their compact size and low weight make them ideal for use in spacecraft.

Overall, this chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of underactuated robotics, covering both the theory and applications of this field. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by underactuated robotics, and how this field is shaping the future of robotics.
