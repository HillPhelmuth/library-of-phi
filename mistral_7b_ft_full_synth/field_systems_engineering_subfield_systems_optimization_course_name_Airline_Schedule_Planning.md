### Subsection: 2.2a Introduction to Permanent Labelling Algorithm

The Permanent Labelling Algorithm (PLA) is a powerful tool for solving optimization problems on networks. It is particularly useful for the Shortest Path Problem with Time Windows (SPPTW), which is a variant of the well-known Shortest Path Problem (SPP). In this section, we will introduce the PLA and discuss its application to the SPPTW.

#### The Permanent Labelling Algorithm

The PLA is a generalization of the well-known Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. It is designed to handle networks with time windows, which are constraints on the start and end times of travel on a particular path. The PLA finds the shortest path that satisfies these time windows, if one exists.

The PLA works by maintaining a set of labels for each vertex in the network. These labels represent the shortest path from the source vertex to the current vertex, along with the time window for that path. The algorithm then iteratively updates these labels until the shortest path is found, or it is determined that no such path exists.

#### Application to the SPPTW

The SPPTW is a variant of the SPP where the goal is to find the shortest path that satisfies a set of time windows. This problem is particularly relevant in the airline industry, where flights must adhere to specific departure and arrival times.

The PLA is well-suited to solving the SPPTW because it can handle the time windows directly in its labeling scheme. This allows the algorithm to efficiently explore the network and find the shortest path that satisfies the time windows, if one exists.

#### Complexity and Computational Challenges

Despite its power, the PLA also presents some challenges. The complexity of the algorithm is dependent on the size of the network and the number of time windows. As the network becomes larger and more complex, the time required to find the shortest path can increase significantly.

Furthermore, the PLA can be sensitive to the initial labeling of the vertices. If the initial labels are not carefully chosen, the algorithm may fail to find the shortest path, or it may take significantly longer to do so.

In the next section, we will discuss some techniques for addressing these challenges and improving the performance of the PLA.




#### 2.2b Application in Airline Scheduling

The Permanent Labelling Algorithm (PLA) has been widely used in the airline industry for optimizing flows on networks. This section will discuss the application of the PLA in airline scheduling, with a focus on the Shortest Path Problem with Time Windows (SPPTW).

#### Airline Scheduling and the SPPTW

Airline scheduling is a complex task that involves planning and optimizing the routes and timings of flights. The SPPTW is particularly relevant in this context, as it allows for the consideration of time windows, which are constraints on the start and end times of travel on a particular path. These time windows are crucial in airline scheduling, as they ensure that flights adhere to specific departure and arrival times.

The PLA is well-suited to solving the SPPTW in the airline industry, as it can handle the time windows directly in its labeling scheme. This allows the algorithm to efficiently explore the network and find the shortest path that satisfies the time windows, if one exists.

#### Challenges and Solutions

A major airline was facing challenges in optimizing its flight schedules due to the complexity of its network and the large number of time windows it had to adhere to. The airline decided to implement the PLA to solve the Shortest Path Problem with Time Windows (SPPTW).

The PLA was able to efficiently explore the network and find the shortest path that satisfied the time windows. However, as the network was large and complex, the time required to find the shortest path was significant. To address this challenge, the airline implemented a parallel implementation of the PLA, allowing for the simultaneous execution of multiple PLA instances. This significantly reduced the time required to find the shortest path.

#### Case Study 2: Optimizing Connections at a Regional Airport

A regional airport was facing challenges in optimizing its connections due to the large number of flights it had to handle. The airport decided to implement the PLA to solve the SPPTW.

The PLA was able to efficiently explore the network and find the shortest path that satisfied the time windows. However, as the number of time windows was large, the complexity of the algorithm increased significantly. To address this challenge, the airport implemented a pruning strategy that eliminated certain paths from consideration early in the algorithm. This reduced the complexity of the algorithm and improved its efficiency.

These case studies demonstrate the power and versatility of the PLA in optimizing flows on networks in the airline industry. Despite the challenges it presents, the PLA can be effectively used to solve complex optimization problems, making it an invaluable tool for airline schedule planning and optimization.

This algorithm is particularly useful for large and complex networks, where the PLA may struggle due to the large number of time windows.

Another advanced technique that has been applied to the airline industry is the Simple Function Point method. This method, developed by the International Function Point Users Group (IFPUG), is used to measure the size and complexity of software systems. In the context of airline schedule planning and optimization, the Simple Function Point method can be used to measure the complexity of the network and the schedule, providing valuable insights for optimization.

The Simple Function Point method is based on the concept of function points, which are a measure of the functionality provided by a system. In the context of airline schedule planning and optimization, function points can be used to measure the complexity of the network and the schedule, taking into account factors such as the number of flights, connections, and time windows. This method can be particularly useful for identifying areas of the network or schedule that are particularly complex and require more attention during optimization.

In addition to these techniques, there are many other advanced methods that can be applied to the airline industry, such as the Line Integral Convolution technique and the Factory Automation Infrastructure. These techniques have been applied to a wide range of problems since they were first published, and their potential applications in the airline industry are vast.

It takes into account various factors such as demographics, travel purpose, and ticket class to provide a comprehensive understanding of the airline's passenger base. This model is essential for airlines as it helps them make strategic decisions about route planning, pricing, and resource allocation.

The passenger mix model is based on the concept of market segmentation, where the airline's passenger base is divided into different segments based on their characteristics. These segments can include business travelers, leisure travelers, families, and other niche markets. Each segment has its own unique characteristics and preferences, which can greatly influence the airline's operations.

One of the key factors in the passenger mix model is demographics. This includes factors such as age, gender, and income level. These demographics can greatly impact the airline's decision-making process. For example, airlines may choose to cater to a specific demographic, such as business travelers, and adjust their schedule and services accordingly.

Another important factor in the passenger mix model is travel purpose. This includes whether the passenger is traveling for business or leisure, as well as the purpose of their trip. For example, a business traveler may have a different travel pattern and preference for services compared to a leisure traveler. The passenger mix model takes these factors into account to provide a comprehensive understanding of the airline's passenger base.

The passenger mix model also considers the ticket class of the passengers. This includes economy, business, and first class. Each class has its own unique characteristics and preferences, which can greatly impact the airline's operations. For example, business class passengers may have different travel patterns and preferences compared to economy class passengers.

In addition to these factors, the passenger mix model also takes into account other variables such as seasonality, special events, and competition. These factors can greatly influence the demand for air travel and can impact the airline's passenger mix.

Overall, the passenger mix model is a crucial tool for airlines in understanding and optimizing their passenger base. By taking into account various factors such as demographics, travel purpose, and ticket class, airlines can make strategic decisions that can greatly impact their operations.

### Subsection: 3.2a Introduction to Multi-commodity Flows

In the previous section, we discussed the challenges faced by airlines in implementing the passenger mix model. In this section, we will explore the concept of multi-commodity flows and its role in airline scheduling and optimization.

#### 3.2a.1 Definition of Multi-commodity Flows

The multi-commodity flow problem is a network flow problem with multiple commodities (flow demands) between different source and sink nodes. In the context of airline scheduling, these commodities can represent different types of passengers, such as business travelers, leisure travelers, or families.

Given a flow network $G(V,E)$, where edge $(u,v) \in E$ has capacity $c(u,v)$. There are $k$ commodities $K_1,K_2,\dots,K_k$, defined by $K_i=(s_i,t_i,d_i)$, where $s_i$ and $t_i$ is the source and sink of commodity $i$, and $d_i$ is its demand. The variable $f_i(u,v)$ defines the fraction of flow $i$ along edge $(u,v)$, where $f_i(u,v) \in [0,1]$ in case the flow can be split among multiple paths, and $f_i(u,v) \in \{0,1\}$ otherwise (i.e. "single path routing").

The goal of multi-commodity flow is to find an assignment of all flow variables which satisfies the following four constraints:

(1) Link capacity: The sum of all flows routed over a link does not exceed its capacity.

(2) Flow conservation on transit nodes: The amount of a flow entering an intermediate node $u$ is the same that exits the node.

(3) Flow conservation at the source: A flow must exit its source node completely.

(4) Flow conservation at the destination: A flow must enter its sink node completely.

#### 3.2a.2 Corresponding Optimization Problems

The multi-commodity flow problem can be used to solve various optimization problems, such as load balancing, minimum cost multi-commodity flow, and maximum multi-commodity flow.

In load balancing, the goal is to route flows such that the utilization $U(u,v)$ of all links $(u,v)\in E$ is even, where

$$
U(u,v) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i(u,v)}{c(u,v)}
$$

The problem can be solved by minimizing $\sum_{u,v\in V} (U(u,v))^2$ or by minimizing the maximum utilization $U_{max}$, where

$$
U_{max} = \max_{u,v\in V} U(u,v)
$$

In the minimum cost multi-commodity flow problem, there is a cost $a(u,v) \cdot f(u,v)$ for sending a flow on $(u,v)$. The goal is to minimize the total cost of all flows.

In the maximum multi-commodity flow problem, the demand of each commodity is not fixed, and the total throughput is maximized. This problem can be formulated as a linear program.

In the next section, we will explore how multi-commodity flows can be used to optimize airline schedules and improve overall efficiency.





#### 3.2b Application in Airline Scheduling

The multi-commodity flow model has been widely used in the airline industry to optimize flight schedules and improve overall efficiency. By considering different types of passengers as separate commodities, airlines can better manage their resources and cater to the specific needs of each group.

One of the key applications of the multi-commodity flow model in airline scheduling is in the allocation of resources. For instance, airlines can use this model to determine the optimal number of flights to operate between two cities, taking into account the demand for different types of passengers. This can help airlines maximize their profits and minimize their costs.

Moreover, the multi-commodity flow model can also be used to optimize flight schedules. By considering different types of passengers as separate commodities, airlines can design schedules that cater to the specific needs of each group. For example, business travelers may require early morning or late evening flights, while leisure travelers may prefer mid-day flights. By using the multi-commodity flow model, airlines can design schedules that meet the needs of all types of passengers, thereby improving customer satisfaction.

Another important application of the multi-commodity flow model in airline scheduling is in the management of connecting flights. By considering different types of passengers as separate commodities, airlines can optimize the timing and routing of connecting flights, thereby improving the overall travel experience for passengers.

In conclusion, the multi-commodity flow model is a powerful tool in airline scheduling and optimization. By considering different types of passengers as separate commodities, airlines can optimize their resources, improve their schedules, and enhance the overall travel experience for passengers.

This is achieved by formulating the problem as a multi-commodity network flow problem, where each commodity represents a different type of passenger.

The mathematical formulation of the Keypath Problem can be represented as follows:

Given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of nodes representing airports and $E$ is the set of edges representing routes between airports, and a set of commodities $K$, where each commodity $k \in K$ is represented by a triple $(s_k, t_k, d_k)$, where $s_k$ and $t_k$ are the source and destination airports of the commodity, and $d_k$ is the demand for the commodity.

The Keypath Problem is to find a set of keypaths $P_k \subseteq E$ for each commodity $k \in K$, such that the total cost of the keypaths is minimized, and the demand for each commodity is satisfied.

The cost of a keypath $p \in P_k$ is given by the function $c: P \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, where $c(p)$ is the cost of using the edge $p$ for the commodity $k$. The cost can be represented as the sum of the cost of the edge, the cost of the aircraft used on the edge, and the cost of the crew used on the edge.

The demand for a commodity $k \in K$ is given by the function $d: K \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$, where $d(k)$ is the number of passengers of type $k$ that need to be transported. The demand can be represented as the number of seats needed on the flights for the commodity.

The Keypath Problem can be formulated as a linear program, which can be solved using standard optimization techniques. The solution to the Keypath Problem provides the optimal allocation of flights across different routes and time periods, which maximizes the overall profit of the airline.

It involves the assignment of aircraft to routes and flights, taking into consideration various factors such as aircraft availability, flight demand, and operational constraints. The goal of the FAP is to optimize the utilization of the airline's fleet, maximizing revenue and minimizing costs.

In this chapter, we will delve into the intricacies of the FAP, exploring its various aspects and the techniques used to solve it. We will begin by discussing the basics of the FAP, including its definition, objectives, and constraints. We will then move on to more advanced topics, such as the different types of aircraft and routes, and the various factors that influence the assignment process.

We will also explore the mathematical models used to represent the FAP, including linear programming and integer programming formulations. These models will be presented using the popular Markdown format, with math expressions rendered using the MathJax library. For example, we might represent the FAP as a linear program as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Maximize } & \sum_{i \in I} \sum_{j \in J} p_{ij} x_{ij} \\
\text{Subject to } & \sum_{j \in J} x_{ij} = 1, \quad \forall i \in I \\
& \sum_{i \in I} a_{ij} x_{ij} \leq b_{j}, \quad \forall j \in J \\
& x_{ij} \in \{0,1\}, \quad \forall i \in I, \forall j \in J
\end{align*}
$$

where $I$ is the set of aircraft, $J$ is the set of routes, $p_{ij}$ is the profit associated with assigning aircraft $i$ to route $j$, $x_{ij}$ is a binary variable indicating whether aircraft $i$ is assigned to route $j$, $a_{ij}$ is the availability of aircraft $i$ on route $j$, and $b_{j}$ is the capacity of route $j$.

The goal is to optimize the utilization of the airline's fleet, maximizing revenue and minimizing costs. In this section, we will delve into the basics of the FAP, including its definition, objectives, and constraints.

#### 4.1a.1 Definition of the Fleet Assignment Problem

The Fleet Assignment Problem (FAP) is a mathematical optimization problem that involves assigning aircraft to routes and flights. The goal is to optimize the utilization of the airline's fleet, maximizing revenue and minimizing costs. The FAP is a critical aspect of airline schedule planning and optimization, as it directly impacts the airline's profitability.

#### 4.1a.2 Objectives of the Fleet Assignment Problem

The primary objective of the FAP is to optimize the utilization of the airline's fleet. This involves maximizing the revenue generated from the flights and minimizing the costs associated with operating the flights. The FAP also aims to ensure that the flights are operated in a manner that is safe, efficient, and reliable.

#### 4.1a.3 Constraints of the Fleet Assignment Problem

The FAP is subject to a number of constraints. These include:

- **Availability constraints**: Each aircraft has a limited availability due to factors such as maintenance, crew rest requirements, and operational constraints.
- **Demand constraints**: The demand for flights on certain routes may vary at different times of the day, week, or year.
- **Operational constraints**: The operation of certain flights may be subject to operational constraints such as air traffic control restrictions, weather conditions, and operational policies.

#### 4.1a.4 Mathematical Formulation of the Fleet Assignment Problem

The FAP can be formulated as a linear program (LP) or an integer program (IP). The LP formulation is given by:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Maximize } & \sum_{i \in I} \sum_{j \in J} p_{ij} x_{ij} \\
\text{Subject to } & \sum_{j \in J} x_{ij} = 1, \quad \forall i \in I \\
& \sum_{i \in I} a_{ij} x_{ij} \leq b_{j}, \quad \forall j \in J \\
& x_{ij} \in \{0,1\}, \quad \forall i \in I, \forall j \in J
\end{align*}
$$

where $I$ is the set of aircraft, $J$ is the set of routes, $p_{ij}$ is the profit associated with assigning aircraft $i$ to route $j$, $x_{ij}$ is a binary variable indicating whether aircraft $i$ is assigned to route $j$, $a_{ij}$ is the availability of aircraft $i$ on route $j$, and $b_{j}$ is the capacity of route $j$.

The IP formulation is similar, but with the additional constraint that $x_{ij} \in \{0,1\}$, enforcing that each aircraft can be assigned to at most one route.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the different types of aircraft and routes, and the various factors that influence the assignment process.




### Subsection: 4.1b Application in Airline Scheduling

The Fleet Assignment Problem (FAP) plays a crucial role in airline scheduling. It is used to determine which aircraft should be assigned to which routes and flights, taking into account various constraints such as availability, demand, and operational constraints. This section will delve into the application of the FAP in airline scheduling, discussing the benefits and challenges of using this approach.

#### 4.1b.1 Benefits of Using the Fleet Assignment Problem in Airline Scheduling

### Subsection: 4.1c Challenges and Solutions

The Fleet Assignment Problem (FAP) is a complex optimization problem that involves assigning aircraft to routes and flights in a manner that maximizes revenue and minimizes costs. Despite its benefits, the application of the FAP in airline scheduling also presents several challenges. These challenges can be broadly categorized into three areas: complexity, uncertainty, and variability.

#### 4.1c.1 Complexity of the Problem

The FAP is a complex optimization problem that involves multiple variables and constraints. This complexity arises from the fact that the problem is a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), which means that it involves both continuous and discrete variables. The continuous variables represent the amount of aircraft assigned to each route and flight, while the discrete variables represent the decision of which aircraft to assign to each route and flight.

The complexity of the problem is further increased by the fact that the FAP is a multi-objective optimization problem. This means that the goal is not just to optimize one objective (such as revenue or cost), but to optimize multiple objectives simultaneously. This requires a trade-off between conflicting objectives, which can be challenging to achieve.

#### 4.1c.2 Uncertainty and Variability

The demand for flights, as well as operational constraints, can be uncertain and vary over time. This uncertainty and variability can make it challenging to develop and implement an optimal fleet assignment plan. For example, changes in market conditions, such as changes in fuel prices or competition, can affect the demand for flights. Similarly, operational constraints, such as aircraft maintenance schedules or crew availability, can also change over time.

To address this challenge, the FAP can be formulated as a stochastic optimization problem, which takes into account the uncertainty and variability in the problem data. This allows for the development of robust fleet assignment plans that can handle changes in the problem data.

#### 4.1c.3 Solutions to the Challenges

Despite the challenges, there are several solutions that can be used to address the complexity, uncertainty, and variability of the FAP. These include:

- **Decomposition methods**: These methods break down the problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems, which can then be solved separately and combined to solve the overall problem. This approach can help to reduce the complexity of the problem.
- **Robust optimization**: As mentioned earlier, the FAP can be formulated as a stochastic optimization problem, which takes into account the uncertainty and variability in the problem data. This allows for the development of robust fleet assignment plans that can handle changes in the problem data.
- **Metaheuristic algorithms**: These are high-level problem-solving strategies that can be used to solve complex optimization problems. Examples include genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and ant colony optimization. These algorithms can help to find good solutions to the FAP in a reasonable amount of time.

In conclusion, the Fleet Assignment Problem is a complex optimization problem that presents several challenges. However, with the right tools and techniques, these challenges can be addressed to develop optimal fleet assignment plans that can help airlines to maximize revenue and minimize costs.




### Subsection: 4.2a Introduction to Passenger Mix Problem

The Passenger Mix Problem (PMP) is a critical component of the Fleet Assignment Problem (FAP). It involves determining the optimal mix of passengers on a flight, taking into account various factors such as ticket prices, seat availability, and passenger preferences. The PMP is a complex optimization problem that is closely related to the FAP, as the assignment of aircraft to routes and flights is heavily influenced by the passenger mix on these flights.

The PMP is a multi-objective optimization problem, similar to the FAP. The goal is to optimize multiple objectives simultaneously, including revenue maximization, cost minimization, and customer satisfaction. This requires a trade-off between conflicting objectives, which can be challenging to achieve.

#### 4.2a.1 Complexity of the Problem

The PMP is a complex optimization problem that involves multiple variables and constraints. This complexity arises from the fact that the problem is a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), which means that it involves both continuous and discrete variables. The continuous variables represent the amount of passengers assigned to each type of seat (e.g., economy, business, first class), while the discrete variables represent the decision of which type of seat to assign to each passenger.

The complexity of the problem is further increased by the fact that the PMP is a multi-objective optimization problem. This means that the goal is not just to optimize one objective (such as revenue or cost), but to optimize multiple objectives simultaneously. This requires a trade-off between conflicting objectives, which can be challenging to achieve.

#### 4.2a.2 Uncertainty and Variability

The demand for flights, as well as operational constraints, can be uncertain and vary over time. This uncertainty and variability can make it challenging to develop and implement an optimal passenger mix plan. For example, changes in market conditions, such as changes in fuel prices or competition, can affect the demand for flights. Similarly, operational constraints, such as aircraft maintenance schedules or crew availability, can also change over time.

To address this challenge, the PMP can be formulated as a stochastic optimization problem, which takes into account the uncertainty and variability in the problem data. This allows for the development of robust passenger mix plans that can adapt to changing conditions.




### Subsection: 4.2b Application in Fleet Assignment

The Passenger Mix Problem (PMP) plays a crucial role in the Fleet Assignment Problem (FAP). The optimal solution to the PMP can significantly impact the assignment of aircraft to routes and flights, which is a key component of the FAP. In this section, we will discuss the application of the PMP in fleet assignment and how it contributes to the overall optimization of airline operations.

#### 4.2b.1 Optimizing Revenue and Cost

The PMP is a multi-objective optimization problem, with the primary objectives being revenue maximization and cost minimization. The optimal solution to the PMP can help airlines maximize revenue by assigning the right mix of passengers to different types of seats. This can be achieved by considering factors such as ticket prices, seat availability, and passenger preferences.

On the other hand, the PMP can also help airlines minimize costs by optimizing the assignment of passengers to different types of seats. This can be achieved by considering factors such as operational costs, fuel costs, and maintenance costs. By optimizing the passenger mix, airlines can reduce their costs and improve their profitability.

#### 4.2b.2 Trade-off between Objectives

The PMP is a complex optimization problem that involves a trade-off between conflicting objectives. This trade-off is necessary to achieve an optimal solution that satisfies both revenue and cost objectives. For example, an airline may need to increase ticket prices to maximize revenue, but this can lead to a decrease in the number of passengers and a subsequent decrease in cost. The PMP helps airlines find the optimal balance between these objectives.

#### 4.2b.3 Impact on Fleet Assignment

The PMP has a direct impact on the fleet assignment problem. The optimal solution to the PMP can help airlines determine the optimal mix of passengers on a flight, which can then be used to assign the right type of aircraft to a particular route or flight. This can help airlines optimize their fleet utilization and improve their overall operational efficiency.

In conclusion, the Passenger Mix Problem plays a crucial role in the Fleet Assignment Problem. By optimizing the passenger mix, airlines can maximize revenue, minimize costs, and improve their overall operational efficiency. The PMP is a complex optimization problem that requires a trade-off between conflicting objectives, but it is essential for the successful operation of an airline. 





### Subsection: 4.2c Case Studies

In this section, we will explore some real-world case studies that demonstrate the application of the Passenger Mix Problem (PMP) in fleet assignment. These case studies will provide a deeper understanding of the challenges faced in optimizing the passenger mix and the strategies used to overcome them.

#### 4.2c.1 Case Study 1: South African Airways

South African Airways (SAA) is a major airline operating in Africa. The airline faces a unique challenge in optimizing its passenger mix due to the diverse nature of its routes and the varying preferences of its passengers. 

SAA operates a mix of domestic and international routes, serving both business and leisure travelers. This diversity in its route network and passenger base presents a complex challenge in optimizing the passenger mix. The airline needs to balance the needs of its business travelers, who often require flexibility and comfort, with those of its leisure travelers, who are more price-sensitive.

To address this challenge, SAA uses a combination of mathematical optimization and human expertise. The airline uses mathematical models to predict demand and optimize the assignment of passengers to different types of seats. However, it also relies on human expertise to make adjustments and decisions that cannot be easily modeled, such as changes in market conditions or customer preferences.

#### 4.2c.2 Case Study 2: Delta Air Lines

Delta Air Lines is a major US airline that operates a large fleet of aircraft. The airline faces a similar challenge to SAA in optimizing its passenger mix, but with the added complexity of a larger and more diverse fleet.

Delta operates a fleet of over 800 aircraft, ranging from small regional jets to large wide-body long-range aircraft. This diversity in its fleet presents a challenge in optimizing the passenger mix, as different types of aircraft have different seating configurations and operational costs.

To address this challenge, Delta uses a combination of mathematical optimization and fleet planning software. The airline uses mathematical models to optimize the assignment of passengers to different types of seats and to determine the optimal mix of aircraft in its fleet. It also uses fleet planning software to manage its fleet and make decisions about aircraft acquisitions and retirements.

These case studies highlight the complexity of the Passenger Mix Problem in fleet assignment and the strategies used to address it. They also underscore the importance of a holistic approach that combines mathematical optimization, human expertise, and fleet planning software.




### Subsection: 4.3a Introduction to Advanced Techniques

In the previous sections, we have discussed the basics of fleet assignment and the Passenger Mix Problem (PMP). We have also explored some real-world case studies that demonstrate the application of these concepts. In this section, we will delve deeper into advanced optimization techniques that can be used to solve the Fleet Assignment Problem (FAP) and the Passenger Mix Problem (PMP).

#### 4.3a.1 Advanced Optimization Techniques for Fleet Assignment

The Fleet Assignment Problem (FAP) is a complex optimization problem that involves assigning aircraft to routes in a way that maximizes revenue while satisfying various constraints. Advanced optimization techniques can be used to solve this problem more efficiently and effectively.

One such technique is the use of metaheuristics. Metaheuristics are high-level problem-solving strategies that guide the search for solutions to complex problems. They are often used when the problem is too complex to be solved directly, or when the search space is too large to be explored exhaustively. Examples of metaheuristics include genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and ant colony optimization.

Another advanced optimization technique is the use of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). MILP is a mathematical optimization technique that can handle both discrete and continuous variables. It is particularly useful for solving the Fleet Assignment Problem (FAP) because it can handle the discrete decision variables (e.g., which aircraft to assign to which route) and the continuous decision variables (e.g., the number of seats to allocate to each type of passenger).

#### 4.3a.2 Advanced Optimization Techniques for Passenger Mix Problem

The Passenger Mix Problem (PMP) is another complex optimization problem that arises in fleet assignment. It involves determining the optimal mix of passengers on a flight that maximizes revenue while satisfying various constraints. Advanced optimization techniques can be used to solve this problem more efficiently and effectively.

One such technique is the use of dynamic programming. Dynamic programming is a mathematical optimization technique that breaks down a complex problem into simpler subproblems and then combines the solutions to these subproblems to solve the original problem. It is particularly useful for solving the Passenger Mix Problem (PMP) because it can handle the dynamic nature of the problem (e.g., changes in demand, prices, and constraints).

Another advanced optimization technique is the use of machine learning. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on historical data to learn the optimal mix of passengers for a given flight. This approach can be particularly useful for airlines that have large amounts of historical data and can afford the computational resources required for training these algorithms.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these advanced optimization techniques and explore how they can be applied to solve the Fleet Assignment Problem (FAP) and the Passenger Mix Problem (PMP).

#### 4.3b.1 Application of Advanced Optimization Techniques in Fleet Assignment

The application of advanced optimization techniques in fleet assignment involves using metaheuristics and mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) to solve the Fleet Assignment Problem (FAP) and the Passenger Mix Problem (PMP). 

Metaheuristics, such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and ant colony optimization, can be used to guide the search for solutions to the FAP and PMP. These techniques are particularly useful when the problem is too complex to be solved directly, or when the search space is too large to be explored exhaustively. 

Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) can be used to handle both discrete and continuous variables in the FAP and PMP. This is particularly useful for the FAP, as it can handle the discrete decision variables (e.g., which aircraft to assign to which route) and the continuous decision variables (e.g., the number of seats to allocate to each type of passenger).

#### 4.3b.2 Case Studies of Advanced Optimization Techniques in Fleet Assignment

To further illustrate the application of advanced optimization techniques in fleet assignment, let's consider a case study of a hypothetical airline, Airline X. Airline X is looking to optimize its fleet assignment and passenger mix to maximize revenue.

Using metaheuristics, Airline X can guide the search for solutions to the FAP and PMP. For example, they can use genetic algorithms to explore different combinations of aircraft assignments and passenger mixes, and simulated annealing to refine these solutions.

Using MILP, Airline X can handle both discrete and continuous variables in the FAP and PMP. For example, they can use MILP to determine the optimal mix of passengers on a flight, taking into account factors such as ticket price, travel date, and customer preferences.

By applying these advanced optimization techniques, Airline X can optimize their fleet assignment and passenger mix to maximize revenue. This can lead to improved operational efficiency, increased customer satisfaction, and ultimately, higher profits.

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have discussed the basics of airline schedule planning and optimization, including network design, fleet assignment, and crew scheduling. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of crew scheduling and aircraft routing, which are crucial components of airline operations.

Crew scheduling involves the assignment of flight crews to specific flights, taking into account their availability, qualifications, and legal requirements.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the complexities of crew scheduling and aircraft routing and their importance in airline operations.




### Section: 5.1 Introduction to Crew Scheduling:

Crew scheduling is a critical aspect of airline operations that involves the assignment of flight crews to specific flights. This process is essential for ensuring the smooth and safe operation of flights, as well as complying with regulations and minimizing costs. In this section, we will provide an overview of crew scheduling and its importance in the airline industry.

#### 5.1a Basics of Crew Scheduling

Crew scheduling is a complex process that involves assigning flight crews to specific flights, taking into account their availability, qualifications, and legal requirements. This process is crucial for airlines as it directly impacts their ability to operate flights and meet customer demands.

The first phase of crew scheduling is building the crew pairings, also known as trips, rotations, or combinations. This process pairs a generic crew member with a flight so that all aircraft flights are covered and all trips are crew legal. The next step is the allocation of those trips to individual crew members.

In the United States, Canada, and Australia, seniority generally rules in crew scheduling. This means that pilots bid for either a line of time or trips and days off, and these are awarded based on seniority. The senior folks have more time off, better choice of time off, and fly better trips than the junior crew members. This process is referred to as bid lines and preferential bidding.

On the other hand, in European airlines and other airlines in the rest of the world, the allocation process is completely different. The company builds the pilot schedules directly to meet their needs, not the pilot's needs. Before assigning a single trip, the schedulers put all planned absences (vacation, training, etc.) onto the crew members' schedule. Only then are trips assigned to the individual crew members. This process is fair, as the most senior captain and the least senior crew member have equal opportunities to fly the best trips.

Crew scheduling is a complex and challenging task for airlines, as they must balance the needs of their crew members with the demands of their operations. In the next section, we will explore the various techniques and strategies used in crew scheduling, including mathematical models, algorithms, and heuristics.
