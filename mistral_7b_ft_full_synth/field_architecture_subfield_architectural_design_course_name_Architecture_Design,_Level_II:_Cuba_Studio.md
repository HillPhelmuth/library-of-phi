## Foreward

Welcome to "Architectural Design in Cuba: Exploring Spaces and Cultures". This book aims to delve into the rich and diverse architectural landscape of Cuba, a country known for its unique blend of cultural and artistic influences.

Cuba's architectural history is deeply rooted in its colonial past, with Spanish rule spanning over 400 years. This period has left an indelible mark on the country's architecture, with influences from various architectural styles from around the world. The seamless fusion of Neoclassical and Baroque architectural styles into Cuban design is a testament to this eclectic mix.

The book will also explore the impact of historical events on Cuban architecture. For instance, the major trade reforms in 1778 and 1791, which led to an increase in trade and immigration, further enriched the architectural landscape of the country.

As we move into the 20th century, we will see how Cuban architecture continued to evolve, with increased funding into architectural projects due to national prosperity from high sugar exports during World War I. The Art Deco period is also a notable reference point for Cuban architecture prior to the turn of the century.

In modern times, Cuban architecture is continually celebrated by historians and tourists alike. The book will also touch upon contemporary issues such as privatisation and how architecture itself is viewed as a profession in Latin America.

This book is written in the popular Markdown format, making it accessible and easy to read. It is intended for advanced undergraduate students at MIT, but can also be a valuable resource for anyone interested in the architectural landscape of Cuba.

I hope this book will serve as a comprehensive guide to understanding the architectural design in Cuba, and will inspire you to explore the spaces and cultures of this fascinating country.

Thank you for joining me on this journey.

Sincerely,

### Section 1.2 Discussion of Cuba:

#### 1.2a Cuba: A Cultural Mosaic

Cuba is a country known for its rich and diverse culture, shaped by a complex history of indigenous, African, and European influences. This cultural mosaic is reflected in the country's architecture, which is a blend of various styles and traditions.

The indigenous Taíno people, who inhabited the island before the arrival of the Spanish, had a significant influence on the early architecture of Cuba. Their settlements were typically circular, with thatched roofs and made from local materials such as bamboo and palm leaves. The Taíno also built elaborate ceremonial structures, such as the "bohíos" and "caneyes", which were used for religious and social gatherings.

The arrival of the Spanish in the 15th century brought a new architectural style to the island. The Spanish colonizers built grandiose structures, often using local labor and materials, to demonstrate their power and wealth. These buildings were typically large, ornate, and heavily influenced by Spanish architecture, with elements such as arches, balconies, and tile roofs.

African influences also played a significant role in the development of Cuban architecture. The African slaves brought to the island by the Spanish introduced new building techniques and materials, such as the use of adobe and bamboo. They also incorporated elements of their own cultural traditions into their architecture, creating a unique blend of African and Spanish styles.

The Cuban Revolution of 1959 brought about significant changes in the country's architecture. The new government implemented policies aimed at promoting social equality, which included the construction of affordable housing for the working class. This led to the development of the "barrio" or "barrio chino", a type of working-class neighborhood characterized by simple, functional buildings made from concrete and steel.

Today, Cuba's architecture continues to reflect its diverse cultural heritage. The country's historic buildings, many of which are UNESCO World Heritage sites, are a testament to its rich architectural history. The Cuba Studio, with its commitment to preserving and celebrating this heritage, plays a crucial role in the country's architectural landscape.

#### 1.2b Cuba: A Land of Contrasts

Cuba is a country of stark contrasts, where the old and the new, the traditional and the modern, coexist in a complex interplay. This is reflected in the country's architecture, which is a blend of historic and contemporary styles.

The historic architecture of Cuba is a testament to the country's rich cultural heritage. The old city of Havana, for instance, is a UNESCO World Heritage site, known for its well-preserved colonial architecture. The city's buildings, many of which date back to the 16th and 17th centuries, are a blend of Spanish, African, and indigenous influences.

### Section: 2.5 Developing a Chunk:

#### 2.5a Defining and refining the concept of a "chunk" in architectural design

In the previous section, we explored the concept of scaling in architectural design and how it can be applied to both large and small-scale projects. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of "chunks" in architectural design and how they can be used to organize and manage complex design problems.

A "chunk" in architectural design refers to a group of design elements that are organized and managed as a unit. This can include anything from a single design element, such as a wall or a window, to a group of elements that form a larger spatial configuration. The concept of chunks is closely related to the concept of modularity, which we discussed in the previous section.

The use of chunks in architectural design can be traced back to the work of architect Christopher Alexander, who introduced the concept of "pattern languages" in his book "A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction" (Alexander, 1977). A pattern language is a set of rules or principles that guide the organization and design of a system. In the context of architectural design, a pattern language can be used to guide the organization and design of chunks.

The use of chunks in architectural design can be particularly useful in complex design problems where there are many design elements and relationships to consider. By organizing these elements into chunks, architects can better manage and understand the relationships between them. This can lead to more effective design decisions and solutions.

In the next section, we will explore some case studies of how the concept of chunks has been applied in architectural design projects in Cuba. These case studies will provide practical examples of how chunks can be used to organize and manage complex design problems.

#### 2.5b Case studies of developing chunks in architectural design

In this section, we will examine some case studies of how the concept of chunks has been applied in architectural design projects in Cuba. These case studies will provide practical examples of how chunks can be used to organize and manage complex design problems.

As mentioned in the previous section, the restoration of the Old Havana Historic District is a notable large-scale project in Cuba. The project involved the restoration of over 1,000 buildings in the historic district. The architects involved in the project used the concept of chunks to organize and manage the complex design problem.

The architects divided the historic district into smaller chunks, each consisting of a group of buildings. Each chunk was then assigned to a team of architects who were responsible for its restoration. This allowed the architects to focus on a smaller, more manageable group of buildings, making the overall project more manageable and less overwhelming.

##### Case Study 2: The Design of the Cuban Pavilion at the 2016 Venice Architecture Biennale

The design of the Cuban pavilion at the 2016 Venice Architecture Biennale is an example of a small-scale project where the concept of chunks was applied. The pavilion, designed by Cuban architect Miguel Coyula, was a response to the biennale's theme of "Reporting from the Front" and aimed to explore the relationship between architecture and conflict.

Coyula used the concept of chunks to organize and manage the design of the pavilion. He divided the pavilion into smaller chunks, each representing a different aspect of the relationship between architecture and conflict. These chunks were then used to guide the design of the pavilion, resulting in a cohesive and meaningful spatial configuration.

##### Case Study 3: The Design of the Cuban Pavilion at the 2018 Venice Biennale

The design of the Cuban pavilion at the 2018 Venice Biennale is another example of a small-scale project where the concept of chunks was applied. The pavilion, designed by Cuban architects Ernesto Ortega and Claudia Rodriguez, explored the theme of "Freespace" and aimed to create a space that was both free and accessible to all.

Ortega and Rodriguez used the concept of chunks to organize and manage the design of the pavilion. They divided the pavilion into smaller chunks, each representing a different aspect of the theme of "Freespace". These chunks were then used to guide the design of the pavilion, resulting in a space that was both free and accessible.

In conclusion, the concept of chunks is a powerful tool in architectural design that can be used to organize and manage complex design problems. By dividing a design problem into smaller, more manageable chunks, architects can better understand and manage the relationships between design elements, leading to more effective design decisions and solutions.

#### 2.5b Techniques for developing a chunk in the Cuban context

In the previous section, we explored the concept of chunks in architectural design and how they can be used to organize and manage complex design problems. In this section, we will focus on the specific techniques that can be used to develop chunks in the Cuban context.

The Cuban context presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities for architectural design. The country's rich history, diverse cultural influences, and limited resources all play a role in shaping the design process. As such, architects working in Cuba must develop strategies to effectively navigate these complexities and create meaningful and sustainable designs.

One technique for developing chunks in the Cuban context is through the use of pattern languages. As mentioned in the previous section, pattern languages provide a set of rules or principles that guide the organization and design of a system. In the Cuban context, these patterns can be derived from the country's history, culture, and resources.

For example, the concept of "tropical modernism" is a pattern that has emerged from the Cuban context. This pattern is characterized by a focus on natural ventilation, shading, and the use of local materials. It is a response to the country's tropical climate and limited resources, and has been used in a variety of architectural projects, from residential buildings to public spaces.

Another technique for developing chunks in the Cuban context is through the use of modularity. As discussed in the previous section, modularity allows for the creation of flexible and adaptable designs. In the Cuban context, this can be particularly useful as it allows architects to respond to the country's changing needs and circumstances.

For instance, the concept of "adaptive reuse" is a modular approach that has been applied in the Cuban context. This involves repurposing existing buildings for new uses, rather than demolishing and rebuilding. This approach is not only more sustainable, but it also allows for the preservation of the country's architectural heritage.

In addition to these techniques, architects working in Cuba must also consider the country's cultural and social context. This includes understanding the needs and preferences of the local community, as well as the cultural values and traditions that shape the country's built environment.

For example, the concept of "community-based design" is a technique that has been used in the Cuban context. This approach involves working closely with the local community to understand their needs and preferences, and then incorporating these insights into the design process. This not only results in more meaningful and sustainable designs, but it also fosters a sense of ownership and pride within the community.

In conclusion, developing chunks in the Cuban context requires a combination of techniques, including the use of pattern languages, modularity, and community-based design. By incorporating these techniques, architects can create designs that respond to the country's unique challenges and opportunities, and contribute to the creation of a more sustainable and culturally sensitive built environment.

## Chapter 3: Exploring Spaces and Cultures:




#### 2.6a Understanding the importance of elevation montage and section in architectural representation

In the previous section, we explored the concept of chunks and how they can be used to organize and manage complex design problems. In this section, we will focus on the specific techniques that can be used to develop chunks in the Cuban context.

The Cuban context presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities for architectural design. The country's rich history, diverse cultural influences, and limited resources all play a role in shaping the design process. As such, architects working in Cuba must develop strategies to effectively navigate these complexities and create meaningful and sustainable designs.

One technique for developing chunks in the Cuban context is through the use of pattern languages. As mentioned in the previous section, pattern languages provide a set of rules or principles that guide the organization and design of a system. In the Cuban context, these patterns can be derived from the country's history, culture, and resources.

For example, the concept of "tropical modernism" is a pattern that has emerged from the Cuban context. This pattern is characterized by a focus on natural ventilation, shading, and the use of local materials. It is a response to the country's tropical climate and limited resources, and has been used in a variety of architectural projects, from residential buildings to public spaces.

Another technique for developing chunks in the Cuban context is through the use of modularity. As discussed in the previous section, modularity allows for the creation of flexible and adaptable designs. In the Cuban context, this can be particularly useful as it allows architects to respond to the country's changing needs and circumstances.

For instance, the concept of "adaptive reuse" is a modular approach that has been applied in the Cuban context. This involves repurposing existing buildings for new uses, rather than demolishing and rebuilding. This approach is particularly relevant in the Cuban context, where resources are limited and there is a desire to preserve the country's rich architectural heritage.

In addition to pattern languages and modularity, another important tool for developing chunks in the Cuban context is the use of elevation montage and section. These techniques allow architects to visually represent and analyze the spatial relationships and interactions within a design.

Elevation montage is a visual representation of a building or structure from a specific elevation or angle. It allows architects to see the building in three dimensions and to identify any potential design flaws or opportunities. In the Cuban context, elevation montage can be particularly useful for understanding the relationship between a building and its surrounding context, such as the street, neighborhood, and natural landscape.

Section, on the other hand, is a visual representation of a building or structure cut along a specific plane. This allows architects to see the internal spaces and relationships within the building. In the Cuban context, section can be particularly useful for understanding the spatial organization and flow within a building, as well as for identifying any potential design flaws or opportunities.

By using elevation montage and section, architects can gain a deeper understanding of the spatial relationships and interactions within a design, and can use this information to inform their design decisions. This can be particularly useful in the Cuban context, where the complexities of the context require a nuanced and strategic approach to design.

In the next section, we will explore the specific techniques for creating elevation montage and section in the Cuban context.





#### 2.6b Creating effective elevation montages and sections in Cuba Studio projects

In this section, we will explore the techniques for creating effective elevation montages and sections in Cuba Studio projects. These techniques are crucial for effectively communicating the design intent and conveying the spatial qualities of a project.

Elevation montages and sections are two-dimensional representations of three-dimensional spaces. They provide a simplified view of the project, highlighting specific aspects of the design. In the Cuban context, these representations can be particularly useful as they allow architects to communicate the spatial qualities of their designs in a clear and concise manner.

One technique for creating effective elevation montages and sections is through the use of line drawings. Line drawings are simple, black and white drawings that focus on the geometric and spatial qualities of a project. They are particularly useful in the Cuban context as they can effectively communicate the spatial qualities of a project, while also highlighting the geometric and structural aspects of the design.

For instance, the line drawings of the "Casa del Alba" project, located in the historic center of Havana, effectively communicate the spatial qualities of the project. The drawings highlight the project's use of natural ventilation and shading, as well as its integration with the surrounding context.

Another technique for creating effective elevation montages and sections is through the use of 3D models. 3D models provide a more realistic representation of the project, allowing architects to communicate the spatial qualities of the design in a more immersive manner. In the Cuban context, 3D models can be particularly useful as they can effectively communicate the spatial qualities of a project, while also highlighting the project's integration with the surrounding context.

For example, the 3D model of the "Casa del Alba" project, created using the Autodesk suite of software, effectively communicates the project's use of natural ventilation and shading, as well as its integration with the surrounding context. The model also highlights the project's use of local materials, further emphasizing its integration with the Cuban context.

In addition to these techniques, architects working in Cuba can also benefit from the use of virtual reality (VR) technology. VR technology allows architects to create immersive, three-dimensional representations of their projects, providing a more realistic and interactive experience for the user. This can be particularly useful in the Cuban context, where architects often need to communicate their designs to clients or stakeholders who may not have a strong background in architecture.

In conclusion, creating effective elevation montages and sections is crucial for effectively communicating the design intent and conveying the spatial qualities of a project in the Cuban context. By utilizing techniques such as line drawings, 3D models, and VR technology, architects can effectively communicate the spatial qualities of their designs, while also highlighting the project's integration with the surrounding context.




#### 2.7a Integrating different design elements and concepts into a cohesive architectural project

In this section, we will explore the process of integrating different design elements and concepts into a cohesive architectural project. This process is crucial for creating a successful architectural design that effectively communicates the design intent and conveys the spatial qualities of a project.

The first step in integrating different design elements and concepts is to establish a clear design intent. This intent should be based on the project's context, including the site conditions, cultural and social influences, and functional requirements. The design intent should also consider the project's spatial qualities, including the spatial organization, circulation, and relationship between different spaces.

Once the design intent has been established, architects can begin to integrate different design elements and concepts into the project. This can include the integration of different building systems, such as structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems. It can also include the integration of different design strategies, such as sustainability, resilience, and adaptability.

One technique for integrating different design elements and concepts is through the use of a cellular model. This model allows architects to break down the project into smaller, more manageable units, each with its own set of design elements and concepts. By integrating these units into a larger, cohesive project, architects can create a design that is both complex and cohesive.

Another technique for integrating different design elements and concepts is through the use of a design continuum. This concept, borrowed from computer-aided architectural design (CAAD), emphasizes the integration of different design tools and processes throughout the entire life cycle of a building. By considering the shared use of digital design tools and the exchange of information and knowledge between designers and across different projects, architects can create a design continuum that spans the entire life cycle of a building.

In the Cuban context, these techniques can be particularly useful as they allow architects to integrate the unique design elements and concepts of the country into a cohesive architectural project. This can include the integration of traditional Cuban design elements, such as verandas and courtyards, as well as modern design concepts, such as sustainability and resilience.

In conclusion, integrating different design elements and concepts into a cohesive architectural project is a crucial step in the architectural design process. By establishing a clear design intent, integrating different design elements and concepts, and utilizing techniques such as a cellular model and design continuum, architects can create a design that effectively communicates the design intent and conveys the spatial qualities of a project.




#### 2.7b Strategies for presenting and communicating complex designs

In this section, we will explore various strategies for presenting and communicating complex architectural designs. As architects, it is crucial to effectively communicate our design ideas and concepts to clients, stakeholders, and other professionals involved in the project.

One strategy for presenting complex designs is through the use of diagrams and visual aids. These can help to illustrate the spatial qualities of a project and the relationships between different design elements and concepts. For example, a diagram can show the circulation paths within a building, or the structural system supporting the building. Visual aids, such as 3D models or renderings, can provide a more realistic representation of the project and help clients to visualize the final outcome.

Another strategy is to use storytelling techniques to communicate the design intent and concept. This can involve creating a narrative that explains the design decisions and how they contribute to the overall project. Storytelling can be a powerful tool for conveying the design intent and engaging the audience.

In addition to these strategies, architects can also use technology to present and communicate complex designs. This can include the use of virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) technologies, which allow for a more immersive experience and can help clients to better understand the project.

It is also important for architects to be able to effectively communicate their design ideas and concepts verbally. This can involve practicing presentations and pitches, as well as developing strong communication skills.

In conclusion, presenting and communicating complex designs is a crucial aspect of architectural practice. By using a combination of strategies, architects can effectively convey their design intent and concepts to a wide range of audiences.

### Section: 4.1 Sketch model:

#### 4.1a Introduction to sketch modeling techniques

Sketch modeling is a powerful tool in architectural design, allowing architects to quickly and intuitively create 3D models of their designs. This section will introduce the concept of sketch modeling and discuss its applications in architectural design.

Sketch modeling, also known as free-form modeling, is a method of creating 3D models by drawing a 2D shape which is then automatically converted to 3D by the modeling software. This method is particularly useful for architects who are not familiar with traditional 3D modeling programs, which often have a high learning curve. Sketch modeling interfaces are designed to be similar to drawing, a task that most users are familiar with.

One of the primary uses of sketch modeling is rapid modeling of low-detail objects for prototyping and design work. This allows architects to quickly explore different design ideas and make changes on the fly. Sketch modeling is also used in the early stages of design, where architects need to communicate their ideas to clients or other team members.

The operation of sketch modeling involves drawing a shape in the workspace using a mouse or a tablet. The system then interprets this shape as a 3D object. Users can then alter the object by cutting off or adding sections. The process of adding sections to a model is generally referred to as overdrawing. The user is never required to interact directly with the vertices or Nurbs control points.

In the second type of sketch-based modeling, the user draws one or more images on paper, then scans in the images. The system then automatically converts the sketches to a 3D model.

Sketch modeling is a rapidly evolving field, with a great deal of research being done on it. A number of papers on this topic are presented each year at the ACM SIGGRAPH conference. One of the key areas of research is the Fréchet distance, a mathematical concept used in sketch-based modeling to measure the similarity between two curves.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the various sketch modeling techniques and their applications in architectural design. We will also explore how these techniques are used in the projects discussed in this chapter.

#### 4.1b Techniques for creating sketch models

Creating a sketch model involves a series of steps that are designed to simplify the process of creating a 3D model. These steps are typically iterative, allowing the architect to make changes and refinements as needed.

##### Step 1: Drawing the 2D Shape

The first step in creating a sketch model is to draw a 2D shape. This can be done using a mouse or a tablet, depending on the modeling software being used. The shape can be as simple or as complex as needed, depending on the design being modeled.

##### Step 2: Conversion to 3D

Once the 2D shape has been drawn, it is automatically converted to a 3D model by the modeling software. This conversion process can be complex, involving algorithms that interpret the 2D shape and create a corresponding 3D model.

##### Step 3: Overdrawing

After the 3D model has been created, the architect can begin overdrawing. This involves adding or removing sections of the model to refine the design. Overdrawing can be done by cutting off or adding sections to the model.

##### Step 4: Finalization

The final step in creating a sketch model is to finalize the design. This involves checking the model for errors and making any necessary adjustments. The model can then be saved for future use or exported for use in other software.

It's important to note that these steps are not always linear. For example, an architect might need to go back to an earlier step to make changes or corrections. Additionally, the steps might be performed in a different order depending on the specific needs of the project.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the challenges and limitations of sketch modeling, as well as some strategies for overcoming these challenges.
