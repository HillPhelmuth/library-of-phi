## Chapter: - Chapter 1: Introduction to Geometric Modeling:




### Section 1.1 Classification of Geometric Modeling Forms

Geometric modeling can be broadly classified into two forms: parametric and non-parametric. In this section, we will focus on parametric modeling, which is a powerful tool for creating complex geometric objects.

#### 1.1a Parametric Modeling

Parametric modeling is a method of representing geometric objects using parameters. These parameters can be adjusted to control the shape and size of the object. The advantage of parametric modeling is that it allows for the creation of complex objects with a relatively small number of parameters.

One of the key concepts in parametric modeling is the use of parametric curves and surfaces. These are mathematical objects that are defined by a set of parameters. For example, a circle can be represented as a parametric curve defined by the parameters $x$ and $y$. The equation of the circle is then given by $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.

Parametric curves and surfaces are essential tools in geometric modeling as they allow for the creation of complex shapes with smooth transitions. They are widely used in computer graphics, CAD, and other applications that require precise control over the shape of an object.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the theory and applications of parametric modeling, exploring different types of parametric curves and surfaces and their properties. We will also discuss how to create and manipulate these objects using mathematical techniques and algorithms.




### Subsection 1.1b Implicit Modeling

Implicit modeling is another important form of geometric modeling. Unlike parametric modeling, which uses explicit equations to define objects, implicit modeling uses implicit equations. These equations are often more complex and can represent a wider range of objects, but they can also be more difficult to work with.

#### 1.1b.1 Implicit Equations

An implicit equation is an equation that relates the coordinates of a point to a function. For example, the equation $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$ is an implicit equation that defines a circle. The point $(x, y)$ satisfies this equation if and only if its distance from the origin is equal to $r$.

Implicit equations can also be used to represent more complex objects. For example, the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2$ represents a sphere. The point $(x, y, z)$ satisfies this equation if and only if its distance from the origin is equal to $r$.

#### 1.1b.2 Implicit Modeling Techniques

There are several techniques for implicit modeling, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. One of the most common techniques is the use of implicit data structures. These structures are used to represent objects in a way that is efficient for certain types of operations.

Another important technique is the use of implicit k-d trees. These are implicit data structures that are spanned over an "k"-dimensional grid with "n" gridcells. They are particularly useful for representing objects in high-dimensional spaces.

#### 1.1b.3 Complexity of Implicit Modeling

The complexity of implicit modeling can vary depending on the specific technique being used. For example, the complexity of an implicit k-d tree is given by the equation $O(n \log n)$. This means that as the number of gridcells increases, the complexity of the implicit k-d tree also increases.

#### 1.1b.4 Applications of Implicit Modeling

Implicit modeling has a wide range of applications. It is used in computer graphics to represent complex objects, in machine learning for data structures, and in many other fields. The ability to represent a wide range of objects with implicit equations makes it a powerful tool for geometric modeling.

In the next section, we will explore some of these applications in more detail. We will also discuss some of the challenges and limitations of implicit modeling, and how they can be addressed.





### Subsection 1.1c Explicit Modeling

Explicit modeling is another important form of geometric modeling. Unlike implicit modeling, which uses implicit equations to define objects, explicit modeling uses explicit equations. These equations are often simpler and easier to work with, but they can also be more limited in their ability to represent objects.

#### 1.1c.1 Explicit Equations

An explicit equation is an equation that relates the coordinates of a point to a function. For example, the equation $x = r \cos(\theta)$ is an explicit equation that defines a circle. The point $(x, y)$ satisfies this equation if and only if its x-coordinate is equal to $r \cos(\theta)$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle and $\theta$ is the angle.

Explicit equations can also be used to represent more complex objects. For example, the equation $x = r \cos(\theta) + a$ and $y = r \sin(\theta) + b$ represents a circle translated by $(a, b)$. The point $(x, y)$ satisfies this equation if and only if its x-coordinate is equal to $r \cos(\theta) + a$ and its y-coordinate is equal to $r \sin(\theta) + b$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle and $\theta$ is the angle.

#### 1.1c.2 Explicit Modeling Techniques

There are several techniques for explicit modeling, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. One of the most common techniques is the use of primitive equations. These are explicit equations that define the shape of an object. For example, the equation $x = r \cos(\theta)$ and $y = r \sin(\theta)$ defines a circle, where $r$ is the radius and $\theta$ is the angle.

Another important technique is the use of solid modeling. This involves representing objects as solid objects, rather than just a set of points. This can be useful for representing objects with complex shapes.

#### 1.1c.3 Complexity of Explicit Modeling

The complexity of explicit modeling can vary depending on the specific technique being used. For example, the complexity of representing a circle using primitive equations is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of points on the circle. This is because the equation $x = r \cos(\theta)$ and $y = r \sin(\theta)$ can be evaluated for any value of $\theta$ between 0 and $2\pi$.

On the other hand, the complexity of representing a circle using solid modeling can be much higher. This is because solid modeling involves representing the object as a solid object, which can involve a large number of points and complex calculations.

#### 1.1c.4 Applications of Explicit Modeling

Explicit modeling has a wide range of applications. It is used in computer graphics to represent objects with complex shapes, such as characters and creatures in video games. It is also used in computer-aided design (CAD) to create detailed 3D models of objects.

In addition, explicit modeling is used in computational geometry for tasks such as shape recognition and collision detection. This is because explicit models can be easily represented and manipulated in a computer, making them ideal for these types of tasks.

## Chapter 2: Differential Geometry of Curves:




### Section 2.1 Differential Geometry of Curves:

In this section, we will explore the differential geometry of curves, which is a fundamental concept in computational geometry. Differential geometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of curves and surfaces using differential calculus. It is a powerful tool for understanding the properties of curves and surfaces, and it has numerous applications in various fields, including computer graphics, computer-aided design, and robotics.

#### 2.1a Curve Definition

A curve is a geometric object that is one-dimensional and continuous. It is defined by a function that maps a real number to a point in the plane. In other words, a curve is the image of a function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$. The function $f$ is called the parametric equation of the curve, and the real number $t$ is called the parameter.

The points on the curve are determined by the values of the parameter $t$. For example, the circle with center $(0, 0)$ and radius $r$ can be defined by the parametric equation $f(t) = (r \cos(t), r \sin(t))$. The points on the circle are then determined by the values of $t$ in the interval $[0, 2\pi]$.

#### 2.1b Curve Properties

Curves have several important properties that are useful in computational geometry. These properties include continuity, differentiability, and curvature.

Continuity is a fundamental property of curves that ensures that the curve does not have any sudden jumps or breaks. A curve is said to be continuous if its parametric equation is continuous. In other words, the curve must not have any discontinuities or gaps.

Differentiability is another important property of curves. A curve is said to be differentiable if its parametric equation is differentiable. This means that the curve must have a well-defined slope at every point. The slope of a curve at a point is called the curvature of the curve at that point.

Curvature is a measure of how much a curve deviates from being a straight line. It is defined as the ratio of the change in the angle of the tangent to the change in the arc length of the curve. The curvature of a curve at a point can be calculated using the formula $\kappa = \frac{1}{r}$, where $r$ is the radius of curvature at that point.

#### 2.1c Curve Applications

The study of curves has numerous applications in various fields. In computer graphics, curves are used to create smooth and continuous paths for objects to follow. In computer-aided design, curves are used to create complex shapes and objects. In robotics, curves are used to define the trajectory of a robot's movement.

In addition to these applications, the study of curves is also essential in understanding the properties of surfaces. In the next section, we will explore the differential geometry of surfaces and how it relates to the study of curves.

### Section: 2.1 Differential Geometry of Curves:

In this section, we will explore the differential geometry of curves, which is a fundamental concept in computational geometry. Curves are essential in many applications, such as computer graphics, robotics, and data analysis. Understanding the differential geometry of curves allows us to analyze and manipulate curves in a precise and efficient manner.

#### 2.1a Curve Definitions

A curve is a geometric object that is one-dimensional and continuous. It is defined by a function $f(t)$ that maps the real numbers to the plane. The function $f(t)$ is called the parametric equation of the curve, and the real numbers $t$ are called the parameters of the curve.

The derivative of the function $f(t)$ with respect to the parameter $t$ is called the tangent vector of the curve at the point $f(t)$. The tangent vector is a vector that points in the direction of the curve at the point $f(t)$. The length of the tangent vector is the speed of the curve at the point $f(t)$.

The second derivative of the function $f(t)$ with respect to the parameter $t$ is called the curvature of the curve at the point $f(t)$. The curvature is a measure of how quickly the tangent vector changes direction as the parameter $t$ increases. The curvature is positive if the tangent vector rotates counterclockwise as the parameter $t$ increases, and the curvature is negative if the tangent vector rotates clockwise as the parameter $t$ increases.

The third derivative of the function $f(t)$ with respect to the parameter $t$ is called the torsion of the curve at the point $f(t)$. The torsion is a measure of how quickly the tangent vector changes direction as the parameter $t$ increases. The torsion is positive if the tangent vector rotates counterclockwise as the parameter $t$ increases, and the torsion is negative if the tangent vector rotates clockwise as the parameter $t$ increases.

The fourth derivative of the function $f(t)$ with respect to the parameter $t$ is called the bending energy of the curve at the point $f(t)$. The bending energy is a measure of the energy required to bend the curve at the point $f(t)$. The bending energy is positive if the curve is bent in a positive direction, and the bending energy is negative if the curve is bent in a negative direction.

The fifth derivative of the function $f(t)$ with respect to the parameter $t$ is called the twisting energy of the curve at the point $f(t)$. The twisting energy is a measure of the energy required to twist the curve at the point $f(t)$. The twisting energy is positive if the curve is twisted in a positive direction, and the twisting energy is negative if the curve is twisted in a negative direction.

The sixth derivative of the function $f(t)$ with respect to the parameter $t$ is called the warping energy of the curve at the point $f(t)$. The warping energy is a measure of the energy required to warp the curve at the point $f(t)$. The warping energy is positive if the curve is warped in a positive direction, and the warping energy is negative if the curve is warped in a negative direction.

The seventh derivative of the function $f(t)$ with respect to the parameter $t$ is called the bending moment of the curve at the point $f(t)$. The bending moment is a measure of the moment of inertia of the curve at the point $f(t)$. The bending moment is positive if the curve is bent in a positive direction, and the bending moment is negative if the curve is bent in a negative direction.

The eighth derivative of the function $f(t)$ with respect to the parameter $t$ is called the twisting moment of the curve at the point $f(t)$. The twisting moment is a measure of the moment of inertia of the curve at the point $f(t)$. The twisting moment is positive if the curve is twisted in a positive direction, and the twisting moment is negative if the curve is twisted in a negative direction.

The ninth derivative of the function $f(t)$ with respect to the parameter $t$ is called the warping moment of the curve at the point $f(t)$. The warping moment is a measure of the moment of inertia of the curve at the point $f(t)$. The warping moment is positive if the curve is warped in a positive direction, and the warping moment is negative if the curve is warped in a negative direction.

The tenth derivative of the function $f(t)$ with respect to the parameter $t$ is called the bending stiffness of the curve at the point $f(t)$.

Surfaces can be represented in various ways. One common way is through parametric equations. These equations define a surface by giving the coordinates of its points in terms of two parameters. For example, the unit sphere can be parametrized by the Euler angles, also called longitude `u` and latitude `v`, as shown in the related context.

Another way to represent a surface is through implicit equations. These equations define a surface by giving an equation that is satisfied by the coordinates of its points. For example, the unit sphere can be defined by the implicit equation `x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1`.

The curvature of a surface at a point can be calculated using the second derivative of its parametric equations or the Hessian matrix of its implicit equations.

Another important property of surfaces is area. The area of a surface is a fundamental property that can be calculated using various methods, such as the double integral or the surface integral. The area of a surface can also be generalized to higher dimensions, where it becomes the surface content.

## Chapter: Convexity and Convexity Preserving Maps

### Introduction

In this chapter, we delve into the fascinating world of convexity and convexity preserving maps. Convexity, a fundamental concept in mathematics, is a property that is not only mathematically intriguing but also has wide-ranging applications in various fields such as optimization, geometry, and computer science. 

We will begin by exploring the concept of convexity, understanding its definition, properties, and significance. We will learn that a set is convex if the line segment connecting any two points within the set lies entirely within the set. This simple definition leads to profound implications, including the convex combination of points, the convex hull of a set, and the convexity of the intersection of convex sets.

Next, we will introduce the concept of convexity preserving maps. These are maps that preserve the convexity of sets. We will see that these maps play a crucial role in many areas of mathematics, including optimization, where they are used to find the global minimum of a convex function.

Throughout the chapter, we will use mathematical notation to express these concepts. For instance, we might denote a convex set as `$S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$` and a convexity preserving map as `$f: S \to \mathbb{R}^n$`. We will also use the popular Markdown format to present mathematical expressions and equations, rendered using the MathJax library. For example, we might write inline math like `$y_j(n)$` and equations like `$$
\Delta w = ...
$$`.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of convexity and convexity preserving maps, and be equipped with the mathematical tools to explore these concepts further.

## Chapter 4: Introduction to Spline Curves:




### Section 4.1 Introduction to Spline Curves:

Spline curves are a fundamental concept in computational geometry, with applications ranging from computer graphics and animation to data interpolation and smoothing. In this section, we will introduce the basic concepts of spline curves, including their definition, properties, and applications.

#### 4.1a Spline Definition

A spline is a mathematical function that is defined piecewise by polynomials. In other words, a spline is a function that is composed of multiple polynomial segments, each defined over a specific interval. The spline function is continuous everywhere, and its derivatives are continuous everywhere except at a finite number of points, known as the knots.

The degree of a spline is determined by the highest degree of the polynomials used in its definition. For example, a cubic spline is defined by cubic polynomials, while a quartic spline is defined by quartic polynomials. The degree of a spline can have a significant impact on its smoothness and the accuracy of its approximation.

Splines are often used in interpolation problems, where the goal is to find a function that passes through a given set of points. In these cases, spline interpolation is often preferred over polynomial interpolation because it yields similar results, even when using low degree polynomials, while avoiding Runge's phenomenon for higher degrees.

In the computer science subfields of computer-aided design and computer graphics, the term "spline" more frequently refers to a piecewise polynomial (parametric) curve. Splines are popular curves in these subfields because of the simplicity of their construction, their ease and accuracy of evaluation, and their capacity to approximate complex shapes through curve fitting and interactive curve design.

The term spline comes from the flexible spline devices used by shipbuilders and draftsmen to draw smooth shapes. These devices were made of a flexible strip of metal or wood that could be shaped by hand to create smooth curves. The term was later adopted by mathematicians to describe their mathematical counterparts.

In the next section, we will explore the properties of spline curves and how they can be used to approximate complex shapes.


## Chapter 4: Introduction to Spline Curves:




#### 4.1b Spline Properties

Splines have several important properties that make them useful in computational geometry. These properties include continuity, differentiability, and the ability to approximate complex shapes.

##### Continuity

As mentioned earlier, splines are continuous everywhere. This means that the function is smooth and does not have any abrupt changes. This property is crucial in many applications, such as computer graphics, where smooth curves are often required.

##### Differentiability

The derivatives of splines are also continuous, except at the knots. This property is important in many applications, such as curve fitting, where the goal is to find a function that closely approximates a given set of points. The differentiability of splines allows us to use optimization techniques to find the best-fit spline.

##### Approximation

Splines are known for their ability to approximate complex shapes. This is due to the fact that splines are piecewise polynomials, and polynomials can approximate any continuous function. By adjusting the degree of the spline, we can control the smoothness of the approximation.

##### Interpolation

Splines are often used in interpolation problems, where the goal is to find a function that passes through a given set of points. The properties of splines, such as their continuity and differentiability, make them well-suited for this task.

In the next section, we will explore some applications of splines in computational geometry.

#### 4.1c Spline Applications

Splines have a wide range of applications in computational geometry. In this section, we will explore some of these applications, including curve fitting, surface reconstruction, and data interpolation.

##### Curve Fitting

One of the most common applications of splines is in curve fitting. Given a set of points, the goal is to find a curve that passes through these points. Splines are particularly useful for this task due to their ability to approximate complex shapes. By adjusting the degree of the spline, we can control the smoothness of the approximation. This makes splines a powerful tool for curve fitting, especially in situations where the underlying function is not known.

##### Surface Reconstruction

Splines are also used in surface reconstruction. Given a set of points on a surface, the goal is to reconstruct the surface. Splines can be used to create a smooth surface that passes through the given points. This is particularly useful in applications such as 3D scanning, where the goal is to create a digital representation of a physical object.

##### Data Interpolation

Another important application of splines is in data interpolation. Given a set of data points, the goal is to find a function that interpolates these points. Splines are well-suited for this task due to their differentiability. This allows us to use optimization techniques to find the best-fit spline. This is particularly useful in applications such as geographic information systems (GIS), where the goal is to interpolate data over a geographic region.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the theory behind splines, exploring concepts such as the spline basis and the spline representation.




#### 4.1c Spline Applications

Splines have a wide range of applications in computational geometry. In this section, we will explore some of these applications, including curve fitting, surface reconstruction, and data interpolation.

##### Curve Fitting

One of the most common applications of splines is in curve fitting. Given a set of points, the goal is to find a curve that passes through these points. Splines are particularly useful for this task due to their ability to approximate complex shapes. The properties of splines, such as their continuity and differentiability, make them well-suited for curve fitting.

##### Surface Reconstruction

Splines are also used in surface reconstruction, where the goal is to reconstruct a surface from a set of sample points. This is often done in computer graphics, where a 3D model needs to be reconstructed from a set of 2D images. Splines are particularly useful for this task due to their ability to approximate complex shapes and their smoothness.

##### Data Interpolation

Another important application of splines is in data interpolation. Given a set of data points, the goal is to find a function that interpolates these points. Splines are particularly useful for this task due to their ability to approximate complex shapes and their smoothness. The properties of splines, such as their continuity and differentiability, make them well-suited for data interpolation.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the world of B-splines, a powerful tool in the field of computational geometry. B-splines, short for "basis splines", are mathematical curves that are defined by a set of control points. They are widely used in computer graphics, computer-aided design (CAD), and other fields where smooth curves are needed.

We will begin by introducing the basic concepts of B-splines, including their definition, properties, and how they are constructed. We will then explore the different types of B-splines, such as cubic B-splines and quadratic B-splines, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.

Next, we will delve into the theory behind B-splines, including their mathematical representation and how they are used to represent curves. We will also discuss the concept of B-spline spaces and how they are used to define smooth curves.

Finally, we will look at some applications of B-splines in various fields, including computer graphics, CAD, and data interpolation. We will also discuss some of the challenges and limitations of using B-splines and how they can be overcome.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of B-splines and their role in computational geometry. You will also be able to apply B-splines to solve real-world problems and understand their limitations. So, let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of B-splines!




### Section: 5.1 B-splines:

B-splines are a powerful tool in computational geometry, providing a flexible and efficient way to represent and manipulate curves and surfaces. In this section, we will introduce the basic concepts of B-splines, including their definition, properties, and construction.

#### 5.1a B-spline Definition

A B-spline of order $n$ is a piecewise polynomial function of degree $n-1$ in a variable $x$. The values of $x$ where the pieces of polynomial meet are known as knots, denoted $t_0, t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n$ and sorted into nondecreasing order. When the knots are distinct, the first $n-2$ derivatives of the polynomial pieces are continuous across each knot. When $r$ knots are coincident, then only the first $n-r-1$ derivatives of the spline are continuous across that knot.

For a given sequence of knots, there is, up to a scaling factor, a unique spline $B_{i,n}(x)$ satisfying

$$
B_{i,n}(x) = \frac{(x-t_{i-1})(x-t_{i+1})}{(t_{i+n-1}-t_{i-1})(t_{i+n-1}-t_{i+1})}B_{i,n-1}(x) + \frac{(x-t_{i-1})(t_{i+n-1}-x)}{(t_{i+n-1}-t_{i-1})(t_{i+n-1}-t_{i+1})}B_{i+1,n-1}(x)
$$

where $B_{i,n-1}(x)$ and $B_{i+1,n-1}(x)$ are the splines of order $n-1$ defined by the same knot sequence $t_0, t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n$.

If we add the additional constraint that $\sum_i B_{i,n}(x) = 1$ for all $x$ between the first and last knot, then the scaling factor of $B_{i,n}(x)$ becomes fixed. The resulting $B_{i,n}(x)$ spline functions are called B-splines.

Alternatively, B-splines can be defined by construction by means of the Cox–de Boor recursion formula. Given a knot sequence $\ldots, t_0, t_1, t_2, \ldots$, the B-splines of order 1 are defined by

$$
B_{i,1}(x) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } x \in [t_i, t_{i+1}) \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

The higher-order B-splines are defined by recursion

$$
B_{i,n}(x) = \frac{(x-t_{i-1})B_{i,n-1}(x)}{t_{i+n-1}-t_{i-1}} + \frac{(t_{i+n-1}-x)B_{i+1,n-1}(x)}{t_{i+n-1}-t_{i+1}}
$$

where $B_{i,n-1}(x)$ and $B_{i+1,n-1}(x)$ are the splines of order $n-1$ defined by the same knot sequence $t_0, t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n$.

#### 5.1b B-spline Properties

B-splines have several important properties that make them useful in computational geometry. These include:

1. **Local Support:** Each B-spline has a finite support, meaning that it is only non-zero on a finite interval. This property allows us to control the shape of a curve or surface by manipulating only a small number of control points.

2. **Continuity:** As mentioned earlier, B-splines have continuous derivatives up to a certain order, depending on the number of coincident knots. This property ensures that the curve or surface is smooth and does not have any sharp corners.

3. **Positive Basis:** The B-splines form a positive basis, meaning that the sum of the B-splines at any point is always positive. This property is useful in applications such as shape optimization, where we want to ensure that the shape is always well-defined.

4. **Rational Basis:** The B-splines form a rational basis, meaning that the sum of the B-splines at any point is always finite. This property is useful in applications where we want to represent curves or surfaces using rational functions.

5. **Convex Combination:** The B-splines satisfy the convex combination property, meaning that any linear combination of B-splines is also a B-spline. This property is useful in applications where we want to create complex shapes by combining simpler B-splines.

In the next section, we will explore some applications of B-splines in computational geometry.

#### 5.1c B-spline Applications

B-splines have a wide range of applications in computational geometry. They are used in various fields such as computer graphics, computer-aided design (CAD), and geometric modeling. In this section, we will discuss some of the key applications of B-splines.

##### Curve and Surface Representation

One of the primary applications of B-splines is in the representation of curves and surfaces. B-splines provide a flexible and efficient way to represent complex curves and surfaces. They allow us to control the shape of a curve or surface by manipulating only a small number of control points. This makes them particularly useful in applications where we need to create smooth and continuous curves or surfaces.

##### Shape Optimization

B-splines are also used in shape optimization problems. In these problems, we want to find the optimal shape of a curve or surface that satisfies certain constraints. The positive basis property of B-splines ensures that the shape is always well-defined, making them a useful tool in shape optimization.

##### Geometric Modeling

In geometric modeling, B-splines are used to create and manipulate geometric objects. They provide a powerful and flexible way to represent complex objects, making them a popular choice in applications such as CAD and computer animation.

##### Interpolation and Approximation

B-splines are also used in interpolation and approximation problems. In these problems, we want to find a function that passes through a given set of points. The rational basis property of B-splines makes them particularly useful in these types of problems.

##### NURBS

Non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) are a generalization of B-splines that allow for non-uniformly spaced knots. They are widely used in computer graphics and CAD for their ability to represent complex curves and surfaces with high precision.

In conclusion, B-splines are a powerful tool in computational geometry with a wide range of applications. Their flexibility, efficiency, and ability to represent complex shapes make them an essential tool for anyone working in this field. In the next section, we will delve deeper into the theory behind B-splines and explore some of their more advanced properties.




#### 5.1b B-spline Properties

B-splines have several important properties that make them a powerful tool in computational geometry. These properties include continuity, differentiability, and compact support.

##### Continuity

B-splines are piecewise polynomial functions, meaning they are continuous across the knots. This property is crucial in many applications, as it allows for smooth transitions between different polynomial pieces. The degree of continuity of a B-spline is determined by the number of times the spline crosses a knot. For example, a B-spline of order $n$ will have $n-1$ continuous derivatives across each knot.

##### Differentiability

B-splines are also differentiable functions. The degree of differentiability of a B-spline is determined by the number of times the spline crosses a knot. For example, a B-spline of order $n$ will have $n-1$ continuous derivatives across each knot. This property is particularly useful in applications where the spline needs to be differentiated, such as in curve fitting or surface reconstruction.

##### Compact Support

B-splines have compact support, meaning they are zero outside a finite interval. This property is useful in applications where the spline needs to be truncated or where only a portion of the spline is needed. The order of a B-spline determines the number of knots it has. For example, a B-spline of order $n$ will have $n+1$ knots.

##### Recursive Definition

B-splines can also be defined recursively. This recursive definition allows for the efficient computation of B-splines and their derivatives. The recursive definition is given by the Cox–de Boor recursion formula, which relates the B-splines of order $n$ to the B-splines of order $n-1$. This recursive definition is particularly useful in applications where the spline needs to be evaluated at many points.

In the next section, we will explore some applications of B-splines in computational geometry.

#### 5.1c B-spline Applications

B-splines have a wide range of applications in computational geometry. They are used in curve and surface fitting, interpolation, and reconstruction. In this section, we will explore some of these applications in more detail.

##### Curve and Surface Fitting

B-splines are often used in curve and surface fitting due to their ability to represent complex shapes with a relatively small number of control points. The control points of a B-spline curve or surface can be adjusted to modify the shape of the curve or surface. This makes B-splines a powerful tool for creating smooth, continuous curves and surfaces.

##### Interpolation

B-splines are also used in interpolation, which is the process of finding a function that passes through a given set of points. The B-spline interpolation problem is to find the control points of a B-spline curve or surface that passes through a given set of points. This problem can be solved using the de Boor algorithm, which is a recursive algorithm that computes the control points of a B-spline curve or surface that passes through a given set of points.

##### Reconstruction

B-splines are used in the reconstruction of curves and surfaces from a set of sample points. The reconstruction problem is to find a B-spline curve or surface that passes through a given set of sample points. This problem can be solved using the least squares method, which minimizes the sum of the squares of the distances between the sample points and the B-spline curve or surface.

##### Mesh Generation

B-splines are used in the generation of meshes, which are a collection of points, lines, and surfaces that cover a region of space. The mesh generation problem is to generate a mesh that accurately represents a given region. This problem can be solved using the Ruppert algorithm, which uses B-splines to generate a mesh that accurately represents a given region.

##### Geometric Modeling

B-splines are used in geometric modeling, which is the process of creating mathematical models of real-world objects. The geometric modeling problem is to create a mathematical model of a real-world object that accurately represents its shape and structure. This problem can be solved using the NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-splines) representation, which uses B-splines to represent complex shapes with a high degree of accuracy.

In the next section, we will explore some of the algorithms used to solve these problems in more detail.




#### 5.1c B-spline Applications

B-splines have a wide range of applications in computational geometry. They are used in various fields such as computer graphics, computer-aided design (CAD), and geometric modeling. In this section, we will explore some of the key applications of B-splines.

##### Curve and Surface Fitting

One of the primary applications of B-splines is in curve and surface fitting. B-splines are used to represent smooth curves and surfaces in a parametric form. This allows for the easy manipulation and interpolation of data points, making them ideal for curve and surface fitting. The degree of the B-spline determines the smoothness of the curve or surface. For example, a B-spline of degree $n$ will have $n-1$ continuous derivatives, making it suitable for representing smooth curves and surfaces.

##### Geometric Modeling

B-splines are also used in geometric modeling, particularly in the representation of complex shapes. They are used to define the shape of an object by specifying its boundary curve or surface. This allows for the easy manipulation and modification of the object's shape. B-splines are also used in the subdivision surface modeling technique, which is a method for creating smooth surfaces from coarse meshes.

##### Computer Graphics

In computer graphics, B-splines are used to create smooth curves and surfaces for objects and characters. They are also used in the animation of these objects, allowing for smooth and natural movements. B-splines are also used in the creation of texture maps, which are used to represent the surface of an object in a 2D image.

##### Other Applications

B-splines have many other applications in computational geometry. They are used in the approximation of functions, the interpolation of data, and the creation of spline spaces. They are also used in the field of isogeometric analysis, where they are used to define basis functions for the approximation of functions.

In the next section, we will explore the properties of B-splines in more detail, including their continuity, differentiability, and compact support. We will also discuss the Cox–de Boor recursion formula, which is used to define B-splines recursively.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the world of Non-Uniform B-splines and Spline Surfaces, two powerful tools in the field of computational geometry. These mathematical constructs have found widespread applications in various fields, including computer graphics, computer-aided design, and data analysis.

Non-Uniform B-splines are a generalization of the Uniform B-splines, which are used to represent curves and surfaces. The non-uniform version allows for more flexibility and control over the shape of the curve or surface, making it a valuable tool in many applications. We will explore the theory behind Non-Uniform B-splines, including their mathematical definition and properties.

Spline Surfaces, on the other hand, are used to represent three-dimensional objects. They are constructed by joining together a series of two-dimensional splines, creating a smooth and continuous surface. We will discuss the different types of spline surfaces, including their advantages and limitations.

Throughout this chapter, we will provide examples and applications of Non-Uniform B-splines and Spline Surfaces to illustrate their practical use. We will also discuss the algorithms and techniques used to construct and manipulate these mathematical objects.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of Non-Uniform B-splines and Spline Surfaces and their role in computational geometry. They will also have the necessary knowledge to apply these concepts in their own work, whether it be in research or industry. So, let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of Non-Uniform B-splines and Spline Surfaces.




## Chapter 6: Non-Uniform B-splines and Spline Surfaces




### Section: 6.1 Non-Uniform B-splines

Non-uniform B-splines are a type of spline that allows for more flexibility and control in the representation of curves and surfaces. Unlike uniform B-splines, which have a fixed number of control points, non-uniform B-splines have varying numbers of control points along the curve or surface. This allows for a more natural representation of complex shapes and structures.

#### 6.1a Non-Uniform B-spline Definition

A non-uniform B-spline of degree $n$ is defined by a set of control points $P = \{p_0, p_1, ..., p_m\}$, where $p_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ for $i = 0, 1, ..., m$. The spline is then given by the piecewise polynomial function

$$
S(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{m} N_i(t)p_i
$$

where $N_i(t)$ is the B-spline basis function of degree $n$ and $t \in [t_i, t_{i+1}]$ for some $t_i \in \mathbb{R}$. The B-spline basis functions are defined recursively by

$$
N_i^{(n)}(t) = \frac{t - t_i}{t_{i+n} - t_i}N_i^{(n-1)}(t) + \frac{t_{i+n+1} - t}{t_{i+n+1} - t_{i+1}}N_{i+1}^{(n-1)}(t)
$$

for $t \in [t_i, t_{i+1}]$ and $i = 0, 1, ..., m-n$. The first and last basis functions are defined as

$$
N_i^{(n)}(t) = \begin{cases}
\frac{(t - t_i)^n}{(t_{i+n} - t_i)^n} & \text{if } t \in [t_i, t_{i+1}] \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

and

$$
N_{m}^{(n)}(t) = \begin{cases}
\frac{(t - t_{m})^n}{(t_{m+1} - t_{m})^n} & \text{if } t \in [t_{m}, t_{m+1}] \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

respectively. The B-spline basis functions have several important properties that make them useful in the representation of curves and surfaces. These include:

- Non-negativity: All B-spline basis functions are non-negative. This ensures that the spline is always above or below the control points, depending on the degree of the spline.
- Local support: The support of a B-spline basis function is limited to a small region around the control point. This allows for local changes in the spline without affecting the rest of the curve or surface.
- Continuity: B-spline basis functions are continuous and have continuous derivatives up to the degree of the spline. This ensures that the spline is smooth and well-behaved.
- Compact support: The support of a B-spline basis function is limited to a finite interval. This allows for the representation of curves and surfaces with finite extent.

In the next section, we will explore the properties of non-uniform B-splines in more detail and discuss their applications in computational geometry.

#### 6.1b Non-Uniform B-spline Properties

Non-uniform B-splines have several important properties that make them a powerful tool in computational geometry. These properties include:

- Non-uniformity: Unlike uniform B-splines, which have a fixed number of control points, non-uniform B-splines have varying numbers of control points along the curve or surface. This allows for a more natural representation of complex shapes and structures.
- Continuity: Non-uniform B-splines are continuous functions, meaning that they do not have any jumps or breaks in their values. This is important for representing smooth curves and surfaces.
- Differentiability: Non-uniform B-splines are differentiable functions, meaning that they have well-defined derivatives. This is useful for applications that require smooth and continuous curves and surfaces.
- Local control: The control points of a non-uniform B-spline have local influence over the shape of the spline. This means that changing a single control point will only affect a small portion of the spline, making it easier to make local changes to the shape.
- Compact support: The support of a non-uniform B-spline is compact, meaning that it is contained within a finite interval. This is useful for representing curves and surfaces with finite extent.
- Basis property: Non-uniform B-splines have a basis property, meaning that they can be represented as a linear combination of B-spline basis functions. This allows for efficient representation and manipulation of non-uniform B-splines.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of non-uniform B-splines in computational geometry.

#### 6.1c Non-Uniform B-spline Applications

Non-uniform B-splines have a wide range of applications in computational geometry. Some of the most common applications include:

- Curve and surface representation: Non-uniform B-splines are commonly used to represent curves and surfaces in computational geometry. Their ability to have varying numbers of control points allows for a more natural representation of complex shapes and structures.
- Smooth interpolation: Non-uniform B-splines are often used for smooth interpolation, where a smooth curve or surface is needed to connect a set of data points. Their continuity and differentiability properties make them well-suited for this task.
- Local deformation: The local control property of non-uniform B-splines makes them useful for local deformation of curves and surfaces. This is particularly useful in applications such as computer animation and computer-aided design.
- Curve and surface fitting: Non-uniform B-splines are commonly used for curve and surface fitting, where a curve or surface is needed to approximate a set of data points. Their basis property allows for efficient representation and manipulation of the curve or surface.
- Mesh generation: Non-uniform B-splines are used in mesh generation for finite element analysis and other numerical methods. Their compact support property is particularly useful for generating meshes with finite extent.

In the next section, we will explore the properties of spline surfaces, another important tool in computational geometry.

$$

for $t \in [t_i, t_{i+1}]$ and $i = 0, 1, ..., m-n$. The first and last basis functions are defined as

$$
N_i^{(n)}(t) = \begin{cases}
\frac{(t - t_i)^n}{(t_{i+n} - t_i)^n} & \text{if } t \in [t_i, t_{i+1}] \\

\end{cases}
$$

and

$$
N_{m}^{(n)}(t) = \begin{cases}
\frac{(t - t_{m})^n}{(t_{m+1} - t_{m})^n} & \text{if } t \in [t_{m}, t_{m+1}] \\

respectively. The B-spline basis functions have several important properties that make them useful in the representation of curves and surfaces. These include:

- Local support: The support of a B-spline basis function is limited to a small region around the control point. This allows for local changes in the spline without affecting the rest of the curve or surface.
- Continuity: B-spline basis functions are continuous functions, meaning that there are no sudden jumps or breaks in the spline. This allows for smooth curves and surfaces.
- Differentiability: B-spline basis functions are differentiable functions, meaning that they have a well-defined derivative. This allows for the calculation of the derivative of the spline at any point.
- Compact support: The support of a B-spline basis function is limited to a small region around the control point. This allows for the representation of complex shapes and structures with a finite number of control points.

#### 6.1b Non-Uniform B-spline Properties

In addition to the properties mentioned above, non-uniform B-splines have several other important properties that make them useful in the representation of curves and surfaces. These include:

- Non-uniformity: Unlike uniform B-splines, which have a fixed number of control points, non-uniform B-splines have varying numbers of control points along the curve or surface. This allows for a more natural representation of complex shapes and structures.
- Degree flexibility: The degree of a non-uniform B-spline can be varied, allowing for more control over the shape of the curve or surface. This is particularly useful in applications where the shape of the curve or surface is not known beforehand.
- Local control: The control points of a non-uniform B-spline only affect the shape of the curve or surface in their local region. This allows for local changes in the shape without affecting the rest of the curve or surface.
- Continuity and differentiability: Non-uniform B-splines have the same properties of continuity and differentiability as uniform B-splines. This allows for smooth curves and surfaces with well-defined derivatives.
- Compact support: The support of a non-uniform B-spline is still limited to a small region around the control points, making them useful for representing complex shapes and structures with a finite number of control points.

#### 6.1c Non-Uniform B-spline Applications

Non-uniform B-splines have a wide range of applications in computer graphics and animation. Some common applications include:

- Curve and surface representation: Non-uniform B-splines are commonly used to represent curves and surfaces in computer graphics. Their ability to represent complex shapes with a finite number of control points makes them a popular choice for creating smooth and realistic curves and surfaces.
- Animation: Non-uniform B-splines are also used in animation to create smooth and natural movements of objects. By varying the degree and control points of the spline, animators can create a wide range of movements and expressions.
- Mesh generation: Non-uniform B-splines are used in mesh generation for finite element analysis and other numerical methods. Their ability to represent complex shapes with a finite number of control points makes them a popular choice for creating high-quality meshes.
- Interpolation: Non-uniform B-splines are used in interpolation problems to find the best approximation of a given function. Their properties of continuity and differentiability make them a popular choice for interpolation.
- Data fitting: Non-uniform B-splines are also used in data fitting to find the best approximation of a given set of data points. Their ability to represent complex shapes with a finite number of control points makes them a popular choice for data fitting.

In conclusion, non-uniform B-splines are a powerful tool in computational geometry, with a wide range of applications in computer graphics, animation, and other fields. Their ability to represent complex shapes with a finite number of control points, along with their properties of continuity and differentiability, make them a popular choice for creating smooth and realistic curves and surfaces. 


## Chapter 6: Non-Uniform B-splines and Spline Surfaces:




### Section: 6.2 Spline Surfaces

Spline surfaces are a generalization of spline curves, and they are used to represent two-dimensional surfaces in three-dimensional space. Similar to spline curves, spline surfaces are defined by a set of control points, and they are used in a variety of applications, including computer graphics, computer-aided design, and finite element modeling.

#### 6.2a Spline Surface Definition

A spline surface of degree ($n$, $m$) is defined by a set of ($n$ + 1)($m$ + 1) control points $k_{i,j}$, where $i = 0, ..., n$ and $j = 0, ..., m$. The surface maps the unit square into a smooth-continuous surface embedded within the space containing the $k_{i,j}$ s.

A two-dimensional spline surface can be defined as a parametric surface where the position of a point $p$ as a function of the parametric coordinates $u$, $v$ is given by:

$$
p(u,v) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \sum_{j=0}^{m} N_i(u)N_j(v)k_{i,j}
$$

where $N_i(u)$ and $N_j(v)$ are the B-spline basis functions of degree $n$ and $m$, respectively, and $u$ and $v$ are in the interval [0, 1]. The basis functions are defined recursively by:

$$
N_i^{(n)}(u) = \frac{u - u_i}{u_{i+n} - u_i}N_i^{(n-1)}(u) + \frac{u_{i+n+1} - u}{u_{i+n+1} - u_{i+1}}N_{i+1}^{(n-1)}(u)
$$

for $u \in [u_i, u_{i+1}]$ and $i = 0, 1, ..., n-1$, and

$$
N_i^{(n)}(u) = \begin{cases}
\frac{(u - u_i)^n}{(u_{i+n} - u_i)^n} & \text{if } u \in [u_i, u_{i+1}] \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

for $u \in [u_i, u_{i+1}]$ and $i = n$. The basis functions $N_j(v)$ are defined similarly.

Some properties of spline surfaces:

- Generally, the most common use of spline surfaces is as nets of bicubic patches (where $n = m = 3$). The geometry of a single bicubic patch is thus completely defined by a set of 16 control points. These are typically linked up to form a B-spline surface in a similar way as Bézier curves are linked up to form a B-spline curve.

- Simpler spline surfaces are formed from biquadratic patches ($n = m = 2$). These surfaces are defined by a set of 9 control points and are often used in applications where a smooth, continuous surface is required.

- Spline surfaces can also be defined using higher-order basis functions, such as the B-spline basis functions of degree $n > 3$. These surfaces are defined by a set of ($n$ + 1)($m$ + 1) control points and are often used in applications where a high degree of flexibility is required.

- Spline surfaces can be used to represent a wide range of shapes and structures, from simple curves and surfaces to complex three-dimensional objects. They are particularly useful in applications where the shape is not easily described using analytic equations.

- Spline surfaces can be easily manipulated using various operations, such as smoothing, subdivision, and blending. These operations allow for the creation of complex shapes and surfaces with a high degree of control.

- Spline surfaces can be used in conjunction with other geometric primitives, such as points, lines, and curves, to create more complex shapes and structures. This allows for the creation of a wide range of objects, from simple shapes to complex three-dimensional models.

#### 6.2b Spline Surface Properties

Spline surfaces, like spline curves, have several important properties that make them useful in a variety of applications. These properties include smoothness, local control, and the ability to approximate complex shapes.

##### Smoothness

Spline surfaces are smooth surfaces, meaning that they have continuous derivatives of all orders. This is a desirable property for many applications, as it allows for the creation of smooth, continuous surfaces. The smoothness of a spline surface is determined by the degree of the spline. For example, a spline surface of degree ($n$, $m$) will have continuous derivatives up to order $n$ in the $u$ direction and order $m$ in the $v$ direction.

##### Local Control

Another important property of spline surfaces is local control. This means that the shape of the surface is determined by the control points in a local region. Changes to the control points in one region do not affect the shape of the surface in another region. This property makes it easy to modify the surface by adjusting the control points.

##### Approximation

Spline surfaces are also capable of approximating complex shapes. This is because the surface is defined by a set of control points, and the shape of the surface is determined by the position of these points. By adjusting the position of the control points, the shape of the surface can be changed. This makes spline surfaces useful for representing and manipulating complex shapes.

##### Continuity

Continuity is a crucial property for spline surfaces. It ensures that the surface is smooth and continuous, without any abrupt changes. This is important for applications such as computer graphics, where the surface is often viewed from different angles and perspectives. The level of continuity is determined by the degree of the spline. For example, a spline surface of degree ($n$, $m$) will have $n$th order continuity in the $u$ direction and $m$th order continuity in the $v$ direction.

##### Non-Uniformity

Non-uniformity refers to the ability of spline surfaces to handle unevenly spaced control points. This is in contrast to uniform B-splines, where the control points are evenly spaced. Non-uniform B-splines are useful for representing surfaces with irregular shapes or where the level of detail varies.

In conclusion, spline surfaces have several important properties that make them useful in a variety of applications. These properties include smoothness, local control, approximation, continuity, and non-uniformity. Understanding these properties is crucial for working with spline surfaces in computational geometry.

#### 6.2c Spline Surface Applications

Spline surfaces have a wide range of applications in various fields, including computer graphics, computer-aided design (CAD), and finite element analysis. In this section, we will discuss some of these applications in more detail.

##### Computer Graphics

In computer graphics, spline surfaces are used to create smooth, continuous surfaces for objects in a 3D scene. The smoothness and local control properties of spline surfaces make them ideal for this application. For example, the surfaces of 3D models in a video game or animated film are often represented as spline surfaces. The level of continuity of the spline surface ensures that the surface is smooth and continuous, even when viewed from different angles.

##### Computer-Aided Design

In CAD, spline surfaces are used to create complex shapes and curves. The approximation property of spline surfaces allows for the creation of intricate shapes that would be difficult to represent using simpler geometric primitives. The local control property makes it easy to modify the shape by adjusting the control points.

##### Finite Element Analysis

In finite element analysis, spline surfaces are used to represent the geometry of a physical object. The surface is then divided into a mesh of smaller elements, and the behavior of the object is analyzed by solving a system of equations over these elements. The smoothness and continuity properties of spline surfaces are crucial for this application, as they ensure that the surface is well-defined and that the analysis is accurate.

##### Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines

Non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) are a generalization of spline surfaces that allow for the representation of surfaces with non-uniformly spaced control points. NURBS are used in many of the same applications as spline surfaces, but they offer additional flexibility and control. For example, in CAD, NURBS can be used to create surfaces with varying levels of detail, such as a smooth, curved surface in one region and a more detailed, faceted surface in another.

In conclusion, spline surfaces and their generalization NURBS are powerful tools in computational geometry, with a wide range of applications in various fields. Their properties of smoothness, local control, approximation, continuity, and non-uniformity make them versatile and useful for representing and manipulating complex shapes.

## Chapter: Chapter 7: Moving Least Squares and Surface Reconstruction

### Introduction

In this chapter, we delve into the fascinating world of Moving Least Squares (MLS) and Surface Reconstruction, two fundamental concepts in the field of computational geometry. These concepts are not only theoretically interesting, but also have wide-ranging applications in various fields such as computer graphics, computer-aided design, and data analysis.

Moving Least Squares is a numerical method used to approximate the solution of a system of equations. It is particularly useful in computational geometry for its ability to handle complex geometrical problems. The MLS method is based on the principle of least squares, which minimizes the sum of the squares of the residuals. This method is particularly useful when dealing with noisy or incomplete data.

Surface Reconstruction, on the other hand, is a process of creating a surface from a set of data points. This is a crucial step in many computational geometry problems, as it allows us to represent complex geometrical objects in a digital format. Surface reconstruction is used in a variety of applications, from creating 3D models of physical objects to generating surfaces from scattered data points.

Throughout this chapter, we will explore these concepts in depth, discussing their theoretical foundations, their applications, and the algorithms used to implement them. We will also provide numerous examples and exercises to help you understand these concepts better.

Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field of computational geometry, this chapter will provide you with the knowledge and tools you need to understand and apply Moving Least Squares and Surface Reconstruction in your work. So, let's embark on this exciting journey together.

### Subsection: 7.1a NURBS Definition

Non-Uniform Rational B-spline (NURBS) curves and surfaces are a powerful mathematical tool used in computer graphics and computer-aided design (CAD) to create smooth, continuous curves and surfaces. They are widely used in various industries, including automotive, aerospace, and architecture, due to their ability to accurately represent complex shapes and forms.

A NURBS curve is defined by its order, knot vector, and control points. The order of a NURBS curve is the degree of the polynomial used to define the curve. The knot vector is a sequence of parameter values that determines where and how the control points affect the curve. The number of knots is always equal to the number of control points plus the curve degree plus one. Each time the parameter value enters a new knot span, a new control point becomes active, while an old control point is discarded.

The control points of a NURBS curve determine the shape of the curve. Each point of the curve is computed by taking a weighted sum of a number of control points. The weight of each point varies according to the governing parameter. For a curve of degree "d", the influence of any control point is only nonzero in "d"+1 intervals (knot spans) of the parameter space. Within those intervals, the weight changes according to a polynomial function (basis functions) of degree "d". At the boundaries of the intervals, the basis functions go smoothly to zero, the smoothness being determined by the degree of the polynomial.

A NURBS curve takes the following form:

$$
\mathbf{r}(u) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \mathbf{p}_i w_i R_i(u)
$$

where $\mathbf{r}(u)$ is the position vector of the curve at parameter value $u$, $\mathbf{p}_i$ is the position vector of the $i$th control point, $w_i$ is the weight of the $i$th control point, and $R_i(u)$ is the $i$th basis function.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of NURBS curves and surfaces, and discuss their applications in various industries.


## Chapter 7: Non-Uniform Rational B-spline Curves and Surfaces:




### Subsection: 7.1b NURBS Properties

Non-Uniform Rational B-spline (NURBS) curves and surfaces have several important properties that make them a powerful tool in computational geometry. These properties include continuity, smoothness, and the ability to accurately represent complex shapes.

#### Continuity

NURBS curves and surfaces are continuous functions. This means that there are no abrupt jumps or breaks in the curve or surface. This property is crucial in many applications, as it allows for smooth, continuous transitions between different parts of a curve or surface.

#### Smoothness

NURBS curves and surfaces are smooth functions. This means that they have no sharp corners or abrupt changes in direction. The smoothness of a NURBS curve or surface is determined by its degree. A higher degree means a smoother curve or surface. This property is particularly useful in applications where smooth, continuous shapes are required.

#### Ability to Represent Complex Shapes

NURBS curves and surfaces are capable of accurately representing complex shapes. This is due to their ability to be defined by a set of control points, each of which can have a different influence on the shape of the curve or surface. This allows for a high degree of control over the shape, making it possible to create intricate and detailed designs.

#### Invariance under Affine Transformations

Another important property of NURBS curves and surfaces is their invariance under affine transformations. This means that if a NURBS curve or surface is transformed using an affine transformation, the resulting curve or surface will still be a NURBS curve or surface. This property is useful in applications where transformations are required, as it allows for the preservation of the NURBS properties.

#### Rationality

NURBS curves and surfaces are rational functions. This means that they can be expressed as a ratio of two polynomials. This property is useful in applications where rational functions are required, such as in the representation of conic sections.

#### Non-Uniformity

The "non-uniform" aspect of NURBS curves and surfaces refers to the fact that the knot vector can have different spacing between knots. This allows for more control over the shape of the curve or surface, as the knots can be spaced closer together in areas where more control is needed, and farther apart in areas where less control is needed.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of NURBS curves and surfaces, and discuss their applications in various fields.


### Conclusion

### Subsection: 8.1a Deformable Surface Definition

Deformable surfaces are mathematical models that describe the behavior of surfaces under various physical forces. They are designed to mimic the behavior of real-world materials, such as rubber, cloth, or biological tissues, under different conditions. This makes them an invaluable tool for simulating and analyzing the behavior of these materials in a virtual environment.

#### 8.1a.1 Basic Concepts

A deformable surface is a mathematical representation of a surface in a three-dimensional space. It is defined by a set of points, each with a position vector $r(u,v)$, where $u$ and $v$ are parameters that define the position of a point on the surface. The position vector $r(u,v)$ is a function of the parameters $u$ and $v$, and it describes the location of each point on the surface.

The deformation of a deformable surface is described by a deformation function $f(u,v)$, which maps the parameters $u$ and $v$ to a new set of parameters $\bar{u}$ and $\bar{v}$. The deformation function $f(u,v)$ is typically defined in terms of a set of physical forces acting on the surface, such as gravity, tension, or pressure.

#### 8.1a.2 Mathematical Models

The behavior of a deformable surface is described by a set of differential equations. These equations are derived from the principles of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, and they describe how the surface deforms under various physical forces.

The most common mathematical model for deformable surfaces is the finite element method. This method discretizes the surface into a set of finite elements, and it solves the differential equations for each element. The solutions for the individual elements are then combined to obtain the overall deformation of the surface.

Another popular mathematical model is the level set method. This method represents the surface as the zero level set of a higher-dimensional function. The deformation of the surface is then described by the evolution of this function.

#### 8.1a.3 Applications

Deformable surfaces have a wide range of applications in various fields. In computer graphics and animation, they are used to create realistic and lifelike characters and objects. In robotics, they are used to model and control the deformation of flexible structures. In medical imaging, they are used to analyze the deformation of biological tissues under different conditions.

#### 8.1a.4 Future Directions

The field of deformable surfaces is constantly evolving, with new mathematical models and numerical methods being developed. Researchers are also exploring new applications in areas such as biomechanics and tissue engineering. The use of machine learning techniques is also being investigated to improve the accuracy and efficiency of deformable surface models.

In conclusion, deformable surfaces are a powerful tool for representing and manipulating complex shapes and structures. They have a wide range of applications and are constantly evolving to meet the demands of various fields. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the mathematical models and numerical methods used to describe these surfaces.

### Subsection: 8.1b Deformable Surface Properties

Deformable surfaces have several important properties that make them useful for modeling and simulating real-world materials. These properties include elasticity, plasticity, and viscoelasticity.

#### 8.1b.1 Elasticity

Elasticity is the ability of a material to return to its original shape after being deformed. In the context of deformable surfaces, this means that the surface will return to its original shape after the physical forces acting on it are removed. This property is often modeled using the Hooke's law, which describes the relationship between the deformation of a material and the forces acting on it.

#### 8.1b.2 Plasticity

Plasticity is the ability of a material to permanently deform under the action of physical forces. In the context of deformable surfaces, this means that the surface will not return to its original shape after the physical forces acting on it are removed. This property is often modeled using the von Mises yield criterion, which describes the conditions under which a material will start to deform plastically.

#### 8.1b.3 Viscoelasticity

Viscoelasticity is the combination of elasticity and plasticity. Viscoelastic materials exhibit both elastic and plastic behavior, and their response to physical forces depends on the rate at which these forces are applied. In the context of deformable surfaces, this means that the surface will deform and eventually return to its original shape, but the rate at which this happens depends on the rate at which the physical forces are applied. This property is often modeled using the Maxwell model, which describes the behavior of a viscoelastic material as a combination of an elastic spring and a viscous damper.

#### 8.1b.4 Other Properties

In addition to these three main properties, deformable surfaces can also exhibit other properties such as damping, stiffness, and toughness. These properties can be modeled using various mathematical models, such as the finite element method or the level set method. The choice of model depends on the specific requirements of the simulation, such as the accuracy of the model, the computational cost, and the complexity of the surface geometry.

### Subsection: 8.1c Deformable Surface Applications

In computer graphics, deformable surfaces are used to create realistic models of objects and characters. These models can deform in response to physical forces, such as gravity or collisions, allowing for more natural and lifelike movements. This is particularly useful in animation, where characters and objects need to move in a realistic and believable manner.

Deformable surfaces are also used in virtual reality (VR) applications. In VR, users interact with virtual environments using VR controllers or their own body movements. Deformable surfaces allow for more natural and realistic interactions, as the virtual objects and surfaces can deform in response to the user's actions.

#### 8.1c.2 Robotics

In robotics, deformable surfaces are used to model and simulate the behavior of robots and their interactions with the environment. This is particularly important in the design and testing of new robots, as it allows engineers to predict and analyze the behavior of the robot in real-world scenarios.

Deformable surfaces are also used in the design of robotic grippers and end-effectors. These components need to be able to deform and adapt to different shapes and sizes, and deformable surfaces provide a powerful tool for modeling and simulating this behavior.

#### 8.1c.3 Biomechanics

In biomechanics, deformable surfaces are used to model and simulate the behavior of biological tissues and organs. This is particularly important in the study of human movement and injury, as it allows researchers to understand how different tissues and organs respond to physical forces.

Deformable surfaces are also used in the design of medical devices, such as prosthetics and implants. These devices need to be able to deform and adapt to the specific conditions of the human body, and deformable surfaces provide a powerful tool for modeling and simulating this behavior.

#### 8.1c.4 Other Applications

In addition to these main applications, deformable surfaces have many other uses in various fields. For example, they are used in the design of soft robots, the simulation of fluid dynamics, and the modeling of biological processes. As computational power continues to increase, we can expect to see even more applications of deformable surfaces in the future.

In computer graphics and animation, deformable surfaces are used to create realistic and lifelike movements of objects and characters. The ability of deformable surfaces to deform and return to their original shape makes them ideal for modeling and animating organic objects such as animals, plants, and human bodies.

For example, in the animation industry, deformable surfaces are used to create realistic movements of characters and creatures. The animators can control the deformation of the surfaces to achieve the desired movements, and the surfaces will return to their original shape after the animation is completed. This allows for more natural and fluid movements, which are essential for creating believable animations.

#### 8.1c.2 Robotics

In robotics, deformable surfaces are used to create robots that can adapt to their environment. The ability of deformable surfaces to deform and return to their original shape allows robots to perform tasks in unknown or changing environments.

For instance, in the field of soft robotics, deformable surfaces are used to create robots that can adapt to their environment by deforming their surfaces. This allows these robots to perform tasks such as grasping and manipulating objects, navigating through complex environments, and interacting with humans.

### Section: 9.1 Fairing:

Fairing is a fundamental concept in computational geometry that involves smoothing out rough surfaces or edges of a geometric object. It is a crucial step in many geometric modeling and design processes, as it allows for the creation of smooth and aesthetically pleasing objects. In this section, we will explore the theory behind fairing, including its mathematical foundations and algorithms, and its applications in various fields.

#### 9.1a Fairing Definition

Fairing can be defined as the process of removing small errors in the surface of a geometric object, such as bumps or dents, to create a smooth and continuous surface. It is often used in computer graphics and animation to create realistic and visually appealing objects. In computational geometry, fairing is an important tool for creating smooth and accurate representations of geometric objects.

The goal of fairing is to minimize the difference between the original surface and the smoothed surface. This is typically achieved by iteratively applying a fairing algorithm to the surface, which adjusts the vertices of the surface to minimize the error. The error can be measured using various metrics, such as the maximum or average error, or the total surface area of the error.

There are several different types of fairing algorithms, each with its own advantages and limitations. Some common types include:

- **Vertex-based fairing:** This type of fairing algorithm adjusts the vertices of the surface to minimize the error. It is often used for simple and smooth surfaces.
- **Edge-based fairing:** This type of fairing algorithm adjusts the edges of the surface to minimize the error. It is useful for more complex surfaces with multiple edges.
- **Face-based fairing:** This type of fairing algorithm adjusts the faces of the surface to minimize the error. It is useful for surfaces with multiple faces and is often used in 3D modeling.

The choice of fairing algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the application and the complexity of the surface. In some cases, a combination of different types of fairing algorithms may be used to achieve the desired result.

#### 9.1b Fairing Algorithms

Vertex-based fairing is a simple and efficient algorithm for smoothing out the surface of a geometric object. It works by adjusting the vertices of the surface to minimize the error. This is typically achieved by moving the vertices along the normal vector of the surface. The algorithm iteratively adjusts the vertices until the error is minimized.

Vertex-based fairing is commonly used for simple and smooth surfaces, such as spheres or cylinders. It is also useful for surfaces with a small number of vertices. However, it may not be suitable for more complex surfaces with multiple edges or faces.

##### Edge-based Fairing

Edge-based fairing is another commonly used algorithm for smoothing out the surface of a geometric object. It works by adjusting the edges of the surface to minimize the error. This is typically achieved by moving the edges along the normal vector of the surface. The algorithm iteratively adjusts the edges until the error is minimized.

Edge-based fairing is useful for more complex surfaces with multiple edges. It is also useful for surfaces with a large number of vertices. However, it may not be suitable for surfaces with multiple faces.

##### Face-based Fairing

Face-based fairing is a more advanced algorithm for smoothing out the surface of a geometric object. It works by adjusting the faces of the surface to minimize the error. This is typically achieved by moving the faces along the normal vector of the surface. The algorithm iteratively adjusts the faces until the error is minimized.

Face-based fairing is useful for surfaces with multiple faces and is often used in 3D modeling. It is also useful for surfaces with a large number of vertices. However, it may not be suitable for surfaces with multiple edges.

#### 9.1c Fairing Applications

Fairing has a wide range of applications in various fields, including computer graphics, animation, and geometric modeling. Some common applications of fairing include:

- **Surface smoothing:** Fairing is commonly used for smoothing out the surface of a geometric object, such as a sphere or cylinder. This is useful for creating realistic and visually appealing objects in computer graphics and animation.

Fairing algorithms are used to smooth surfaces by minimizing the error between the original surface and the smoothed surface. These algorithms are based on the concept of fairing, which is the process of making a surface smooth by removing small errors and imperfections. Fairing algorithms are used in a variety of applications, including computer graphics, geometric modeling, and manufacturing.

One of the most commonly used fairing algorithms is the Remez algorithm. This algorithm is used to find the best approximation of a function by a polynomial of a given degree. It is based on the concept of interpolation, where the function is approximated by a polynomial that passes through a set of points.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the concept of blending surfaces in computational geometry.

This chapter will cover the theory behind blending surfaces, including their mathematical representation and properties, as well as their applications in various fields such as computer graphics, computer-aided design, and data visualization.

Blending surfaces are used to join two or more surfaces together seamlessly, creating a continuous surface that is smooth and visually appealing. This is particularly useful in situations where data is collected at discrete points, and a smooth surface is needed for visualization or analysis. By blending surfaces, we can create a continuous surface that accurately represents the underlying data, while also maintaining a smooth and visually appealing appearance.

The chapter will begin by discussing the basic concepts of blending surfaces, including their definition and properties. We will then delve into the different types of blending surfaces, such as linear, quadratic, and cubic blending surfaces, and their respective advantages and disadvantages. We will also cover the mathematical representation of blending surfaces, including their equations and parameters.

## Chapter 10: Blending Surfaces:




### Subsection: 10.1a Blending Surface Definition

A blending surface is a mathematical representation of a smooth and continuous surface that is created by joining two or more surfaces together seamlessly. This is achieved by blending the surfaces at their intersection points, creating a smooth transition between them. The resulting blended surface is a combination of the individual surfaces, and it accurately represents the underlying data while maintaining a smooth and visually appealing appearance.

Blending surfaces are defined by a set of control points, which are used to determine the shape and smoothness of the surface. These control points are typically placed at the intersection points of the individual surfaces, and their positions and weights are adjusted to create a smooth transition between the surfaces. The resulting blended surface is then calculated using various mathematical techniques, such as linear, quadratic, or cubic interpolation.

The mathematical representation of a blending surface can be written as:

$$
S(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_iP_i(x)
$$

where $S(x)$ is the blended surface, $P_i(x)$ are the individual surfaces, $w_i$ are the weights of the surfaces, and $n$ is the number of surfaces being blended. The weights $w_i$ are typically determined by the distance between the control points and the point of interest on the surface.

Blending surfaces have a wide range of applications in computational geometry. In computer graphics, they are used to create smooth and realistic surfaces for 3D objects. In computer-aided design, they are used to create smooth and continuous curves for complex shapes. In data visualization, blending surfaces are used to create smooth and visually appealing surfaces from discrete data points.

However, blending surfaces also have some limitations. One of the main challenges is the choice of control points and weights, which can greatly affect the smoothness and accuracy of the resulting surface. Additionally, blending surfaces can become complex and difficult to manipulate when dealing with a large number of surfaces.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of blending surfaces and their respective advantages and disadvantages. We will also discuss the mathematical representation of blending surfaces in more detail.


## Chapter 1:0: Blending Surfaces:




### Subsection: 10.1b Blending Surface Properties

Blending surfaces have several important properties that make them useful in computational geometry. These properties include smoothness, continuity, and accuracy.

#### Smoothness

The smoothness of a blending surface is determined by the choice of control points and weights. The smoother the surface, the more control points and weights are needed. This is because the surface is calculated using interpolation techniques, which rely on the positions and weights of the control points to determine the shape of the surface. By adjusting the weights, the smoothness of the surface can be controlled.

#### Continuity

Continuity refers to the ability of a surface to be smoothly connected to another surface. In the case of blending surfaces, this means that the surfaces being blended must have a common point of intersection. By blending the surfaces at this point, a smooth transition can be created between them. This property is crucial in applications such as computer graphics, where smooth and continuous surfaces are essential for creating realistic objects.

#### Accuracy

The accuracy of a blending surface is determined by the number of surfaces being blended and the choice of control points. The more surfaces being blended, the more accurate the resulting surface will be. However, adding more surfaces also increases the complexity of the surface and may require more control points and weights. The accuracy of the surface can be improved by adjusting the weights of the control points, but this must be done carefully to maintain smoothness and continuity.

In conclusion, blending surfaces have several important properties that make them useful in computational geometry. These properties include smoothness, continuity, and accuracy. By understanding and controlling these properties, blending surfaces can be used to create smooth and accurate surfaces for a variety of applications.

### Section: 11.1 Intersections:

Intersections are fundamental to many geometric problems and applications, and understanding them is crucial for anyone working in computational geometry. In this section, we will explore the concept of intersections and their properties. We will also delve into the different types of intersections, including line-line, line-circle, and circle-circle intersections.

#### 11.1a Intersection Definition

An intersection is a point or a line segment where two or more geometric objects meet. In computational geometry, we often deal with intersections of lines, circles, and other geometric objects. The intersection of two lines, for example, is the point where the two lines meet. The intersection of a line and a circle is the point where the line touches the circle. The intersection of two circles is the point where the two circles touch or overlap.

Intersections play a crucial role in many areas of computational geometry, including computer graphics, robotics, and GIS. In computer graphics, intersections are used to determine the visibility of objects and to create realistic shadows. In robotics, intersections are used to plan paths for robots to navigate through complex environments. In GIS, intersections are used to analyze the overlap of different spatial datasets.

In the following sections, we will explore the different types of intersections in more detail and discuss how to compute them efficiently and accurately. We will also cover the properties of intersections and how they can be used to solve geometric problems.

#### 11.1b Intersection Properties

Intersections have several important properties that are useful in computational geometry. These properties include:

1. Uniqueness: For any two intersecting lines, there is only one point of intersection. This property is crucial in many applications, such as determining the visibility of objects in computer graphics.

2. Transitivity: If three lines intersect at a single point, then the intersection of the first two lines is the same as the intersection of the second and third lines. This property is useful in simplifying intersection calculations.

3. Continuity: The intersection of two lines is a continuous function of the parameters of the lines. This property is important in numerical methods for computing intersections.

4. Symmetry: The intersection of two lines is symmetric with respect to the midpoint of the lines. This property is useful in visualizing intersections and in some applications, such as robotics.

In the next section, we will explore these properties in more detail and discuss how they can be used to solve geometric problems.

#### 11.1c Intersection Algorithms

In this section, we will discuss some of the algorithms used to compute intersections in computational geometry. These algorithms are essential for solving many geometric problems, such as determining the visibility of objects in computer graphics or planning paths for robots in complex environments.

One of the most common algorithms for computing intersections is the line intersection algorithm. This algorithm finds the intersection of two lines by solving a system of linear equations. The algorithm can be extended to handle more than two lines by using the concept of a line arrangement.

Another important algorithm for computing intersections is the circle intersection algorithm. This algorithm finds the intersection of two circles by solving a system of quadratic equations. The algorithm can be extended to handle more than two circles by using the concept of a circle arrangement.

In addition to these algorithms, there are also more advanced techniques for computing intersections, such as the intersection of a line and a curve or the intersection of two curves. These techniques are often used in applications that involve more complex geometric objects.

In the next section, we will explore these algorithms in more detail and discuss their applications in computational geometry.

#### 11.1d Intersection Applications

Intersections have a wide range of applications in computational geometry. In this section, we will explore some of these applications and discuss how intersections are used in various fields.

One of the most common applications of intersections is in computer graphics. Intersections are used to determine the visibility of objects and to create realistic shadows. For example, in a 3D scene, the intersection of a light ray with an object determines whether the object is visible from the light's perspective. Similarly, the intersection of a camera ray with an object determines whether the object is visible from the camera's perspective.

Intersections are also used in robotics. In a robot's environment, intersections are used to plan paths for the robot to navigate through complex environments. For example, in a factory setting, the intersection of a robot's path with a conveyor belt can be used to determine the robot's position and orientation relative to the conveyor belt.

In GIS, intersections are used to analyze the overlap of different spatial datasets. For example, the intersection of a road network with a land use map can be used to determine which areas are accessible by road and which are not.

In addition to these applications, intersections are also used in other fields, such as architecture, urban planning, and transportation engineering. In these fields, intersections are used to design and analyze the layout of buildings, cities, and transportation systems.

In the next section, we will explore some specific examples of intersection applications and discuss how intersections are used in these fields in more detail.

## Chapter: Chapter 12: Convexity

### Introduction

In this chapter, we delve into the fascinating world of convexity, a fundamental concept in computational geometry. Convexity is a property of geometric objects that has profound implications in various fields, including computer graphics, machine learning, and optimization. 

A set in the plane is convex if the line segment connecting any two points in the set lies entirely within the set. In higher dimensions, a set is convex if the line segment connecting any two points in the set lies entirely in the convex hull of the set. The convex hull of a set is the smallest convex set that contains all the points in the original set.

Convexity plays a crucial role in many computational problems. For instance, in computer graphics, convex polygons are often used to represent objects in a scene because they are easier to render and manipulate than non-convex polygons. In machine learning, convex functions are preferred in optimization problems because they have a unique global minimum, making them easier to solve.

In this chapter, we will explore the theory behind convexity, including its properties and algorithms for determining convexity. We will also discuss the applications of convexity in various fields, providing a comprehensive understanding of this important concept. 

Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field of computational geometry, this chapter will provide you with the knowledge and tools to understand and apply convexity in your work. So, let's embark on this journey of exploring convexity and its fascinating implications.

In the previous section, we discussed the basics of surface intersections and their properties. In this section, we will delve deeper into the topic and explore some advanced concepts related to surface intersections.

#### 11.2c Surface Intersection Algorithms

In the previous section, we discussed the properties of surface intersections and how they can be used to solve real-world problems. However, in many cases, it is not always possible to solve these problems analytically. This is where surface intersection algorithms come into play.

Surface intersection algorithms are computational methods used to find the intersection of two or more surfaces. These algorithms are essential in many applications, such as computer graphics, robotics, and computer-aided design.

One of the most commonly used surface intersection algorithms is the line integral convolution (LIC) method. This method was first introduced by David T. T. Chiu in 1993 and has since been widely used in various applications.

The LIC method is based on the concept of line integrals, which are used to calculate the intersection of two surfaces. The algorithm works by integrating the normal vectors of the two surfaces along a curve on the surface. The resulting vector is then used to calculate the intersection point.

Another popular surface intersection algorithm is the marching cubes method. This method was first introduced by Lance Williams in 1993 and has since been widely used in computer graphics and other applications.

The marching cubes method works by dividing the surface into smaller cubes and then finding the intersection points between the surface and the cube boundaries. The resulting points are then used to construct a polygon that represents the intersection of the two surfaces.

In addition to these methods, there are also other surface intersection algorithms, such as the sweep line method and the ray casting method. Each of these methods has its own advantages and is suitable for different types of surfaces.

In conclusion, surface intersection algorithms are essential tools in solving real-world problems that involve the intersection of two or more surfaces. These algorithms provide a systematic approach to finding the intersection points and are widely used in various applications.

#### 11.2c.1 Robotics

One of the most common applications of surface intersection algorithms is in robotics. In robotics, it is often necessary to determine the intersection of two surfaces to perform tasks such as navigation and obstacle avoidance.

For example, in a self-driving car, surface intersection algorithms can be used to determine the intersection of the car's sensors and the road surface. This information can then be used to calculate the car's position and orientation, which is crucial for navigation and obstacle avoidance.

#### 11.2c.2 Computer Graphics

Surface intersection algorithms are also widely used in computer graphics. In computer graphics, it is often necessary to determine the intersection of two surfaces to create realistic images and animations.

For example, in a 3D animation, surface intersection algorithms can be used to determine the intersection of two objects, such as a car and a building. This information can then be used to calculate the position and orientation of the objects, which is crucial for creating realistic movements and collisions.

#### 11.2c.3 Computer-Aided Design

Another important application of surface intersection algorithms is in computer-aided design (CAD). In CAD, it is often necessary to determine the intersection of two surfaces to create complex designs and structures.

For example, in the design of a bridge, surface intersection algorithms can be used to determine the intersection of the bridge's supports and the road surface. This information can then be used to calculate the position and orientation of the supports, which is crucial for creating a stable and safe bridge.

In conclusion, surface intersection algorithms have a wide range of applications in various fields, including robotics, computer graphics, and computer-aided design. These algorithms are essential tools for solving real-world problems and are constantly being improved and developed to meet the demands of modern technology.

## Chapter 12: Line Integrals:




### Subsection 11.3a Nonlinear Solver Definition

Nonlinear solvers are mathematical algorithms used to solve systems of nonlinear equations. These equations are of the form `$F(\mathbf{u},\lambda) = 0$`, where `$\mathbf{u}$` and `$\lambda$` are vectors of unknowns, and `$F$` is a vector-valued function. Nonlinear solvers are essential tools in computational geometry, as they allow us to solve complex problems that involve nonlinear equations.

#### 11.3a.1 Solution Components

A solution component `$\Gamma(\mathbf{u}_0,\lambda_0)$` of the nonlinear system `$F$` is a set of points `$(\mathbf{u},\lambda)$` which satisfy `$F(\mathbf{u},\lambda) = 0$` and are "connected" to the initial solution `$(\mathbf{u}_0,\lambda_0)$` by a path of solutions `$(\mathbf{u}(s),\lambda(s))$` for which `$(\mathbf{u}(0),\lambda(0)) = (\mathbf{u}_0,\lambda_0)$`, `$(\mathbf{u}(1),\lambda(1)) = (\mathbf{u},\lambda)$`, and `$F(\mathbf{u}(s),\lambda(s)) = 0$`.

#### 11.3a.2 Numerical Continuation

A numerical continuation is an algorithm which takes as input a system of parametrized nonlinear equations and an initial solution `$(\mathbf{u}_0,\lambda_0)$`, `$F(\mathbf{u}_0,\lambda_0) = 0$`, and produces a set of points on the solution component `$\Gamma(\mathbf{u}_0,\lambda_0)$`.

#### 11.3a.3 Regular and Singular Points

A regular point of `$F$` is a point `$(\mathbf{u},\lambda)$` at which the Jacobian of `$F$` is full rank `$(n)$`. Near a regular point, the solution component is an isolated curve passing through the regular point (the implicit function theorem). In the figure above, the point `$(\mathbf{u}_0,\lambda_0)$` is a regular point.

A singular point of `$F$` is a point `$(\mathbf{u},\lambda)$` at which the Jacobian of `$F$` is not full rank. Near a singular point, the local structure is determined by higher derivatives of `$F$`. In the figure above, the point where the two blue curves cross is a singular point.

In general, solution components `$\Gamma$` are branched curves. The branch points are singular points. Finding the solution curves leaving a singular point is called branch switching, and uses techniques from numerical continuation.

### Subsection 11.3b Nonlinear Solver Applications

Nonlinear solvers have a wide range of applications in computational geometry. They are used to solve complex problems that involve nonlinear equations, such as finding the intersection of two surfaces or determining the shape of a curve. In this section, we will explore some of these applications in more detail.

#### 11.3b.1 Intersection of Two Surfaces

One of the most common applications of nonlinear solvers in computational geometry is finding the intersection of two surfaces. This is a fundamental problem in many areas, such as robotics, computer graphics, and computer-aided design.

Consider two surfaces defined by the equations `$F_1(\mathbf{u},\lambda) = 0$` and `$F_2(\mathbf{u},\lambda) = 0$`. The intersection of these surfaces is the set of points `$(\mathbf{u},\lambda)$` that satisfy both equations. This is a system of nonlinear equations, and can be solved using a nonlinear solver.

#### 11.3b.2 Shape Optimization

Another important application of nonlinear solvers in computational geometry is shape optimization. This involves finding the shape of a curve or surface that optimizes a certain criterion, such as minimizing the length of a curve or maximizing the volume of a surface.

Consider a curve defined by the equation `$F(\mathbf{u},\lambda) = 0$`. The length of the curve can be expressed as a function of the unknowns `$\mathbf{u}$` and `$\lambda$`. The shape optimization problem is then to find the values of `$\mathbf{u}$` and `$\lambda$` that minimize this length function. This is a system of nonlinear equations, and can be solved using a nonlinear solver.

#### 11.3b.3 Numerical Continuation

Nonlinear solvers are also used in numerical continuation, a method for finding the solutions of a system of nonlinear equations. This involves starting from an initial solution `$(\mathbf{u}_0,\lambda_0)$` and iteratively moving along the solution component `$\Gamma(\mathbf{u}_0,\lambda_0)$` to find other solutions.

Consider a system of nonlinear equations `$F(\mathbf{u},\lambda) = 0$`. The numerical continuation algorithm starts with an initial solution `$(\mathbf{u}_0,\lambda_0)$` and a small step size `$\Delta s$`. It then iteratively updates the solution as `$(\mathbf{u}(s),\lambda(s)) = (\mathbf{u}_0,\lambda_0) + s\Delta s$`, where `$s$` is a scalar parameter. The algorithm terminates when `$F(\mathbf{u}(s),\lambda(s)) = 0$` is no longer satisfied.

In conclusion, nonlinear solvers are powerful tools in computational geometry, with applications ranging from finding the intersection of two surfaces to optimizing the shape of a curve. They allow us to solve complex problems that involve nonlinear equations, and are essential for many areas of research and industry.

### Subsection 11.3c Nonlinear Solver Complexity

Nonlinear solvers, while powerful, are not without their complexities. The complexity of these solvers arises from several factors, including the nature of the nonlinear equations, the size and structure of the problem, and the numerical methods used to solve the equations.

#### 11.3c.1 Nonlinear Equations

Nonlinear equations are inherently more complex than linear equations. They can exhibit a wide range of behaviors, including multiple solutions, non-differentiable points, and chaotic behavior. These behaviors can make it difficult to find and analyze the solutions of the equations.

For example, consider the system of nonlinear equations `$F_1(\mathbf{u},\lambda) = 0$` and `$F_2(\mathbf{u},\lambda) = 0$`. The solutions of these equations are the points `$(\mathbf{u},\lambda)$` that satisfy both equations. However, these solutions can be complex and difficult to find, especially if the equations are non-linear and have multiple solutions.

#### 11.3c.2 Problem Size and Structure

The size and structure of the problem can also contribute to the complexity of nonlinear solvers. Larger problems, with more unknowns and equations, can be more difficult to solve due to the increased number of variables and constraints. Additionally, the structure of the problem, including the number of equations and unknowns, the presence of linear or non-linear terms, and the degree of non-linearity, can affect the complexity of the solution process.

For instance, consider the shape optimization problem, where the goal is to find the shape of a curve or surface that optimizes a certain criterion. The complexity of this problem depends on the number of unknowns (the degrees of freedom of the curve or surface), the number of equations (the constraints on the curve or surface), and the nature of these equations (linear or non-linear).

#### 11.3c.3 Numerical Methods

The numerical methods used to solve nonlinear equations can also add to the complexity of nonlinear solvers. These methods often involve iterative processes, where the solution is approximated by a sequence of values that converge to the true solution. The convergence of these processes can be affected by various factors, including the initial guess, the choice of method, and the properties of the equations.

For example, consider the numerical continuation method, which is used to find the solutions of a system of nonlinear equations. The complexity of this method depends on the initial solution, the step size, and the behavior of the solution component. If the solution component is smooth and well-behaved, the method can be relatively simple to implement and analyze. However, if the solution component is complex and exhibits chaotic behavior, the method can be much more difficult to use.

In conclusion, while nonlinear solvers are powerful tools for solving complex problems, they also involve a range of complexities that must be considered and managed. Understanding these complexities is crucial for effectively applying these solvers in computational geometry.

### Subsection 11.4a Intersection Types

In the previous sections, we have discussed the basics of intersections and their properties. In this section, we will delve deeper into the types of intersections that can occur in computational geometry. 

#### 11.4a.1 Simple Intersection

A simple intersection occurs when two curves or surfaces intersect at a single point. This is the simplest type of intersection and is often the first to be considered when studying intersections. The point of intersection is unique and can be easily determined by solving the equations of the curves or surfaces.

For example, consider two lines in a two-dimensional plane, represented by the equations `$y = m_1x + b_1$` and `$y = m_2x + b_2$`. If these lines intersect, the point of intersection `$(x, y)$` can be found by setting the equations equal to each other and solving for `$x$` and `$y$`.

#### 11.4a.2 Multiple Intersection

A multiple intersection occurs when two curves or surfaces intersect at more than one point. This can happen when the curves or surfaces are not distinct or when they have multiple points in common. 

For instance, consider two circles in a two-dimensional plane, represented by the equations `$(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2$` and `$(x - c)^2 + (y - d)^2 = s^2$`. If these circles intersect, the points of intersection `$(x, y)$` can be found by setting the equations equal to each other and solving for `$x$` and `$y$`. The solutions will be multiple if the circles intersect at more than one point.

#### 11.4a.3 Transverse Intersection

A transverse intersection occurs when two curves or surfaces intersect in such a way that they cross each other. This type of intersection is common in many geometric problems and is often the focus of study in computational geometry.

For example, consider two curves in a two-dimensional plane, represented by the equations `$y = f_1(x)$` and `$y = f_2(x)$`. If these curves intersect transversally, the points of intersection `$(x, y)$` can be found by solving the equations `$f_1(x) = f_2(x)$`. The solutions will be multiple if the curves intersect at more than one point.

#### 11.4a.4 Cuspidal Intersection

A cuspidal intersection occurs when two curves or surfaces intersect in such a way that they form a cusp. This type of intersection is less common but can still occur in certain geometric problems.

For instance, consider two curves in a two-dimensional plane, represented by the equations `$y = f_1(x)$` and `$y = f_2(x)$`. If these curves intersect at a cusp, the point of intersection `$(x, y)$` can be found by solving the equations `$f_1(x) = f_2(x)$`. The solution will be unique if the curves intersect at a cusp.

#### 11.4a.5 Tangential Intersection

A tangential intersection occurs when two curves or surfaces intersect at a point where they are tangent to each other. This type of intersection is less common but can still occur in certain geometric problems.

For example, consider two curves in a two-dimensional plane, represented by the equations `$y = f_1(x)$` and `$y = f_2(x)$`. If these curves intersect tangentially, the point of intersection `$(x, y)$` can be found by solving the equations `$f_1(x) = f_2(x)$`. The solution will be unique if the curves intersect tangentially.

In the next section, we will discuss how these types of intersections can be detected and analyzed in computational geometry problems.

### Subsection 11.4b Intersection Properties

In the previous section, we discussed the types of intersections that can occur in computational geometry. In this section, we will explore the properties of these intersections and how they can be used to solve geometric problems.

#### 11.4b.1 Uniqueness of Intersection

The uniqueness of intersection refers to the property that, given two curves or surfaces, the point of intersection (if it exists) is unique. This property holds for simple intersections, where the curves or surfaces intersect at a single point. It also holds for transverse intersections, where the curves or surfaces cross each other at a single point.

For example, consider two lines in a two-dimensional plane, represented by the equations `$y = m_1x + b_1$` and `$y = m_2x + b_2$`. If these lines intersect, the point of intersection `$(x, y)$` is unique and can be found by setting the equations equal to each other and solving for `$x$` and `$y$`.

#### 11.4b.2 Multiplicity of Intersection

The multiplicity of intersection refers to the number of points of intersection between two curves or surfaces. This property is important in multiple intersections, where the curves or surfaces intersect at more than one point.

For instance, consider two circles in a two-dimensional plane, represented by the equations `$(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2$` and `$(x - c)^2 + (y - d)^2 = s^2$`. If these circles intersect, the points of intersection `$(x, y)$` are multiple and can be found by setting the equations equal to each other and solving for `$x$` and `$y$`. The solutions will be multiple if the circles intersect at more than one point.

#### 11.4b.3 Transversality of Intersection

The transversality of intersection refers to the property that, given two curves or surfaces, the point of intersection (if it exists) is transversal, i.e., the curves or surfaces cross each other at the point of intersection. This property holds for transverse intersections.

For example, consider two curves in a two-dimensional plane, represented by the equations `$y = f_1(x)$` and `$y = f_2(x)$`. If these curves intersect transversally, the point of intersection `$(x, y)$` is transversal and can be found by solving the equations `$f_1(x) = f_2(x)$`. The solutions will be multiple if the curves intersect at more than one point.

#### 11.4b.4 Cuspidality of Intersection

The cuspidality of intersection refers to the property that, given two curves or surfaces, the point of intersection (if it exists) is cuspidal, i.e., the curves or surfaces form a cusp at the point of intersection. This property holds for cuspidal intersections.

For instance, consider two curves in a two-dimensional plane, represented by the equations `$y = f_1(x)$` and `$y = f_2(x)$`. If these curves intersect at a cusp, the point of intersection `$(x, y)$` is cuspidal and can be found by solving the equations `$f_1(x) = f_2(x)$`. The solution will be unique if the curves intersect at a cusp.

#### 11.4b.5 Tangentiality of Intersection

The tangentiality of intersection refers to the property that, given two curves or surfaces, the point of intersection (if it exists) is tangential, i.e., the curves or surfaces are tangent to each other at the point of intersection. This property holds for tangential intersections.

For example, consider two curves in a two-dimensional plane, represented by the equations `$y = f_1(x)$` and `$y = f_2(x)$`. If these curves intersect tangentially, the point of intersection `$(x, y)$` is tangential and can be found by solving the equations `$f_1(x) = f_2(x)$`. The solution will be unique if the curves intersect tangentially.

### Subsection 11.4c Intersection Applications

In this section, we will explore some applications of intersections in computational geometry. These applications demonstrate the practical relevance and usefulness of the concepts discussed in the previous sections.

#### 11.4c.1 Robotics

In robotics, intersections play a crucial role in path planning and collision avoidance. For instance, consider a robot moving in a two-dimensional plane. The robot's path can be represented as a curve, and obstacles in the environment as circles. The robot's path can be planned to avoid intersecting with any of the obstacles by solving the intersection problem.

For example, consider a robot moving in a two-dimensional plane with obstacles represented by the circles `$(x - a_i)^2 + (y - b_i)^2 = r_i^2$`, where `$a_i$`, `$b_i$`, and `$r_i$` are the center, y-intercept, and radius of the `$i$`-th obstacle, respectively. The robot's path can be planned to avoid intersecting with any of the obstacles by solving the system of equations `$(x - a_i)^2 + (y - b_i)^2 = r_i^2$` for `$x$` and `$y$`, and ensuring that the solutions do not intersect with any of the circles.

#### 11.4c.2 Computer Graphics

In computer graphics, intersections are used to determine the visibility of objects. For instance, consider a scene with multiple objects, represented as curves or surfaces. The visibility of an object can be determined by finding the intersections of its boundary with the boundaries of the other objects.

For example, consider two objects in a three-dimensional scene, represented by the surfaces `$z = f_1(x, y)$` and `$z = f_2(x, y)$`. The visibility of the first object can be determined by finding the intersections of its surface `$z = f_1(x, y)$` with the surface `$z = f_2(x, y)$`. The points of intersection `$(x, y, z)$` where `$f_1(x, y) = f_2(x, y)$` are the points where the two surfaces intersect.

#### 11.4c.3 Computer-Aided Design

In computer-aided design (CAD), intersections are used to check the validity of designs. For instance, consider a mechanical part designed in a two-dimensional plane. The part can be represented as a curve, and the design constraints as circles. The validity of the design can be checked by solving the intersection problem.

For example, consider a mechanical part designed in a two-dimensional plane with design constraints represented by the circles `$(x - a_i)^2 + (y - b_i)^2 = r_i^2$`, where `$a_i$`, `$b_i$`, and `$r_i$` are the center, y-intercept, and radius of the `$i$`-th constraint, respectively. The validity of the design can be checked by solving the system of equations `$(x - a_i)^2 + (y - b_i)^2 = r_i^2$` for `$x$` and `$y$`, and ensuring that the solutions do not intersect with any of the circles.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the fascinating world of intersections in computational geometry. We have explored the fundamental concepts, theorems, and algorithms that govern the intersection of lines, curves, and surfaces. We have also seen how these concepts are applied in various fields such as robotics, computer graphics, and computer-aided design.

The intersection of lines and curves is a fundamental concept in computational geometry. It is the basis for many algorithms and applications, including line integral convolution, line integral convolution with boundary conditions, and line integral convolution with boundary conditions and a kernel. These concepts are not only theoretical but also have practical applications in various fields.

## Chapter: Chapter 12: Convexity

### Introduction

In the realm of computational geometry, the concept of convexity plays a pivotal role. This chapter, "Convexity," is dedicated to exploring this fundamental concept in depth. We will delve into the intricacies of convexity, its properties, and its applications in various fields.

Convexity is a fundamental concept in mathematics, particularly in the field of computational geometry. It is a property of geometric objects that describes whether the object's shape is curved or angular. In simpler terms, a convex object is one in which all the internal angles are less than or equal to 180 degrees. This property is crucial in many computational geometry problems, as it allows us to simplify complex geometric objects into simpler convex shapes.

In this chapter, we will explore the concept of convexity in detail. We will start by defining what convexity is and how it is used in computational geometry. We will then delve into the properties of convexity, such as the convex combination and the convex hull. We will also discuss the algorithms used to determine the convexity of a shape, such as the Graham scan and the Jarvis march.

Furthermore, we will explore the applications of convexity in various fields, such as robotics, computer graphics, and machine learning. We will see how the concept of convexity is used to solve real-world problems in these fields.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of convexity and its importance in computational geometry. You will also be equipped with the knowledge to apply this concept in your own computational geometry problems.

So, let's embark on this journey to unravel the mysteries of convexity in computational geometry.




### Subsection 11.3b Nonlinear Solver Properties

Nonlinear solvers are essential tools in computational geometry, as they allow us to solve complex problems that involve nonlinear equations. In this section, we will discuss some of the key properties of nonlinear solvers.

#### 11.3b.1 Convergence Properties

The convergence of a nonlinear solver refers to the ability of the solver to find a solution to the system of equations. The convergence of a solver is determined by several factors, including the initial guess, the choice of solver, and the properties of the system of equations.

For instance, the Gauss-Seidel method, a popular iterative method for solving linear systems, can be extended to solve arbitrary nonlinear systems. The convergence of the Gauss-Seidel method for nonlinear systems is typically slower than for linear systems, and it may not always converge.

#### 11.3b.2 Sensitivity to Initial Guess

The sensitivity of a nonlinear solver to the initial guess refers to how small changes in the initial guess can affect the solution. For some solvers, small changes in the initial guess can lead to large changes in the solution, making the solver sensitive to the initial guess. This sensitivity can make it difficult to find a solution, especially for systems with multiple solutions.

#### 11.3b.3 Robustness

The robustness of a nonlinear solver refers to its ability to handle small perturbations in the system of equations. For some solvers, small changes in the system of equations can lead to large changes in the solution, making the solver sensitive to perturbations. This sensitivity can make it difficult to solve real-world problems, where the system of equations is often not known exactly.

#### 11.3b.4 Complexity

The complexity of a nonlinear solver refers to the computational resources required to solve the system of equations. Some solvers may require a large amount of memory or computational time, making them impractical for large-scale problems. The complexity of a solver can also affect its convergence and sensitivity to initial guess and perturbations.

#### 11.3b.5 Accuracy

The accuracy of a nonlinear solver refers to the ability of the solver to find an accurate solution. For some solvers, the solution may not be accurate, especially for systems with multiple solutions or for systems with high sensitivity to initial guess and perturbations. The accuracy of a solver can also affect its convergence and robustness.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the key algorithms used in nonlinear solvers, including the Gauss-Seidel method and the gradient discretisation method.

### Subsection 11.3c Nonlinear Solver Applications

Nonlinear solvers have a wide range of applications in computational geometry. They are used to solve complex problems that involve nonlinear equations, such as the intersection of curves and surfaces, the optimization of geometric objects, and the simulation of physical phenomena.

#### 11.3c.1 Intersection of Curves and Surfaces

The intersection of curves and surfaces is a fundamental problem in computational geometry. Nonlinear solvers are used to find the points of intersection between two or more curves or surfaces. This is particularly useful in computer graphics, where the intersection of curves and surfaces is used to create complex geometric objects.

For example, consider the intersection of two curves represented by the equations $f(x,y) = 0$ and $g(x,y) = 0$. A nonlinear solver can be used to find the points $(x,y)$ that satisfy both equations. This can be done by setting up a system of equations and using a solver to find the solution.

#### 11.3c.2 Optimization of Geometric Objects

Optimization is another important application of nonlinear solvers in computational geometry. The optimization of geometric objects involves finding the best possible shape or configuration of a geometric object, given certain constraints. This is often formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem, which can be solved using a nonlinear solver.

For instance, consider the optimization of a circle with a given area. The radius $r$ of the circle can be varied to optimize the area, subject to the constraint that the area should be equal to a given value $A$. This can be formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem:

$$
\max_{r} A = \pi r^2
$$

subject to the constraint $A = \pi r^2$. A nonlinear solver can be used to find the maximum value of $r$ that satisfies the constraint.

#### 11.3c.3 Simulation of Physical Phenomena

Nonlinear solvers are also used in the simulation of physical phenomena, such as fluid flow, heat conduction, and structural mechanics. These phenomena are often described by nonlinear partial differential equations, which can be solved using a nonlinear solver.

For example, consider the heat conduction equation, which describes how heat is transferred through a material. The equation is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $T$ is the temperature, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity. A nonlinear solver can be used to solve this equation for a given initial and boundary temperature distribution.

In conclusion, nonlinear solvers are powerful tools in computational geometry, with applications ranging from the intersection of curves and surfaces to the optimization of geometric objects and the simulation of physical phenomena. Their ability to handle complex nonlinear systems makes them indispensable in many areas of computational geometry.

Convexity, in the simplest terms, is a property of a set or a function. A set is convex if all the line segments connecting any two points within the set lie entirely within the set. Similarly, a function is convex if its domain is convex and the function itself is always above the line segment connecting any two points in its domain.

The concept of convexity is not just a theoretical construct, but it has profound implications in various fields. In computer graphics, convexity is used to simplify complex shapes and objects.

Nonlinear solvers have a wide range of applications in computational geometry. They are used to solve complex problems that involve nonlinear equations, such as the optimization of glass recycling processes and the simulation of fluid dynamics. In this section, we will discuss some of these applications in more detail.

#### 11.3c.1 Optimization of Glass Recycling Processes

The optimization of glass recycling processes is a challenging problem that involves nonlinear equations. The goal is to maximize the amount of glass recycled while minimizing the cost of the recycling process. This problem can be formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem, which can be solved using nonlinear solvers.

The optimization of glass recycling processes is a complex problem due to the presence of multiple constraints. For instance, the amount of glass recycled must be maximized, but the cost of the recycling process must also be minimized. Furthermore, the recycling process must satisfy certain environmental regulations, which can be represented as additional constraints.

Nonlinear solvers can be used to find the optimal solution to this problem. The solver starts with an initial guess for the solution, and then iteratively adjusts the solution until it satisfies all the constraints. The convergence of the solver is determined by the properties of the system of equations, as discussed in the previous section.

The simulation of fluid dynamics is another important application of nonlinear solvers in computational geometry. The equations governing fluid dynamics are nonlinear, and they involve complex interactions between different physical quantities.

The Local Linearization (LL) method is a popular approach for solving these equations. The LL method is based on the idea of approximating the nonlinear equations by a linear system in the neighborhood of a solution. This linear system can then be solved using linear solvers, which are typically more efficient than nonlinear solvers.

The LL method has been implemented in a number of freely available codes, including a version for GPUs. These implementations make use of the PETSc non-linear solver package and libmesh to provide the finite element discretization.

#### 11.3c.3 Hierarchical Equations of Motion

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the fascinating world of interval methods and robustness in computational geometry. These topics are crucial for understanding and solving complex geometric problems, and they have a wide range of applications in various fields such as computer graphics, robotics, and machine learning.

Interval methods are a powerful tool for solving geometric problems. They allow us to represent and manipulate geometric objects in a precise and efficient manner.

In other words, a robust algorithm is one that is not overly sensitive to small changes in the input data. This is crucial in real-world applications, where the input data is often noisy or incomplete.

Throughout this chapter, we will delve into the theory behind interval methods and robustness, and we will explore their applications in various fields.

### Section: 12.1 Interval Methods:

Interval methods are a powerful tool in computational geometry, allowing us to represent and manipulate geometric objects in a precise and efficient manner. In this section, we will explore the basics of interval methods, including their definition and properties.

#### 12.1a Interval Method Definition

An interval method is a mathematical technique used to solve geometric problems. It involves representing a geometric object as an interval, which is a set of real numbers. This allows us to perform operations such as intersection, union, and containment tests.

The interval method is particularly useful in computational geometry, where we often need to work with complex and irregular objects. By defining the boundaries of an object, we can perform operations such as intersection, union, and containment tests. This is crucial in real-world applications, where the input data is often noisy or incomplete.

The interval method is based on the concept of interval arithmetic, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with the manipulation of intervals. In interval arithmetic, an interval is represented as a set of real numbers, and operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined on these intervals.

The interval method is closely related to the concept of robustness. In fact, robustness can be seen as a measure of the sensitivity of an interval method to small perturbations in the input data. A robust interval method is one that is able to handle small changes in the input data without significantly affecting its output.

In the next section, we will explore the properties of interval methods and how they relate to robustness. We will also discuss some practical applications of interval methods in various fields.

#### 12.1b Interval Method Properties

Interval methods have several important properties that make them useful in solving geometric problems. These properties include:

1. **Monotonicity:** The interval method is monotonic, meaning that if two intervals are nested, then the intersection of these intervals will also be nested. This property is crucial in performing operations such as intersection and union.

2. **Robustness:** As mentioned earlier, robustness is a measure of the sensitivity of an interval method to small perturbations in the input data. A robust interval method is able to handle small changes in the input data without significantly affecting its output. This property is important in real-world applications, where the input data is often noisy or incomplete.

3. **Efficiency:** Interval methods are efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. This makes them suitable for solving large-scale geometric problems.

4. **Stability:** The interval method is stable, meaning that small changes in the input data will not result in large changes in the output. This property is important in ensuring the accuracy of the results.

5. **Flexibility:** Interval methods are flexible and can be applied to a wide range of geometric problems. They are not limited to specific types of objects or operations.

In the next section, we will explore some practical applications of interval methods in various fields. We will also discuss how these properties make interval methods a powerful tool in solving geometric problems.

#### 12.1c Interval Method Applications

Interval methods have a wide range of applications in various fields, including computer graphics, robotics, and machine learning. In this section, we will explore some of these applications and how interval methods are used to solve real-world problems.

1. **Computer Graphics:** In computer graphics, interval methods are used to perform operations such as clipping, intersection, and union on geometric objects. These operations are essential in creating realistic and visually appealing images. The monotonicity property of interval methods makes them well-suited for these operations, as it ensures that the results will be accurate and efficient.

2. **Robotics:** In robotics, interval methods are used to plan and execute trajectories for robots. These trajectories are often represented as intervals, and interval methods are used to perform operations such as intersection and union to determine the feasibility of a trajectory. The robustness property of interval methods is particularly useful in this application, as it allows the robot to handle small perturbations in its environment without significantly affecting its trajectory.

3. **Machine Learning:** In machine learning, interval methods are used to perform operations such as classification and regression on data sets. These operations often involve finding the intersection of multiple intervals, and the monotonicity property of interval methods makes them well-suited for these operations. Additionally, the efficiency and stability properties of interval methods make them a popular choice in machine learning applications.

4. **Geometric Modeling:** In geometric modeling, interval methods are used to represent and manipulate complex geometric objects. These objects are often represented as intervals, and interval methods are used to perform operations such as intersection and union to create more complex objects. The flexibility and stability properties of interval methods make them a powerful tool in geometric modeling.

In conclusion, interval methods are a powerful tool in computational geometry, with a wide range of applications in various fields. Their properties of monotonicity, robustness, efficiency, stability, and flexibility make them well-suited for solving a variety of geometric problems.

### Section: 12.1 Interval Methods:

Interval methods are a powerful tool in computational geometry, allowing us to represent and manipulate geometric objects in a precise and efficient manner. In this section, we will explore the basics of interval methods, including their definition and properties.

#### 12.1a Interval Method Definition

An interval method is a mathematical technique used to solve geometric problems. It involves representing a geometric object as an interval, which is a set of real numbers. This allows us to perform operations such as intersection, union, and containment tests.

The interval method is particularly useful in computational geometry, where we often need to work with complex and irregular objects. By defining the boundaries of an object, we can perform operations such as intersection, union, and containment tests. This is crucial in real-world applications, where the input data is often noisy or incomplete.

The interval method is based on the concept of interval arithmetic, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with the manipulation of intervals. In interval arithmetic, an interval is represented as a set of real numbers, and operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined on these intervals.

The interval method is closely related to the concept of robustness. In fact, robustness can be seen as a measure of the sensitivity of an interval method to small perturbations in the input data. A robust interval method is one that is able to handle small changes in the input data without significantly affecting its output.

In the next section, we will explore the properties of interval methods and how they relate to robustness. We will also discuss some practical applications of interval methods in various fields.

#### 12.1b Interval Method Properties

Interval methods have several important properties that make them useful in solving geometric problems. These properties include:

1. **Monotonicity**: The interval method is a monotone function, meaning that the output of the method is always an interval that contains the input. This property is crucial in ensuring that the method is always able to find a solution, even if the input data is noisy or incomplete.
2. **Robustness**: As mentioned earlier, robustness is a measure of the sensitivity of an interval method to small perturbations in the input data. A robust interval method is one that is able to handle small changes in the input data without significantly affecting its output. This property is important in real-world applications, where the input data is often noisy or incomplete.
3. **Efficiency**: Interval methods are generally efficient, meaning that they are able to solve geometric problems in a reasonable amount of time. This is important in practical applications, where time is a crucial factor.
4. **Accuracy**: Interval methods are able to provide accurate solutions to geometric problems. This is important in applications where precision is crucial, such as in engineering and architecture.
5. **Flexibility**: Interval methods are able to handle a wide range of geometric problems, making them a versatile tool in computational geometry. This allows them to be applied in various fields, such as computer graphics, robotics, and machine learning.

In the next section, we will explore some practical applications of interval methods in these fields.

#### 12.1c Interval Method Applications

Interval methods have a wide range of applications in various fields, including computer graphics, robotics, and machine learning. In this section, we will explore some of these applications in more detail.

##### Computer Graphics

In computer graphics, interval methods are used to perform geometric operations, such as intersection and union, on complex and irregular objects. This allows for the creation of realistic and detailed scenes, which are essential in applications such as video games and animated films.

One example of an interval method used in computer graphics is the line integration convolution (LIC) method. This method is used to visualize vector fields, which are commonly used in computer graphics to represent the movement of objects. By using interval methods, the LIC method is able to accurately visualize these vector fields, allowing for more realistic and dynamic scenes.

##### Robotics

In robotics, interval methods are used to perform path planning and obstacle avoidance. These tasks often involve solving geometric problems, such as finding the shortest path between two points or avoiding obstacles. By using interval methods, these tasks can be solved efficiently and accurately, allowing for more precise and efficient robot movements.

One example of an interval method used in robotics is the Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm. This algorithm uses interval methods to generate random samples in the configuration space of a robot, allowing for the exploration of the robot's workspace. By using interval methods, the RRT algorithm is able to efficiently generate samples and find the shortest path between two points.

##### Machine Learning

In machine learning, interval methods are used to perform classification and regression tasks. These tasks often involve solving geometric problems, such as finding the nearest neighbor or fitting a curve to a set of data points. By using interval methods, these tasks can be solved efficiently and accurately, allowing for more precise predictions.

One example of an interval method used in machine learning is the Support Vector Machine (SVM). This algorithm uses interval methods to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between two classes of data points. By using interval methods, the SVM algorithm is able to efficiently classify data points and make accurate predictions.

In conclusion, interval methods have a wide range of applications in various fields, making them a valuable tool in computational geometry. By understanding the properties and applications of interval methods, we can better utilize them to solve complex and practical problems.

For example, consider a simple polygon with vertices at $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$. The robustness of this polygon can be analyzed by considering the interval of values that each vertex can take on while still maintaining the polygon's convexity. This can be represented as the interval $I_i = [x_{i,\min}, x_{i,\max}] \times [y_{i,\min}, y_{i,\max}]$ for each vertex $i$.

### Section: 12.2 Robustness:

Robustness is a crucial concept in computational geometry, as it allows us to understand the sensitivity of our algorithms and data structures to changes in the input. In this section, we will explore the definition of robustness and its importance in the field.

#### 12.2a Robustness Definition

Robustness can be defined as the ability of a system to perform well in the presence of variations or uncertainties in the input. In computational geometry, this can be applied to both algorithms and data structures. A robust algorithm is one that can handle small changes in the input without significantly altering its output. Similarly, a robust data structure is one that can handle changes in the data without losing its functionality.

To formally define robustness, we can use the concept of interval methods. An interval method is a technique for representing and manipulating intervals of values. In computational geometry, we can use interval methods to represent the uncertainty in the input. For example, if we have a set of points in the plane, we can represent the uncertainty in their coordinates by using interval methods.

Using interval methods, we can define the robustness of a system as the intersection of the intervals representing the uncertainty in the input. If this intersection is non-empty, then the system is considered robust. This means that the system can handle small changes in the input without significantly altering its output.

#### 12.2b Robustness in Computational Geometry

In computational geometry, robustness is particularly important as we often deal with complex and uncertain data. For example, in geometric optimization problems, the input data may be noisy or incomplete. In such cases, it is crucial for our algorithms to be robust and able to handle these uncertainties.

One way to achieve robustness in computational geometry is through the use of interval methods. By representing the uncertainty in the input using intervals, we can ensure that our algorithms are able to handle small changes in the input without significantly altering their output.

#### 12.2c Robustness Analysis

To analyze the robustness of a system, we can use interval methods to determine the intersection of the intervals representing the uncertainty in the input. If this intersection is non-empty, then the system is considered robust. However, if the intersection is empty, then the system is not robust and may need to be modified to handle the uncertainties in the input.

In addition to using interval methods, we can also use other techniques such as sensitivity analysis and stress testing to analyze the robustness of a system. Sensitivity analysis involves studying the effect of small changes in the input on the output of the system. Stress testing, on the other hand, involves subjecting the system to extreme or unexpected inputs to determine its behavior.

#### 12.2d Robustness in Real-World Applications

The concept of robustness is not limited to theoretical discussions and analysis. It has practical applications in various fields such as computer vision, robotics, and machine learning. In computer vision, robustness is crucial for tasks such as object detection and recognition, where the input data may be noisy or incomplete. In robotics, robustness is necessary for tasks such as navigation and manipulation, where the environment may be uncertain.

In machine learning, robustness is essential for training models that can handle noisy or incomplete data. This is particularly important in real-world applications where the data may not be perfect. By using robustness analysis techniques, we can ensure that our machine learning models are able to handle uncertainties and perform well in real-world scenarios.

#### 12.2e Conclusion

In conclusion, robustness is a crucial concept in computational geometry that allows us to understand the sensitivity of our algorithms and data structures to changes in the input. By using interval methods and other techniques, we can analyze the robustness of a system and make modifications to ensure its ability to handle uncertainties in the input. With the increasing complexity and uncertainty in real-world data, the importance of robustness in computational geometry will only continue to grow.

An offset curve is a mathematical object that represents the boundary of a shape or object in a geometric space. It is defined as the set of points that are a fixed distance from the original curve or surface. This distance is typically referred to as the offset distance or the offset value.

The offset curve can be thought of as a parallel curve to the original curve, but at a different distance. The offset distance can be positive or negative, depending on whether the offset curve is inside or outside the original curve.

The concept of offset curves is closely related to the concept of signed distance functions. A signed distance function assigns a signed distance value to each point in the space, where the distance is positive if the point is outside the curve, negative if the point is inside the curve, and zero if the point is on the curve. The offset curve can be defined as the set of points where the signed distance function is equal to the offset value.

The offset curve can also be defined as the envelope of the family of parallel curves at different offset distances. The envelope of a family of curves is the curve that is tangent to all the curves in the family at some point. In the case of offset curves, the envelope is the offset curve itself.

The offset curve has many applications in computational geometry. It is used in shape representation and manipulation, geometric modeling and rendering, and in the creation of complex 3D models. It is also used in the simulation of physical phenomena, such as fluid flow and heat transfer.

#### 13.2a Offset Surface Definition

An offset surface is a geometric object that is defined as the set of points that are a constant distance from a given surface. This concept is analogous to the concept of an offset curve, which is the set of points that are a constant distance from a given curve. The offset surface is a fundamental concept in computational geometry, with applications in various fields such as computer graphics, computer-aided design, and robotics.

The offset surface can be defined in any dimension, but for the sake of simplicity, we will focus on surfaces in three-dimensional space. Let's consider a regular parametric representation of an n-dimensional surface, denoted as $\vec x(\vec u)$, where the dimension of $\vec u$ is n-1. Also, let's assume we have a second n-dimensional surface that can be parameterized by its unit normal, denoted as $\vec d(\vec n)$, where the normal of $\vec d(\vec n) = \vec n$. The parametric representation of the general offset surface of $\vec x(\vec u)$ offset by $\vec d(\vec n)$ is given by:

$$
\vec x_d(\vec u) = \vec x(\vec u) + \vec d(\vec n(\vec u))
$$

Notice that the normal of $\vec x_d(\vec u) =$ the normal of $\vec d(\vec n(\vec u)) = \vec n(\vec u)$, by definition. This aligns with the nature of envelopes, as the offset surface shares the same tangent plane and normal with $\vec x(\vec u)$ and $\vec d(\vec n(\vec u))$.

The Weingarten equations for the shape operator can be written as $\partial\vec n = -\partial\vec xS$, where $S$ is the shape operator. If $S$ is invertable, we can write $\partial\vec x = -\partial\vec nS^{-1}$. The principal curvatures of a surface are the eigenvalues of the shape operator, the principal curvature directions are its eigenvectors, the Gauss curvature is its determinant, and the mean curvature is half its trace. The inverse of the shape operator can be used to calculate these properties of the offset surface.

In the next section, we will explore some applications of offset surfaces in computational geometry.

#### 13.2b Offset Surface Properties

The properties of offset surfaces are crucial in understanding their behavior and applications in computational geometry. These properties are derived from the geometric properties of the offset curves and the properties of the surface from which the offset is taken.

##### Regularity

The regularity of an offset surface is determined by the regularity of the offset curve. If the offset curve is regular, then the offset surface is also regular. This means that the offset surface is smooth and does not have any sharp corners or cusps. This property is important in applications such as computer graphics, where smooth surfaces are desired.

##### Convexity

The convexity of an offset surface is determined by the convexity of the offset curve. If the offset curve is convex, then the offset surface is also convex. This means that all the points on the offset surface lie on one side of the plane perpendicular to the normal of the surface. This property is important in applications such as robotics, where convex surfaces are often used to define the workspace of a robot.

##### Envelope

The envelope of an offset surface is the set of points on the surface that are at the maximum distance from the surface from which the offset is taken. This property is important in applications such as computer-aided design, where the envelope of an offset surface can be used to define the boundary of a solid object.

##### Weingarten Equations

The Weingarten equations for the shape operator can be written as $\partial\vec n = -\partial\vec xS$, where $S$ is the shape operator. If $S$ is invertable, we can write $\partial\vec x = -\partial\vec nS^{-1}$. The principal curvatures of a surface are the eigenvalues of the shape operator, the principal curvature directions are its eigenvectors, the Gauss curvature is its determinant, and the mean curvature is half its trace. The inverse of the shape operator can be used to calculate these properties of the offset surface. This property is important in applications such as computer graphics, where the curvature of a surface can be used to determine how light is reflected from the surface.

In the next section, we will explore some applications of offset surfaces in computational geometry.

The Weingarten equations for the shape operator, which can be used to calculate the curvature of a surface, are also used in CAD. This allows designers to manipulate the curvature of a surface to achieve the desired shape.

##### Robotics

In robotics, offset surfaces are used to define the workspace of a robot. The convexity property of offset surfaces makes them ideal for defining the workspace of a robot, as all the points on the offset surface lie on one side of the plane perpendicular to the normal of the surface. This allows robots to move smoothly and without obstruction within their workspace.

The Weingarten equations for the shape operator are also used in robotics. They can be used to calculate the curvature of a surface, which is useful in applications such as path planning for robots.

The defining characteristic of an offset surface is its distance from the original surface. This distance is constant across the entire offset surface and is determined by the offset value.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the concepts of Boundary Representation (B-rep) and Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG). These are two fundamental concepts in the field of computational geometry, with wide-ranging applications in various industries such as computer graphics, computer-aided design (CAD), and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM).

B-rep is a mathematical representation of a solid object in three-dimensional space. It is defined by its boundary, which is the set of all points on the surface of the object. The boundary is represented as a collection of faces, edges, and vertices, forming a closed polygonal mesh. This representation is particularly useful in computer graphics and CAD, where it allows for the precise description of complex shapes.

On the other hand, CSG is a method for constructing solid objects by combining simpler solid objects. It is based on the principle of set-theoretic operations, where a solid object is constructed by taking the union, intersection, or difference of two or more simpler solid objects. CSG is widely used in CAD and CAM, where it allows for the creation of complex shapes from simpler components.

### Section: 14.1 B-rep:

Boundary Representation (B-rep) is a mathematical representation of a solid object in three-dimensional space. It is defined by its boundary, which is the set of all points on the surface of the object. The boundary is represented as a collection of faces, edges, and vertices, forming a closed polygonal mesh. This representation is particularly useful in computer graphics and computer-aided design (CAD), where it allows for the precise description of complex shapes.

#### 14.1a B-rep Definition

A B-rep is a tuple $(V, E, F)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices, $E$ is the set of edges, and $F$ is the set of faces. Each vertex $v \in V$ is a point in three-dimensional space, and each edge $e \in E$ is a line segment connecting two vertices. Each face $f \in F$ is a polygon, bounded by a closed loop of edges. The boundary of a B-rep is the set of all points on the surface of the object, which is the union of all the faces in the representation.

The B-rep representation is a powerful tool for representing complex shapes in three-dimensional space. It allows for the precise description of the surface of an object, including its curvature and topology. This makes it particularly useful in applications such as computer graphics, where it is used to render realistic images of objects.

In the next section, we will explore the properties of B-reps and how they can be used to perform various operations on solid objects.

#### 14.1b B-rep Properties

B-reps have several important properties that make them a powerful tool for representing and manipulating solid objects. These properties include:

1. **Completeness**: A B-rep is said to be complete if it contains all the information necessary to fully describe the object. This includes the location and orientation of each vertex, the length and direction of each edge, and the type and orientation of each face.

2. **Consistency**: A B-rep is consistent if it does not contain any contradictory information. This means that the representation should not contain any overlapping or intersecting faces, edges, or vertices.

3. **Simplicity**: A B-rep is simple if it does not contain any redundant information. This means that each vertex, edge, and face should only be represented once in the representation.

4. **Connectivity**: A B-rep is connected if it forms a single, continuous surface. This means that there should not be any gaps or holes in the representation.

5. **Orientability**: A B-rep is orientable if it can be assigned a consistent orientation. This means that the normal vector of each face should point in the same direction.

These properties are important for ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of B-rep representations. In the next section, we will explore how these properties can be used to perform various operations on solid objects.

#### 14.1c B-rep Applications

#### 14.2a CSG Definition

Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) is a method for representing and manipulating solid objects in three-dimensional space. It is based on the principle of set-theoretic operations, where a solid object is constructed by taking the union, intersection, or difference of two or more simpler solid objects. This approach allows for the creation of complex shapes from simpler components, making it a powerful tool in various fields such as computer graphics, computer-aided design (CAD), and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM).

A CSG representation is a tuple $(S, R)$, where $S$ is the set of solid objects and $R$ is the set of set-theoretic operations. Each solid object $s \in S$ is a three-dimensional shape, and each operation $r \in R$ is a set-theoretic operation such as union, intersection, or difference. The resulting solid object is then the set-theoretic combination of the solid objects in $S$ according to the operations in $R$.

The CSG representation is particularly useful for representing and manipulating solid objects with complex shapes. It allows for the creation of objects with holes, overhangs, and other intricate features that may be difficult to represent using other methods. Additionally, the use of set-theoretic operations allows for the creation of non-manifold objects, where different parts of the object may have different orientations or normals.

In the next section, we will explore the properties of CSG representations and how they can be used to perform various operations on solid objects.

#### 14.2b CSG Properties

CSG representations have several important properties that make them a powerful tool for representing and manipulating solid objects. These properties include:

1. **Completeness**: A CSG representation is said to be complete if it contains all the information necessary to fully describe the object. This includes the location and orientation of each solid object, as well as the set-theoretic operations used to combine them.

2. **Consistency**: A CSG representation is consistent if it does not contain any contradictory information. This means that the set-theoretic operations used to combine the solid objects should not result in any overlapping or intersecting parts.

3. **Simplicity**: A CSG representation is simple if it does not contain any redundant information. This means that each solid object should only be represented once, and each set-theoretic operation should only be used once.

4. **Connectivity**: A CSG representation is connected if it forms a single, continuous solid object. This means that there should not be any gaps or holes in the representation.

5. **Orientability**: A CSG representation is orientable if it can be assigned a consistent orientation. This means that the normal vector of each solid object should point in the same direction.

These properties are important for ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of CSG representations. In the next section, we will explore how these properties can be used to perform various operations on solid objects.

## Chapter: Chapter 15: Convexity

### Introduction

In the realm of computational geometry, the concept of convexity plays a pivotal role. This chapter, Chapter 15: Convexity, is dedicated to exploring this fundamental concept in depth. Convexity, in its simplest form, refers to the property of a shape or an object where all the internal angles are less than or equal to 180 degrees. This property is crucial in various applications, including but not limited to, computer graphics, machine learning, and optimization problems.

The chapter will delve into the mathematical underpinnings of convexity, starting with the basic definition. We will explore the different types of convexity, such as strict convexity and convexity in the large. The chapter will also cover the concept of convex hulls, which is a fundamental concept in computational geometry. 

We will also discuss the implications of convexity in various applications. For instance, in optimization problems, convexity is a desirable property as it ensures that the solution found is the global optimum. Similarly, in machine learning, convexity plays a crucial role in the training of certain types of models.

Throughout the chapter, we will use the powerful language of mathematics to express these concepts. For instance, we might define a convex set as a set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ such that for all $x, y \in S$ and all $t \in [0, 1]$, we have that $tx + (1-t)y \in S$. This mathematical expression captures the essence of convexity.

#### 14.2a CSG Definition

Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) is a powerful geometric modeling technique that allows for the creation of complex 3D objects by combining simpler geometric primitives. It is based on the concept of constructive solid modeling, where objects are built up by adding material to an initial empty space. CSG is widely used in computer graphics, computer-aided design, and solid modeling applications.

In CSG, objects are represented as a set of Boolean operations on a set of primitive objects. These primitive objects can be points, lines, planes, spheres, and other geometric shapes. The Boolean operations include union, intersection, and difference, and they are used to combine the primitive objects to create more complex shapes.

The CSG representation of an object can be thought of as a tree, with the root node representing the entire object and the leaf nodes representing the primitive objects. Each internal node in the tree represents a Boolean operation on its child nodes. This tree structure allows for efficient storage and manipulation of complex objects.

CSG has many applications in computer graphics and solid modeling. In computer graphics, CSG is used to create realistic and detailed renderings of 3D objects. The precise description of the object's surface provided by CSG allows for accurate lighting calculations and shading. In solid modeling, CSG is used to represent and manipulate solid objects. The ability to precisely describe the surface of an object makes it easier to create and modify designs.

CSG also has applications in other fields, such as robotics and medical imaging. In robotics, CSG is used to represent and manipulate the geometry of objects in the environment. In medical imaging, CSG is used to reconstruct 3D objects from 2D images.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of CSG operations and their properties. We will also discuss how these operations can be used to create complex objects and how they can be manipulated to achieve desired results.


#### 14.2b CSG Operations

CSG operations are the fundamental building blocks of Constructive Solid Geometry. They allow for the creation of complex 3D objects by combining simpler geometric primitives. In this section, we will explore the different types of CSG operations and their properties.

##### Union Operation

The union operation is the most basic CSG operation. It combines two objects by adding the material of the second object to the first object. Mathematically, the union operation can be represented as the Minkowski sum of two objects. This operation is useful for creating objects with multiple components, such as a car with separate wheels and a body.

##### Intersection Operation

The intersection operation combines two objects by keeping only the material that is common to both objects. This operation is useful for creating objects with holes or cutouts, such as a donut or a hole in a wall. Mathematically, the intersection operation can be represented as the Minkowski difference of two objects.

##### Difference Operation

The difference operation is the inverse of the intersection operation. It combines two objects by removing the material of the second object from the first object. This operation is useful for creating objects with holes or cutouts, such as a donut or a hole in a wall. Mathematically, the difference operation can be represented as the Minkowski difference of two objects.

##### Boolean Operations

In addition to the three basic operations, there are also more complex Boolean operations that can be performed on CSG objects. These include the exclusive OR operation, which combines two objects by keeping only the material that is common to one object but not the other. The inclusive OR operation combines two objects by keeping only the material that is common to both objects or is unique to one object. The exclusive OR operation can be represented as the Minkowski difference of two objects, while the inclusive OR operation can be represented as the Minkowski sum of two objects.

##### Other Operations

There are also other operations that can be performed on CSG objects, such as the symmetric difference operation, which combines two objects by keeping only the material that is unique to one object or the other. The symmetric difference operation can be represented as the Minkowski difference of two objects.

##### Properties of CSG Operations

CSG operations have several important properties that make them useful for creating complex objects. These include associativity, commutativity, and idempotence. Associativity means that the order in which operations are performed does not matter, such as in the union operation. Commutativity means that the order in which objects are combined does not matter, such as in the intersection operation. Idempotence means that performing the same operation on an object multiple times does not change the result, such as in the difference operation.

##### Applications of CSG Operations

CSG operations have a wide range of applications in computer graphics and solid modeling. In computer graphics, they are used to create realistic and detailed renderings of 3D objects. The precise description of the object's surface provided by CSG allows for accurate lighting calculations and shading. In solid modeling, CSG is used to represent and manipulate solid objects.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the concepts of Boundary Representation (B-rep) and Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG). These two methods are fundamental to the representation and manipulation of solid objects in computational geometry. B-rep is a powerful tool for representing complex objects as a collection of faces, edges, and vertices. It allows for efficient storage and manipulation of objects, making it a popular choice in many applications. On the other hand, CSG is a method for constructing solid objects by combining simpler shapes. It is particularly useful for creating complex objects from simpler components.

We have also discussed the advantages and disadvantages of both methods. B-rep is a versatile and efficient representation, but it can be challenging to work with for complex objects. CSG, on the other hand, is a powerful tool for creating complex objects, but it can be computationally intensive and may not always produce the desired result.

Overall, the choice between B-rep and CSG depends on the specific application and the complexity of the objects being represented. Both methods have their strengths and weaknesses, and understanding them is crucial for any computational geometry application.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the world of B-rep and Non-Manifold Mixed Dimension (NMMD) models, two fundamental concepts in the field of computational geometry. These models are essential tools for representing and manipulating complex geometric objects, and are widely used in various applications such as computer graphics, computer-aided design, and robotics.

B-rep (Boundary Representation) models are a type of geometric model that represents a solid object by its boundary surface. This model is particularly useful for representing objects with complex internal structures, as it allows for the representation of both the surface and the interior of the object. B-rep models are widely used in computer graphics and computer-aided design, where they are used to create realistic and detailed representations of objects.

On the other hand, Non-Manifold Mixed Dimension (NMMD) models are a type of geometric model that allows for the representation of objects with non-manifold topology. This means that the object may have holes, self-intersections, or other complex topological features that cannot be represented by a traditional manifold model. NMMD models are particularly useful for representing objects with complex topological features, and are widely used in applications such as robotics and computer-aided manufacturing.

In this chapter, we will explore the theory behind these models, including their mathematical representations and algorithms for manipulating them. We will also discuss their applications in various fields, and how they are used to solve real-world problems. By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of B-rep and NMMD models, and be able to apply them in your own work.




### Subsection: 15.1a B-rep Definition

B-rep (Boundary Representation) models are a type of geometric model that represents a solid object by its boundary surface. This model is particularly useful for representing objects with complex internal structures, as it allows for the representation of both the surface and the interior of the object. B-rep models are widely used in computer graphics and computer-aided design, where they are used to create realistic and detailed representations of objects.

#### 15.1a.1 B-rep Representation

A B-rep model is defined by its boundary, which is a set of faces, edges, and vertices. The faces of the model are polygons that define the surface of the object. The edges of the model are lines that connect the vertices of the faces. The vertices of the model are points in three-dimensional space that define the corners of the faces and the ends of the edges.

The boundary of the model is represented by a set of primitives, which are basic geometric objects such as points, lines, and polygons. These primitives are connected together to form the boundary of the model. The connectivity of the primitives is represented by a set of adjacency relationships, which define how the primitives are connected to each other.

#### 15.1a.2 B-rep Manipulation

B-rep models can be manipulated using various operations, such as translation, rotation, and scaling. These operations can be applied to the model as a whole, or to specific parts of the model. For example, a translation operation can be applied to move the entire model in three-dimensional space, while a rotation operation can be applied to rotate a specific face of the model around a specific axis.

B-rep models can also be combined with other B-rep models to create more complex objects. This is done by merging the boundaries of the two models, resulting in a single model with a combined boundary. This operation is particularly useful for creating objects with multiple parts, such as a car with multiple components.

#### 15.1a.3 B-rep Applications

B-rep models have a wide range of applications in various fields. In computer graphics, they are used to create realistic and detailed representations of objects, such as characters, vehicles, and environments. In computer-aided design, they are used to create and manipulate complex mechanical and architectural objects. In robotics, they are used to create realistic simulations of objects for robots to interact with.

In conclusion, B-rep models are a fundamental concept in computational geometry, providing a powerful and versatile tool for representing and manipulating complex geometric objects. In the next section, we will explore the theory behind B-rep models, including their mathematical representations and algorithms for manipulating them.





### Subsection: 15.1b B-rep Properties

B-rep models have several important properties that make them useful for representing and manipulating objects in three-dimensional space. These properties include:

#### 15.1b.1 Boundary Representation

As mentioned earlier, B-rep models are defined by their boundary. This means that the entire model can be reconstructed from its boundary, making it a powerful tool for representing complex objects. The boundary of the model is represented by a set of primitives, which are connected together to form the boundary of the model. This connectivity is represented by a set of adjacency relationships, which define how the primitives are connected to each other.

#### 15.1b.2 Manipulability

B-rep models can be easily manipulated using various operations, such as translation, rotation, and scaling. These operations can be applied to the model as a whole, or to specific parts of the model. This makes B-rep models a versatile tool for creating and modifying objects in three-dimensional space.

#### 15.1b.3 Non-Manifold Topology

B-rep models can represent objects with non-manifold topology, meaning that the object may have holes or voids within its interior. This is particularly useful for representing objects with complex internal structures, such as a car engine or a human body. Non-manifold topology is represented by a set of non-manifold vertices, edges, and faces, which are used to define the holes or voids within the object.

#### 15.1b.4 Mixed Dimension

B-rep models can also represent objects with mixed dimension, meaning that the object may have both two-dimensional and three-dimensional parts. This is useful for representing objects with varying levels of complexity, such as a building with a flat roof and a curved wall. Mixed dimension is represented by a set of mixed dimension vertices, edges, and faces, which are used to define the two-dimensional and three-dimensional parts of the object.

#### 15.1b.5 Data Compression

B-rep models can be compressed to reduce their size and storage requirements. This is achieved by representing the model as a set of primitives and adjacency relationships, rather than storing the entire model as a set of points, lines, and polygons. This data compression allows for more efficient storage and transmission of B-rep models, making them a popular choice for applications that deal with large amounts of geometric data.

In conclusion, B-rep models have several important properties that make them a powerful tool for representing and manipulating objects in three-dimensional space. These properties include boundary representation, manipulability, non-manifold topology, mixed dimension, and data compression. These properties make B-rep models a versatile and efficient choice for a wide range of applications, from computer graphics to computer-aided design.

B-rep models are widely used in computer graphics for creating and rendering realistic 3D objects. The boundary representation of B-rep models allows for efficient storage and manipulation of complex objects, making it a popular choice for creating detailed and realistic 3D scenes. Additionally, the non-manifold topology and mixed dimension properties of B-rep models make them suitable for representing objects with complex internal structures, such as characters and creatures in animated films.

#### 15.1c.2 Computer-Aided Design (CAD)

B-rep models are also commonly used in CAD software for creating and modifying 3D designs. The manipulability of B-rep models makes it easy to make changes to the design, such as adding or removing features, without having to start from scratch. Additionally, the data compression properties of B-rep models allow for efficient storage and transfer of large CAD files, making it a popular choice for collaborative design projects.

#### 15.1c.3 Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM)

In the field of CAM, B-rep models are used for generating toolpaths for CAD designs. The boundary representation of B-rep models allows for efficient generation of toolpaths, while the non-manifold topology and mixed dimension properties make it suitable for representing complex objects with varying levels of detail. This allows for more accurate and efficient manufacturing processes.

#### 15.1c.4 Other Applications

B-rep models also have applications in other fields, such as architecture, urban planning, and medical imaging. In architecture, B-rep models are used for creating and visualizing building designs. In urban planning, they are used for creating and analyzing 3D city models. In medical imaging, B-rep models are used for reconstructing 3D images from 2D data.

In conclusion, B-rep models have a wide range of applications and are an essential tool in many fields.

Non-manifold mixed dimension models, also known as NMM models, are a type of geometric model that extends the concept of B-rep models. They are used to represent objects with complex internal structures that cannot be accurately represented by a single manifold. In this section, we will define NMM models and discuss their properties and applications.

#### 15.2a.1 Definition of Non-Manifold Models

A non-manifold model is a geometric model that represents an object as a collection of disjoint manifolds, each with its own boundary. This allows for the representation of objects with complex internal structures, such as holes, tunnels, and intersecting surfaces. The manifolds in an NMM model can have different dimensions, hence the term "mixed dimension".

#### 15.2a.2 Properties of Non-Manifold Models

One of the key properties of NMM models is their ability to represent objects with complex internal structures. This makes them suitable for a wide range of applications, including CAD, CAM, and computer graphics. Additionally, NMM models have the same data compression properties as B-rep models, making them efficient for storing and manipulating large 3D objects.

#### 15.2a.3 Applications of Non-Manifold Models

NMM models have a wide range of applications in various fields. In CAD, they are used for creating and modifying complex designs. In CAM, they are used for generating toolpaths for CAD designs. In computer graphics, NMM models are used for creating realistic 3D objects with complex internal structures. They are also used in medical imaging for representing 3D models of human anatomy.

#### 15.2a.4 Non-Manifold Model Examples

Some common examples of objects that can be represented using NMM models include a car engine, a human skull, and a DNA molecule. These objects have complex internal structures that cannot be accurately represented by a single manifold, making NMM models the ideal choice for their representation.

#### 15.2a.5 Non-Manifold Model Implementations

There are several software libraries available for implementing NMM models, including Solid Modeling Solutions (SMS) and the NURBS-based geometry modeling kernel (NLib). These libraries provide a range of functionality for creating, manipulating, and rendering NMM models.

#### 15.2a.6 Non-Manifold Model Challenges

Despite their many advantages, NMM models also present some challenges. One of the main challenges is the complexity of their representation, which can make them difficult to manipulate and visualize. Additionally, the use of NMM models requires a deep understanding of geometric and topological concepts, making them less accessible to non-experts.

#### 15.2a.7 Non-Manifold Model Future Directions

As technology continues to advance, the use of NMM models is expected to increase in various fields. With the development of more advanced algorithms and software tools, the challenges associated with NMM models are expected to decrease. Additionally, the integration of NMM models with other geometric and topological models, such as B-rep models, is expected to provide even more powerful and versatile representations of 3D objects.

### Subsection: 15.2b Non-Manifold Model Properties

Non-manifold mixed dimension models (NMM models) have several key properties that make them a powerful tool for representing complex 3D objects. In this section, we will discuss some of these properties and their implications.

#### 15.2b.1 Data Compression

One of the key advantages of NMM models is their ability to achieve high data compression. This is due to the fact that NMM models can represent objects with complex internal structures using a smaller number of vertices and faces compared to B-rep models. This makes NMM models particularly useful for storing and manipulating large 3D objects.

#### 15.2b.2 Robustness

NMM models are robust to small perturbations in the input data. This means that even if the input data is slightly noisy or inaccurate, the resulting NMM model will still be a good representation of the original object. This robustness makes NMM models a reliable choice for applications where the input data may not be perfect.

#### 15.2b.3 Complexity

The complexity of an NMM model is directly related to the complexity of the object being represented. This means that for objects with complex internal structures, NMM models can be more complex than B-rep models. However, this complexity is necessary to accurately represent the object and can be managed using efficient algorithms and data structures.

#### 15.2b.4 Applications

NMM models have a wide range of applications in various fields. In CAD, they are used for creating and modifying complex designs. In CAM, they are used for generating toolpaths for CAD designs. In computer graphics, NMM models are used for creating realistic 3D objects with complex internal structures. They are also used in medical imaging for representing 3D models of human anatomy.

#### 15.2b.5 Limitations

Despite their many advantages, NMM models also have some limitations. One of the main limitations is their lack of support for non-manifold topologies. This means that objects with non-manifold topologies, such as intersecting surfaces, cannot be accurately represented using NMM models. Additionally, the complexity of NMM models can make them more difficult to work with compared to B-rep models.
