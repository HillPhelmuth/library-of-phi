In this section, we will discuss the various criteria that are used to evaluate the course.

#### 12.1a Introduction to Evaluation Criteria

The evaluation criteria for the Masters of Engineering program in Environmental Engineering are based on the principles of the Common Criteria (CC). The CC is a set of standards and guidelines for evaluating the security features of computer products and systems. It was developed by the governments of Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, and the US, and is widely used in the IT industry.

The CC evaluations are performed on computer security products and systems, and they aim to establish the level of confidence that can be placed in the product's security features. This is achieved through quality assurance processes, such as the ISO/IEC 27002 and the German IT baseline protection. Additionally, the CC also includes cryptographic requirements for evaluations, which are typically covered by standards like FIPS 140-2.

The CC is constantly evolving, and it is important for the course evaluation to keep up with the latest developments. Some national evaluation schemes are phasing out EAL-based evaluations and only accepting products for evaluation that claim strict conformance with an approved PP. This ensures that the products and systems being evaluated meet the highest standards of security.

The evaluation process for the Masters of Engineering program in Environmental Engineering is based on the principles of the CC. It involves a thorough examination of the course content, teaching methods, and student learning outcomes. The evaluation is conducted by a team of experts, including faculty members, students, and industry professionals.

The evaluation criteria for the course are based on the following categories:

- Course content: This includes the relevance and depth of the course material, as well as the effectiveness of the teaching methods used.
- Student learning outcomes: This category assesses the achievement of the learning objectives and the overall learning experience of the students.
- Teaching methods: This includes the effectiveness of the teaching methods used, such as lectures, discussions, and group work.
- Assessment methods: This category evaluates the fairness and effectiveness of the assessment methods used, such as exams, assignments, and presentations.
- Student support: This includes the availability and effectiveness of support services for students, such as academic advising and tutoring.
- Course administration: This category assesses the efficiency and effectiveness of the course administration, including course scheduling, communication, and resource management.

Each of these categories is evaluated using a set of criteria and indicators, which are based on the principles of the CC.

### Reliability

Reliability refers to whether the scores are reproducible. Unless otherwise specified, the reliability scores and values come from studies done with a United States population sample # Program evaluation

## Reliability, validity and sensitivity

It is important to ensure that the instruments (for example, tests, questionnaires, etc.) used in program evaluation are as reliable, valid and sensitive as possible. According to Rossi et al. (2004, p. 222), 'a measure that is poorly chosen or poorly conceived can completely undermine the worth of an impact assessment by producing misleading estimates. Only if outcome measures are valid, reliable and appropriately sensitive can impact assessments be regarded as credible'.

### Reliability

The reliability of a measurement instrument is the 'extent to which the measure produces the same results when used repeatedly to measure the same thing' (Rossi et al., 2004, p. 218). The more reliable a measure is, the greater its statistical power and the more credible its findings. If a measuring instrument is unreliable, it may dilute and obscure the real effects of a program, and the program will 'appear to be less effective than it actually is' (Rossi et al., 2004, p. 219). Hence, it is important to ensure the evaluation is as reliable as possible.

### Validity

The validity of a measurement instrument is 'the extent to which it measures what it is intended to measure' (Rossi et al., 2004, p. 219). This concept can be difficult to accurately measure: in general use in evaluations, an instrument may be deemed valid if accepted as valid by the stakeholders (stakeholders may include, for example, funders, program administrators, et cetera).

Common Criteria certification is sometimes specified for IT procurement. Other standards containing, e.g., interoperation, system management, user training, supplement CC and other product standards. Examples include the ISO/IEC 27002 and the German IT baseline protection.

Details of cryptographic implementation within the TOE are outside the scope of the CC. Instead, national standards, like FIPS 140-2, give the specifications for cryptographic modules, and various standards specify the cryptographic algorithms in use.

More recently, PP authors are including cryptographic requirements for CC evaluations that would typically be covered by FIPS 140-2 evaluations, broadening the bounds of the CC through scheme-specific interpretations.

Some national evaluation schemes are phasing out EAL-based evaluations and only accept products for evaluation that claim strict conformance with an approved PP. The United States currently only allows PP-based evaluations.

## History

CC originated out of three standards:


CC was developed by the governments of Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, and the U.S.

## Testing organizations

All testing laboratories must comply with ISO/IEC 17025, and certification bodies will normally be approved against ISO/IEC 17024.

### Reliability

Reliability refers to whether the scores are reproducible. Unless otherwise specified, the reliability scores and values come from studies done with a United States population sample # Program evaluation

## Reliability, validity and sensitivity

It is important to ensure that the instruments (for example, tests, questionnaires, etc.) used in program evaluation are as reliable, valid and sensitive as possible. According to Rossi et al. (2004, p. 222), 'a measure that is poorly chosen or poorly conceived can completely undermine the worth of an impact assessment by producing misleading estimates. Only if outcome measures are valid, reliable and appropriately sensitive can impact assessments be regarded as credible'.

### Reliability

The reliability of a measurement instrument is the 'extent to which the measure produces the same results when used repeatedly to measure the same thing' (Rossi et al., 2004, p. 218). The more reliable a measure is, the greater its statistical power and the more credible its findings. If a measuring instrument is unreliable, it may dilute and obscure the real effects of a program, and the program will 'appear to be less effective than it actually is' (Rossi et al., 2004, p. 219). Hence, it is important to ensure the evaluation is as reliable as possible.

### Validity

The validity of a measurement instrument is 'the extent to which it measures what it is intended to measure' (Rossi et al., 2004, p. 219). This concept can be difficult to accurately measure: in general use in evaluations, an instrument may be deemed valid if accepted as valid by the stakeholders (stakeholders may include, for example, funders, program administrators, et cetera).

### Section: 12.1 Evaluation Criteria:

The evaluation of the Masters of Engineering Project (MEP) is a crucial step in the completion of the degree program. It is designed to assess the student's understanding and application of the principles and techniques learned throughout the course. The evaluation criteria for the MEP are based on the Common Criteria (CC) standards, which are widely accepted in the field of computer security.

The CC standards provide a set of evaluation criteria for computer security products and systems. These criteria are used to assess the security features of a product or system and to establish the level of confidence that can be placed in these features. The evaluation process also tries to establish the level of confidence that may be placed in the product's security features through quality assurance processes.

The CC standards are used in the evaluation of IT components such as firewalls, operating systems, and smart cards. They are also used in IT procurement, where they are sometimes specified. Other standards, such as the ISO/IEC 27002 and the German IT baseline protection, also contain requirements for system management, user training, and supplement CC and other product standards.

The details of cryptographic implementation within the TOE (Target of Evaluation) are outside the scope of the CC. Instead, national standards, like FIPS 140-2, give the specifications for cryptographic modules, and various standards specify the cryptographic algorithms in use.

Recently, PP (Protection Profile) authors have been including cryptographic requirements for CC evaluations that would typically be covered by FIPS 140-2 evaluations. This has broadened the bounds of the CC through scheme-specific interpretations.

Some national evaluation schemes are phasing out EAL-based evaluations and only accepting products for evaluation that claim strict conformance with an approved PP. The United States currently only allows PP-based evaluations.

The history of the CC can be traced back to three standards: the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC), the Information Technology Security Evaluation Criteria (ITSEC), and the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation (CC). These standards were combined to create the CC, which was developed by the governments of Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, and the U.S.

The testing organizations involved in the CC evaluations must comply with ISO/IEC 17025, and certification bodies will normally be approved against ISO/IEC 17024. This ensures that the evaluations are conducted in a standardized and reliable manner.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of these evaluation criteria in the context of the MEP.





### Section: 12.2 Evaluation Methods:

Evaluation methods are essential tools for assessing the effectiveness and impact of environmental engineering projects. These methods provide a systematic approach to evaluating the project's performance, identifying areas of improvement, and measuring the project's overall success. In this section, we will discuss the various evaluation methods used in environmental engineering projects.

#### 12.2a Introduction to Evaluation Methods

Evaluation methods are used to assess the performance of environmental engineering projects. These methods provide a systematic approach to evaluating the project's effectiveness, identifying areas of improvement, and measuring the project's overall success. There are various evaluation methods used in environmental engineering projects, each with its own strengths and limitations.

One commonly used evaluation method is the Simple Function Point (SFP) method. This method is used to evaluate the complexity and size of a project, and is particularly useful for projects with a large number of components or functions. The SFP method is based on the concept of function points, which are defined as the smallest unit of functionality that can be measured and evaluated. The SFP method assigns a point value to each function point, based on its complexity and size. These point values are then used to calculate a total point value for the project, which can be used to compare different projects and assess their relative complexity.

Another commonly used evaluation method is the Critical Path Method (CPM). This method is used to identify the critical path of a project, which is the sequence of tasks that must be completed on time for the project to be completed on schedule. The CPM method uses a network diagram to represent the project's tasks and their dependencies, and then calculates the critical path based on the project's start and end dates. This method is particularly useful for projects with a large number of tasks and dependencies.

#### 12.2b Evaluation Methods for Environmental Engineering Projects

Environmental engineering projects require a unique set of evaluation methods due to their complex and multifaceted nature. These projects often involve multiple stakeholders, including government agencies, private companies, and community groups. Therefore, it is essential to use evaluation methods that can capture the project's impact on all stakeholders and assess its overall success.

One such method is the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). The EIA is a systematic process used to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of a project. It involves collecting and analyzing data on the project's potential impacts on air quality, water quality, soil quality, and other environmental factors. The EIA also considers the project's potential impacts on human health and well-being. This method is particularly useful for projects that have a significant impact on the environment, such as large-scale infrastructure projects.

Another commonly used evaluation method for environmental engineering projects is the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The LCA is a comprehensive method used to evaluate the environmental impacts of a product or system throughout its entire life cycle, from raw material extraction to disposal. This method takes into account all energy inputs, including those used in manufacturing, transportation, and disposal. It also considers the environmental impacts of the product or system, such as emissions, waste, and resource depletion. The LCA is particularly useful for projects that involve the production or use of products or systems with a long lifespan.

#### 12.2c Case Studies in Evaluation Methods

To further illustrate the application of evaluation methods in environmental engineering projects, let us consider a case study of a waste management project. The project aims to reduce the amount of waste generated by a community and increase recycling rates. The project involves implementing a new waste management system, including recycling bins, composting facilities, and waste reduction education programs.

To evaluate the project's success, the Simple Function Point (SFP) method can be used to assess the complexity and size of the project. The Critical Path Method (CPM) can be used to identify the critical path of the project, ensuring that all tasks are completed on time. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) can be used to evaluate the project's potential environmental impacts, and the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) can be used to assess the project's overall environmental impact.

By using a combination of these evaluation methods, the project can be effectively evaluated and improvements can be made to ensure its success. This case study highlights the importance of using a variety of evaluation methods to assess the effectiveness and impact of environmental engineering projects.

### Inspection methods

These usability evaluation methods involve observation of users by an experimenter, or the testing and evaluation of a program by an expert reviewer. They provide more quantitative data as tasks can be timed and recorded.

#### Card sorts

Card sorting is a way to involve users in grouping information for a website's usability review. Participants in a card sorting session are asked to organize the content from a Web site in a way that makes sense to them. Participants review items from a Web site and then group these items into categories. Card sorting helps to learn how users think about the content and how they would organize the information on the Web site. Card sorting helps to build the structure for a Web site, decide what to put on the home page, and label the home page categories. It also helps to ensure that information is organized on the site in a way that is logical to users.

#### Tree tests

Tree testing is a way to evaluate the effectiveness of a website's top-down organization. Participants are given "find it" tasks, then asked to drill down through successive text lists of topics and subtopics to find a suitable answer. Tree testing evaluates the findability and labeling of topics in a site, separate from its navigation controls or visual design.

## Specific design evaluation

The evaluation of specific designs is the third and final step of the approach development. It had begun with the assessment of GrayArea.

### GrayArea evaluation

GrayArea was evaluated by using a prototype that simulated the participants' folders but included a gray area where they could drag & drop their subjectively unimportant files. In the study 96 participants were asked to clean up their folders from unimportant files once with GrayArea and once without it. Results show that the use of GrayArea reduced the clutter in folders, that it was easier for participants to demote files than to delete them and that they would use it if provided in their next operating system.

These results encourage commercial implementation of GrayArea and the development and testing of other user-subjective designs.

## Chronological development

The user-subjective approach was developed by Ofer Bergman during his Ph.D. at Tel Aviv University supervised by Prof. Rafi Nachmias and guided by Prof. Ruth Beyth-Marom. The research was partially funded by the Sacta Rashi foundation. In 2003 they had published a paper titled "The user-subjective approach to personal information management" at the Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology. In 2004 the paper was recognized by The American Library Association as field representative when choosing personal information management as one of the top ten information science research contributions of the year.

### Section: 13.1 Understanding Objectives:

In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of course objectives and their importance in the learning process. As mentioned in the previous section, course objectives are the specific, measurable, and achievable goals that students are expected to attain by the end of a course. They provide a clear direction for both the instructor and the students, ensuring that the course is aligned with the overall program objectives.

#### 13.1a Definition of Objectives

Objectives are the heart of any course. They are the desired outcomes that students are expected to achieve by the end of the course. They are often referred to as the "what" of the course, as they describe what students will be able to do, know, or understand after completing the course.

Objectives are typically stated in behavioral terms, meaning they describe what students will be able to do, rather than what they will know or understand. This is because behavioral objectives are more measurable and can be easily assessed. For example, instead of stating an objective as "Students will understand the principles of environmental engineering," a more specific and measurable objective would be "Students will be able to apply the principles of environmental engineering to solve real-world problems."

Objectives are also often stated in terms of Bloom's Taxonomy, a framework that categorizes learning objectives based on the level of thinking required. The six levels of Bloom's Taxonomy are remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. By using Bloom's Taxonomy, instructors can ensure that their objectives align with the desired level of learning for the course.

#### 13.1b Importance of Course Objectives

Course objectives are crucial for both instructors and students. For instructors, they provide a clear roadmap for the course, helping them plan and organize the content and assessments. By setting clear objectives, instructors can ensure that the course is aligned with the overall program objectives and that students are meeting the necessary learning outcomes.

For students, course objectives provide a clear understanding of what is expected of them and what they will be able to achieve by the end of the course. They also serve as a guide for students to plan and manage their time effectively. By understanding the objectives, students can prioritize their learning and focus on the most important concepts and skills.

#### 13.1c Writing Effective Objectives

Writing effective objectives requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some tips for writing clear and measurable objectives:

1. Start with the overall program objectives and work down to the course objectives. This ensures that the course objectives align with the program objectives and that students are meeting the necessary learning outcomes.

2. Use behavioral language and avoid vague terms. Be specific and clear about what students will be able to do, know, or understand.

3. Use Bloom's Taxonomy to categorize your objectives. This helps ensure that your objectives align with the desired level of learning for the course.

4. Make sure your objectives are measurable. This means that they can be assessed and evaluated.

5. Involve students in the process. Ask for their input and feedback on the objectives. This can help ensure that the objectives are relevant and meaningful to students.

By following these tips and using the guidelines provided in this chapter, instructors can write effective course objectives that align with the overall program objectives and guide students towards achieving the desired learning outcomes.
