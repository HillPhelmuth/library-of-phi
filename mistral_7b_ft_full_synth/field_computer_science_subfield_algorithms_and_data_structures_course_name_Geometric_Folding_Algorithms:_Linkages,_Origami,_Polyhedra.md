### Subsection 1.3b: Algorithm Design

In this section, we will discuss the design of folding algorithms for polyhedra. This involves understanding the principles behind these algorithms and how they can be applied to create complex and intricate structures.

#### Design Principles

The design of folding algorithms for polyhedra is based on the principles of symmetry, tessellations, and duality. These principles guide the creation of algorithms that can efficiently and accurately fold polyhedra.

Symmetry is a key principle in the design of folding algorithms. It allows for the creation of balanced and aesthetically pleasing structures by ensuring that the polyhedron is folded along its axes of symmetry. This results in a more efficient folding process and a more visually appealing final structure.

Tessellations also play a crucial role in the design of folding algorithms. By breaking down a polyhedron into smaller, simpler shapes, tessellations allow for the creation of complex structures from simple building blocks. This makes the folding process more manageable and allows for the creation of intricate designs.

Duality is another important principle in the design of folding algorithms. It allows for the creation of a dual polyhedron, which is a polyhedron that is complementary to the original polyhedron. This duality can be used to create symmetrical and balanced structures, as well as to simplify the folding process.

#### Design Process

The design process for folding algorithms for polyhedra involves several steps. First, the polyhedron is broken down into smaller, simpler shapes through tessellation. Then, the symmetry of the polyhedron is analyzed, and the axes of symmetry are identified. Next, the duality of the polyhedron is explored, and the dual polyhedron is created. Finally, the folding algorithm is designed, taking into account the principles of symmetry, tessellations, and duality.

#### Complexity

The complexity of folding algorithms for polyhedra can vary depending on the size and complexity of the polyhedron. Some algorithms may require more time and effort to design and implement, while others may be more straightforward. However, the complexity of the algorithm is not necessarily indicative of the complexity of the final structure. In fact, some of the most intricate and visually appealing structures can be created using relatively simple folding algorithms.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, the design of folding algorithms for polyhedra is a complex and intricate process that involves understanding and applying the principles of symmetry, tessellations, and duality. By breaking down the polyhedron into simpler shapes, identifying its axes of symmetry, and exploring its duality, designers can create efficient and aesthetically pleasing folding algorithms. The complexity of these algorithms may vary, but they can all be used to create stunning and intricate structures.

For example, a uniaxial linkage has one degree of freedom, while a biaxial linkage has two degrees of freedom.

Another important property of linkages is the range of motion, which is the maximum angle that a linkage can rotate around its joints. This property is crucial in determining the capabilities of a linkage and its ability to perform certain tasks.

Linkages also have a concept of linkage isotopy, which is the equivalence of two linkages up to rigid motion and scaling. This property is useful in simplifying complex linkages and reducing the number of degrees of freedom.

## Chapter: Geometric Folding Algorithms: Linkages, Origami, Polyhedra":




### Section: 2.1 Types of Linkages:

Linkages are an essential tool in the study of geometric folding algorithms. They allow us to connect and manipulate different parts of a structure, providing a means for movement and transformation. In this section, we will explore the different types of linkages and their properties.

#### 2.1a Introduction to Linkages

Linkages are a fundamental concept in the study of geometric folding algorithms. They are used to connect and manipulate different parts of a structure, providing a means for movement and transformation. In this subsection, we will introduce the concept of linkages and discuss their role in geometric folding algorithms.

Linkages are essentially a series of connected segments, where each segment is connected to its adjacent segments by a joint. These joints can be thought of as pivot points, allowing the segments to rotate and move relative to each other. The segments and joints together form a kinematic chain, which is a series of rigid bodies connected by joints that allow relative motion.

Linkages are used in a variety of applications, from simple mechanical toys to complex robotic systems. In the context of geometric folding algorithms, linkages are used to create and manipulate polyhedra, origami structures, and other geometric objects. By carefully designing the linkages, we can control the movement and transformation of these objects, allowing us to create intricate and complex structures.

In the following sections, we will explore the different types of linkages and their properties. We will also discuss how linkages are used in various applications, including origami and polyhedra. By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of linkages and their role in geometric folding algorithms.

#### 2.1b Types of Linkages

There are several types of linkages that are commonly used in geometric folding algorithms. These include:

- Revolute joints: These are the most common type of joint used in linkages. They allow for rotation of one segment relative to another.
- Prismatic joints: These joints allow for linear motion of one segment relative to another.
- Spherical joints: These joints allow for both rotation and linear motion of one segment relative to another.
- Universal joints: These joints allow for rotation and linear motion in two perpendicular planes.

Each of these joints has its own unique properties and applications. For example, revolute joints are commonly used in origami structures, while prismatic joints are often used in polyhedra.

#### 2.1c Practical Examples

To better understand the different types of linkages and their properties, let's look at some practical examples.

##### Origami Structures

Origami is the art of paper folding, and it is a popular application of linkages in geometric folding algorithms. In origami, linkages are used to create complex structures from a single sheet of paper. The linkages are typically made using revolute joints, which allow for the paper to be folded and unfolded in different ways.

One example of an origami structure is the crane, which is a popular origami model. The crane is made using a series of linkages, with each linkage representing a different part of the crane's body. By carefully folding and unfolding the paper, the crane can be transformed from a flat sheet into a three-dimensional structure.

##### Polyhedra

Polyhedra are three-dimensional geometric objects that are made up of flat polygonal faces. In geometric folding algorithms, polyhedra are often created using linkages. The linkages are used to connect the vertices of the polyhedron, allowing for the creation of complex and intricate structures.

One example of a polyhedron created using linkages is the cube. The cube is made up of six square faces, and the linkages are used to connect the vertices of the cube. By manipulating the linkages, the cube can be transformed into different shapes, such as a tetrahedron or an octahedron.

##### Conclusion

In this section, we have explored the different types of linkages and their properties. We have also looked at practical examples of how linkages are used in origami structures and polyhedra. In the next section, we will delve deeper into the properties of linkages and how they are used in geometric folding algorithms.

# The Principles of Scientific Management

### Chapter 1: Fundamentals of scientific management

Taylor argued that the principle object of management should be to secure the maximum prosperity for the employer, coupled with the maximum prosperity for each employee. He argued that the most important object of both the employee and the management should be the training and development of each individual in the establishment, so that he can do the highest class of work for which his natural abilities fit him. Taylor demonstrated that maximum prosperity can exist only as the result of maximum productivity, both for the shop and individual, and rebuked the idea that the fundamental interests of employees and employers are necessarily antagonistic.

Taylor described how workers deliberately work slowly, or “soldier”, to protect their interests. According to Taylor, there were three reasons for the inefficiency:
"First." The fallacy, which has from time immemorial been almost universal among workmen, that a material increase in the output of each man or each machine in the trade would result in the end in throwing a large number of men out of work.

"Second." The defective systems of management which are in common use, and which make it necessary for each workman to soldier, or work slowly, in order that he may protect his own best interests.

"Third." The inefficient rule-of-thumb methods, which are still almost universal in all trades, and in practicing which our workmen waste a large part of their effort.
Taylor argued that the cheapening of any article in common use almost immediately results in a largely increased demand for that article, creating additional work and contradicting the first belief.

As to the second cause, Taylor pointed to quotes from 'Shop Management' to help explain how current management styles caused workers to soldier. He explained the natural tendency of men to take it easy as distinct from "systematic soldiering" due to thought and reasoning,

- Revolute joints: These are the most common type of joint used in linkages. They allow for rotation of one segment relative to another.
- Prismatic joints: These joints allow for linear motion of one segment relative to another.
- Spherical joints: These joints allow for both rotation and linear motion of one segment relative to another.
- Universal joints: These joints allow for rotation and linear motion in multiple directions.

Each type of joint has its own unique properties and applications. For example, revolute joints are commonly used in linkages that require precise and controlled rotation, while prismatic joints are used in linkages that require linear motion.

#### 2.1c Applications of Linkages

Linkages have a wide range of applications in geometric folding algorithms. They are used to create and manipulate polyhedra, origami structures, and other geometric objects. By carefully designing the linkages, we can control the movement and transformation of these objects, allowing us to create intricate and complex structures.

One of the most common applications of linkages is in the creation of polyhedra. By using linkages, we can connect and manipulate the faces of a polyhedron, allowing for precise control over its shape and transformation. This is particularly useful in the study of geometric folding algorithms, as it allows us to create and manipulate polyhedra with specific properties and characteristics.

Linkages are also used in origami, the art of paper folding. By using linkages, we can create complex origami structures that would be difficult or impossible to create using traditional folding techniques. This allows for the creation of intricate and detailed origami designs, making it a popular application of linkages in geometric folding algorithms.

In addition to these applications, linkages are also used in various other fields, such as robotics and mechanical engineering. By understanding the principles and properties of linkages, we can design and create complex and efficient mechanical systems.

In the next section, we will explore the properties of linkages in more detail, including their kinematic and geometric properties. We will also discuss how these properties can be used to create and manipulate geometric objects using linkages. 





### Section: 2.2 Kinematic Analysis of Linkages:

#### 2.2c Linkage Design Techniques

In the previous section, we discussed the kinematic analysis of linkages, which involves studying the motion of linkages under different conditions. In this section, we will explore some techniques for designing linkages that can be used in various applications.

#### 2.2c.1 Designing Linkages for Maximum Motion

One of the key considerations in designing linkages is the maximum motion that the linkage can achieve. This is particularly important in applications where the linkage needs to move a large distance or cover a wide range of angles.

To design a linkage for maximum motion, we can use the principles of kinematic chains. A kinematic chain is a series of rigid bodies connected by joints, where the motion of one body affects the motion of the others. By carefully designing the kinematic chain, we can control the maximum motion of the linkage.

For example, consider a simple linkage consisting of two rigid bodies connected by a hinge. If we want the linkage to achieve maximum motion, we can design the kinematic chain such that the two bodies are perpendicular to each other. This will allow the linkage to rotate through a full 360 degrees, achieving maximum motion.

#### 2.2c.2 Designing Linkages for Specific Motion Paths

In some applications, we may need to design a linkage that follows a specific motion path. This could be due to the requirements of the application, or to ensure that the linkage does not interfere with other components.

To design a linkage for a specific motion path, we can use the principles of inverse kinematics. Inverse kinematics is the process of determining the joint angles and positions that will result in a desired motion path. By using inverse kinematics, we can design a linkage that follows a specific motion path.

For example, consider a linkage that needs to follow a circular motion path. We can use inverse kinematics to determine the joint angles and positions that will result in a circular motion path. By adjusting these parameters, we can design a linkage that follows the desired circular motion path.

#### 2.2c.3 Designing Linkages for Robustness

In some applications, we may need to design a linkage that is robust, meaning it can withstand external forces and maintain its functionality. This is particularly important in applications where the linkage may be subjected to vibrations or other external forces.

To design a linkage for robustness, we can use the principles of dynamic analysis. Dynamic analysis involves studying the forces and torques acting on the linkage, and designing the linkage to withstand these forces. By using dynamic analysis, we can design a linkage that is robust and can maintain its functionality under external forces.

For example, consider a linkage that needs to withstand vibrations. We can use dynamic analysis to determine the forces and torques acting on the linkage due to the vibrations. By adjusting the design of the linkage, we can ensure that it can withstand these forces and maintain its functionality.

In conclusion, designing linkages involves careful consideration of the maximum motion, specific motion paths, and robustness. By using the principles of kinematic chains, inverse kinematics, and dynamic analysis, we can design linkages that are efficient, precise, and robust.




#### 2.2c.3 Designing Linkages for Robustness

In some applications, the linkage may need to withstand external forces or vibrations. In these cases, it is important to design the linkage for robustness, meaning it can continue to function properly even under these conditions.

To design a linkage for robustness, we can use the principles of statics. Statics is the branch of mechanics that deals with the study of forces in equilibrium. By analyzing the forces acting on the linkage, we can design it to withstand these forces and continue to function properly.

For example, consider a linkage that needs to withstand a certain amount of torque. We can use the principles of statics to determine the maximum torque that the linkage can withstand without breaking. By designing the linkage to withstand this torque, we can ensure its robustness.

#### 2.2c.4 Designing Linkages for Efficiency

In some applications, the linkage may need to move quickly or efficiently. This could be due to the requirements of the application, or to minimize wear and tear on the linkage.

To design a linkage for efficiency, we can use the principles of dynamics. Dynamics is the branch of mechanics that deals with the study of motion. By analyzing the forces and torques acting on the linkage, we can design it to move efficiently and minimize wear and tear.

For example, consider a linkage that needs to move quickly. We can use the principles of dynamics to determine the optimal joint angles and positions that will result in the fastest motion. By designing the linkage with these optimal joint angles and positions, we can ensure its efficiency.

### Conclusion

In this section, we have explored some techniques for designing linkages for various applications. By using the principles of kinematic chains, inverse kinematics, statics, and dynamics, we can design linkages that achieve maximum motion, follow specific motion paths, are robust, and move efficiently. These techniques are essential for creating effective and efficient linkages in a wide range of applications.





#### 2.3a Design Principles

In the previous section, we discussed the principles of kinematic chains, inverse kinematics, statics, and dynamics, and how they can be applied to design linkages for various applications. In this section, we will delve deeper into the mechanical design of linkages, focusing on the principles of design and how they can be applied to create efficient and effective linkages.

#### 2.3a.1 Design Principles

The design of linkages is governed by a set of principles that guide the creation of efficient and effective mechanical systems. These principles are often derived from the principles of physics and mathematics, and they provide a framework for understanding and predicting the behavior of linkages.

One of the key principles of design is the principle of economy, which states that a design should be as simple and efficient as possible. This principle is particularly relevant in the design of linkages, where complexity can lead to increased friction, wear and tear, and reduced efficiency. By adhering to the principle of economy, designers can create linkages that are efficient, durable, and easy to maintain.

Another important principle of design is the principle of robustness, which states that a design should be able to withstand external forces and vibrations without losing its functionality. This principle is particularly relevant in the design of linkages, which are often subjected to a variety of external forces and vibrations. By adhering to the principle of robustness, designers can create linkages that are able to perform their intended function even under challenging conditions.

#### 2.3a.2 Design Process

The design process for linkages typically involves several stages, each of which is guided by the principles of design. The first stage is the conceptual design, where the designer defines the purpose and requirements of the linkage. This is followed by the detailed design, where the designer creates a detailed model of the linkage, taking into account the principles of economy and robustness. The final stage is the testing and validation, where the designer tests the linkage to ensure that it meets the specified requirements.

#### 2.3a.3 Design Tools

Designers can use a variety of tools to aid in the design of linkages. Computer-aided design (CAD) software, for example, allows designers to create detailed models of their linkages and to simulate their behavior under various conditions. Finite element analysis (FEA) software can be used to analyze the stresses and strains in the linkage, helping to ensure that it is robust and durable.

#### 2.3a.4 Design Examples

To further illustrate the principles and process of design, let's consider a few examples of linkages. The first example is a simple hinge, which is used to connect two rigid bodies. The hinge is designed to allow rotation around a single axis, and it is subjected to a variety of external forces. The design of the hinge is guided by the principles of economy and robustness, with the goal of creating a simple and efficient mechanism that can withstand external forces.

The second example is a more complex linkage, such as a robotic arm. The robotic arm is designed to perform a variety of tasks, and it is subjected to a variety of external forces and vibrations. The design of the robotic arm is guided by the principles of economy and robustness, with the goal of creating an efficient and durable mechanism that can perform its intended tasks even under challenging conditions.

In conclusion, the mechanical design of linkages is guided by a set of principles that are derived from the principles of physics and mathematics. These principles provide a framework for understanding and predicting the behavior of linkages, and they guide the creation of efficient and effective mechanical systems.

The first step in kinematic design is to define the desired motion path. This can be done using a variety of tools, such as CAD software or pen and paper. Once the motion path is defined, the designer can use the principles of kinematics to determine the necessary joint angles and link lengths.

##### 2.3b.2 Dynamic Design

Dynamic design is a technique used to design linkages that can withstand external forces and vibrations. This technique is based on the principles of dynamics, which is the branch of physics that deals with the forces that cause motion.

The first step in dynamic design is to identify the external forces and vibrations that the linkage will be subjected to. This can be done using tools such as FEA software or physical testing. Once the external forces and vibrations are identified, the designer can use the principles of dynamics to determine the necessary joint stiffness and damping.

##### 2.3b.3 Robust Design

Robust design is a technique used to design linkages that are able to perform their intended function even under challenging conditions. This technique is based on the principles of robustness, which is the ability of a design to withstand external forces and vibrations without losing its functionality.

The first step in robust design is to identify the potential failure modes of the linkage. This can be done using tools such as FMEA (Failure Modes and Effects Analysis) or physical testing. Once the potential failure modes are identified, the designer can use the principles of robustness to design the linkage in a way that minimizes the impact of these failure modes.

##### 2.3b.4 Design for Manufacturability

Design for manufacturability is a technique used to design linkages that are easy and cost-effective to manufacture. This technique is based on the principles of economy, which is the ability of a design to be simple and efficient.

The first step in design for manufacturability is to identify the manufacturing processes that will be used to create the linkage. This can be done using tools such as DFM (Design for Manufacturability) or consultation with a manufacturer. Once the manufacturing processes are identified, the designer can use the principles of economy to design the linkage in a way that minimizes the complexity and cost of manufacturing.

In conclusion, the mechanical design of linkages involves a variety of techniques, each of which is guided by the principles of design. By using these techniques, designers can create efficient and effective linkages that are able to perform their intended function even under challenging conditions.

The design of robotic arms, for instance, often involves the use of kinematic design to achieve specific motion paths. The robotic arms are also designed to withstand external forces and vibrations using dynamic design techniques.

##### 2.3c.2 Automotive Industry

In the automotive industry, the principles of robust design are extensively used. The design of car components, such as the engine, transmission, and suspension, involves identifying potential failure modes and designing the components in a way that minimizes the impact of these failure modes.

## Chapter: Chapter 3: Folding Algorithms

### Introduction

In the realm of geometric folding, algorithms play a pivotal role. They are the mathematical rules that govern the process of folding, providing a systematic approach to creating complex geometric structures. This chapter, "Folding Algorithms," delves into the intricacies of these algorithms, their types, and their applications.

The chapter begins by introducing the concept of folding algorithms, explaining their importance in the field of geometric folding. It then proceeds to discuss the different types of folding algorithms, such as the mountain-valley rule, the angle-of-incidence rule, and the crease pattern rule. Each type is explained in detail, with examples to illustrate their application.

The chapter also explores the applications of folding algorithms in the creation of various geometric structures, such as polyhedra, origami, and paper sculptures. It discusses how these algorithms are used to generate the crease patterns that guide the folding process.

Throughout the chapter, mathematical expressions are rendered using the MathJax library, ensuring clarity and precision in the presentation of complex mathematical concepts. For instance, the equation `$y_j(n)$` is rendered as `$y_j(n)$`.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of folding algorithms, their types, and their applications. They should be able to apply these algorithms to create their own geometric structures, and understand the mathematical principles that govern the process of folding.




#### 2.3b Design Techniques

In addition to the principles of design, there are several techniques that can be used to create efficient and effective linkages. These techniques are often derived from the principles of design and provide a practical approach to creating linkages.

#### 2.3b.1 Finite Element Analysis

Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a numerical method used to solve complex engineering problems. It involves dividing a structure into a finite number of elements, and then solving the equations of motion for each element. The results are then combined to determine the overall behavior of the structure.

FEA can be used to analyze the behavior of linkages under various loading conditions. By creating a finite element model of the linkage, engineers can simulate the effects of external forces and vibrations on the linkage.

### Subsection: 2.5b Optimization Techniques

In this section, we will delve into the various optimization techniques that can be used to optimize linkages. These techniques can be broadly classified into two categories: deterministic and stochastic.

#### 2.5b.1 Deterministic Optimization Techniques

Deterministic optimization techniques are those that guarantee an optimal solution. These techniques are often used when the objective function and constraints are well-defined and continuous. Some common deterministic optimization techniques include:

- **Linear Programming (LP)**: This technique is used to optimize linear objective functions subject to linear constraints. It is particularly useful for problems with a large number of variables and constraints.

- **Quadratic Programming (QP)**: This technique is used to optimize quadratic objective functions subject to linear constraints. It is often used in problems where the objective function is non-linear.

- **Convex Optimization**: This technique is used to optimize convex objective functions subject to convex constraints. Convex optimization problems have a unique optimal solution, making them particularly tractable.

#### 2.5b.2 Stochastic Optimization Techniques

Stochastic optimization techniques are those that do not guarantee an optimal solution but can handle non-convex and non-differentiable objective functions. These techniques are often used when the objective function and constraints are not well-defined or when the problem is too complex to be solved deterministically. Some common stochastic optimization techniques include:

- **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**: These algorithms are inspired by the process of natural selection and evolution. They work by generating a population of potential solutions, evaluating them according to a fitness function, and then selecting the fittest individuals to reproduce and create the next generation.

- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**: This algorithm is inspired by the behavior of bird flocks and fish schools. It works by having a population of particles move through the design space, with their positions and velocities updated based on their own best position and the best position of the swarm.

- **Simulated Annealing (SA)**: This algorithm is inspired by the process of annealing in metallurgy. It works by iteratively making small changes to the design parameters and accepting them if they improve the objective function or rejecting them if they worsen it. The algorithm accepts worse solutions with a certain probability, which decreases over time, allowing it to escape local optima.

- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**: This algorithm is inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. It works by having a population of artificial ants move through the design space, with their paths influenced by pheromone trails that they deposit and follow.

Each of these optimization techniques has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which one to use depends on the specific characteristics of the problem at hand. In the next section, we will discuss how these techniques can be applied to optimize linkages.

For instance, the optimization of the kinematic chain can reduce the number of joints required for a given task, thereby reducing the complexity and cost of the robot.

#### 2.5c.2 Mechanical Engineering

In mechanical engineering, linkages are used in a variety of machines and mechanisms. The optimization of these linkages can improve the efficiency and reliability of these machines. For example, the optimization of a linkage in a crane can reduce the weight and size of the crane, thereby increasing its portability and reducing its cost.

#### 2.5c.3 Computer Science

In computer science, linkages are used in the design of data structures and algorithms. The optimization of these linkages can improve the performance of these data structures and algorithms. For instance, the optimization of a linked list can reduce its memory usage and improve its search efficiency.

#### 2.5c.4 Biology

In biology, linkages are used to model the structure and function of biological systems. The optimization of these linkages can provide insights into the behavior of these systems. For example, the optimization of a protein-protein interaction network can reveal the most critical proteins in the network, which can be targeted for drug development.

#### 2.5c.5 Other Applications

Linkages have many other applications in various fields, including architecture, furniture design, and even art. The optimization of these linkages can improve the functionality, durability, and aesthetics of these applications.

### Introduction

Origami, the ancient Japanese art of paper folding, has captivated the world with its intricate designs and complex structures. It is a form of art that has been practiced for centuries, with its roots dating back to the 17th century. The art of origami is not just about creating beautiful designs, but it also has a strong mathematical foundation that governs its principles. In this chapter, we will explore the mathematical foundations of origami and how it is intertwined with the art form.

We will begin by discussing the basic principles of origami, such as the use of folds and creases to create shapes. We will then delve into the mathematical concepts that are essential to understanding origami, such as symmetry, angles, and geometric transformations. We will also explore the role of origami in the development of geometric folding algorithms, which are used in various fields such as robotics and architecture.

Furthermore, we will examine the connection between origami and linkages, which are interconnected chains of rigid bodies that can move in a specific pattern. We will discuss how origami techniques are used to create linkages and how these linkages can be used to create complex structures. We will also explore the mathematical principles behind linkages, such as kinematics and dynamics.

Finally, we will touch upon the concept of polyhedra, which are three-dimensional shapes with flat faces. We will discuss how origami techniques are used to create polyhedra and how these polyhedra can be used to create more complex structures. We will also explore the mathematical properties of polyhedra, such as their vertexes, edges, and faces.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations of origami and how it is intertwined with the art form. They will also gain insight into the various applications of origami in different fields and how it can be used to create complex structures. So let us begin our journey into the world of origami and its mathematical foundations.




### Section 3.1 Folding Patterns in Origami:

Origami is a form of art that has been practiced for centuries, with its roots dating back to the 17th century. It is a form of paper folding that has captivated the world with its intricate designs and complex structures. In this section, we will explore the basic concepts of origami and how it is intertwined with mathematics.

#### 3.1a Basic Concepts

Origami is based on the principles of folding and creasing paper. These folds and creases are used to create shapes and structures. The art of origami is not just about creating beautiful designs, but it also has a strong mathematical foundation that governs its principles.

One of the fundamental concepts in origami is symmetry. Symmetry is the property of an object where it looks the same from all directions. In origami, symmetry is used to create balanced and aesthetically pleasing designs. For example, the popular origami crane is a symmetrical design that is often used in Japanese culture.

Another important concept in origami is angles. Angles are used to create shapes and structures in origami. The angle of a fold determines the shape of the resulting structure. For example, a 90-degree angle creates a square, while a 180-degree angle creates a straight line.

Geometric transformations are also essential in origami. These transformations include translations, rotations, and reflections. These transformations are used to create complex structures from simple folds. For example, the origami cube is created by combining two 90-degree rotations and a translation.

Origami also has a strong connection with linkages. Linkages are interconnected chains of rigid bodies that can move in a specific pattern. Origami techniques are used to create linkages, and these linkages can be used to create complex structures. The mathematical principles behind linkages, such as kinematics and dynamics, are also applied in origami.

Finally, origami is also intertwined with the concept of polyhedra. Polyhedra are three-dimensional shapes with flat faces. Origami techniques are used to create polyhedra, and these polyhedra can be used to create more complex structures. The mathematical properties of polyhedra, such as their vertexes, edges, and faces, are also studied in origami.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical concepts that are essential to understanding origami, such as symmetry, angles, and geometric transformations. We will also explore the role of origami in the development of geometric folding algorithms, which are used in various fields such as robotics and architecture.

## Practice

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation. Freshly written code can often have hidden subtle issues that take time to be detected, issues that sometimes can cause major problems down the road. Reusing design patterns helps to prevent such subtle issues, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.

In order to achieve flexibility, design patterns usually introduce additional levels of indirection, which in some cases may complicate the resulting designs and hurt application performance.

By definition, a pattern must be programmed anew into each application that uses it. Since some authors see this as a step backward from software reuse as provided by components, researchers have worked to turn patterns into components. Meyer and Arnout were able to provide full or partial componentization of two-thirds of the patterns they attempted.

Software design techniques are difficult to apply to a broader range of problems. Design patterns provide general solutions, documented in a format that does not require specifics tied to a particular problem.

## Structure

Design patterns are composed of several sections (see <section link||Documentation> below). Of particular interest to us is the "Design" section, which describes the problem that the pattern solves and the solution that the pattern provides. This section also includes a discussion of the trade-offs and considerations that must be taken into account when using the pattern.

### Design

The "Design" section of a design pattern is where the pattern is described in detail. This section includes a description of the problem that the pattern solves, the solution that the pattern provides, and the trade-offs and considerations that must be taken into account when using the pattern.

#### Problem

The problem section describes the problem that the pattern solves. This could be a design problem, a performance problem, or a maintainability problem. The problem section should clearly define the problem and explain why it is important to solve it.

#### Solution

The solution section describes the solution that the pattern provides. This could be a design solution, a performance solution, or a maintainability solution. The solution section should clearly explain how the pattern solves the problem and provide examples or diagrams to illustrate the solution.

#### Trade-offs

The trade-offs section discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using the pattern. This could include performance trade-offs, complexity trade-offs, or flexibility trade-offs. The trade-offs section should provide a balanced discussion of the pros and cons of using the pattern.

#### Considerations

The considerations section discusses any important factors that must be taken into account when using the pattern. This could include system requirements, design constraints, or implementation considerations. The considerations section should provide a comprehensive list of all important factors that must be considered.

#### Example

An example section is often included in the "Design" section to provide a concrete example of how the pattern is used. This could be a code example, a diagram, or a step-by-step explanation of how to implement the pattern. The example section should clearly demonstrate how the pattern is used and how it solves the problem.

### Subsection: 3.1c Practical Applications

Origami, the ancient Japanese art of paper folding, has been used for centuries to create beautiful and intricate designs. However, it is also a powerful tool for mathematical exploration and learning. In this section, we will explore some practical applications of origami in mathematics.

#### 3.1c.1 Origami and Geometry

One of the most common applications of origami is in the study of geometry. The process of folding a piece of paper involves creating lines and angles, which can be used to explore geometric concepts such as symmetry, congruence, and similarity. For example, the famous origami crane, a symbol of peace and good fortune in Japanese culture, is a perfect example of symmetry in action. The crane is folded along a single axis of symmetry, resulting in a perfectly balanced and symmetrical shape.

#### 3.1c.2 Origami and Algebra

Origami can also be used to illustrate algebraic concepts. For instance, the process of folding a piece of paper can be represented using algebraic equations. The number of folds and the angles at which they are made can be represented using variables, and the resulting shape can be described using equations. This can be a powerful tool for visualizing and understanding abstract algebraic concepts.

#### 3.1c.3 Origami and Computer Science

In recent years, origami has found applications in computer science, particularly in the field of computational geometry. The process of folding a piece of paper can be represented as a series of transformations, which can be used to create complex shapes and patterns. This has led to the development of algorithms for generating origami designs, which have applications in fields such as robotics and architecture.

#### 3.1c.4 Origami and Art

Finally, origami is not just a tool for mathematical exploration, but also a form of art. The intricate and delicate designs created through origami can be used to create beautiful and meaningful works of art. This has led to the development of origami as a contemporary art form, with artists creating large-scale installations and sculptures using origami techniques.

In conclusion, origami is a powerful tool for exploring and understanding mathematics. Its practical applications range from geometry and algebra to computer science and art, making it a valuable tool for learning and creativity.




### Subsection: 3.2a Basic Concepts

In this section, we will delve into the fundamental concepts of origami, including the basic folds and the mathematical principles behind them.

#### 3.2a.1 Basic Folds

The most basic fold in origami is the valley fold, where the paper is folded along a valley, or a line where the paper is thicker than the surrounding areas. This fold is represented by the symbol `V` and is the foundation for many more complex folds.

Another basic fold is the mountain fold, where the paper is folded along a mountain, or a line where the paper is thinner than the surrounding areas. This fold is represented by the symbol `M` and is the inverse of the valley fold.

#### 3.2a.2 Symmetry

Symmetry is a fundamental concept in origami. It refers to the balance and harmony in a design, where one side is a mirror image of the other. In origami, symmetry is often achieved through the use of axis of symmetry, where the paper is folded along a line that divides it into two equal halves.

#### 3.2a.3 Angles

Angles play a crucial role in origami. They determine the shape and orientation of the folds. In origami, angles are often measured in radians, with a full rotation being equivalent to $2\pi$ radians. The angle of a fold is determined by the ratio of the length of the paper along the fold to the length of the paper perpendicular to the fold.

#### 3.2a.4 Transformations

Transformations are the mathematical representation of the process of folding a piece of paper. They involve a series of rotations, translations, and reflections that transform the paper from its original state to the final shape. These transformations can be represented using matrices, which can be used to generate complex origami designs.

#### 3.2a.5 Theorems

Theorems are mathematical statements that describe the properties of origami designs. For example, the angle sum theorem states that the sum of the angles at a vertex in a folded paper is always equal to $180^\circ$. This theorem is fundamental to the design of origami models.

In the next section, we will explore some of these concepts in more detail, and discuss how they are used in the design and construction of origami models.

## Chapter: Chapter 4: Polyhedra and Tilings

### Introduction

In this chapter, we delve into the fascinating world of polyhedra and tilings, two fundamental concepts in the realm of geometric folding algorithms. Polyhedra, as we know, are three-dimensional geometric objects bounded by flat polygonal surfaces. Tilings, on the other hand, are two-dimensional patterns that cover a surface without any gaps or overlaps. 

We will explore the mathematical foundations of these concepts, their properties, and how they are interconnected. The chapter will also shed light on the role of polyhedra and tilings in the broader context of geometric folding algorithms. 

The exploration of polyhedra and tilings is not just a theoretical exercise. It has practical applications in various fields such as architecture, design, and computer graphics. Understanding these concepts can help us create more efficient and effective geometric folding algorithms. 

We will also discuss the relationship between polyhedra and tilings, and how they can be used together to create complex geometric structures. This will involve a deep dive into the concept of polyhedral tilings, where polyhedra are used to tile a surface. 

Throughout the chapter, we will use mathematical notation to express these concepts. For instance, we might denote a polyhedron as `$P$` and its vertices as `$v_1, v_2, ..., v_n$`. Similarly, we might denote a tiling as `$T$` and its tiles as `$t_1, t_2, ..., t_m$`. 

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of polyhedra and tilings, their properties, and their role in geometric folding algorithms. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the more advanced topics covered in the subsequent chapters.




### Subsection: 3.5a Basic Concepts

Geometric algebra is a mathematical system that combines the concepts of geometry and algebra. It provides a powerful framework for understanding and manipulating geometric objects, making it a valuable tool in the study of origami. In this section, we will introduce some of the basic concepts of geometric algebra and how they apply to origami.

#### 3.5a.1 Points, Lines, and Planes

In geometric algebra, a point is represented as a scalar, a line is represented as a vector, and a plane is represented as a bivector. These geometric objects are represented as mathematical entities, and operations on them are performed using the rules of algebra.

For example, consider two points, $P$ and $Q$, and a line $L$. The distance between $P$ and $Q$ can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the distance between two points is the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences of their coordinates. This can be represented mathematically as:

$$
d(P, Q) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (Q_i - P_i)^2}
$$

where $P_i$ and $Q_i$ are the coordinates of $P$ and $Q$ respectively, and $n$ is the dimension of the space.

#### 3.5a.2 Transformations

Transformations are operations that change the position, orientation, or size of a geometric object. In geometric algebra, transformations are represented as matrices. For example, a translation of a point $P$ by a vector $v$ can be represented as:

$$
T_v(P) = P + v
$$

where $T_v$ is the translation operator.

#### 3.5a.3 Folding

Folding is a fundamental operation in origami. It involves taking a sheet of paper and bending it along a line to create a crease. In geometric algebra, folding can be represented as a transformation. For example, a fold along a line $L$ can be represented as:

$$
F_L(P) = \frac{P \cdot L}{L^2} L
$$

where $P$ is a point on the paper, $L$ is the line along which the paper is folded, and $\cdot$ denotes the dot product.

#### 3.5a.4 Unfolding

Unfolding is the inverse operation of folding. It involves taking a folded paper and straightening it out. In geometric algebra, unfolding can be represented as a transformation. For example, an unfold along a line $L$ can be represented as:

$$
U_L(P) = \frac{P \cdot L}{L^2} L + (1 - \frac{P \cdot L}{L^2}) P
$$

where $P$ is a point on the paper, $L$ is the line along which the paper is folded, and $\cdot$ denotes the dot product.

#### 3.5a.5 Symmetry

Symmetry is a fundamental concept in origami. It refers to the property of an object where it looks the same from different directions. In geometric algebra, symmetry can be represented as a transformation. For example, a reflection across a line $L$ can be represented as:

$$
S_L(P) = 2 \frac{P \cdot L}{L^2} L - P
$$

where $P$ is a point on the paper, $L$ is the line across which the paper is reflected, and $\cdot$ denotes the dot product.

In the next section, we will explore how these concepts are applied in the study of origami.




#### 3.5b Algebraic Techniques

In addition to the basic concepts of geometric algebra, there are several algebraic techniques that are particularly useful in the study of origami. These techniques allow us to manipulate and solve complex geometric problems in a systematic and efficient manner.

#### 3.5b.1 Gaussian Elimination

Gaussian elimination is a method for solving systems of linear equations. It involves transforming the system into an upper triangular form, where the solution to the system can be easily found. In the context of origami, Gaussian elimination can be used to solve problems involving the folding and unfolding of paper.

For example, consider a piece of paper with three creases, as shown in the figure below. We can represent the positions of the creases as vectors $a$, $b$, and $c$. The goal is to find the position of a point $P$ on the paper such that the distances from $P$ to the creases are equal.

![Piece of paper with three creases](https://i.imgur.com/6JZJjJt.png)

We can represent this problem as a system of linear equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
|P - a|^2 &= |P - b|^2 \\
|P - b|^2 &= |P - c|^2 \\
|P - c|^2 &= |P - a|^2
\end{align*}
$$

We can then use Gaussian elimination to solve this system and find the position of $P$.

#### 3.5b.2 Line Integral Convolution

Line Integral Convolution (LIC) is a numerical method for solving partial differential equations. It involves integrating a function along a curve, and has been applied to a wide range of problems since it was first published in 1993.

In the context of origami, LIC can be used to solve problems involving the folding and unfolding of paper. For example, consider a piece of paper with a single crease, as shown in the figure below. We can represent the position of the crease as a vector $a$. The goal is to find the position of a point $P$ on the paper such that the distance from $P$ to the crease is equal to a constant $c$.

![Piece of paper with a single crease](https://i.imgur.com/6JZJjJt.png)

We can represent this problem as a partial differential equation:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = 0
$$

where $u(x, y)$ is the distance from the point $(x, y)$ to the crease. We can then use LIC to solve this equation and find the position of $P$.

#### 3.5b.3 Shifting nth Root Algorithm

The Shifting nth Root Algorithm is a method for finding the nth root of a number. It involves iteratively shifting the root towards the number itself, and has been shown to be efficient for finding the nth root of a number.

In the context of origami, the Shifting nth Root Algorithm can be used to solve problems involving the folding and unfolding of paper. For example, consider a piece of paper with a single crease, as shown in the figure below. We can represent the position of the crease as a vector $a$. The goal is to find the position of a point $P$ on the paper such that the distance from $P$ to the crease is equal to the nth root of a constant $c$.

![Piece of paper with a single crease](https://i.imgur.com/6JZJjJt.png)

We can represent this problem as a system of linear equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
|P - a|^n &= c \\
|P - a|^n &= c \\
|P - a|^n &= c
\end{align*}
$$

We can then use the Shifting nth Root Algorithm to solve this system and find the position of $P$.

#### 3.5b.4 Remez Algorithm

The Remez Algorithm is a method for finding the best approximation of a function by a polynomial. It involves iteratively improving the approximation until it reaches a desired level of accuracy.

In the context of origami, the Remez Algorithm can be used to solve problems involving the folding and unfolding of paper. For example, consider a piece of paper with a single crease, as shown in the figure below. We can represent the position of the crease as a vector $a$. The goal is to find the position of a point $P$ on the paper such that the distance from $P$ to the crease is equal to the best approximation of a function $f(x)$ by a polynomial $p(x)$.

![Piece of paper with a single crease](https://i.imgur.com/6JZJjJt.png)

We can represent this problem as a system of linear equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
|P - a|^2 &= f(x) \\
|P - a|^2 &= f(x) \\
|P - a|^2 &= f(x)
\end{align*}
$$

We can then use the Remez Algorithm to solve this system and find the position of $P$.

#### 3.5b.5 Bcache

Bcache is a method for caching data in a computer system. It involves storing frequently used data in a cache, and has been shown to be efficient for improving the performance of a system.

In the context of origami, Bcache can be used to solve problems involving the folding and unfolding of paper. For example, consider a piece of paper with a single crease, as shown in the figure below. We can represent the position of the crease as a vector $a$. The goal is to find the position of a point $P$ on the paper such that the distance from $P$ to the crease is equal to the data stored in a cache $b$.

![Piece of paper with a single crease](https://i.imgur.com/6JZJjJt.png)

We can represent this problem as a system of linear equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
|P - a|^2 &= b \\
|P - a|^2 &= b \\
|P - a|^2 &= b
\end{align*}
$$

We can then use Bcache to solve this system and find the position of $P$.

#### 3.5b.6 Implicit Data Structure

An implicit data structure is a data structure that is not explicitly defined, but can be constructed from other data. In the context of origami, implicit data structures can be used to solve problems involving the folding and unfolding of paper.

For example, consider a piece of paper with a single crease, as shown in the figure below. We can represent the position of the crease as a vector $a$. The goal is to find the position of a point $P$ on the paper such that the distance from $P$ to the crease is equal to the data stored in an implicit data structure $b$.

![Piece of paper with a single crease](https://i.imgur.com/6JZJjJt.png)

We can represent this problem as a system of linear equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
|P - a|^2 &= b \\
|P - a|^2 &= b \\
|P - a|^2 &= b
\end{align*}
$$

We can then use implicit data structures to solve this system and find the position of $P$.

#### 3.5b.7 Multiset

A multiset is a generalization of a set, where each element can appear more than once. In the context of origami, multisets can be used to solve problems involving the folding and unfolding of paper.

For example, consider a piece of paper with a single crease, as shown in the figure below. We can represent the position of the crease as a vector $a$. The goal is to find the position of a point $P$ on the paper such that the distance from $P$ to the crease is equal to the number of elements in a multiset $b$.

![Piece of paper with a single crease](https://i.imgur.com/6JZJjJt.png)

We can represent this problem as a system of linear equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
|P - a|^2 &= b \\
|P - a|^2 &= b \\
|P - a|^2 &= b
\end{align*}
$$

We can then use multisets to solve this system and find the position of $P$.

#### 3.5b.8 Variants

Some modifications of the algorithm are present in the literature. These variants can be used to solve different types of problems involving the folding and unfolding of paper.

For example, consider a piece of paper with a single crease, as shown in the figure below. We can represent the position of the crease as a vector $a$. The goal is to find the position of a point $P$ on the paper such that the distance from $P$ to the crease is equal to the result of a variant of the algorithm $b$.

![Piece of paper with a single crease](https://i.imgur.com/6JZJjJt.png)

We can represent this problem as a system of linear equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
|P - a|^2 &= b \\
|P - a|^2 &= b \\
|P - a|^2 &= b
\end{align*}
$$

We can then use the variant of the algorithm to solve this system and find the position of $P$.

#### 3.5b.9 Performance

On each iteration, the most time-consuming task is to select $\beta$. We know that there are $B$ possible values, so we can find $\beta$ using $O(\log(B))$ comparisons. Each comparison will require evaluating $(B y +\beta)^n - B^n y^n$. In the "k"th iteration, $y$ has $k$ digits, and the polynomial can be evaluated with $2 n - 4$ multiplications of up to $k(n-1)$ digits and $n - 2$ additions of up to $k(n-1)$ digits, once we know the powers of $y$ and $\beta$ up through $n-1$ for $y$ and $n$ for $\beta$. $\beta$ has a restricted range, so we can get the powers of $\beta$ in constant time. We can get the powers of $y$ with $n-2$ multiplications of up to $k(n-1)$ digits. Assuming $n$-digit multiplication takes time $O(n^2)$ and addition takes time $O(n)$, we take time $O(k^2 n^2)$.

#### 3.5b.10 Conclusion

In this section, we have explored various algebraic techniques that can be used to solve problems involving the folding and unfolding of paper. These techniques include Gaussian elimination, Line Integral Convolution, Shifting nth Root Algorithm, Remez Algorithm, Bcache, Implicit Data Structure, Multiset, and Variants.

### Section: 4.1 Types of Polyhedra:

Polyhedra are three-dimensional geometric objects that are bounded by flat polygonal surfaces. They are a fundamental concept in mathematics, with applications in various fields such as architecture, engineering, and computer graphics. In this section, we will explore the different types of polyhedra and their unique characteristics.

#### 4.1a Definition and Classification

A polyhedron is a three-dimensional object that is bounded by flat polygonal surfaces. It is a higher-dimensional generalization of a polygon, which is a two-dimensional object bounded by straight lines. The term "polyhedron" is derived from the Greek words "poly" meaning "many" and "hedra" meaning "seat", referring to the multiple flat surfaces of the object.

Polyhedra can be classified into two main categories: convex and non-convex. A convex polyhedron is one in which all of its vertices, edges, and faces are contained within a single plane. In other words, all of its angles are less than 180 degrees. On the other hand, a non-convex polyhedron has at least one vertex, edge, or face that is not contained within a single plane, resulting in at least one angle greater than 180 degrees.

Convex polyhedra have been extensively studied in mathematics, and their properties have been well-documented. They have a wide range of applications, from architecture and engineering to computer graphics and game design. Non-convex polyhedra, on the other hand, have been less studied and have fewer applications. However, they still have important properties that make them useful in certain fields.

#### 4.1b Convex Polyhedra

Convex polyhedra have been studied extensively in mathematics, and their properties have been well-documented. They have a wide range of applications, from architecture and engineering to computer graphics and game design. One of the most well-known properties of convex polyhedra is that they can be represented as the intersection of half-spaces. This means that any point inside a convex polyhedron is closer to at least one of its vertices than to any of its edges or faces.

Another important property of convex polyhedra is that they can be easily unfolded into a flat surface. This is because all of their angles are less than 180 degrees, allowing for a smooth and seamless unfolding. This property is particularly useful in origami, where convex polyhedra are often used to create complex structures.

#### 4.1c Non-Convex Polyhedra

Non-convex polyhedra have been less studied and have fewer applications compared to convex polyhedra. However, they still have important properties that make them useful in certain fields. One of the most well-known properties of non-convex polyhedra is that they cannot be represented as the intersection of half-spaces. This means that any point inside a non-convex polyhedron may not be closer to any of its vertices than to its edges or faces.

Another important property of non-convex polyhedra is that they cannot be easily unfolded into a flat surface. This is because at least one of their angles is greater than 180 degrees, making it difficult to unfold the polyhedron without creating overlaps or gaps. This property is particularly challenging in origami, where non-convex polyhedra are often used to create complex structures.

In conclusion, polyhedra are three-dimensional geometric objects that are bounded by flat polygonal surfaces. They can be classified into two main categories: convex and non-convex. Convex polyhedra have been extensively studied and have a wide range of applications, while non-convex polyhedra have fewer applications but still have important properties that make them useful in certain fields. In the next section, we will explore the different types of polyhedra in more detail and discuss their unique characteristics.

#### 4.1b Convex Polyhedra

Convex polyhedra have been studied extensively in mathematics, and their properties have been well-documented. They have a wide range of applications, from architecture and engineering to computer graphics and game design. One of the most well-known properties of convex polyhedra is that they can be represented as the intersection of half-spaces. This means that any point inside a convex polyhedron can be represented as the intersection of all the half-spaces that make up its boundaries. This property is useful in many applications, such as in the design of 3D objects in computer graphics.

Another important property of convex polyhedra is that they have a unique vertex, edge, and face structure. This means that the number of vertices, edges, and faces of a convex polyhedron is fixed and does not depend on its orientation or position in space. This property is useful in the study of convex polyhedra, as it allows for the classification and comparison of different polyhedra.

#### 4.1c Non-Convex Polyhedra

Non-convex polyhedra have been less studied compared to convex polyhedra, but they still have important properties that make them useful in certain fields. One of the main differences between convex and non-convex polyhedra is that non-convex polyhedra do not have a unique vertex, edge, and face structure. This means that the number of vertices, edges, and faces of a non-convex polyhedron can vary depending on its orientation and position in space.

One of the most well-known properties of non-convex polyhedra is that they can be represented as the intersection of convex polyhedra. This means that any non-convex polyhedron can be broken down into a set of convex polyhedra. This property is useful in the study of non-convex polyhedra, as it allows for the classification and comparison of different polyhedra.

#### 4.1d Properties and Characteristics

In addition to their unique vertex, edge, and face structure, convex and non-convex polyhedra have other important properties and characteristics. For example, the sum of the angles at each vertex of a convex polyhedron is always less than 360 degrees, while the sum of the angles at each vertex of a non-convex polyhedron can be greater than 360 degrees.

Convex polyhedra also have the property of being convex in all directions, while non-convex polyhedra may only be convex in certain directions. This property is useful in the design of 3D objects, as it allows for the creation of objects with curved surfaces.

Another important characteristic of polyhedra is their symmetry. Convex polyhedra have a high degree of symmetry, with many of them being symmetric about their center of gravity. Non-convex polyhedra, on the other hand, may have lower degrees of symmetry and may not be symmetric about their center of gravity.

In conclusion, polyhedra are three-dimensional geometric objects that have been extensively studied in mathematics. They have a wide range of applications and properties that make them useful in various fields. Convex polyhedra have been studied more extensively than non-convex polyhedra, but both types have important properties and characteristics that make them useful in different applications.

In this section, we will explore the basic concepts of symmetry in polyhedra. Symmetry is a fundamental concept in mathematics and is defined as a property of a shape or object that remains unchanged under certain operations, such as rotation, reflection, or inversion. In the context of polyhedra, symmetry refers to the presence of identical or similar shapes when viewed from different angles or directions.

#### 4.4a.1 Symmetry Axis

A symmetry axis is a line or point about which a polyhedron is symmetric. This means that when the polyhedron is rotated or reflected about this axis, it will appear the same. For example, a cube has four symmetry axes, one for each of its four 90-degree rotations.

#### 4.4a.2 Symmetry Plane

A symmetry plane is a flat surface about which a polyhedron is symmetric. This means that when the polyhedron is reflected across this plane, it will appear the same. For example, a cube has three symmetry planes, one for each of its three 180-degree rotations.

#### 4.4a.3 Symmetry Order

The symmetry order of a polyhedron refers to the number of symmetry operations that leave the polyhedron unchanged. For example, a cube has a symmetry order of 432, as it has four 90-degree rotations, three 180-degree rotations, and three reflections.

#### 4.4a.4 Symmetry Group

The symmetry group of a polyhedron is the set of all symmetry operations that leave the polyhedron unchanged. For example, the symmetry group of a cube is the dihedral group D4, which consists of all the rotations and reflections that leave the cube unchanged.

#### 4.4a.5 Symmetry and Folding

Symmetry plays a crucial role in the folding of polyhedra. The symmetry of a polyhedron can affect the folding sequence, stability, and efficiency of the final structure. For example, a polyhedron with a high symmetry order may have a simpler folding sequence, as there are fewer unique shapes to create. Additionally, the presence of symmetry axes or planes can help stabilize the folded structure, as they provide points or surfaces for the polyhedron to rest on.

In the next section, we will explore some practical applications of symmetry in polyhedra, including its use in origami design and architecture.

Group theory is a mathematical tool used to study symmetry in polyhedra. It allows us to classify the symmetry operations of a polyhedron and determine its symmetry group. This information can then be used to analyze the symmetry of the polyhedron and its implications for folding.

For example, the symmetry group of a cube, D4, can be represented as a group of four rotations and three reflections. This group has a total of 432 elements, each representing a unique symmetry operation. By studying the properties of this group, we can gain insight into the symmetry of the cube and how it affects the folding process.

#### 4.4b.2 Symmetry Analysis using Geometric Invariants

Geometric invariants are mathematical quantities that remain unchanged under symmetry operations. They can be used to identify the symmetry of a polyhedron and determine its symmetry group.

For example, the cube has three geometric invariants: the length of its edges, the angle between its edges, and the volume of its interior. These invariants remain unchanged under symmetry operations, and by studying them, we can determine the symmetry of the cube and its implications for folding.

#### 4.4b.3 Symmetry Analysis using Computer Algorithms

Computer algorithms can also be used to analyze the symmetry of polyhedra. These algorithms use mathematical techniques to identify the symmetry operations of a polyhedron and determine its symmetry group.

For example, the Symmetry Analysis Algorithm (SAA) is a computer algorithm that uses group theory and geometric invariants to analyze the symmetry of polyhedra. It can be used to study the symmetry of complex polyhedra and determine their symmetry groups.

### Subsection: 4.5a Definition and Classification

In the previous sections, we have explored the concept of symmetry in polyhedra and its practical applications. In this section, we will delve into the classification of polyhedra, specifically focusing on regular and semi-regular polyhedra.

#### 4.5a.1 Regular Polyhedra

A regular polyhedron is a polyhedron in which all faces are congruent regular polygons, all vertices are the same distance from the center of the polyhedron, and all edges have the same length. The five regular polyhedra are the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron.

The tetrahedron is a polyhedron with four triangular faces. The cube is a polyhedron with six square faces. The octahedron is a polyhedron with eight triangular faces. The dodecahedron is a polyhedron with twelve pentagonal faces. The icosahedron is a polyhedron with twenty triangular faces.

#### 4.5a.2 Semi-Regular Polyhedra

A semi-regular polyhedron is a polyhedron in which all vertices are the same distance from the center of the polyhedron, all edges have the same length, but not all faces are congruent regular polygons. There are four semi-regular polyhedra: the cuboctahedron, icosidodecahedron, rhombicuboctahedron, and rhombicosidodecahedron.

The cuboctahedron is a polyhedron with eight triangular faces and six square faces. The icosidodecahedron is a polyhedron with twelve pentagonal faces and ten hexagonal faces. The rhombicuboctahedron is a polyhedron with eight square faces and eight hexagonal faces. The rhombicosidodecahedron is a polyhedron with twelve pentagonal faces and twelve hexagonal faces.

#### 4.5a.3 Classification of Polyhedra

The classification of polyhedra is based on the number of vertices, edges, and faces. Regular and semi-regular polyhedra are classified based on their symmetry properties. The regular polyhedra are classified based on the number of faces, while the semi-regular polyhedra are classified based on the number of faces and the type of faces.

The classification of polyhedra is important in many fields, including mathematics, architecture, and computer graphics. In the next section, we will explore the properties of regular and semi-regular polyhedra and their applications.




### Subsection: 4.5b Properties and Characteristics

In this section, we will explore the properties and characteristics of regular and semi-regular polyhedra. These properties are crucial in understanding the behavior of these polyhedra and their applications in various fields.

#### 4.5b.1 Regular Polyhedra Properties

Regular polyhedra have several unique properties that set them apart from other polyhedra. These properties include:

1. **Symmetry**: Regular polyhedra exhibit a high degree of symmetry. This means that they look the same from any direction. This property is a direct result of the fact that all faces, vertices, and edges are congruent.

2. **Duality**: Each regular polyhedron has a dual polyhedron. The dual of a regular polyhedron is another regular polyhedron with the property that the vertices of the original polyhedron correspond to the faces of the dual, and vice versa.

3. **Face-Vertex Relationship**: The number of faces of a regular polyhedron is always equal to the number of vertices, multiplied by the number of edges. This relationship is given by the formula `$n = (v \times e) / 2$`, where `$n$` is the number of faces, `$v$` is the number of vertices, and `$e$` is the number of edges.

4. **Edge-Face Relationship**: The number of edges of a regular polyhedron is always equal to the number of faces, multiplied by the number of vertices. This relationship is given by the formula `$e = (n \times v) / 2$`, where `$e$` is the number of edges, `$n$` is the number of faces, and `$v$` is the number of vertices.

#### 4.5b.2 Semi-Regular Polyhedra Properties

Semi-regular polyhedra also have unique properties that set them apart from regular polyhedra. These properties include:

1. **Symmetry**: Like regular polyhedra, semi-regular polyhedra also exhibit a high degree of symmetry. However, unlike regular polyhedra, not all faces are congruent.

2. **Duality**: Each semi-regular polyhedron has a dual polyhedron. The dual of a semi-regular polyhedron is another semi-regular polyhedron with the property that the vertices of the original polyhedron correspond to the faces of the dual, and vice versa.

3. **Face-Vertex Relationship**: The number of faces of a semi-regular polyhedron is always equal to the number of vertices, multiplied by the number of edges. This relationship is given by the formula `$n = (v \times e) / 2$`, where `$n$` is the number of faces, `$v$` is the number of vertices, and `$e$` is the number of edges.

4. **Edge-Face Relationship**: The number of edges of a semi-regular polyhedron is always equal to the number of faces, multiplied by the number of vertices. This relationship is given by the formula `$e = (n \times v) / 2$`, where `$e$` is the number of edges, `$n$` is the number of faces, and `$v$` is the number of vertices.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of these properties in various fields.

### Subsection: 4.6a Definition and Classification

In the previous section, we explored the properties and characteristics of regular and semi-regular polyhedra. In this section, we will delve deeper into the classification of polyhedra, specifically focusing on convex and non-convex polyhedra.

#### 4.6a.1 Convex Polyhedra

A convex polyhedron is a polyhedron in which all the vertices, edges, and faces are convex. In other words, a convex polyhedron is a polyhedron that does not have any concave surfaces or angles. This property is crucial in many applications, as it allows for the easy construction of the polyhedron and the ability to see inside the polyhedron.

The simplest example of a convex polyhedron is a cube. All of its vertices, edges, and faces are convex, making it a simple and easy-to-construct polyhedron.

#### 4.6a.2 Non-Convex Polyhedra

On the other hand, a non-convex polyhedron is a polyhedron that does not satisfy the definition of a convex polyhedron. This means that at least one of its vertices, edges, or faces is concave. Non-convex polyhedra are more complex and difficult to construct compared to convex polyhedra.

An example of a non-convex polyhedron is an octahedron. While it has convex faces, its vertices and edges are concave, making it a non-convex polyhedron.

#### 4.6a.3 Classification of Polyhedra

Polyhedra can be classified into two main categories: convex and non-convex. Convex polyhedra can be further classified into regular and semi-regular polyhedra, while non-convex polyhedra can be classified into a variety of different types based on their properties.

The classification of polyhedra is crucial in understanding their properties and applications. For example, convex polyhedra are often used in 3D graphics and architecture due to their simplicity and ease of construction. Non-convex polyhedra, on the other hand, are used in more complex applications such as in the design of microprocessors.

In the next section, we will explore the properties and applications of convex and non-convex polyhedra in more detail.




### Subsection: 4.6b Properties and Characteristics

In this section, we will explore the properties and characteristics of convex and non-convex polyhedra. These properties are crucial in understanding the behavior of polyhedra and their applications in various fields.

Convex polyhedra have several important properties that make them useful in various applications. These properties include:

- **Simplicity:** Convex polyhedra are simple and easy to construct. This makes them ideal for applications where simplicity is crucial, such as in 3D graphics and architecture.
- **Transparency:** The vertices, edges, and faces of convex polyhedra are all convex. This allows for easy visualization and manipulation of the polyhedron.
- **Regularity:** Regular convex polyhedra have all their vertices, edges, and faces identical. This property is useful in applications where symmetry is important, such as in the design of microprocessors.

#### 4.6b.2 Non-Convex Polyhedra Properties

Non-convex polyhedra, while more complex and difficult to construct, have their own unique properties that make them useful in various applications. These properties include:

- **Complexity:** Non-convex polyhedra are more complex and difficult to construct compared to convex polyhedra. This complexity can be useful in applications where more intricate designs are required, such as in the design of microprocessors.
- **Non-Transparency:** The vertices, edges, and faces of non-convex polyhedra are not necessarily convex. This can make it more difficult to visualize and manipulate the polyhedron, but it also allows for more flexibility in design.
- **Non-Regularity:** Non-convex polyhedra do not have to be regular. This allows for a wider range of designs and applications, as the properties of each non-convex polyhedron can vary depending on its structure.

#### 4.6b.3 Comparison of Convex and Non-Convex Polyhedra

While convex polyhedra have their advantages, non-convex polyhedra offer a wider range of possibilities. Non-convex polyhedra can be more complex and difficult to construct, but this complexity can be useful in applications where more intricate designs are required. Additionally, the non-regularity of non-convex polyhedra allows for a wider range of designs and applications, as the properties of each non-convex polyhedron can vary depending on its structure.

In the next section, we will explore the folding characteristics of convex and non-convex polyhedra, and how these properties play a role in their folding behavior.

### Subsection: 5.1a Basic Concepts

In this section, we will introduce some basic concepts that are essential for understanding the computational complexity of folding algorithms. These concepts include time complexity, space complexity, and the role of geometric properties in determining the complexity of an algorithm.

#### Time Complexity

Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, as a function of the size of the input. In the context of folding algorithms, the size of the input can be measured in terms of the number of vertices, edges, or faces in a geometric object. The time complexity of an algorithm is typically expressed in terms of the Big O notation, which describes the upper bound on the running time of an algorithm as the input size approaches infinity.

For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2) will take longer to run on larger inputs, while an algorithm with a time complexity of O(nlogn) will take less time to run on larger inputs. The time complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors, including the type of fold used, the number of folds, and the complexity of the geometric object being folded.

#### Space Complexity

Space complexity is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm requires to run, as a function of the size of the input. In the context of folding algorithms, the space complexity can be affected by the number of variables and data structures used in the algorithm. For example, an algorithm that uses a large number of variables to represent the state of a fold may have a higher space complexity than an algorithm that uses fewer variables.

The space complexity of an algorithm can also be affected by the type of geometric object being folded. For example, folding a polyhedron may require more space than folding a simple polygon. Understanding the space complexity of an algorithm is crucial for determining its efficiency and scalability.

#### Geometric Properties and Complexity

The geometric properties of a fold, such as the type of fold, the number of folds, and the complexity of the geometric object being folded, can greatly impact the computational complexity of an algorithm. For example, a fold with a high degree of complexity, such as a fold with multiple layers or a fold with a complex geometric shape, may require more time and space to process.

Furthermore, the geometric properties of a fold can also affect the accuracy and precision of the final result. For example, a fold with a high degree of complexity may result in a less precise final shape, while a fold with a lower degree of complexity may result in a more precise final shape. Understanding the relationship between geometric properties and complexity is crucial for designing efficient and accurate folding algorithms.

In the next section, we will explore some specific examples of folding algorithms and their computational complexity, providing a deeper understanding of these concepts.

### Subsection: 5.1b Analysis Techniques

In this section, we will discuss some techniques for analyzing the computational complexity of folding algorithms. These techniques include the use of mathematical models, empirical testing, and algorithmic design.

#### Mathematical Models

Mathematical models can be used to predict the time and space complexity of folding algorithms. These models can be based on various mathematical concepts, such as graph theory, combinatorics, and differential geometry. For example, the time complexity of a folding algorithm can be modeled using the concept of the complexity of a graph, where the vertices represent the geometric objects being folded and the edges represent the folds between them.

#### Empirical Testing

Empirical testing involves running the algorithm on a set of test cases and measuring its performance. This can provide valuable insights into the actual time and space complexity of the algorithm, which may differ from the predicted complexity. Empirical testing can also be used to identify bottlenecks and optimize the algorithm for better performance.

#### Algorithmic Design

Algorithmic design involves designing the algorithm in a way that minimizes its time and space complexity. This can be achieved by carefully choosing the data structures used, optimizing the algorithm for specific types of geometric objects, and using techniques such as divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms.

In the next section, we will discuss some specific examples of folding algorithms and their computational complexity.

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of folding algorithms and origami. Folding algorithms are mathematical procedures that describe how to fold a piece of paper or other material into a specific shape.

### Subsection: 5.2a Basic Concepts

In this section, we will introduce some basic concepts that are essential for understanding geometric data structures. These concepts include points, lines, and polygons, as well as more advanced concepts such as convexity and concavity.

#### Points, Lines, and Polygons

A point in a geometric structure is a location in space. It is represented by its coordinates, which can be either Cartesian coordinates or polar coordinates. A line is a straight path that extends infinitely in both directions. It is defined by two points, known as the endpoints of the line. A polygon is a closed shape that is bounded by straight lines. It is defined by its vertices, which are the points where the lines meet.

#### Convexity and Concavity

Convexity and concavity are important concepts in computational geometry. A convex polygon is a polygon in which all interior angles are less than 180 degrees. A concave polygon is a polygon in which at least one interior angle is greater than 180 degrees. These concepts are important for understanding the properties of geometric structures and for designing efficient algorithms for manipulating them.

#### Geometric Data Structures

A geometric data structure is a data structure that represents a geometric object, such as a point, line, or polygon. These data structures are essential for representing and manipulating geometric objects in computational geometry. They are used to store information about the object, such as its coordinates or its properties, and to perform operations on the object, such as moving it or changing its shape.

#### Geometric Transformations

Geometric transformations are operations that change the position, orientation, or size of a geometric object. These transformations are essential for manipulating geometric objects in computational geometry. They include translations, rotations, and scalings, as well as more advanced transformations such as shears and projections.

#### Geometric Folding Algorithms

Geometric folding algorithms are algorithms that create complex structures by folding simple geometric shapes. These algorithms are based on the principles of symmetry and recursion, and have been used to create intricate origami designs. They are an important tool for understanding the properties of geometric structures and for designing efficient algorithms for manipulating them.

### Subsection: 5.2b Data Structure Design

In this section, we will discuss the design of geometric data structures for folding algorithms. The design of these data structures is crucial for the efficient implementation of folding algorithms, as it determines the time and space complexity of the algorithms.

#### Implicit Data Structure

An implicit data structure is a data structure that represents a geometric object without explicitly storing all of its data. Instead, the data is computed on demand, based on a set of rules or constraints. This approach can be particularly useful for representing large or complex geometric objects, as it reduces the amount of memory required to store the data.

One example of an implicit data structure is the implicit k-d tree, which is used to represent high-dimensional data. This data structure divides the data space into a grid of cells, and stores a representative point for each cell. The representative points are used to compute the data on demand, based on a set of rules or constraints.

#### Persistent Data Structure

A persistent data structure is a data structure that maintains its structure and data even after modifications have been made to it. This is particularly useful for geometric data structures, as it allows for the efficient representation of geometric objects that undergo frequent modifications.

One example of a persistent data structure is the persistent k-d tree, which is a variant of the implicit k-d tree. This data structure maintains a history of all previous versions of the data, allowing for efficient access to past versions of the data.

#### A Combination

A combination of the techniques of fat nodes and path copying can be used to achieve O(1) access slowdown and O(1) modification space and time complexity. This approach involves storing a modification box in each node of the data structure, which can hold one modification to the node and a timestamp for when that modification was applied.

The modification box is checked when a node is accessed, and its timestamp is compared against the access time. If the modification box is empty, or the access time is before the modification time, then the modification box is ignored and only the normal part of the node is considered. If the access time is after the modification time, then the value in the modification box is used, overriding that value in the node.

Modifying a node works by making a copy of the node, but using only the latest values. The modification is performed directly on the new node, without using the modification box. Finally, this change is cascaded to the node's parent, just like path copying.

#### Conclusion

The design of geometric data structures is a crucial aspect of implementing folding algorithms. By carefully considering the properties of the data and the operations that will be performed on it, we can design efficient and effective data structures that support the efficient implementation of folding algorithms.

### Subsection: 5.3a Basic Concepts

In this section, we will introduce some basic concepts that are essential for understanding efficient algorithms for folding. These concepts include the use of implicit data structures, the concept of fat nodes, and the technique of path copying.

#### Implicit Data Structures

Implicit data structures are a type of geometric data structure that are particularly useful in folding algorithms. They allow for the efficient representation of complex objects without the need to store all the data explicitly. This is particularly important in folding algorithms, where the objects can be large and complex.

The key idea behind implicit data structures is to represent an object by a function that maps points in the object to points in a simpler, often lower-dimensional, space. This function is typically defined by a set of constraints, such as linear or polynomial equations. The advantage of this representation is that it allows for efficient storage and manipulation of the object, while still providing a complete description of the object.

#### Fat Nodes

Fat nodes are a technique used in graph algorithms to represent a graph in a more compact form. In the context of folding algorithms, fat nodes can be used to represent the folding process as a graph, where the nodes represent the states of the folding process and the edges represent the transitions between these states.

The key idea behind fat nodes is to represent a node in the graph by a set of attributes, rather than by a single value. This allows for a more flexible representation of the graph, which can be particularly useful in folding algorithms, where the folding process can involve a large number of states and transitions.

#### Path Copying

Path copying is a technique used in graph algorithms to duplicate a path in a graph. In the context of folding algorithms, path copying can be used to duplicate a folding process, allowing for the efficient manipulation of the folding process.

The key idea behind path copying is to represent a path in the graph by a set of vertices and edges, rather than by a single path. This allows for a more flexible representation of the path, which can be particularly useful in folding algorithms, where the folding process can involve a large number of states and transitions.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into these concepts and explore how they can be used to develop efficient algorithms for folding.

#### The Folding Process as a Graph

The folding process can be represented as a graph, where the nodes represent the states of the folding process and the edges represent the transitions between these states. This representation can be particularly useful in the development of efficient algorithms for folding.

The key idea behind representing the folding process as a graph is to capture the structure of the folding process in a way that allows for efficient manipulation of the process. This can be particularly important in situations where the folding process involves a large number of states and transitions.

### Subsection: 5.3c Applications and Examples

In this section, we will explore some practical applications and examples of efficient algorithms for folding. These examples will illustrate how the concepts of implicit data structures, fat nodes, and path copying can be applied in real-world scenarios.

#### Folding Algorithms in Origami

Origami, the traditional Japanese art of paper folding, provides a rich context for the application of folding algorithms. The process of creating an origami model involves a series of folds, each of which can be represented as a state in a folding graph. The transitions between these states can be represented by edges in the graph.

In the context of origami, implicit data structures can be particularly useful. For example, the origami model can be represented as a function that maps points in the flat paper to points in the three-dimensional origami model. This function can be defined by a set of constraints, such as the angles at which the paper is folded.

Fat nodes can also be useful in origami. For example, the state of the paper before a particular fold can be represented as a fat node, with attributes such as the location of the fold and the angle of the fold.

Path copying can be used to duplicate a sequence of folds in origami. This can be particularly useful when creating multiple copies of the same origami model.

### Subsection: 5.3b Algorithm Design

In this section, we will discuss the design of efficient algorithms for folding. We will focus on the design of the Remez algorithm, a popular algorithm for finding the best approximation of a function by a polynomial.

#### Remez Algorithm

The Remez algorithm is a variant of the A* algorithm, which is known for its efficiency in finding the shortest path in a graph. The Remez algorithm shares many of the properties of A*, but it is particularly suited for finding the best approximation of a function by a polynomial.

The key idea behind the Remez algorithm is to use a binary search to find the best approximation. This is done by dividing the interval into two subintervals, and recursively finding the best approximation in each subinterval. The algorithm terminates when the subintervals become small enough, and the best approximation is chosen from the two subintervals.

The Remez algorithm can be implemented using the implicit k-d tree data structure, which allows for efficient storage and manipulation of the interval subdivision. This data structure is particularly useful in the context of the Remez algorithm, as it allows for the efficient computation of the best approximation.

#### Complexity of the Remez Algorithm

The complexity of the Remez algorithm depends on the size of the implicit k-d tree. Given an implicit k-d tree spanned over an k-dimensional grid with n gridcells, the complexity of the Remez algorithm is O(n^k). This is because the algorithm needs to perform O(n^k) operations to find the best approximation.

The Remez algorithm also has a time complexity of O(n^k), which is due to the fact that the algorithm needs to perform O(n^k) operations to find the best approximation. This complexity can be reduced by using a more efficient data structure, such as the implicit k-d tree, which allows for the efficient storage and manipulation of the interval subdivision.

#### Performance of the Remez Algorithm

The performance of the Remez algorithm can be improved by using a more efficient data structure, such as the implicit k-d tree. This data structure allows for the efficient storage and manipulation of the interval subdivision, which can significantly improve the performance of the algorithm.

Furthermore, the Remez algorithm can be optimized by using the concept of fat nodes, which allows for a more flexible representation of the graph. This can be particularly useful in the context of the Remez algorithm, as it allows for the efficient manipulation of the interval subdivision.

In conclusion, the Remez algorithm is a powerful tool for finding the best approximation of a function by a polynomial. By using efficient data structures and techniques, such as the implicit k-d tree and fat nodes, the performance of the Remez algorithm can be significantly improved.




### Subsection: 5.3c Practical Applications

In this section, we will explore some practical applications of the Remez algorithm and other efficient algorithms for folding. These applications demonstrate the versatility and usefulness of these algorithms in various fields.

#### Folding in Origami

One of the most well-known applications of folding algorithms is in the art of origami. Origami is the traditional Japanese art of paper folding, and it involves creating complex shapes and figures from a single sheet of paper. The Remez algorithm, with its ability to find the best approximation of a function, can be used to create precise folds in origami designs.

For example, consider the task of folding a sheet of paper into a perfect square. This can be achieved by using the Remez algorithm to find the best approximation of the square root function. The algorithm can then be used to determine the optimal folding points, resulting in a perfectly square piece of paper.

#### Folding in Polyhedra

Another practical application of folding algorithms is in the field of polyhedra. A polyhedron is a geometric object in three-dimensional space that is bounded by flat polygonal surfaces. The Remez algorithm can be used to fold a polyhedron into a smaller, more manageable size.

For instance, consider the task of folding a cube into a smaller, more compact shape. The Remez algorithm can be used to find the best approximation of the cube root function, which can then be used to determine the optimal folding points. This results in a smaller, more manageable cube that can be easily handled and manipulated.

#### Folding in Computational Geometry

Folding algorithms also have applications in the field of computational geometry. Computational geometry is the study of algorithms for solving geometric problems, and it involves tasks such as finding the intersection of two lines or determining the convex hull of a set of points.

The Remez algorithm can be used in computational geometry to perform tasks such as finding the best approximation of a line or determining the convex hull of a set of points. This can be particularly useful in applications such as robotics, where precise and efficient folding algorithms are necessary for manipulating objects in three-dimensional space.

## Chapter 6: Geometric Folding Algorithms: Linkages, Origami, Polyhedra




### Section: 5.5 Topology and Folding:

In this section, we will explore the relationship between topology and folding, and how topological concepts can be applied to the design and analysis of folding algorithms.

#### 5.5a Basic Concepts

Topology is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties of geometric objects that are preserved under continuous deformations. In the context of folding algorithms, topology plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of folds and how they can be manipulated to create complex structures.

One of the key concepts in topology is the notion of a topological invariant. A topological invariant is a property of a geometric object that remains unchanged under continuous deformations. In the context of folding algorithms, topological invariants can be used to classify and distinguish different folds.

For example, consider a simple square piece of paper. If we fold it in half along the diagonal, we create a triangle. This fold can be described using a topological invariant known as the Euler characteristic. The Euler characteristic of a triangle is 1, while the Euler characteristic of a square is 0. This difference in Euler characteristic can be used to distinguish between the two folds.

Another important concept in topology is the notion of a topological equivalence. Two folds are said to be topologically equivalent if they can be continuously deformed into each other. This concept is particularly useful in the design of folding algorithms, as it allows us to simplify the design process by focusing on topologically equivalent folds.

In addition to topological invariants and equivalences, topology also provides tools for analyzing the behavior of folds under different transformations. For example, the concept of a topological transformation can be used to understand how a fold changes under a continuous deformation. This can be particularly useful in the design of folding algorithms, as it allows us to predict how a fold will behave under different transformations.

In the next section, we will explore some practical applications of topology and folding in various fields. These applications demonstrate the versatility and usefulness of these concepts in solving real-world problems.

#### 5.5b Topological Invariants

Topological invariants are fundamental concepts in topology that play a crucial role in the design and analysis of folding algorithms. As mentioned earlier, a topological invariant is a property of a geometric object that remains unchanged under continuous deformations. In the context of folding algorithms, topological invariants can be used to classify and distinguish different folds.

One of the most commonly used topological invariants is the Euler characteristic. The Euler characteristic of a geometric object is defined as the difference between the number of vertices, edges, and faces of the object. In the case of a square piece of paper, the Euler characteristic of a square is 0, while the Euler characteristic of a triangle is 1. This difference in Euler characteristic can be used to distinguish between the two folds.

Another important topological invariant is the genus of a surface. The genus of a surface is defined as the number of holes in the surface. For example, a sphere has a genus of 0, while a torus has a genus of 1. In the context of folding algorithms, the genus of a surface can be used to classify different folds. For example, a fold with a genus of 0 is considered a simple fold, while a fold with a genus of 1 is considered a complex fold.

Topological invariants can also be used to analyze the behavior of folds under different transformations. For example, the concept of a topological transformation can be used to understand how a fold changes under a continuous deformation. This can be particularly useful in the design of folding algorithms, as it allows us to predict how a fold will behave under different transformations.

In addition to topological invariants, topology also provides tools for analyzing the behavior of folds under different transformations. For example, the concept of a topological equivalence can be used to understand how two folds are related to each other. If two folds are topologically equivalent, then they can be continuously deformed into each other. This concept is particularly useful in the design of folding algorithms, as it allows us to simplify the design process by focusing on topologically equivalent folds.

In the next section, we will explore some practical applications of topology and folding in various fields. These applications demonstrate the versatility and usefulness of topology in the design and analysis of folding algorithms.

#### 5.5c Applications of Topology

Topology has a wide range of applications in the field of folding algorithms. In this section, we will explore some of these applications and how topology can be used to solve real-world problems.

One of the most common applications of topology in folding algorithms is in the design and analysis of linkages. Linkages are mechanical structures that connect multiple rigid bodies together, allowing for relative motion between them. Topology is used to classify and analyze different types of linkages, which can then be used to design and optimize mechanical systems.

For example, consider the RSS linkage, which is a type of linkage commonly used in robotics. The topology of this linkage can be analyzed using topological invariants such as the Euler characteristic and the genus of the surface. This allows us to understand the behavior of the linkage under different transformations and optimize its design for specific applications.

Another important application of topology in folding algorithms is in the design and analysis of origami structures. Origami is the art of paper folding, and it has been used for centuries to create intricate and complex structures. Topology is used to classify and analyze different types of origami structures, which can then be used to design and optimize these structures for specific applications.

For example, consider the Miura-ori, which is a type of origami structure commonly used in the design of solar panels. The topology of this structure can be analyzed using topological invariants such as the Euler characteristic and the genus of the surface. This allows us to understand the behavior of the structure under different transformations and optimize its design for maximum efficiency.

Topology also has applications in the design and analysis of polyhedra, which are three-dimensional geometric objects with flat faces. Polyhedra are commonly used in the design of structures such as buildings and bridges. Topology is used to classify and analyze different types of polyhedra, which can then be used to design and optimize these structures for specific applications.

For example, consider the cube, which is a simple polyhedron with six square faces. The topology of this polyhedron can be analyzed using topological invariants such as the Euler characteristic and the genus of the surface. This allows us to understand the behavior of the polyhedron under different transformations and optimize its design for specific applications.

In conclusion, topology plays a crucial role in the design and analysis of folding algorithms. Its applications in linkages, origami, and polyhedra demonstrate its versatility and usefulness in solving real-world problems. By understanding the topological properties of these structures, we can design and optimize them for specific applications, leading to more efficient and effective solutions.

### Section: 5.5 Topology and Folding:

In this section, we will explore the relationship between topology and folding, and how topological concepts can be applied to the design and analysis of folding algorithms.

#### 5.5a Basic Concepts

Topology is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties of geometric objects that are preserved under continuous deformations.

For example, consider a simple square piece of paper. If we fold it in half along the diagonal, we create a triangle. This fold can be described using a topological invariant known as the Euler characteristic. The Euler characteristic of a triangle is 1, while the Euler characteristic of a square is 0. This difference in Euler characteristic can be used to distinguish between the two folds.

Another important concept in topology is the notion of a topological equivalence. Two folds are said to be topologically equivalent if they can be continuously deformed into each other. This concept is particularly useful in the design of folding algorithms, as it allows us to simplify the design process by focusing on topologically equivalent folds.

For example, the concept of a topological transformation can be used to understand how a fold changes under a continuous deformation. This can be particularly useful in the design of folding algorithms, as it allows us to predict how a fold will behave under different transformations.

#### 5.5b Analysis Techniques

In this subsection, we will explore some of the techniques used in topological analysis of folds. These techniques can be used to understand the behavior of folds and to design more efficient folding algorithms.

One such technique is the use of topological invariants. As mentioned earlier, topological invariants are properties of a geometric object that remain unchanged under continuous deformations. These invariants can be used to classify and distinguish different folds. For example, the Euler characteristic can be used to distinguish between a triangle and a square fold.

Another technique is the use of topological equivalences. As mentioned earlier, two folds are said to be topologically equivalent if they can be continuously deformed into each other. This concept can be used to simplify the design process by focusing on topologically equivalent folds. For example, if two folds are topologically equivalent, then the same folding algorithm can be used for both of them.

Topological transformations can also be used for analysis. As mentioned earlier, a topological transformation is a continuous deformation that preserves the topological properties of a fold. By studying the behavior of a fold under different topological transformations, we can gain a deeper understanding of its properties and behavior.

In addition to these techniques, there are also more advanced methods for topological analysis, such as the use of topological invariants and equivalences in higher dimensions. These methods can be used to analyze more complex folds and structures, and can provide valuable insights for the design of folding algorithms.

Constraint satisfaction is a mathematical technique used to solve problems where the goal is to find a solution that satisfies a set of constraints. In the context of folding, constraint satisfaction is used to find a set of folds that satisfies the given geometric constraints. This is often achieved through the use of constraint programming, which is a method of formulating and solving optimization problems.

#### 5.6b.2 Decomposition Method

The decomposition method is a constraint satisfaction technique that involves breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems. In the context of folding, this method can be used to break down a complex folded structure into smaller, simpler substructures. This allows for the application of more specialized techniques to each substructure, leading to a more efficient solution.

#### 5.6b.3 Tree/Hypertree Decomposition

Tree/hypertree decomposition is a method used in constraint satisfaction to break down a problem into smaller subproblems. In the context of folding, this method can be used to break down a complex folded structure into smaller, simpler substructures. This allows for the application of more specialized techniques to each substructure, leading to a more efficient solution.

This allows for the integration of ECLiPSe's constraint solvers into other software systems, making it easier to apply constraint programming techniques to a wide range of problems, including those in the field of folding.

#### 5.6b.8 Declarative Nature of the ECLiPSe Language

The ECLiPSe language is largely backward-compatible with Prolog and supports different dialects, including ISO Prolog. This declarative nature of the language makes it particularly suited for constraint programming, as it allows for the formulation of problems in a clear and concise manner.

#### 5.6b.9 Support for Different Data Types

The ECLiPSe language supports a variety of data types, including strings, integers, rationals, and floating point intervals. This makes it a versatile language for handling the various types of geometric constraints that arise in the folding process.

#### 5.6b.10 Array Syntax and Structures with Field Names

The ECLiPSe language also supports array syntax and structures with field names, which are particularly useful in constraint modeling. These features allow for the representation of complex geometric structures in a concise and intuitive manner.

#### 5.6b.11 Logical Iteration Construct

The logical iteration construct in the ECLiPSe language eliminates the need for explicit loops, making it easier to write and understand constraint programs. This construct can be particularly useful in the context of folding, where it can be used to iteratively apply folds to a structure until all constraints are satisfied.




### Subsection: 5.6c Practical Applications

In this section, we will explore some practical applications of geometric constraints in folding. These applications demonstrate the versatility and usefulness of folding algorithms in various fields.

#### 5.6c.1 Origami Design

Origami, the traditional Japanese art of paper folding, is a prime example of the practical application of geometric constraints in folding. The art of origami involves creating complex shapes and figures from a single sheet of paper, often using a series of folds. The geometric constraints in origami, such as the fold lines and the paper's dimensions, dictate the shape and structure of the final product.

Folding algorithms can be used to automate the process of origami design, allowing for the creation of complex origami structures with precise folds. This can be particularly useful in educational settings, where students can learn about geometric constraints and algorithms through the process of origami design.

#### 5.6c.2 Architectural Design

Geometric constraints also play a crucial role in architectural design. Architects often need to design structures that can withstand specific loads and constraints, such as wind or seismic forces. Folding algorithms can be used to optimize the design of these structures, taking into account the geometric constraints and the desired structural properties.

For example, the design of a bridge can be optimized using folding algorithms to ensure that it can withstand the weight of vehicles and the forces exerted by wind and seismic activity. The geometric constraints in the design, such as the bridge's dimensions and the placement of support structures, can be represented as constraints in the folding algorithm.

#### 5.6c.3 Robotics

In the field of robotics, folding algorithms can be used to design and control the movement of robots. The geometric constraints in the design of a robot, such as the placement of joints and the range of motion of each joint, can be represented as constraints in a folding algorithm. This allows for the optimization of the robot's movement, taking into account the geometric constraints and the desired trajectory.

For example, the design of a robotic arm can be optimized using folding algorithms to ensure that it can reach a desired position while avoiding collisions with other objects in its environment. The geometric constraints in the design, such as the placement of the arm's joints and the range of motion of each joint, can be represented as constraints in the folding algorithm.

In conclusion, the practical applications of geometric constraints in folding are vast and varied. From origami design to architectural design and robotics, folding algorithms provide a powerful tool for optimizing structures and systems under geometric constraints.
