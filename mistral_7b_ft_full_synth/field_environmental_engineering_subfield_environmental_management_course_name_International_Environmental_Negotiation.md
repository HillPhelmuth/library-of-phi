### Subsection: 1.1a Understanding global environmental challenges

In order to effectively negotiate and address global environmental challenges, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of these challenges. This includes understanding the current state of the environment, the potential impacts of climate change, and the role of international organizations in addressing these issues.

#### The Current State of the Environment

The current state of the environment is a cause for concern. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has reported that the world is facing a "planetary emergency" due to the rapid degradation of the environment. This includes the loss of biodiversity, the depletion of natural resources, and the impact of climate change on ecosystems.

One of the key factors contributing to the current state of the environment is the increasing demand for resources. As the global population continues to grow, so does the demand for resources such as food, water, and energy. This has led to overexploitation of natural resources and has put pressure on the environment.

#### The Potential Impacts of Climate Change

Climate change is another major global environmental challenge. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has reported that human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have contributed to the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This has led to changes in global temperatures, sea levels, and weather patterns.

The potential impacts of climate change are far-reaching and have the potential to affect every aspect of our lives. This includes changes in agriculture, water availability, and the spread of diseases. It is crucial to address climate change and reduce our carbon footprint in order to mitigate these potential impacts.

#### The Role of International Organizations

International organizations play a crucial role in addressing global environmental challenges. These organizations, such as the United Nations and the European Union, have established treaties and agreements to regulate the use of natural resources and reduce the impact of climate change.

However, there have been criticisms of the effectiveness of these organizations in addressing environmental issues. Some argue that these organizations are too slow to act and that their efforts are not enough to address the scale of the environmental challenges we face.

#### Meeting the Challenge

To achieve the societal transformation required to meet the climate change challenge, we must overcome a number of significant constraints and seize critical opportunities. This includes reducing inertia in social and economic systems, building on a growing public desire for governments to act on climate change, and removing implicit and explicit subsidies.

Furthermore, we must enable the shifts from ineffective governance and weak institutions to innovative leadership in government, the private sector, and civil society. This includes engaging society in the transition to norms and practices that foster sustainability.

#### Scientific Findings

Recent scientific findings have shed light on the potential impacts of climate change. For example, a study by the University of Copenhagen found that the Greenland ice sheet may remain at temperatures far higher than those envisaged by the IPCC when more advanced modelling techniques are used.

Another study by the University of California, Irvine, found that the acceleration of outlet glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica has led to an increase in sea level rise. This highlights the urgent need for action to reduce our carbon footprint and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, understanding global environmental challenges is crucial for effective international environmental negotiation. This includes understanding the current state of the environment, the potential impacts of climate change, and the role of international organizations in addressing these issues. By addressing these challenges, we can work towards a more sustainable future for all.

### Subsection: 1.3a Challenges of multi-party negotiations in environmental diplomacy

Multi-party negotiations in environmental diplomacy present a unique set of challenges that must be addressed in order to reach a successful outcome. These challenges are often rooted in the complex and interconnected nature of environmental issues, as well as the diverse interests and perspectives of the parties involved.

#### The Complexity of Environmental Issues

Environmental issues are often complex and interconnected, making it difficult for parties to reach a consensus on the best course of action. For example, climate change is a global issue that has far-reaching impacts on ecosystems, economies, and societies. Addressing climate change requires a comprehensive and coordinated effort, involving multiple parties and sectors. However, the complexity of the issue can make it challenging for parties to agree on a single, unified approach.

#### Diverse Interests and Perspectives

In addition to the complexity of environmental issues, multi-party negotiations also face challenges due to the diverse interests and perspectives of the parties involved. Each party may have their own priorities and concerns, making it difficult to reach a consensus on certain issues. For example, a developing country may prioritize economic growth and development, while a developed country may prioritize environmental protection. These differing priorities can create significant barriers to reaching a successful outcome.

#### Power Dynamics and Asymmetry

Furthermore, power dynamics and asymmetry can also pose challenges in multi-party negotiations. Asymmetry refers to the unequal distribution of power and resources among parties, which can create barriers to effective collaboration. For example, a developed country may have more resources and influence than a developing country, making it difficult for the latter to have their voices heard and their interests represented in the negotiations.

#### Increased Conflict

Finally, multi-party negotiations can also lead to increased conflict, particularly in situations where large state actors are involved. Collaboration can be seen as a means of co-optation or marginalization of smaller or local actors, leading to further conflict and hindering the effectiveness of the negotiations.

In conclusion, multi-party negotiations in environmental diplomacy present a unique set of challenges that must be addressed in order to reach a successful outcome. These challenges require creative and innovative solutions, as well as a deep understanding of the complex and interconnected nature of environmental issues.

### Subsection: 1.3b Ensuring compliance and enforcement of environmental treaties

Ensuring compliance and enforcement of environmental treaties is a critical aspect of international environmental negotiation. It is through effective compliance and enforcement that the goals and objectives of these treaties can be achieved. However, ensuring compliance and enforcement is not without its challenges.

#### The Role of Compliance and Enforcement in Environmental Treaties

Compliance and enforcement play a crucial role in the success of environmental treaties. Compliance refers to the adherence to the terms and conditions of a treaty, while enforcement refers to the mechanisms and processes used to ensure compliance. In the context of environmental treaties, compliance and enforcement are essential for achieving the goals and objectives of these agreements.

For instance, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) relies heavily on compliance and enforcement to protect endangered species. The Convention requires its parties to implement laws and regulations to regulate trade in endangered species. Compliance with these laws and regulations is crucial for the effectiveness of the Convention. Enforcement mechanisms, such as inspections and penalties, are also in place to ensure compliance.

#### Challenges of Compliance and Enforcement

Despite their importance, ensuring compliance and enforcement of environmental treaties is not without its challenges. One of the main challenges is the lack of a global enforcement authority. Unlike international trade, where the World Trade Organization (WTO) plays a significant role in enforcing trade agreements, there is no equivalent body for environmental treaties. This lack of a global enforcement authority can make it difficult to ensure compliance and enforce environmental treaties.

Another challenge is the lack of resources and capacity in many developing countries. These countries often struggle to implement the necessary laws and regulations, as well as to enforce them effectively. This can lead to non-compliance and undermine the effectiveness of environmental treaties.

#### Strategies for Ensuring Compliance and Enforcement

Despite these challenges, there are strategies that can be used to ensure compliance and enforce environmental treaties. One strategy is to increase transparency and accountability. By making information about compliance and enforcement publicly available, it becomes more difficult for parties to engage in non-compliant behavior. This can also help to build trust among parties and encourage compliance.

Another strategy is to promote capacity building in developing countries. This can involve providing technical and financial assistance to help these countries implement and enforce environmental laws and regulations. Capacity building can also help to build the necessary skills and expertise to effectively monitor and enforce compliance.

In conclusion, ensuring compliance and enforcement of environmental treaties is a complex and challenging task. However, it is crucial for the success of these agreements. By promoting transparency, accountability, and capacity building, we can work towards a more effective and sustainable future for our planet.

## Chapter: Chapter 2: The Role of Non-State Actors

### Introduction

In the realm of international environmental negotiation, the role of non-state actors (NSAs) is a critical yet often overlooked aspect. This chapter aims to shed light on the significant influence and impact of NSAs in shaping environmental policies and agreements at the global level. 

Non-state actors, also known as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), are entities that operate independently of any government. They can range from environmental advocacy groups to multinational corporations, and their involvement in international environmental negotiations can be both beneficial and challenging. 

The involvement of NSAs in international environmental negotiations can bring a diverse range of perspectives and expertise to the table. They can provide valuable insights and data, and their advocacy can help raise awareness and mobilize public opinion. However, their involvement can also complicate the negotiation process, as they may have conflicting interests and agendas.

This chapter will delve into the various roles and influences of NSAs in international environmental negotiations. It will explore the challenges and opportunities they present, and how their involvement can shape the outcomes of these negotiations. By understanding the role of NSAs, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of international environmental negotiation.




### Subsection: 1.4a Role of science in informing environmental negotiations

Science plays a crucial role in informing environmental negotiations. It provides the necessary data and information that can guide decision-making processes and help negotiators reach mutually beneficial agreements. In this section, we will explore the role of science in environmental negotiations, with a particular focus on the role of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

#### The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)

The IPCC is a scientific body established by the United Nations to assess the scientific, technical, and socio-economic information relevant for understanding climate change. It is made up of thousands of scientists from around the world who volunteer their time and expertise to produce comprehensive reports on climate change. These reports are then used by policymakers to inform their decisions and negotiate international agreements.

The IPCC has produced several reports, including the First, Second, and Third Assessment Reports, as well as Special Reports on specific topics such as climate change 2007: Synthesis Report, Climate Change 2014: Synthesis Report, and Global Warming of 1.5°C. These reports have been instrumental in providing the scientific basis for international climate change negotiations.

#### The Role of the IPCC in Environmental Negotiations

The IPCC plays a crucial role in environmental negotiations by providing the necessary scientific information and data. This information is used by negotiators to understand the current state of the environment, the potential impacts of climate change, and the effectiveness of different mitigation and adaptation strategies.

For instance, the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report, released in 2014, provided the scientific basis for the Paris Agreement, a global agreement on climate change adopted in 2015. The report concluded that human influence is the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century, and that it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming over the last few decades. This information was crucial in convincing countries to commit to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions.

#### Challenges and Future Directions

Despite its success, the IPCC faces several challenges. One of the main challenges is the need for more accurate and up-to-date information. Climate change is a complex and rapidly evolving issue, and the IPCC's reports are often based on data that is several years old. This can make it difficult to keep up with the latest developments and trends.

In the future, the IPCC will need to adapt to these challenges by improving its data collection and analysis methods, and by producing more frequent and targeted reports. It will also need to continue to engage with policymakers and the public to ensure that its findings are effectively communicated and used in environmental negotiations.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, science plays a crucial role in informing environmental negotiations. The IPCC, in particular, has been instrumental in providing the necessary scientific information and data to guide international climate change negotiations. However, as the field of environmental science continues to evolve, so too must the IPCC adapt to ensure that its findings remain relevant and effective in informing environmental negotiations.




### Subsection: 1.4b Incorporating scientific knowledge into policy-making

Incorporating scientific knowledge into policy-making is a critical aspect of international environmental negotiation. It involves the use of scientific information and data to inform decision-making processes and guide the development of policies and agreements. This section will explore the role of scientific knowledge in policy-making, with a particular focus on the role of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

#### The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)

As previously mentioned, the IPCC plays a crucial role in providing the necessary scientific information and data for international environmental negotiations. The IPCC's reports are used by policymakers to understand the current state of the environment, the potential impacts of climate change, and the effectiveness of different mitigation and adaptation strategies.

The IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report, released in 2014, provided the scientific basis for the Paris Agreement, a global agreement on climate change adopted in 2015. The report concluded that human influence is the dominant cause of the observed warming, and it provided a range of scenarios for future climate change based on different levels of greenhouse gas emissions.

#### Incorporating Scientific Knowledge into Policy-Making

Incorporating scientific knowledge into policy-making is a complex process that involves multiple stakeholders, including scientists, policymakers, and the public. The science of science policy (SoSP) is an emerging interdisciplinary research area that seeks to develop theoretical and empirical models of the scientific enterprise. This scientific basis can be used to help government, and society in general, make better R&D management decisions by establishing a scientifically rigorous, quantitative basis from which policy makers and researchers may assess the impacts of the nation's scientific and engineering enterprise, improve their understanding of its dynamics, and assess the likely outcomes.

The federal government of the United States has long been a supporter of SoSP. In 2006, in response to Office of Science and Technology Policy Director John H. Marburger's challenge for a new "science of science policy," the National Science and Technology Council's Subcommittee on Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE) established an Interagency Task Group on Science of Science Policy (ITG) to serve as part of the internal deliberative process of the Subcommittee.

The ITG's subsequent work has been guided by the questions outlined in the Roadmap and the action steps developed at the workshop. Furthermore, since 2007, the National Science Foundation, in support of academic research to advance the field, has awarded grants from the Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP) program. The SciSIP research supports and complements the Federal efforts necessary for the long-term development of a science of science policy.

In conclusion, incorporating scientific knowledge into policy-making is a complex but crucial aspect of international environmental negotiation. The IPCC and the SoSP provide valuable tools and frameworks for this process, helping to ensure that policy decisions are based on the best available scientific information.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the process of treaty-making in the context of international environmental negotiation. We have delved into the intricacies of treaty-making, from the initial stages of negotiation to the final signing and ratification. We have also examined the role of various stakeholders in this process, including governments, non-governmental organizations, and international bodies. 

We have learned that treaty-making is a complex and multifaceted process that requires careful planning, negotiation, and consensus-building. It is a process that is influenced by a variety of factors, including political, economic, social, and environmental considerations. We have also seen that treaty-making is not a one-size-fits-all process, and that different treaties may require different approaches and strategies.

In conclusion, treaty-making is a crucial aspect of international environmental negotiation. It provides a formal and legally binding framework for addressing environmental issues and promoting sustainable practices. However, it is also a challenging process that requires careful navigation and a deep understanding of the complex dynamics at play.

### Introduction

In the realm of international environmental negotiation, the concept of capacity building plays a pivotal role. This chapter, "Capacity Building," delves into the intricacies of this crucial aspect, providing a comprehensive understanding of its importance and how it can be effectively implemented.

Capacity building is a process that involves enhancing the ability of individuals, organizations, and nations to perform functions, solve problems, and set and achieve objectives. In the context of international environmental negotiation, it is a critical component that enables countries to effectively participate in global environmental discussions and agreements. It equips them with the necessary skills, knowledge, and resources to engage in these negotiations and implement the resulting agreements.

This chapter will explore the various dimensions of capacity building, including its importance in international environmental negotiation, the challenges faced in its implementation, and strategies for overcoming these challenges. It will also delve into the role of different stakeholders in capacity building, such as governments, non-governmental organizations, and international agencies.

The chapter will also discuss the relationship between capacity building and other aspects of international environmental negotiation, such as treaty-making and compliance. It will highlight how capacity building can enhance the effectiveness of these processes and contribute to the achievement of global environmental goals.

In essence, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of capacity building in the context of international environmental negotiation. It seeks to equip readers with the knowledge and tools necessary to effectively implement capacity building initiatives and contribute to the global efforts towards a sustainable future.




### Subsection: 1.5a Understanding negotiation dynamics through a simulation game

The Chlorine Game is a simulation activity that provides a unique opportunity to understand the dynamics of international environmental negotiations. This game is a common demonstration in game theory classes and reveals the significant heterogeneity of behavior. It is unlikely that many people will play rationally according to the Nash Equilibrium, as the game has no strictly dominant strategy. This requires players to consider what others will do. For Nash Equilibrium to be played, players would need to assume both that everyone else is rational and that there is common knowledge of rationality. However, this is a strong assumption.

Experiments demonstrate that many people make mistakes and do not assume common knowledge of rationality. It has been demonstrated that even economics graduate students do not guess 0. When performed among ordinary people, it is usually found that the winner's guess is much higher than 0. This corresponds to approximately two levels of k-level reasoning.

The Chlorine Game also provides an opportunity to explore the role of repetition in learning and decision-making. Kocher and Sutter observed that while both subjects applied roughly the same level of reasoning, groups learned faster. This demonstrated that repetition enabled a group of individuals to observe others' behavior in previous games and correspondingly choose a number that increases their chances of winning the game.

Sbriglia's investigation also revealed that non-winners often try to imitate winners' understanding of the game's structure. Accordingly, other players adopt strategies which are best responses to the imitators' behavior instead of the Nash Equilibrium. This further highlights the importance of understanding the dynamics of international environmental negotiations and the role of strategic behavior.

In the context of international environmental negotiations, the Chlorine Game can be used as a metaphor to illustrate the complexities and challenges of reaching agreements. Just as in the game, negotiations often involve multiple parties with different interests and levels of understanding. The game also highlights the importance of strategic thinking and the role of repetition in learning and decision-making.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the role of strategic thinking in international environmental negotiations and explore how it can be used to navigate the complexities of these negotiations.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the process of treaty-making in the context of international environmental negotiations. We have delved into the intricacies of treaty negotiation, from the initial stages of identifying the need for a treaty to the final stages of ratification and implementation. We have also examined the role of various stakeholders in the treaty-making process, including governments, non-governmental organizations, and international bodies.

We have learned that treaty-making is a complex and multifaceted process that requires careful planning, negotiation, and implementation. It is a critical tool in the international community's efforts to address environmental issues and protect the planet for future generations. However, we have also seen that treaty-making is not without its challenges. These include issues of compliance, enforcement, and the need for ongoing review and revision.

Despite these challenges, treaty-making remains a vital part of international environmental negotiation. It provides a formal and legally binding framework for addressing environmental issues and promoting sustainable practices. As we move forward, it is crucial to continue to improve and refine the treaty-making process to ensure its effectiveness in addressing the ever-evolving environmental challenges we face.

It is hoped that this chapter will provide readers with a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of international environmental negotiation and the role of international organizations in this process.




### Subsection: 1.5b Analyzing outcomes and strategies in the chlorine game

The Chlorine Game provides a unique opportunity to analyze the outcomes and strategies of international environmental negotiations. The game's structure and dynamics can be used to understand the complexities of these negotiations and the strategic behavior of the participants.

#### Analyzing Outcomes

The outcomes of the Chlorine Game can be analyzed in terms of the Nash Equilibrium and the role of repetition in learning and decision-making. As mentioned earlier, the Nash Equilibrium is a state in which no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy. In the Chlorine Game, this equilibrium is not easily attainable due to the lack of a strictly dominant strategy. This requires players to consider what others will do, which can lead to a variety of outcomes.

The outcomes of the game can also be analyzed in terms of the winner's guess. This is the number that the winner of the game guesses as the number of chlorine molecules in the bottle. This number can provide insights into the players' understanding of the game's structure and their strategic behavior.

#### Analyzing Strategies

The strategies used in the Chlorine Game can be analyzed in terms of the role of repetition in learning and decision-making. As Kocher and Sutter observed, groups learn faster than individuals due to the ability to observe others' behavior in previous games and choose a number that increases their chances of winning. This suggests that repetition can be a powerful tool in international environmental negotiations, allowing participants to learn from each other's behavior and make more informed decisions.

Sbriglia's investigation further highlights the importance of understanding the dynamics of international environmental negotiations. He found that non-winners often try to imitate winners' understanding of the game's structure, leading to the adoption of strategies that are best responses to the imitators' behavior instead of the Nash Equilibrium. This suggests that strategic behavior plays a crucial role in these negotiations, and understanding this behavior can be key to successful outcomes.

In conclusion, the Chlorine Game provides a valuable tool for analyzing the outcomes and strategies of international environmental negotiations. By understanding the game's dynamics and the role of repetition and strategic behavior, we can gain insights into the complexities of these negotiations and potentially improve our negotiating strategies.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the process of treaty-making in the context of international environmental negotiations. We have delved into the intricacies of negotiating and drafting treaties, and the importance of these processes in the global effort to address environmental issues. We have also examined the role of various stakeholders, including governments, non-governmental organizations, and international bodies, in the treaty-making process.

The chapter has highlighted the importance of consensus-building and compromise in treaty-making.

It is a legally binding agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which was adopted in 1992. The Kyoto Protocol sets targets for industrialized countries to reduce their emissions of six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.

In this chapter, we will delve into the intricacies of the Kyoto Protocol, exploring its history, key provisions, and the challenges it faces. We will also examine the role of international environmental negotiation in its development and implementation. The Kyoto Protocol is a significant step in the global effort to address climate change, and understanding its mechanisms and implications is crucial for anyone involved in international environmental negotiation.

We will begin by providing a brief overview of the Kyoto Protocol, including its key principles and objectives. We will then delve into the details of its provisions, including the targets for greenhouse gas emissions, the mechanisms for monitoring and verifying emissions, and the provisions for flexibility in meeting emission reduction targets. We will also discuss the challenges faced by the Kyoto Protocol, including the United States' refusal to ratify it and the difficulties in implementing its provisions.

Finally, we will explore the role of international environmental negotiation in the development and implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. We will discuss the negotiations that led to its creation, the ongoing negotiations to address its shortcomings, and the role of international organizations and non-state actors in these negotiations.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a comprehensive understanding of the Kyoto Protocol and its role in international environmental negotiation. They should also be equipped with the knowledge and tools to engage in these negotiations effectively.




### Subsection: 2.3a Overview of the Cancun round negotiations

The Cancun round of negotiations, held in 2010, was a crucial step in the ongoing international efforts to address climate change. This round of negotiations was significant as it was the first time that all 192 member states of the United Nations participated in a single climate change conference. The negotiations were held under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which sets the overall framework for international cooperation on climate change.

The Cancun round of negotiations was particularly important as it was the first major climate change conference after the failed Copenhagen summit in 2009. The Copenhagen summit had ended without a binding agreement, largely due to disagreements between developed and developing countries on the issue of emissions reductions. The Cancun round aimed to build on the progress made in Copenhagen and to reach a more comprehensive and inclusive agreement.

The negotiations in Cancun were divided into several key areas, including:

- Mitigation: This refers to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The goal was to reach an agreement on a new global target for emissions reductions, with a focus on the developed countries.
- Adaptation: This refers to efforts to help developing countries adapt to the impacts of climate change. The goal was to increase financial support for adaptation efforts.
- Transparency: This refers to the need for all countries to report on their emissions and efforts to reduce them. The goal was to establish a system for monitoring and verifying emissions reductions.
- Technology: This refers to the need for technology transfer to help developing countries reduce their emissions and adapt to climate change. The goal was to establish a technology mechanism to facilitate this transfer.

The Cancun round of negotiations resulted in a new agreement, known as the Cancun Agreements. This agreement included a commitment by developed countries to a second round of emissions reductions, with a goal of limiting the increase in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. It also included a commitment to increase financial support for adaptation efforts in developing countries.

Despite these achievements, the Cancun Agreements were criticized for not going far enough. Many developing countries argued that the agreement did not adequately address their concerns, particularly in terms of emissions reductions and financial support. However, the Cancun Agreements did provide a basis for further negotiations and set the stage for the next major climate change conference, held in Durban in 2011.




### Subsection: 2.3b Key issues and outcomes of the negotiations

The Cancun round of negotiations was a significant step forward in international efforts to address climate change. Despite the challenges and disagreements that arose during the negotiations, a number of key issues were successfully addressed, leading to the adoption of the Cancun Agreements.

One of the key issues in the Cancun round of negotiations was the establishment of a new global target for emissions reductions. This was a contentious issue, with developed countries pushing for a more ambitious target and developing countries advocating for a more flexible approach. The final agreement included a commitment by all countries to reduce their emissions, with developed countries taking the lead and developing countries being given more flexibility in their emissions reduction efforts.

#### Adaptation

Another important issue in the negotiations was the provision of financial support for adaptation efforts in developing countries. This was a key demand of developing countries, who argued that they needed additional resources to help them adapt to the impacts of climate change. The final agreement included a commitment by developed countries to provide $100 billion per year by 2020 to support adaptation and mitigation efforts in developing countries.

#### Transparency

Transparency was also a key issue in the negotiations, with all countries agreeing to establish a system for monitoring and verifying their emissions reductions. This was seen as a crucial step towards ensuring that all countries were meeting their commitments under the UNFCCC. The final agreement included a commitment by all countries to report on their emissions and efforts to reduce them, with developed countries being held to a higher standard of transparency.

#### Technology

The issue of technology transfer was also a major focus of the negotiations. Developing countries argued that they needed access to clean and affordable technology to help them reduce their emissions and adapt to climate change. The final agreement included a commitment by developed countries to provide technology transfer to developing countries, with a focus on renewable energy and energy efficiency.

In conclusion, the Cancun round of negotiations was a significant step forward in international efforts to address climate change. Despite the challenges and disagreements that arose during the negotiations, a number of key issues were successfully addressed, leading to the adoption of the Cancun Agreements. These agreements provide a framework for future negotiations and will be crucial in the ongoing efforts to address climate change.

 7.1: The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is a legally binding international agreement that aims to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system. It was adopted in 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The UNFCCC has been ratified by 197 countries, making it one of the most widely ratified international agreements.

The UNFCCC sets out a framework for international cooperation on climate change, including the provision of financial and technological support to developing countries. It also establishes the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, recognizing that developed countries have a greater responsibility in addressing climate change due to their historical contributions to greenhouse gas emissions.

The ultimate objective of the UNFCCC is to achieve stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system. This is achieved through the implementation of mitigation measures, which aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and adaptation measures, which aim to help countries adapt to the impacts of climate change.

The UNFCCC also establishes the Conference of the Parties (COP), which is the supreme body of the Convention. The COP meets annually to review the implementation of the Convention and to make decisions on its future direction. The COP also oversees the work of the Subsidiary Bodies, which are responsible for specific tasks related to the Convention.

The UNFCCC has been instrumental in bringing attention to the issue of climate change and promoting international cooperation in addressing it. However, it has also faced criticism for its lack of specific targets and timelines, as well as its reliance on voluntary actions by countries. Despite these challenges, the UNFCCC remains a crucial tool in the fight against climate change and has paved the way for more ambitious agreements such as the Paris Climate Agreement.

In the next section, we will explore the process of international environmental negotiation, including the role of the UNFCCC and other international agreements in shaping global environmental policies.

One of the key principles of the Convention is the concept of common but differentiated responsibilities. This principle recognizes that developed countries have a greater responsibility in addressing climate change due to their historical contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, the Convention requires developed countries to take the lead in reducing their emissions and providing financial and technological support to developing countries.

The Convention also establishes the Conference of the Parties (COP), which is the supreme decision-making body responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Convention. The COP meets annually to review progress, discuss new developments, and make decisions on the Convention's implementation.

In addition to its overall objectives and principles, the Convention also includes specific provisions for mitigation, adaptation, and finance. Mitigation refers to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while adaptation focuses on preparing for and responding to the impacts of climate change. Finance provisions aim to mobilize resources for developing countries to address climate change.

The Convention also includes a mechanism for review and revision, known as the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA). This body is responsible for reviewing the Convention's implementation and making decisions on its revision.

Overall, the UNFCCC is a crucial international agreement that sets the framework for addressing climate change. Its principles, objectives, and provisions guide the actions of its parties and provide a basis for international cooperation on climate change. However, the Convention also faces challenges in its implementation, which will be explored in the following sections.

### Section: 11.1 'Week #TOPICS KEY DATES Treaty-making':

#### 11.1a Understanding the course schedule and key dates

In the previous chapter, we discussed the importance of a calendar in international environmental negotiation. In this section, we will delve deeper into the specifics of the calendar, focusing on the key dates and deadlines for treaty-making.

Treaty-making is a crucial aspect of international environmental negotiation, as it allows for the formalization of agreements between countries. These agreements can range from simple memorandums of understanding to complex international treaties. The process of treaty-making involves multiple stages, each with its own set of key dates and deadlines.

The first step in treaty-making is the initiation of negotiations. This is where the parties involved agree to enter into negotiations and set a timeline for the process. The initiation of negotiations is typically marked by a letter of intent or a joint statement, which outlines the scope and objectives of the negotiations. The key date for this stage is the date of the letter of intent or joint statement.

The next stage is the negotiation phase, where the parties work towards reaching an agreement. This phase can be lengthy and may involve multiple rounds of negotiations. The key dates for this stage are the dates of the negotiations, which are typically scheduled in advance. These dates are crucial for planning and coordinating the negotiation process.

Once an agreement is reached, the next step is the signing of the treaty. This is a formal ceremony where the parties sign the agreement, making it a legally binding document. The key date for this stage is the date of the signing ceremony.

After the signing of the treaty, there is a period of ratification, where the treaty is reviewed and approved by the respective governments. This process can take several months, and the key date for this stage is the date of ratification.

Finally, the treaty comes into force once it has been ratified by all parties involved. This is typically marked by a ceremony where the treaty is officially signed and ratified. The key date for this stage is the date of entry into force.

It is important to note that these key dates and deadlines are not set in stone and may be subject to changes depending on the specific circumstances of the negotiation process. Therefore, it is crucial to have a flexible calendar that can be easily adjusted to accommodate these changes.

In the next section, we will discuss the role of the calendar in setting and managing deadlines for treaty-making. We will also explore different strategies for maintaining flexibility in a calendar, while still ensuring that the negotiation process stays on track.





### Section: 11.1 'Week #TOPICS KEY DATES Treaty-making':

#### 11.1b Preparing for and participating in treaty-making topics

Treaty-making is a complex process that requires careful preparation and participation from all parties involved. In this section, we will discuss the key topics and deadlines that are important to consider when preparing for and participating in treaty-making.

The first topic to consider is the scope of the treaty. This includes the objectives of the treaty, the parties involved, and the duration of the treaty. The scope of the treaty is typically negotiated during the initiation of negotiations and is crucial for setting the agenda for the negotiation process.

The next topic to consider is the timeline for the treaty-making process. This includes the dates of the negotiations, the signing ceremony, and the ratification process. As mentioned earlier, these dates are crucial for planning and coordinating the negotiation process.

Another important topic to consider is the drafting of the treaty. This involves the legal and technical aspects of the treaty, such as the articles, annexes, and appendices. The drafting process can be lengthy and may involve multiple rounds of revisions. The key deadlines for this stage are the deadlines for submitting drafts and the final deadline for the signing ceremony.

In addition to these topics, there are also important deadlines to consider, such as the deadline for submitting comments and suggestions on the draft treaty, the deadline for finalizing the text of the treaty, and the deadline for submitting the treaty for ratification.

Participating in treaty-making also requires careful preparation. This includes familiarizing oneself with the negotiation process, understanding the key issues and interests of the parties involved, and developing a strategy for negotiations. It is also important to have a strong understanding of the legal and technical aspects of the treaty, as well as the potential implications and consequences of the treaty.

In conclusion, preparing for and participating in treaty-making requires careful consideration of the key topics and deadlines involved. By understanding and addressing these topics and deadlines, parties can effectively navigate the treaty-making process and reach mutually beneficial agreements.





### Section: 11.2 'Introduction, and global environmental treaty-making: How should we judge the outcomes? (Susskind)':

#### 11.2a Understanding the role of global environmental treaty-making

Global environmental treaty-making plays a crucial role in addressing the complex and interconnected environmental issues facing our planet. These treaties are agreements between countries that aim to protect the environment and promote sustainable development. They are negotiated and signed by governments, and their implementation is overseen by international organizations.

One of the main goals of global environmental treaty-making is to establish a framework for addressing environmental issues at the international level. This includes setting standards and regulations for environmental protection, promoting sustainable practices, and providing a platform for countries to work together towards common environmental goals.

However, the effectiveness of these treaties is often debated. Some argue that they are not strong enough to address the urgent and complex environmental challenges we face. Others argue that they are too restrictive and hinder economic growth.

To better understand the role of global environmental treaty-making, it is important to examine the process and outcomes of these agreements. This includes analyzing the negotiation process, the content of the treaties, and their implementation.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of global environmental treaties and their objectives. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities in the negotiation process, and how these can impact the outcomes of the treaties.




### Section: 11.2 'Introduction, and global environmental treaty-making: How should we judge the outcomes? (Susskind)':

#### 11.2b Evaluating the outcomes of environmental treaties

In the previous section, we discussed the role of global environmental treaty-making and the challenges and opportunities in the negotiation process. Now, we will delve into the evaluation of the outcomes of these treaties.

Evaluating the outcomes of environmental treaties is a complex and multifaceted task. It involves assessing the effectiveness of the treaties in achieving their objectives, as well as their impact on the environment and society. This evaluation is crucial in determining the success of these agreements and identifying areas for improvement.

One way to evaluate the outcomes of environmental treaties is through the lens of the precautionary principle. This principle, which is incorporated into many environmental treaties, states that in the face of potential irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason to postpone taking action to prevent harm. This principle can be used to assess the effectiveness of treaties in addressing urgent environmental issues.

Another approach to evaluating the outcomes of environmental treaties is through the concept of "sustainable development." This concept, which is central to many environmental treaties, aims to balance economic, social, and environmental considerations. By evaluating the outcomes of treaties in terms of their contribution to sustainable development, we can assess their overall impact on society and the environment.

However, evaluating the outcomes of environmental treaties is not without its challenges. One of the main challenges is the lack of clear and measurable objectives in many treaties. This makes it difficult to determine whether the treaties have been successful in achieving their goals. Additionally, the complexity of environmental issues and the interconnectedness of different environmental factors make it challenging to isolate the impact of a single treaty.

## Chapter 12: International Environmental Agreements




### Section: 11.3 'The politics: North-South relations, role of civil society; role of international business interests (Susskind)':

#### 11.3a Understanding the politics of North-South relations in environmental negotiations

The politics of North-South relations play a significant role in environmental negotiations. The North-South divide, often referred to as the developed-developing country divide, is a complex and contentious issue in international environmental law. This divide is characterized by differences in economic, social, and political systems, as well as varying levels of environmental degradation and pollution.

The North-South divide is not a static or uniform phenomenon. It is shaped by a variety of factors, including historical patterns of trade and investment, colonial legacies, and contemporary economic and political power dynamics. This divide is also reflected in the distribution of environmental resources and burdens. For instance, developed countries, often located in the Global North, have historically been the main contributors to global environmental degradation and pollution, while developing countries, often located in the Global South, have borne the brunt of the environmental impacts of climate change and other environmental threats.

In the context of environmental negotiations, the North-South divide can be seen in the unequal distribution of environmental resources and burdens. Developed countries often have the resources and technological capabilities to address environmental issues, while developing countries often lack these resources and capabilities. This divide can also be seen in the unequal distribution of environmental benefits and burdens. Developed countries often benefit from the exploitation of environmental resources in developing countries, while developing countries often bear the environmental burdens of this exploitation.

The North-South divide also plays a role in the politics of environmental negotiations. Developed countries often have the economic and political power to shape the agenda and outcomes of environmental negotiations. This power can be used to advance their own interests, often at the expense of developing countries. For instance, developed countries have often been able to use their economic and political power to shape the terms of international environmental agreements in ways that benefit them, while disadvantaging developing countries.

However, the North-South divide is not static. It is shaped by a variety of factors, including changes in economic and political power dynamics, technological advancements, and shifts in public opinion. These changes can create opportunities for new alliances and coalitions, and can also lead to shifts in the balance of power in environmental negotiations.

In the next section, we will explore the role of civil society and international business interests in environmental negotiations.

#### 11.3b Role of civil society in environmental negotiations

Civil society plays a crucial role in environmental negotiations, particularly in the North-South context. Civil society refers to the space for individuals and groups to organize and advocate for their interests independently of the state. In the context of environmental negotiations, civil society can include environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs), labor unions, faith-based organizations, and other groups that represent the interests of communities and individuals.

Civil society plays a vital role in environmental negotiations by providing a voice for marginalized communities and advocating for environmental justice. In many cases, these communities are disproportionately affected by environmental degradation and pollution, and their voices are often not heard in formal negotiations. Civil society organizations can bring these voices to the table and advocate for policies that address the environmental needs of these communities.

Civil society also plays a crucial role in monitoring and enforcing environmental agreements. NGOs, for instance, often play a key role in monitoring compliance with international environmental agreements. They can collect and analyze data, report on violations, and advocate for enforcement. This role is particularly important in the context of North-South relations, where developed countries often have the resources and technological capabilities to monitor and enforce environmental agreements, while developing countries often lack these resources.

Civil society also plays a role in shaping the agenda and outcomes of environmental negotiations. Civil society organizations can mobilize public opinion and put pressure on governments to take action on environmental issues. They can also provide technical expertise and policy recommendations that can inform the negotiations process.

However, the role of civil society in environmental negotiations is not without challenges. In many cases, civil society organizations face barriers to participation, such as limited resources, lack of access to information, and intimidation. These barriers can limit their ability to participate effectively in negotiations and advocate for their interests.

In conclusion, civil society plays a crucial role in environmental negotiations, particularly in the North-South context. It provides a voice for marginalized communities, monitors and enforces environmental agreements, and helps shape the agenda and outcomes of negotiations. However, efforts are needed to address the barriers to participation faced by civil society organizations, particularly in developing countries.

#### 11.3c Role of international business interests in environmental negotiations

International business interests play a significant role in environmental negotiations, particularly in the North-South context. These interests can include multinational corporations, industry associations, and other business entities that operate across national boundaries. Their role is often complex and multifaceted, involving both potential threats and opportunities for environmental governance.

On one hand, international business interests can pose significant threats to environmental negotiations. They often have a strong financial incentive to exploit natural resources and expand their operations, which can lead to environmental degradation and pollution. This is particularly true in the Global South, where many developing countries are rich in natural resources but lack the regulatory frameworks and technological capabilities to manage these resources sustainably.

Moreover, international business interests can also exert significant influence over environmental negotiations. They often have the resources and expertise to shape the terms of environmental agreements, and can use their economic power to influence policy decisions. This can lead to outcomes that are favorable to their interests, but may not necessarily align with the environmental needs of local communities or the global community as a whole.

On the other hand, international business interests can also play a positive role in environmental negotiations. They can bring valuable technical expertise and resources to the table, and can help to implement and enforce environmental agreements. They can also play a key role in promoting sustainable practices and technologies, which can help to mitigate the environmental impacts of their operations.

In the context of North-South relations, international business interests can play a particularly important role. They can help to bridge the North-South divide by providing resources and expertise to developing countries, and by promoting sustainable practices that can help to address the environmental needs of these countries.

However, the role of international business interests in environmental negotiations is not without challenges. They often face criticism for their environmental practices, and can face pressure from civil society, governments, and other stakeholders to improve their environmental performance. Moreover, their role in environmental negotiations can be influenced by a variety of factors, including their own business interests, the regulatory frameworks in the countries where they operate, and the broader political and economic context.

In conclusion, international business interests play a crucial role in environmental negotiations, particularly in the North-South context. Their role is complex and multifaceted, involving both potential threats and opportunities for environmental governance. Understanding their role is therefore essential for effective environmental negotiations.

It is an active participant, shaping the discourse and influencing the outcomes. Understanding its role is therefore crucial for anyone involved in international environmental negotiation.




### Section: 11.3 'The politics: North-South relations, role of civil society; role of international business interests (Susskind)':

#### 11.3b Exploring the role of civil society and international business interests in environmental treaty-making

The role of civil society and international business interests in environmental treaty-making is a critical aspect of international environmental negotiation. Civil society, which includes non-governmental organizations (NGOs), labor unions, religious groups, and other non-state actors, plays a significant role in shaping environmental policies and agreements. International business interests, on the other hand, often have a vested interest in environmental issues due to their potential impacts on trade and investment.

Civil society organizations (CSOs) have been instrumental in advocating for environmental protection and sustainable development. They often act as watchdogs, monitoring compliance with environmental agreements and policies, and advocating for stronger measures when necessary. CSOs also play a crucial role in raising public awareness about environmental issues and mobilizing public support for environmental policies.

In the context of environmental treaty-making, CSOs can provide valuable input and expertise. They can help identify potential environmental threats and propose solutions, which can inform the negotiation process. CSOs can also play a role in promoting transparency and accountability in environmental negotiations, by monitoring the negotiation process and advocating for public access to information.

International business interests, particularly those in the energy, manufacturing, and transportation sectors, have a significant impact on the environment. Their activities can lead to environmental degradation and pollution, which can have far-reaching impacts on ecosystems and human health. However, these businesses also have the potential to contribute to environmental solutions. For instance, they can invest in clean technologies and sustainable practices, which can help reduce their environmental footprint and contribute to environmental protection.

In the context of environmental treaty-making, international business interests can play a crucial role in promoting sustainable practices and technologies. They can also provide valuable input and expertise, particularly in areas where they have specialized knowledge or expertise. However, their involvement in environmental negotiations can also raise ethical and transparency concerns, which need to be carefully managed.

In conclusion, the role of civil society and international business interests in environmental treaty-making is crucial. Their involvement can help ensure that environmental agreements are effective, equitable, and sustainable. However, it is important to ensure that their involvement is transparent and accountable, and that their interests do not undermine the overall objectives of environmental protection and sustainable development.

#### 11.5a Understanding the challenges of multi-party negotiations

Multi-party negotiations are a common occurrence in international environmental negotiations. These negotiations involve multiple parties, each with their own interests and concerns. As such, they can be complex and challenging to navigate. In this section, we will explore some of the key challenges of multi-party negotiations and how to address them.

One of the main challenges of multi-party negotiations is the potential for conflicting interests. Each party may have different priorities and goals, making it difficult to reach a consensus. This can lead to gridlock and hinder the negotiation process. To address this challenge, it is important for negotiators to actively listen to each other and understand each party's perspective. This can help to identify common ground and potential compromises that can be made.

Another challenge of multi-party negotiations is the potential for unequal power dynamics. Some parties may have more influence or resources than others, leading to unequal bargaining power. This can result in certain parties being marginalized or their concerns being overlooked. To address this challenge, it is important for negotiators to establish a level playing field and ensure that all parties have an equal opportunity to participate and have their voices heard.

The complexity of multi-party negotiations can also be a challenge. With multiple parties involved, there are more perspectives and interests to consider, making it difficult to reach a consensus. This can also lead to a lack of accountability, as it may not be clear who is responsible for certain decisions or outcomes. To address this challenge, it is important for negotiators to establish clear roles and responsibilities, as well as a system for accountability.

Finally, the potential for external factors to influence the negotiation process can also be a challenge. These external factors may include changes in technology, economic conditions, or political landscapes. They can disrupt the negotiation process and make it difficult to reach a long-term agreement. To address this challenge, it is important for negotiators to regularly reassess the negotiation process and make adjustments as needed to account for external factors.

In conclusion, multi-party negotiations can be challenging, but with proper preparation and strategies, they can also be successful. By understanding and addressing the challenges of multi-party negotiations, negotiators can navigate these complex negotiations and reach mutually beneficial agreements.

#### 11.5b Exploring the problems of treaty enforcement

Treaty enforcement is a crucial aspect of international environmental negotiations. It ensures that parties uphold their commitments and obligations, and promotes accountability. However, there are several challenges that can hinder effective treaty enforcement. In this section, we will explore some of these challenges and discuss potential solutions.

One of the main challenges of treaty enforcement is the lack of a central authority. Unlike domestic laws, international treaties do not have a central enforcement agency. This can make it difficult to ensure compliance and enforce penalties for non-compliance. To address this challenge, it is important for parties to establish a clear and effective enforcement mechanism, such as a compliance committee or a dispute resolution process.

Another challenge of treaty enforcement is the potential for non-compliance. Parties may choose to ignore or violate their commitments, especially if there are no consequences for doing so. This can undermine the effectiveness of the treaty and hinder progress towards environmental goals. To address this challenge, it is important for parties to establish strong enforcement mechanisms, such as penalties for non-compliance, and to regularly monitor and review compliance.

The complexity of international environmental issues can also pose a challenge for treaty enforcement. Environmental problems often have multiple causes and require coordinated efforts from multiple parties. This can make it difficult to determine responsibility and enforce compliance. To address this challenge, it is important for parties to establish clear and specific obligations, and to work together to address complex environmental issues.

Finally, the potential for external factors to influence treaty enforcement must also be considered. Changes in technology, economic conditions, or political landscapes can impact the effectiveness of a treaty and make it difficult to enforce compliance. To address this challenge, it is important for parties to regularly review and update treaties to account for changing circumstances.

In conclusion, treaty enforcement is a crucial aspect of international environmental negotiations, but it also presents several challenges. By establishing effective enforcement mechanisms, regularly monitoring and reviewing compliance, and accounting for external factors, parties can work towards effective treaty enforcement and promote accountability in international environmental negotiations.

### Subsection: 11.6b Exploring how scientific knowledge is incorporated into policy-making

The incorporation of scientific knowledge into policy-making is a complex and dynamic process. It involves the interaction of various stakeholders, including scientists, policymakers, and the public. In this section, we will explore the different ways in which scientific knowledge is incorporated into policy-making, with a focus on the role of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

#### The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)

The IPCC is an international body that assesses the scientific, technical, and socio-economic information relevant to understanding climate change. It was established by the United Nations in 1988 to provide policymakers with a comprehensive, objective, and timely scientific information about climate change. The IPCC does not conduct its own research, but rather reviews and synthesizes existing research from a wide range of sources.

The IPCC operates through three working groups: Working Group I (WGI) assesses the physical science basis of climate change, Working Group II (WGII) assesses the impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability of climate change, and Working Group III (WGIII) assesses the mitigation of climate change. Each working group produces a comprehensive report, which is then reviewed and approved by the IPCC plenary.

#### The Role of the IPCC in Policy-Making

The IPCC plays a crucial role in the incorporation of scientific knowledge into policy-making. Its reports provide policymakers with a comprehensive and objective assessment of the current state of scientific knowledge on climate change. This information is then used to inform policy decisions and negotiations.

The IPCC also plays a key role in bridging the gap between science and policy. Its reports are written in a way that is accessible to policymakers and the public, and they provide clear and concise summaries of the latest scientific research. This helps to ensure that policymakers have a solid understanding of the scientific basis for climate change and its potential impacts.

#### Challenges and Opportunities

Despite its importance, the incorporation of scientific knowledge into policy-making is not without its challenges. One of the main challenges is the potential for political influence on scientific research. As with any scientific research, the work of the IPCC is not immune to this issue. However, the IPCC has strict guidelines in place to ensure the objectivity and integrity of its work.

Another challenge is the potential for scientific uncertainty. Climate change is a complex and dynamic phenomenon, and there are still many uncertainties in our understanding of it. This can make it difficult for policymakers to make decisions based solely on scientific information. However, the IPCC also provides information on the uncertainties in its reports, which can help policymakers to make more informed decisions.

Despite these challenges, the incorporation of scientific knowledge into policy-making presents many opportunities. It allows policymakers to make evidence-based decisions, which can lead to more effective and sustainable solutions to environmental issues. It also promotes transparency and accountability in policy-making, which is crucial in addressing complex and contentious issues like climate change.

In conclusion, the IPCC plays a crucial role in the incorporation of scientific knowledge into policy-making. Its reports provide policymakers with a comprehensive and objective assessment of the current state of scientific knowledge on climate change, and help to bridge the gap between science and policy. Despite the challenges, the incorporation of scientific knowledge into policy-making presents many opportunities for more effective and sustainable environmental negotiations.

### Introduction

The international community has been grappling with the issue of climate change for decades, and in 2009, the world's attention turned to Copenhagen, Denmark, for the United Nations Climate Change Conference. This conference, also known as COP15, was a pivotal moment in the global effort to address climate change. It was here that the international community came together to negotiate a new global agreement on climate change, with the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting the rise in global temperatures.

In this chapter, we will delve into the evaluations of the Copenhagen conference, examining its successes and failures, and the implications of these outcomes for future international environmental negotiations. We will explore the political, economic, and social factors that influenced the negotiations, and the role of key players such as the United States, China, and developing countries.

The Copenhagen conference was a complex and multifaceted event, and its outcomes have been subject to a wide range of interpretations. Some have hailed it as a significant step forward in the global fight against climate change, while others have been more critical, arguing that it fell short of its goals and failed to adequately address the urgency of the issue.

Our aim in this chapter is not to take a position on these debates, but rather to provide a comprehensive and balanced analysis of the Copenhagen conference. We will draw on a wide range of sources, including primary documents, academic research, and media reports, to provide a detailed and nuanced understanding of this important event.

As we navigate through the complexities of the Copenhagen conference, we will also draw on the concepts and theories discussed in previous chapters, providing a practical application of the principles and strategies of international environmental negotiation. This will help us to understand the dynamics of the negotiations, the challenges faced by the negotiators, and the strategies they employed to overcome these challenges.

In the end, our goal is to provide a comprehensive and insightful analysis of the Copenhagen conference, shedding light on its successes and failures, and the lessons it holds for future international environmental negotiations. We hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and policymakers interested in the field of international environmental negotiation.

### Section: 16.2b Evaluating the outcomes of environmental treaties

As mentioned in the previous section, global environmental treaties are often criticized for their lack of effectiveness. This raises the question of how we should evaluate the outcomes of these treaties. In this section, we will explore some key factors to consider when evaluating the outcomes of environmental treaties.

#### 16.2b.1 Consider the Specific Goals and Objectives of the Treaty

Each environmental treaty has its own specific goals and objectives, which are often outlined in the preamble or articles of the treaty. These goals and objectives provide a framework for evaluating the success of the treaty. For example, the Convention on Biological Diversity aims to conserve biodiversity, while the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change aims to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions. By assessing how well these goals and objectives have been achieved, we can determine the overall effectiveness of the treaty.

#### 16.2b.2 Assess the Impact of the Treaty on the Environment

Another important factor to consider when evaluating the outcomes of environmental treaties is the impact of the treaty on the environment. This can be a complex and challenging task, as the effects of environmental policies may not be immediately apparent. However, by conducting scientific studies and monitoring changes in environmental indicators, we can gain a better understanding of the treaty's impact. For example, the Cartagena Protocol on biosafety, which is a related agreement to the Convention on Biological Diversity, has been assessed to have a positive impact on the environment by promoting the safe handling and transport of genetically modified organisms.

#### 16.2b.3 Consider the Role of the Treaty in Addressing Environmental Issues

In addition to assessing the specific goals and objectives of the treaty, it is also important to consider the treaty's role in addressing broader environmental issues. This includes considering the treaty's impact on other environmental agreements and its contribution to global efforts to address environmental problems. For example, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change plays a crucial role in coordinating international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.

#### 16.2b.4 Evaluate the Treaty's Implementation and Enforcement

Finally, it is important to consider the treaty's implementation and enforcement when evaluating its outcomes. This includes assessing the effectiveness of the treaty's monitoring and compliance mechanisms, as well as the level of commitment and action from signatory countries. For example, while the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification aims to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of drought and desertification, its implementation has been criticized for being too slow and inadequate.

In conclusion, evaluating the outcomes of environmental treaties is a complex and multifaceted task. By considering the specific goals and objectives of the treaty, its impact on the environment, its role in addressing environmental issues, and its implementation and enforcement, we can gain a better understanding of the treaty's effectiveness. This information can then be used to inform future negotiations and improve the outcomes of environmental treaties.





### Subsection: 16.3a Understanding the politics of North-South relations in environmental negotiations

The relationship between the North and South in environmental negotiations is a complex and often contentious one. The North, which includes developed countries, has historically been the main contributor to global environmental issues such as climate change and pollution. However, the South, which includes developing countries, often bears the brunt of the consequences of these issues. This has led to a power dynamic in environmental negotiations where the North often holds the upper hand.

#### 16.3a.1 Historical Context of North-South Relations

The relationship between the North and South in environmental negotiations can be traced back to the colonial era. During this time, the North exploited the natural resources of the South for its own economic gain. This led to the degradation of the environment in the South and the perpetuation of environmental injustices.

In the 21st century, emerging problems shared between African states from both North and sub-Saharan Africa have enabled these two regions to reassess their relationship with one another. Some of the most pressing issues for countries across Africa to address in the coming decades include international water usage rights, the impact of climate change on agriculture and the economy, and addressing transnational terror and insurgency movements.

#### 16.3a.2 Environmental Concerns

With the acceleration of climate change and its increasingly tangible impact on agriculture across Africa, governments have sought to encourage the adoption of institutional and economic reforms that foster resilience to climate change at a local and transnational level. This has special urgency because Africa is considered by many scholars to be the area of land most vulnerable to climate variability, particularly given the heavy dependency of the economies of Africa on subsistence agriculture. Despite a dramatic variation in climates across the different zones of the continent, all face formidable hurdles in maintaining their agricultural output. The majority of studies indicate a net negative impact of climate change on crop production, which illustrates why cross-regional African organizations have prioritized combatting the effects of climate change through cooperation on augmenting the adaptive capacity of farmers.

Another issue correlated to the changing climate is the topic of international water usage rights. One prominent case is that of the Nile River, the output of which has been highly disputed throughout history. With rising levels of climate change, a larger proportion of water is lost to evaporation. This is also exacerbated by the population boom of sub-Saharan African countries, which is expected to place further strain on these limited water resources. Egypt, followed by Sudan, have historically held the majority of the rights to the Nile River, while Ethiopia, which is upstream, has been pushing for a larger share. This has led to tensions and conflicts between these countries, highlighting the need for effective environmental negotiations to address these issues.

#### 16.3a.3 Role of Civil Society

Civil society plays a crucial role in environmental negotiations, particularly in the North-South relationship. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other civil society groups have been instrumental in advocating for environmental justice and pushing for stronger environmental policies. They have also been key players in raising awareness and mobilizing public opinion on environmental issues.

In the context of North-South relations, civil society groups have been particularly vocal in advocating for the rights of developing countries in environmental negotiations. They have been instrumental in bringing attention to the historical and ongoing environmental injustices perpetuated by the North and have been key players in pushing for more equitable and just environmental policies.

#### 16.3a.4 Role of International Business Interests

International business interests also play a significant role in environmental negotiations. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, businesses have a significant impact on the environment, both positive and negative. They also have a vested interest in maintaining a stable and sustainable environment for their operations.

In the North-South relationship, international business interests have been a driving force behind the push for more sustainable and environmentally friendly practices. They have also been key players in promoting the adoption of new technologies and policies that aim to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change and other environmental issues.

However, there have also been concerns about the role of international business interests in environmental negotiations. Some argue that their primary motivation is profit, which may lead to conflicts of interest and hinder the effectiveness of environmental policies.

In conclusion, the politics of North-South relations in environmental negotiations are complex and multifaceted. The role of civil society and international business interests is crucial in promoting more equitable and sustainable environmental policies. As we continue to face pressing environmental issues, it is essential to address these political dynamics to achieve effective and just environmental negotiations.





### Section: 16.3b Exploring the role of civil society and international business interests in environmental treaty-making

The role of civil society and international business interests in environmental treaty-making is crucial. Civil society, which includes non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and grassroots movements, plays a vital role in advocating for environmental protection and holding governments and businesses accountable for their environmental impact. International business interests, on the other hand, have a significant influence on environmental policies and regulations due to their economic power and global reach.

#### 16.3b.1 Role of Civil Society

Civil society plays a crucial role in environmental treaty-making by providing a platform for marginalized communities and environmental activists to voice their concerns and advocate for their rights. NGOs, in particular, have been instrumental in raising awareness about environmental issues and pushing for action from governments and businesses. For instance, NGOs played a crucial role in the negotiations leading to the adoption of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

Moreover, civil society also plays a vital role in monitoring and enforcing environmental agreements. NGOs and grassroots movements often conduct their own research and investigations to hold governments and businesses accountable for their environmental impact. This information is then used to pressure governments to take action and enforce environmental regulations.

#### 16.3b.2 Role of International Business Interests

International business interests also play a significant role in environmental treaty-making. As major contributors to global environmental issues such as climate change and pollution, businesses have a responsibility to address these issues and contribute to their solutions. This is especially true for multinational corporations (MNCs) that operate in multiple countries and have a significant impact on the environment.

MNCs have been increasingly involved in environmental treaty-making, particularly in the development and implementation of environmental regulations. For instance, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) has been actively involved in the negotiations leading to the adoption of the Paris Agreement on climate change. MNCs have also been instrumental in promoting sustainable practices and technologies that can help mitigate environmental issues.

However, international business interests also face criticism for their role in environmental treaty-making. Some argue that businesses have too much influence over environmental policies and regulations, leading to weak or inadequate measures. This is particularly true for developing countries, where businesses often have more power and influence than local communities.

In conclusion, the role of civil society and international business interests in environmental treaty-making is crucial. Civil society provides a platform for marginalized communities and environmental activists to advocate for their rights, while international business interests have a responsibility to address environmental issues and contribute to their solutions. However, it is essential to ensure that their influence does not undermine the effectiveness of environmental policies and regulations.
