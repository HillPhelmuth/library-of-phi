# The Power of Place: Media Technology, Youth, and City Design and Development":


## Foreward

Welcome to "The Power of Place: Media Technology, Youth, and City Design and Development". This book aims to explore the intersection of media technology, youth, and city design and development, and how these elements shape our understanding of place.

As we delve into the complexities of urban environments, we will be guided by the concept of locative media, a term that encompasses a range of technologies and practices that use digital media to navigate and interact with physical spaces. This includes technologies such as Global Positioning System (GPS), mobile phones, Geographic Information System (GIS), and web map services like Google Maps and OpenStreetMap.

Locative media is not just about technology, though. It is also about creativity and representation. As we move through urban environments, we make sense of our surroundings and interact with others in ways that are shaped by our understanding of place. Locative media, with its ability to trace our movements and interactions, can provide a poetic form of data visualization that helps us understand these dynamics.

However, the use of locative media is not without its challenges. As we navigate through the dynamism and hybridity of cities, we often encounter issues of privacy, security, and social exclusion. These are complex issues that require careful consideration and discussion.

In this book, we will explore these themes in depth, drawing on a wide range of disciplinary perspectives and methodologies. We will also be guided by the insights of young people, who often have a unique and nuanced understanding of the places they inhabit.

This book is intended for advanced undergraduate students at MIT, but we hope that it will be of interest to a wider audience. We invite you to join us on this journey of exploration and discovery, as we uncover the power of place in the digital age.

#### 2.1b Neighborhood History

The history of Norwood, Bronx is deeply intertwined with its physical and social characteristics. The neighborhood was originally part of the Bronx Kill, a tidal strait that separated the Bronx from Manhattan. However, in the late 19th century, the Kill was filled in and the land was developed into a working-class neighborhood.

The neighborhood's history is marked by a series of migrations, each of which has shaped its current demographic and cultural landscape. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many Italian and Jewish immigrants settled in Norwood, bringing with them their own unique cultures and traditions. This period saw the construction of many of the neighborhood's historic buildings, including the John W. Judd House, the Clifford R. Pearsall House, and the Henry Luce House, all of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In the mid-20th century, Norwood experienced a second wave of migration, this time from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. This influx of Latin American immigrants has contributed to the neighborhood's vibrant and diverse cultural scene, with many residents speaking Spanish at home.

The neighborhood's history is also marked by periods of urban decay and revitalization. In the 1960s and 1970s, Norwood, like many other neighborhoods in the Bronx, experienced a period of decline due to disinvestment and neglect. However, in the 1980s and 1990s, the neighborhood underwent a revitalization, with the construction of new housing and the restoration of many historic buildings.

Today, Norwood continues to evolve, with new developments and renovations transforming its physical landscape. However, the neighborhood's rich history and cultural diversity remain at its core, shaping its identity and character. Understanding this history is crucial for anyone seeking to understand and engage with the neighborhood.

#### 2.1c Neighborhood Challenges

Despite its rich history and recent revitalization, Norwood, like many other neighborhoods in the Bronx, faces a number of challenges. These challenges are often interconnected and require a multifaceted approach to address them effectively.

One of the most pressing challenges facing Norwood is its high poverty rate. According to the 2000 United States Census, 38.4% of the neighborhood's residents live below the poverty line. This is significantly higher than the citywide average of 21.1%. Poverty is a complex issue that is often linked to other social and economic factors, such as education, employment, and healthcare. Addressing poverty in Norwood will require a comprehensive approach that addresses these underlying issues.

Another challenge facing Norwood is its high crime rate. The neighborhood has one of the highest rates of violent crime in the city, with 105.8 violent crimes per 10,000 residents in 2000. This is more than twice the citywide average. Crime is a major concern for residents and has a significant impact on the quality of life in the neighborhood. Addressing crime in Norwood will require a combination of strategies, including increased police presence, community engagement, and job training programs for at-risk youth.

#### 15.1a Definition of Youth

The term "youth" is a socially constructed category that encompasses a wide range of ages and experiences. Around the world, the English terms "youth", "adolescent", "teenager", "kid", "youngster", and "young person" are often interchanged, but they may also have different meanings depending on the context. In general, "youth" refers to the time of life when one is young, and it may also include childhood. However, the term "adolescence" specifically refers to a specific age range during a particular developmental period in a person's life.

The United Nations defines "youth" as persons between the ages of roughly 15 and 24, with all UN statistics based on this range. The UN states education as a source for these statistics. However, the UN also recognizes that this varies without prejudice to other age groups listed by member states such as 18â30. A useful distinction within the UN itself can be made between teenagers (i.e. those between the ages of 13 and 19) and young adults (those between the ages of 20 and 29). While seeking to impose some uniformity on statistical approaches, the UN is aware of contradictions between approaches in its own statutes. Hence, under the 15â24 definition (introduced in 1981) children are defined as those under the age of 14 (someone 13 and younger) while under the 1979 Convention on the Rights of the Child, those under the age of 18 are regarded as children. The UN also states they are aware that several definitions exist for youth within UN entities such as Youth Habitat 15â32, NCSL 12-24, and African Youth Charter 15â35.

In November 2020, the State Duma of the Russian Federation approved a project to raise the cap on the age of young people from 30 to 35 years (the range now extending from 14 to 35 years). This highlights the fluidity and complexity of defining youth, as even within a single country, there may be varying definitions and age ranges.

The role of youth in city design and development is crucial, as they are the future leaders and inhabitants of these cities. Their involvement and input are essential in creating a livable and sustainable urban environment.

## Chapter: The Power of Place: Media Technology, Youth, and City Design and Development

### Introduction

In today's digital age, media technology plays a crucial role in shaping the way we interact with our surroundings. From social media platforms to virtual reality experiences, media technology has the power to influence our perceptions and behaviors. This is especially true for the younger generation, who have grown up surrounded by technology and are often referred to as "digital natives". As cities continue to evolve and adapt to the changing needs of their inhabitants, it is important to consider the impact of media technology on city design and development. In this chapter, we will explore the power of media technology in shaping our cities and how it can be harnessed to create more inclusive and engaging urban spaces.





### Introduction

The role of youth in city design and development is a crucial aspect that cannot be overlooked. As the future leaders and inhabitants of these cities, their input and involvement are essential in creating a livable and sustainable urban environment. This chapter will explore the various ways in which youth contribute to the design and development of cities, and the impact of their involvement on the overall urban landscape.

The youth of today are digital natives, born and raised in a world where technology is ubiquitous. They are often referred to as "digital natives" due to their natural affinity and comfort with technology. This digital literacy and familiarity with media technology make them valuable assets in the design and development of cities. Their understanding of technology and its potential can bring fresh perspectives and innovative ideas to the table.

Moreover, the youth are the ones who will be living and working in these cities in the future. Their input and involvement are crucial in creating a city that meets their needs and aspirations. By involving them in the design and development process, cities can ensure that their future inhabitants are invested in the urban environment and have a sense of ownership over it.

This chapter will also delve into the challenges and opportunities that arise when involving youth in city design and development. While there are certainly challenges, such as ensuring their voices are heard and their ideas are implemented, the benefits of their involvement far outweigh these challenges. By harnessing the power of youth, cities can create a more inclusive and sustainable urban environment for all.

In the following sections, we will explore the various ways in which youth contribute to city design and development, and the impact of their involvement on the overall urban landscape. We will also discuss the role of media technology in this process and how it can be used to empower youth and shape the future of our cities. 





### Subsection: 19.1a Definition of Youth

The term "youth" is a socially constructed category that encompasses a wide range of ages and developmental stages. It is often interchanged with other terms such as "adolescent", "teenager", "kid", "youngster", and "young person". However, these terms are not always synonymous and can have different meanings depending on the context.

The United Nations defines youth as persons between the ages of roughly 15 and 24. This definition is based on education statistics and is used consistently across all UN statistics. However, the UN also recognizes that this varies without prejudice to other age groups listed by member states. For instance, some countries may define youth as those between the ages of 18 and 30.

The UN also makes a useful distinction within its own statutes between teenagers (i.e., those between the ages of 13 and 19) and young adults (those between the ages of 20 and 29). This distinction is important in understanding the different needs and perspectives of youth at different stages of their development.

However, the UN is aware of contradictions between approaches in its own statutes. For example, under the 15â24 definition, children are defined as those under the age of 14, while under the 1979 Convention on the Rights of the Child, those under the age of 18 are regarded as children. This inconsistency highlights the complexity of defining youth and the need for a more comprehensive and inclusive approach.

In Russia, the State Duma recently approved a project to raise the cap on the age of young people from 30 to 35 years. This extension of the age range from 14 to 35 years demonstrates the evolving nature of youth definitions and the ongoing efforts to better understand and support this diverse group.

In conclusion, the definition of youth is a complex and multifaceted issue. It is influenced by various factors, including cultural norms, legal frameworks, and developmental stages. As we continue to explore the role of youth in city design and development, it is important to keep in mind the diversity and complexity of this group and the need for inclusive and comprehensive definitions.

#### The Spatial City: A Case Study of Yona Friedman's Design

Yona Friedman's concept of the "Spatial City" is a prime example of how the physical and social environment can shape city design. Friedman's design, which was first proposed in the 1960s, was based on the concept of "mobile architecture". This design approach involves raising buildings on piles, which allows for the creation of a three-dimensional city. This design was influenced by Friedman's observation of the urban environment, particularly the voids between buildings and the need for more flexible and adaptable urban spaces.

The Spatial City is designed to span across different levels, creating a tiered structure. This tiering allows for the creation of different types of spaces, each with its own function. The lower level is earmarked for public life and community services, while the upper levels are reserved for residential and commercial use. This design not only creates a more efficient use of space but also promotes a sense of community and social interaction.

Friedman's design also incorporates the concept of a "Flatwriter", a tool that allows residents to configure their living spaces within a grid-like structure. This concept highlights the importance of individuality and flexibility in urban design.

#### The Smart City: A Case Study of Singapore's Urban Redevelopment

Singapore's urban redevelopment, particularly in the Marina Bay area, provides a case study of how media technology can influence city design.

It involves the management of a wide range of locations, including public and private spaces of various sizes and geographical spaces. Place management can take different forms, depending on the origins of the resources that support it and the degree of formality that underpins the agreement to secure these resources from various funding bodies.

One example is a community-based approach to place management, where local communities are actively involved in the decision-making process. This approach recognizes the importance of place attachment and the role it plays in shaping the development of a city. By involving local communities in the management of their places, this approach aims to create a sense of ownership and responsibility, fostering a sense of place and contributing to the overall development of the city.

#### Case Study 3: Place Branding in Smart Cities

The concept of place branding has gained significant attention in the context of smart cities. Smart cities, which leverage technology and data to improve the quality of life for their inhabitants, often use place branding as a strategy to attract businesses, tourists, and residents. By leveraging their unique characteristics and attributes, smart cities can create a positive image and attract investment and development.

For instance, the city of Barcelona, Spain, has successfully branded itself as a smart and sustainable city. The city's branding strategy has been instrumental in attracting businesses and tourists, contributing to its economic growth and development.

These case studies highlight the power of place in city development. They demonstrate how place can shape the development of a city, influencing its physical, social, cultural, and economic aspects.

This understanding will be crucial in designing and implementing effective smart city solutions.

#### The Role of Youth in Shaping the Future of Cities

Youth play a crucial role in shaping the future of our cities. As digital natives, they are often at the forefront of adopting and using new media technologies. Their unique perspectives and experiences can provide valuable insights into the future of our cities.

Moreover, youth are often the ones who will inherit the cities we are building today. As such, it is important to involve them in the planning and development process. This not only ensures that their needs and perspectives are considered, but also empowers them to take ownership of their cities.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, the future of our cities will be shaped by the intersection of media technology and youth. As we continue to embrace and integrate media technology into our cities, it is important to consider the implications for the future. This includes understanding the needs and perspectives of our youth, and involving them in the planning and development process.
