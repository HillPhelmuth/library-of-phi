### Subsection 1.4a Understanding Path Dependence

Path dependence is a concept that is central to understanding the evolution of energy systems. It refers to the idea that the decisions made in the past can have a significant impact on the future, and that these impacts can be difficult to predict or control. In the context of energy systems, path dependence can be seen in the choices made about energy sources, technologies, and policies.

#### 1.4a.1 Path Dependence in Energy Systems

The energy sector is characterized by a high degree of path dependence. The decisions made about energy sources, technologies, and policies can have long-lasting effects on the system. For instance, the decision to invest in a particular energy source can lead to a commitment to that source for many years to come, as the infrastructure and expertise required to switch to a different source can be costly and time-consuming.

Moreover, the decisions made about energy systems can also have cascading effects on other sectors of the economy. For example, the decision to invest in a particular energy source can have implications for employment, trade, and economic growth. These effects can be difficult to predict and can lead to path dependence in other sectors of the economy.

#### 1.4a.2 Analyzing Path Dependence in Energy Systems

Analyzing path dependence in energy systems involves understanding the intertemporal trade-offs and lock-ins that can arise from decisions made about energy sources, technologies, and policies. This requires a deep understanding of the energy system and its interactions with other sectors of the economy.

One approach to analyzing path dependence is through the use of dynamic systems models. These models can capture the complex interactions between different components of the energy system and can help to identify potential path dependencies. However, these models also have limitations, as they often rely on simplifying assumptions and can be difficult to validate.

Another approach is through the use of historical analysis. By studying the evolution of energy systems over time, it is possible to identify patterns of path dependence and to understand the factors that have contributed to these patterns. This approach can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of energy systems and can help to inform future decisions.

In conclusion, understanding path dependence is crucial for making informed decisions about energy systems. It requires a deep understanding of the system and its interactions with other sectors of the economy, as well as a careful analysis of the potential impacts of decisions made today on the system in the future.




### Subsection 1.4b Path Dependence in Energy Systems

#### 1.4b.1 Path Dependence and Energy System Evolution

The concept of path dependence is particularly relevant in the context of energy system evolution. The decisions made about energy sources, technologies, and policies can have long-lasting effects on the system, and these effects can be difficult to predict or control. This is because the energy sector is characterized by a high degree of path dependence, with decisions made in the past having a significant impact on the future.

For instance, the decision to invest in a particular energy source can lead to a commitment to that source for many years to come. This is due to the infrastructure and expertise required to switch to a different source, which can be costly and time-consuming. This commitment can then lead to a lock-in, where the system is stuck with the chosen energy source for a long time, even if more efficient or sustainable alternatives become available in the future.

#### 1.4b.2 Path Dependence and Energy System Complexity

The complexity of energy systems also contributes to path dependence. Energy systems are characterized by a high degree of complexity, with many interconnected components and subsystems. This complexity can make it difficult to predict the effects of decisions made about energy sources, technologies, and policies. For example, the decision to invest in a particular energy source can have cascading effects on other sectors of the economy, such as employment, trade, and economic growth. These effects can be difficult to predict and can lead to path dependence in other sectors of the economy.

#### 1.4b.3 Analyzing Path Dependence in Energy Systems

Analyzing path dependence in energy systems involves understanding the intertemporal trade-offs and lock-ins that can arise from decisions made about energy sources, technologies, and policies. This requires a deep understanding of the energy system and its interactions with other sectors of the economy. One approach to analyzing path dependence is through the use of dynamic systems models, which can capture the complex interactions between different components of the energy system. These models can help to identify potential path dependencies and inform decisions about energy sources, technologies, and policies.




### Subsection 1.4c Implications of Path Dependence

The implications of path dependence in energy systems are far-reaching and complex. They can be understood in terms of the concept of "strategic complementarities", as discussed by David G. Victor. Strategic complementarities refer to the situation where the decisions of different actors can have synergistic effects, leading to a self-reinforcing cycle of decisions.

#### 1.4c.1 Strategic Complementarities in Energy Systems

In the context of energy systems, strategic complementarities can arise from the intertemporal trade-offs and lock-ins that result from decisions made about energy sources, technologies, and policies. For instance, the decision to invest in a particular energy source can lead to a commitment to that source, which can then lead to a lock-in. This lock-in can then reinforce the initial decision, creating a self-reinforcing cycle.

This can have significant implications for the evolution of energy systems. For example, if a country invests heavily in a particular energy source, it may become locked into that source for many years to come. This can limit the ability of the country to switch to more efficient or sustainable alternatives in the future, even if these alternatives become available.

#### 1.4c.2 Strategic Complementarities and Energy System Evolution

The concept of strategic complementarities can also be applied to the evolution of energy systems. As energy systems evolve, decisions made at different points in time can have synergistic effects, leading to a self-reinforcing cycle of decisions. This can result in a path-dependent evolution of the energy system, where decisions made in the past continue to influence the system in the future.

For instance, the decision to invest in a particular energy source can lead to a commitment to that source, which can then lead to a lock-in. This lock-in can then reinforce the initial decision, creating a self-reinforcing cycle. This can result in a path-dependent evolution of the energy system, where decisions made in the past continue to influence the system in the future.

#### 1.4c.3 Strategic Complementarities and Energy System Complexity

The concept of strategic complementarities can also be applied to the complexity of energy systems. As energy systems become more complex, with more interconnected components and subsystems, the decisions made about these components and subsystems can have synergistic effects, leading to a self-reinforcing cycle of decisions. This can result in a high degree of path dependence in the energy system, where decisions made in the past continue to influence the system in the future.

For instance, the decision to invest in a particular energy source can lead to a commitment to that source, which can then lead to a lock-in. This lock-in can then reinforce the initial decision, creating a self-reinforcing cycle. This can result in a high degree of path dependence in the energy system, where decisions made in the past continue to influence the system in the future.

### Section: 2.1 Understanding Climate Science and Policy:

Climate change is a complex and pressing issue that requires a comprehensive understanding of both climate science and policy. In this section, we will explore the basics of climate science, including the causes and effects of climate change, and the role of energy decisions in contributing to it. We will also delve into the policies and strategies being implemented to address climate change, and the role of energy decisions in shaping these policies.

#### 2.1a Basics of Climate Science

Climate change is primarily caused by the increase in greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, in the Earth's atmosphere. These gases trap heat, leading to changes in temperature and weather patterns. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has reported that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by 40% since the Industrial Revolution, and is expected to continue to rise in the future.

The effects of climate change are vast and varied, and can be seen in changes in temperature, sea levels, and weather patterns. For example, the Earth's average temperature has increased by 1.1Â°C since the pre-industrial era, and is expected to continue to rise in the future. This rise in temperature has led to more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, and floods, all of which have significant impacts on human societies and the environment.

Energy decisions play a crucial role in contributing to climate change. The majority of greenhouse gas emissions are from the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, for energy production. In fact, the energy sector is responsible for 74% of global emissions. This highlights the need for a shift towards cleaner and more sustainable energy sources, such as renewable energy, in order to reduce our carbon footprint and mitigate the effects of climate change.

#### 2.1b Climate Policy and Energy Decisions

In response to the growing threat of climate change, governments, businesses, and individuals around the world are taking action to reduce their carbon footprint and mitigate the effects of climate change. This includes implementing policies and strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote the use of renewable energy.

One such policy is carbon pricing, which puts a financial cost on emitting carbon dioxide. This can be done through a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system, where companies are given a limit on the amount of carbon dioxide they can emit and can buy and sell emission permits. This policy aims to incentivize companies to reduce their emissions and invest in cleaner energy sources.

Another important aspect of climate policy is energy efficiency. By reducing energy consumption, we can decrease the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector. This can be achieved through various means, such as improving building insulation, promoting energy-efficient transportation, and implementing smart grid technologies.

#### 2.1c Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, there are also efforts being made to adapt to the effects of climate change. This includes building resilience to extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and floods, and developing strategies for managing the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and biodiversity.

Climate change mitigation and adaptation are crucial for addressing the complex and pressing issue of climate change. By reducing our carbon footprint and adapting to the effects of climate change, we can work towards a more sustainable future for our planet.

### Clinton administration

Upon the start of his presidency in 1993, Bill Clinton committed the United States to lowering their greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000 through his biodiversity treaty, reflecting his attempt to return the United States to the global platform of climate policy. Clinton's British Thermal Unit (BTU) Tax and Climate Change Action Plan were also announced within the first year of his presidency, calling for a tax on energy heat content and plans for energy efficiency and joint implementations, respectively.

The Climate Change Action Plan was announced on October 19, 1993. This plan aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. Clinton described this goal as "ambitious but achievable," and called for 44 action steps to achieve this goal. Among these steps were voluntary participation by industry, especially those in the commercial and energy supply fields. Clinton allotted $1.9 billion to fund this plan from the federal budget and called for an additional $60 billion funding to come voluntarily from businesses and industries.

The British Thermal Tax proposed by Clinton in early 1993 called for a tax on producers of gasoline, oil, and other fuels based on fuel content in accordance to the British Thermal Unit (BTU). The British Thermal Unit is a measure of heat corresponding to the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The tax also applied to electricity produced by hydro and nuclear power, but exempted renewable energy sources such as geothermal, solar, and wind. The Clinton administration also implemented a cap-and-trade system, where companies could buy and sell emission permits, as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

#### 2.1b Climate Policy Overview

Climate policy refers to the actions and strategies implemented by governments and organizations to address climate change. These policies aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to the impacts of climate change, and mitigate its effects. The Clinton administration, for example, implemented various climate policies, including the BTU Tax and the Climate Change Action Plan.

The BTU Tax, proposed by Clinton in early 1993, aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by taxing producers of gasoline, oil, and other fuels based on their fuel content. This tax also applied to electricity produced by hydro and nuclear power, but exempted renewable energy sources such as geothermal, solar, and wind. This policy was meant to incentivize the use of cleaner and more sustainable energy sources.

The Climate Change Action Plan, announced in October 1993, aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. This plan involved 44 action steps, including voluntary participation by industry and a cap-and-trade system for emission permits. Clinton also allotted $1.9 billion to fund this plan from the federal budget and called for an additional $60 billion funding to come voluntarily from businesses and industries.

These policies demonstrate the importance of energy decisions in shaping climate policy. By implementing policies that incentivize the use of cleaner and more sustainable energy sources, we can reduce our carbon footprint and mitigate the effects of climate change. However, it is also important to consider the potential unintended consequences of these policies, such as the potential for job losses in the fossil fuel industry. As we continue to address climate change, it is crucial to carefully consider the potential impacts of our policies and work towards a just and equitable transition towards a low-carbon future.





### Section: 2.1 Understanding Climate Science and Policy:

Climate science and policy are two interconnected fields that aim to understand and address the complex issue of climate change. Climate science focuses on studying the Earth's climate system, including its physical, chemical, and biological components, and how they interact to influence the climate. Policy, on the other hand, involves the development and implementation of strategies and regulations to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change.

#### 2.1a Climate Science Basics

Climate science is a multidisciplinary field that combines aspects of meteorology, oceanography, geology, and other sciences to understand the Earth's climate system. The climate system is a complex web of interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice. Changes in any of these components can have cascading effects on the entire system, leading to changes in temperature, precipitation, and other climate variables.

One of the key tools used in climate science is climate modeling. Climate models are mathematical representations of the climate system that simulate the interactions between different components of the system. These models are used to study the effects of various factors on the climate, such as greenhouse gas emissions, land use changes, and natural variability.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a leading international body that provides scientific information on climate change. The IPCC has developed a set of climate models, known as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), which are used to study the effects of climate change on a global scale.

However, there are alternative energy sources and technologies that can significantly reduce these emissions. These include renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydro power, as well as energy-efficient technologies and practices. The transition to these cleaner energy sources and technologies is not only crucial for mitigating climate change but also presents opportunities for economic growth and energy security.

In this chapter, we will explore these topics in depth, providing a comprehensive understanding of the energy-climate change nexus. We will also discuss the policies and market dynamics that influence energy decisions and their impact on climate change. By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the role of energy systems in climate change and the potential for energy decisions to address it.




### Section: 2.2 Analyzing Climate Agreement Negotiations I:

Climate agreement negotiations are a crucial aspect of international climate policy. These negotiations involve countries coming together to discuss and agree on actions to address climate change. The goal of these negotiations is to reach a consensus on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to the impacts of climate change, and finance these efforts.

#### 2.2a History of Climate Agreement Negotiations

The history of climate agreement negotiations dates back to the 1990s when the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted. The UNFCCC is a legally binding international agreement that sets the overall framework for addressing climate change. It aims to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system.

The first major climate agreement was the Kyoto Protocol, which was adopted in 1997. The Kyoto Protocol set binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions for developed countries and established a framework for international cooperation on climate change. However, the United States, one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases, did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol.

In 2015, the Paris Agreement was adopted. This agreement set a goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with a target of 1.5 degrees Celsius. It also included provisions for countries to increase their commitments over time and for developed countries to provide financial support to developing countries for climate action.

The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26, was a major milestone in climate agreement negotiations. This conference aimed to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and to increase ambition in national climate plans. It also aimed to secure commitments from countries to reduce emissions from deforestation and land use change, as well as to phase out coal power.

### Subsection: 2.2c Challenges in Climate Agreement Negotiations

Climate agreement negotiations are complex and involve a wide range of stakeholders with varying interests and priorities. As such, there are several challenges that arise during these negotiations. In this section, we will discuss some of the key challenges in climate agreement negotiations.

#### Lack of Consensus on Climate Change Science

One of the biggest challenges in climate agreement negotiations is the lack of consensus on the science of climate change. While the vast majority of scientists agree that climate change is real and caused by human activities, there are still some skeptics who dispute this. This makes it difficult to reach a consensus on the urgency and need for action.

#### Differing Priorities and Interests

Another challenge in climate agreement negotiations is the differing priorities and interests of the various stakeholders involved. Developed countries may prioritize economic growth and energy security, while developing countries may prioritize poverty reduction and economic development. These differing priorities can make it difficult to reach a consensus on the best course of action.

#### Complexity of Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation

Climate change is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive and coordinated response. Mitigating climate change involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions, while adaptation involves preparing for and responding to the impacts of climate change. These two aspects are interconnected and require a coordinated approach, which can be challenging to achieve.

#### Lack of Enforcement Mechanisms

Many climate agreements rely on voluntary commitments from countries. However, there is often a lack of enforcement mechanisms to ensure that these commitments are met. This can make it difficult to hold countries accountable for their actions and can lead to a lack of progress in addressing climate change.

#### Political Barriers

Political barriers can also pose a challenge in climate agreement negotiations. In some countries, there may be political opposition to taking action on climate change, making it difficult to reach a consensus on the issue. Additionally, the political landscape can change quickly, making it challenging to reach long-term agreements.

In conclusion, climate agreement negotiations are complex and involve a wide range of challenges. However, with the right approach and collaboration, these challenges can be addressed, and progress can be made towards a more sustainable future.





### Subsection: 2.3a Case Study: Kyoto Protocol

The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, was the first international agreement to set binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It was a significant step towards addressing the global climate problem, but it also faced several challenges in its negotiations and implementation.

#### Negotiations

The negotiations for the Kyoto Protocol were complex and contentious. The United States, one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases, initially refused to ratify the protocol, citing concerns about its economic impact and the lack of commitments from developing countries. However, under the leadership of President Bill Clinton, the US eventually signed the protocol in 1998.

The negotiations also faced challenges from developing countries, who argued that they should not be held responsible for reducing emissions as they were not the main contributors to the problem. However, the protocol included provisions for developing countries to receive financial and technological assistance to help them reduce their emissions.

#### Implementation

The implementation of the Kyoto Protocol also faced challenges. The protocol set a target of reducing emissions by 5% below 1990 levels by 2012. However, many countries struggled to meet this target, and some even increased their emissions. This was due to a variety of factors, including economic growth, changes in energy sources, and difficulties in accurately measuring and reporting emissions.

#### The Clean Development Mechanism

One of the key features of the Kyoto Protocol was the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which allowed developed countries to reduce their emissions by investing in emission-reducing projects in developing countries. This was seen as a way to both reduce emissions and help developing countries adapt to the impacts of climate change.

However, the CDM faced criticism for its complexity and lack of effectiveness. Many projects were criticized for being too expensive or not resulting in significant emissions reductions. Additionally, the CDM was seen as a way for developed countries to meet their targets without making significant changes to their own emissions.

#### The Kyoto Protocol Today

Today, the Kyoto Protocol remains in force, but its effectiveness is limited. Many countries, including the US, have not ratified the protocol, and those that have often struggle to meet their targets. The protocol has also faced criticism for not addressing the growing emissions from developing countries, particularly China and India.

Despite its limitations, the Kyoto Protocol was a significant step towards addressing the global climate problem. It set the stage for future climate agreements and has helped to raise awareness and understanding of the issue. However, it also highlights the challenges and complexities of negotiating and implementing effective climate policies.





### Subsection: 2.3b Case Study: Paris Agreement

The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, is the latest international agreement aimed at addressing the global climate problem. It builds upon the Kyoto Protocol and aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with a goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Paris Agreement also includes provisions for countries to regularly report on their emissions and progress towards their targets, as well as to increase their commitments over time.

#### Negotiations

The negotiations for the Paris Agreement were complex and contentious, much like those for the Kyoto Protocol. The United States, under the leadership of President Barack Obama, played a key role in the negotiations, working closely with other countries to reach a consensus. The negotiations also faced challenges from developing countries, who argued for more support and resources to help them adapt to the impacts of climate change.

#### Implementation

The implementation of the Paris Agreement is still in its early stages, but it faces many of the same challenges as the Kyoto Protocol. Countries are struggling to meet their targets, and there is a lack of consensus on how to accurately measure and report emissions. However, there is also a growing sense of urgency and commitment to addressing the climate problem, with many countries announcing ambitious targets and plans for reducing their emissions.

#### Analyzing Climate Agreement Negotiations II

The Paris Agreement represents a significant step forward in the global effort to address the climate problem. It sets more ambitious targets and includes provisions for increased transparency and accountability. However, there are still many challenges to overcome, and it will be crucial for countries to work together to implement the agreement effectively.

In the next section, we will explore the role of energy markets in the global climate problem and how energy decisions can help mitigate its impacts.

### Subsection: 3.2a Understanding Normative Frameworks

In the previous section, we explored various strategies for reducing energy use. However, the effectiveness of these strategies can vary depending on the normative framework within which they are implemented. A normative framework is a set of principles, values, and beliefs that guide decision-making and behavior. In the context of energy demand, normative frameworks can influence how individuals and businesses approach energy use and conservation.

#### The Role of Normative Frameworks in Energy Decisions

Normative frameworks play a crucial role in shaping energy decisions. They influence our perceptions of energy use, conservation, and efficiency. For instance, a normative framework that values sustainability and environmental stewardship may lead to a greater willingness to invest in energy-efficient technologies and renewable energy sources. On the other hand, a normative framework that prioritizes economic growth and profit may lead to a more lax approach to energy use and conservation.

#### Critiques of Normative Frameworks

While normative frameworks can provide a useful lens for understanding energy decisions, they are not without their criticisms. Some scholars argue that the concept of normative frameworks can be problematic due to its structural bias. This bias can lead to a skewed understanding of individual action and decision-making. For example, Ole Jacob Sending argues that the logic of appropriateness, a key component of normative frameworks, has a structural bias that makes it untenable as a theory of individual action.

Kjell Goldmann also critiques the concept of normative frameworks, arguing that it is difficult to determine what kind of constructs they are. He also charges that the logics of appropriateness and consequences overlap considerably, which makes their analytic utility debatable. Moreover, Goldmann finds that March and Olsen do not adequately distinguish between the actions of individuals and collectivities, which is important because one logic may predominate at the level of individuals within an organization and another logic at the level of the organization itself.

#### Emotional Underpinnings of Normative Motivation

Another critique of normative frameworks is that they neglect the emotional underpinnings of normative motivation. March and Olsen acknowledge that human decision-making may be driven by emotion. However, their conceptualization of the logic of appropriateness disregards the role of emotion and focuses solely on its cognitive and normative components. This is problematic, as research in neuroscience and psychology suggests that emotion plays a key role in normative action. Emotions endow norms and identities with meaning, and if people feel strongly about norms, they are particularly likely to adhere to them. Rules that cease to resonate at an affective level, however, often come to lose their prescriptive power.

In conclusion, normative frameworks play a crucial role in shaping energy decisions. However, they are not without their criticisms, and it is important to consider these criticisms when evaluating their usefulness in understanding energy demand.

### Subsection: 3.2b Evaluating Normative Frameworks

In the previous subsection, we explored the role of normative frameworks in energy decisions and the criticisms they have received. In this subsection, we will delve deeper into the process of evaluating normative frameworks, particularly in the context of business decisions.

#### The Process of Evaluating Normative Frameworks

Evaluating normative frameworks involves assessing their effectiveness in guiding decision-making and behavior. This process can be complex and multifaceted, as normative frameworks can influence a wide range of factors, from individual perceptions and attitudes to organizational policies and practices.

One approach to evaluating normative frameworks is to examine their impact on energy decisions. This can involve studying how different normative frameworks influence energy use, conservation, and efficiency in various contexts. For instance, researchers might compare energy decisions in businesses that prioritize economic growth and profit with those that prioritize sustainability and environmental stewardship.

### Subsection: 5.3a Introduction to Shale

Shale is a type of sedimentary rock that is widely distributed throughout the world. It is a fine-grained rock, typically gray in color, and is composed of clay minerals and quartz grains[^4^]. The addition of variable amounts of minor constituents can alter the color of the rock, with red, brown, and green colors indicative of ferric oxide, iron hydroxide, and micaceous minerals, respectively[^4^].

Shales are typically found in sedimentary basins, and their formation is closely linked to the deposition of sediments in these basins. The composition of shales can vary significantly depending on the type of sediments that were deposited in the basin. For example, shales formed in marine environments are typically rich in carbonate minerals, while those formed in freshwater environments are rich in silicate minerals[^4^].

#### Composition and Color of Shale

The color of shale is a key indicator of its composition and the environment in which it was formed. Red, brown, and green colors are indicative of ferric oxide, iron hydroxide, and micaceous minerals, respectively[^4^]. The color shifts from reddish to greenish as iron in the oxidized (ferric) state is converted to iron in the reduced (ferrous) state[^4^]. Black shale results from the presence of greater than one percent carbonaceous material and indicates a reducing environment[^4^]. Pale blue to blue-green shales typically are rich in carbonate minerals[^4^].

Clays are the major constituent of shales and other mudrocks. The clay minerals represented are largely kaolinite, montmorillonite, and illite[^4^]. The transformation of smectite to illite produces silica, sodium, calcium, magnesium, iron, and water[^4^]. These released elements form authigenic quartz, chert, calcite, dolomite, ankerite, hematite, and albite, all trace to minor (except quartz) minerals found in shales and other mudrocks[^4^]. A typical shale is composed of about 58% clay minerals, 28% quartz, 6% feldspar, 5% carbonate minerals, and 2% iron oxides[^4^].

#### Shales and Other Mudrocks

Shales and other mudrocks contain roughly 95 percent of the organic matter in all sedimentary rocks[^4^]. However, this amounts to less than one percent by mass in an average shale[^4^]. Black shales, which form in anoxic conditions, contain reduced free carbon along with ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) and sulfur (S<sup>2âˆ’</sup>)[^4^]. Amorphous iron sulfide, along with carbon, produce the black color of these shales[^4^].

### Subsection: 5.3b Shale Gas and Oil Production

Shale gas and oil production is a relatively new phenomenon in the energy industry, with the first commercial extraction of shale gas in the United States occurring in the 1980s[^5^]. The process involves the use of hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking," to release the gas and oil trapped within the shale rock[^5^]. This process has been controversial due to concerns about water contamination and seismic activity[^5^].

#### Hydraulic Fracturing

Hydraulic fracturing is a process used to extract oil and gas from shale formations. It involves the injection of a fluid mixture, typically composed of water, sand, and chemicals, into the shale rock[^5^]. The pressure of the fluid mixture fractures the rock, creating small cracks that allow the oil and gas to flow out[^5^]. The sand is used to prop open these cracks, while the chemicals help to lubricate the process and prevent the rock from closing back up[^5^].

The fluid mixture is typically injected at high pressures, which can range from 1,500 to 15,000 pounds per square inch (psi)[^5^]. This high pressure can cause the shale rock to fracture and break apart, creating a network of cracks that can extend for hundreds of feet in all directions[^5^]. This process can release large quantities of oil and gas, making shale formations a potentially lucrative source of energy[^5^].

#### Environmental Concerns

Despite its potential benefits, hydraulic fracturing has been a subject of controversy due to its potential environmental impacts[^5^]. The process involves the use of large quantities of water, which can lead to water scarcity in some regions[^5^]. Additionally, the fluid mixture used in hydraulic fracturing can contain harmful chemicals, some of which have been linked to health problems[^5^].

The process of hydraulic fracturing can also lead to seismic activity, as the injection of fluid into the shale rock can cause changes in pressure that can trigger earthquakes[^5^].

One of the earliest and most significant environmental issues in the United States was acid deposition. This phenomenon, which is the result of sulfur and nitrogen dioxide emissions, causes harm to ecosystems and human health. Acid deposition in the Northeast United States from the burning of coal and in the West United States from utilities and motor vehicles caused a number of problems, and was partially exacerbated by the Clean Air Act, which forced coal power plants to use taller smoke stacks, resulting in farther transmission of sulfur dioxide in the air.

During the Carter administration, the United States undertook a risk-averse policy, acting through the EPA and Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to research and control the pollutants suspected to cause acid deposition even in the face of scientific uncertainty. The Reagan administration, on the other hand, was more risk tolerant. It argued that, given the scientific uncertainties about harm and exposure levels, new expenditures should not be undertaken that would curtail energy security and economic growth. However, during George H. W. Bush's presidential campaign, he called for new Clean Air Act legislation to curtail sulfur- and nitrogen-dioxide emissions. In 1990, after he was elected, amendments to the Clean Air Act were finally passed that cut emissions by over 12 million tons per year, set up a market-like system of emissions trading, and set a cap on emissions for the year 2000. These goals were achieved to some degree by the installation of industrial scrubbers.
