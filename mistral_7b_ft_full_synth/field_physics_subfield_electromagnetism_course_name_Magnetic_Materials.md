### Subsection 1.2 Microscopic to Macroscopic Approach

In the study of magnetic materials, it is essential to understand the behavior of these materials at both the microscopic and macroscopic levels. This approach allows us to bridge the gap between the atomic and macroscopic scales, providing a comprehensive understanding of the properties and behavior of magnetic materials.

#### Microscopic Approach

The microscopic approach to studying magnetic materials involves examining the behavior of individual atoms and their interactions. This is typically done through the use of computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. These methods allow us to calculate the electronic and atomic structures of magnetic materials, providing insights into their magnetic properties.

One of the key computational methods used in the microscopic approach is the Multiscale Green's function (MSGF) method. This method combines the Green's function (GF) method, which is used to calculate the electronic structure of a material, with the molecular dynamics (MD) method, which is used to simulate the atomic dynamics of a material. The MSGF method has been used to study a variety of magnetic materials, including quantum dots in semiconductors.

The MSGF method is based on the concept of linking length scales seamlessly. This means that it can connect the atomistic scales of the GF method to the macroscopic scales of the MD method. This is achieved by expressing the Green's function (G) as a function of the position vector (x) of the atom (L), as shown in Eq. (11):

$$
G(L) = G_c(x)
$$

where G<sub>"c"</sub>(x) is the continuum Green's function (CGF), which is defined in terms of the elastic constants and used in modeling of conventional bulk materials at macroscales. This equation shows that the LSGF reduces smoothly and automatically to the CGF for large enough "x", ensuring the seamless linkage of the atomistic length scale to the macroscopic continuum scale.

#### Macroscopic Approach

The macroscopic approach to studying magnetic materials involves examining the behavior of the material as a whole, rather than individual atoms. This is typically done through experimental methods, such as magnetic measurements and microscopy. These methods allow us to determine the macroscopic properties of a material, such as its magnetization and magnetic anisotropy.

One of the key experimental methods used in the macroscopic approach is the magnetic force microscopy (MFM). This method uses a magnetic tip to scan the surface of a magnetic material, providing information about its magnetic properties at the microscopic level. The MFM has been used to study a variety of magnetic materials, including thin films and nanostructures.

In conclusion, the microscopic to macroscopic approach allows us to bridge the gap between the atomic and macroscopic scales, providing a comprehensive understanding of the properties and behavior of magnetic materials. By combining computational and experimental methods, we can gain a deeper understanding of these materials and their applications.

### Section 2.1 Classical Magnetic Moments

In the previous section, we discussed the classical theory of magnetism and its applications. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of classical magnetic moments and their role in magnetism.

#### 2.1a Magnetic Moment of a Dipole

A magnetic moment is a measure of the strength of a magnetic pole. It is defined as the product of the pole strength and the distance between the poles. In classical magnetism, the magnetic moment is represented by the symbol $\mu$. The magnetic moment of a dipole, which is the simplest magnetic system, is given by the equation:

$$
\mu = I A
$$

where $I$ is the current flowing through the dipole and $A$ is the area of the loop. This equation shows that the magnetic moment of a dipole is directly proportional to the current flowing through it and the area of the loop.

The magnetic moment of a dipole is also related to the magnetic field it produces. The magnetic field produced by a dipole is given by the equation:

$$
B = \frac{\mu}{4\pi r^3}
$$

where $r$ is the distance from the dipole. This equation shows that the magnetic field produced by a dipole decreases with the cube of the distance.

The magnetic moment of a dipole is also related to the angular velocity of the loop. The angular velocity of the loop is given by the equation:

$$
\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt}
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle of rotation and $t$ is time. This equation shows that the angular velocity of the loop is directly proportional to the change in angle over time.

The magnetic moment of a dipole is also related to the magnetic field it experiences. The magnetic field experienced by a dipole is given by the equation:

$$
B = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3}
$$

where $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space and $r$ is the distance from the dipole. This equation shows that the magnetic field experienced by a dipole decreases with the cube of the distance.

In summary, the magnetic moment of a dipole is a fundamental concept in classical magnetism. It is related to the current flowing through the dipole, the area of the loop, the angular velocity of the loop, and the magnetic field it experiences. Understanding the magnetic moment of a dipole is crucial in understanding the behavior of more complex magnetic systems.

### Subsection: 3.1a Electron Spin and Magnetic Moment

In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of electron spin and its role in the magnetism of materials. In this section, we will delve deeper into the relationship between electron spin and magnetic moment, and how this relationship is governed by quantum mechanics.

#### Electron Spin and Magnetic Moment

Electron spin is a quantum mechanical property that describes the intrinsic angular momentum of an electron. It is a fundamental property of the electron, much like its mass and charge. The spin of an electron can be either spin-up or spin-down, which corresponds to the two possible orientations of the electron's spin angular momentum.

The magnetic moment of an electron is directly proportional to its spin angular momentum. This relationship is described by the equation:

$$
\boldsymbol{\mu}_\text{s} = -g_\text{s}\,\mu_\text{B}\,\frac{~\mathbf{S}~}{\hbar}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\mu}_\text{s}$ is the spin magnetic moment, $g_\text{s}$ is the spin `g`-factor, $\mu_\text{B}$ is the Bohr magneton, $\mathbf{S}$ is the spin angular momentum, and $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant. The spin `g`-factor is approximately two, which means that the spin magnetic moment is twice as large as the orbital magnetic moment.

The spin `g`-factor arises from the Dirac equation, a relativistic wave equation that describes spin-1/2 particles, such as electrons. The Dirac equation predicts that the `g`-factor for an electron in a magnetic field should be twice the value predicted by the non-relativistic Zewail's equation. This prediction has been confirmed by numerous experiments, including the Stern-Gerlach experiment and the Lamb shift.

#### Spin-Orbit Interaction

The spin-orbit interaction is a key concept in the quantum mechanics of magnetism. It describes the interaction between the spin angular momentum of an electron and its orbital angular momentum. This interaction leads to a shift in the energy levels of the electron, which can have significant implications for the magnetism of materials.

The spin-orbit interaction can be understood in terms of the total angular momentum of the electron. The total angular momentum is the sum of the spin angular momentum and the orbital angular momentum. According to the conservation of angular momentum, the total angular momentum of the electron remains constant. This means that any change in the spin angular momentum must be accompanied by an equal and opposite change in the orbital angular momentum.

The spin-orbit interaction can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\Delta E = \frac{\beta}{2}~\mathbf{L} \cdot \mathbf{S}
$$

where $\Delta E$ is the energy shift, $\beta$ is a constant, and $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{S}$ are the orbital and spin angular momenta, respectively. This equation shows that the energy shift is proportional to the dot product of the orbital and spin angular momenta.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of the spin-orbit interaction for the magnetism of materials, particularly in the context of oxides and metals.

### Subsection: 3.1b Magnetic Moment and Spin

In the previous section, we discussed the relationship between electron spin and magnetic moment. Now, we will delve deeper into the concept of magnetic moment and its relationship with spin.

#### Magnetic Moment and Spin

The magnetic moment of an electron is a vector quantity that describes the strength and direction of the magnetic field produced by the electron. It is directly proportional to the spin angular momentum of the electron, as we have seen in the previous section. This relationship is described by the equation:

$$
\boldsymbol{\mu}_\text{s} = -g_\text{s}\,\mu_\text{B}\,\frac{~\mathbf{S}~}{\hbar}
$$

The magnetic moment of an electron can be either spin-up or spin-down, corresponding to the two possible orientations of the electron's spin angular momentum. These two states are often represented as $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$, respectively.

#### Spin-Up and Spin-Down States

In quantum mechanics, the spin of an electron can be described by a two-state system, where the states $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$ represent the spin-up and spin-down states, respectively. These states are orthogonal to each other, meaning that an electron in a spin-up state is completely unaware of an electron in a spin-down state.

The spin-up and spin-down states are eigenstates of the spin operator $\mathbf{S}$, with eigenvalues $\hbar/2$ and $-\hbar/2$, respectively. This means that when we measure the spin of an electron in a spin-up state, we will always find it to be $\hbar/2$, and when we measure the spin of an electron in a spin-down state, we will always find it to be $-\hbar/2$.

#### Spin-1/2 Particles

Electrons, protons, and neutrons are all examples of spin-1/2 particles. These particles have a spin of $\hbar/2$, and their spin states can be represented by the two-state system $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$. The spin-1/2 nature of these particles is fundamental to their behavior and plays a crucial role in the magnetism of materials.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of spin-1/2 particles for the magnetism of materials, particularly in the context of oxides and metals.

### Subsection: 3.1c Origin of Magnetic Moments

In the previous sections, we have discussed the concept of magnetic moment and its relationship with spin. Now, we will delve deeper into the origin of magnetic moments in materials.

#### Magnetic Moments in Materials

The magnetic moment of a material is a measure of its magnetic properties. It is a vector quantity that describes the strength and direction of the magnetic field produced by the material. The magnetic moment of a material is determined by the magnetic moments of its constituent atoms.

The magnetic moment of an atom is primarily due to the spin of its electrons. As we have seen in the previous sections, the spin of an electron is directly proportional to its magnetic moment. Therefore, the magnetic moment of an atom is determined by the spin of its electrons.

#### Spin-Orbit Interaction

The spin of an electron is influenced by its orbital motion around the nucleus. This influence is known as the spin-orbit interaction. The spin-orbit interaction is a relativistic effect that describes the interaction between the spin of an electron and its orbital motion.

The spin-orbit interaction can be understood in terms of the total angular momentum of the electron. The total angular momentum of an electron is the sum of its spin angular momentum and its orbital angular momentum. According to the conservation of angular momentum, the total angular momentum of the electron remains constant. This means that any change in the spin angular momentum of the electron must be accompanied by an equal and opposite change in the orbital angular momentum.

The spin-orbit interaction leads to a shift in the energy levels of the electron. This shift is proportional to the spin of the electron, and it is responsible for the magnetic moment of the atom.

#### Magnetic Moments in Oxides and Metals

In oxides and metals, the magnetic moments of the atoms are influenced by the interactions between the atoms. In oxides, the magnetic moments of the atoms are often cancelled out due to the antiferromagnetic interactions between the atoms. However, in metals, the magnetic moments of the atoms can be aligned, leading to a net magnetic moment.

The magnetic moments of the atoms in oxides and metals can be manipulated by changing the temperature and the applied magnetic field. This allows for the control of the magnetic properties of the materials, which is crucial for many applications, including data storage and spintronics.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of magnetism in oxides and metals in more detail. We will discuss the different types of magnetism that can occur in these materials, and we will explore how the magnetic properties of these materials can be manipulated for various applications.

### Subsection: 3.1d Magnetic Domains and Hysteresis

In the previous sections, we have discussed the origin of magnetic moments in materials and how these moments can be manipulated. Now, we will delve deeper into the concept of magnetic domains and hysteresis, which are fundamental to understanding the behavior of magnetic materials.

#### Magnetic Domains

A magnetic domain is a region within a magnetic material where the magnetization is uniform. In other words, all the atoms within a magnetic domain have the same magnetic moment. The size and orientation of the magnetic domains within a material determine its magnetic properties.

The formation of magnetic domains is driven by the minimization of the total energy of the system. The total energy of a magnetic material is the sum of the exchange energy, the magnetostatic energy, and the Zeeman energy. The exchange energy is due to the interactions between the atoms, the magnetostatic energy is due to the interactions between the magnetic moments of the atoms, and the Zeeman energy is due to the interaction between the magnetic moments and an external magnetic field.

The exchange energy is the dominant energy term in most magnetic materials. It favors the formation of magnetic domains with a large volume, as this reduces the number of interfaces between different magnetic domains. However, the magnetostatic energy and the Zeeman energy can also play a significant role, particularly in materials with strong magnetostatic interactions or in the presence of an external magnetic field.

#### Hysteresis

Hysteresis is a phenomenon that occurs in magnetic materials where the magnetization of the material lags behind changes in the applied magnetic field. This is due to the fact that the magnetization of a material is not an instantaneous response to a change in the applied magnetic field. Instead, it takes time for the magnetization to change, and this time delay can lead to a hysteresis loop in the magnetization-field curve.

The hysteresis loop is a characteristic feature of a magnetic material and can provide valuable information about its magnetic properties. For example, the area enclosed by the hysteresis loop is proportional to the energy dissipated in the material during a cyclic magnetization process. This energy dissipation can be a significant factor in the design of magnetic devices, as it can lead to heating and potential device failure.

#### Magnetic Domains and Hysteresis in Oxides and Metals

In oxides and metals, the behavior of magnetic domains and hysteresis can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the crystal structure of the material, the temperature, and the applied magnetic field. For example, in oxides, the formation of magnetic domains can be influenced by the antiferromagnetic interactions between the atoms, while in metals, the behavior of magnetic domains can be influenced by the conduction electrons.

The hysteresis behavior of oxides and metals can also be influenced by these factors. For example, in oxides, the hysteresis behavior can be influenced by the antiferromagnetic interactions, while in metals, the hysteresis behavior can be influenced by the conduction electrons and the temperature.

Understanding the behavior of magnetic domains and hysteresis in oxides and metals is crucial for the design and optimization of magnetic devices. By manipulating the magnetic domains and hysteresis, it is possible to control the magnetic properties of these materials, leading to improved device performance.

### Subsection: 3.1e Magnetic Anisotropy

Magnetic anisotropy is a fundamental concept in the study of magnetic materials. It refers to the directional dependence of a material's magnetic properties. In other words, the magnetic properties of a material can vary depending on the direction in which they are measured. This is in contrast to isotropic materials, where the magnetic properties are the same in all directions.

#### Magnetic Anisotropy in Oxides and Metals

In oxides and metals, magnetic anisotropy can arise from a variety of sources. One of the primary sources is the crystal structure of the material. The arrangement of atoms in a crystal lattice can lead to different magnetic properties in different directions. For example, in a cubic crystal, the magnetic properties can be different along the x, y, and z axes.

Another source of magnetic anisotropy is the presence of magnetic domains. As we discussed in the previous section, magnetic domains are regions within a material where the magnetization is uniform. The orientation of these domains can lead to different magnetic properties in different directions.

#### Magnetic Anisotropy and Magnetic Domains

The relationship between magnetic anisotropy and magnetic domains is complex and multifaceted. On one hand, the formation of magnetic domains can lead to magnetic anisotropy. This is because the magnetization within a domain is uniform, and the orientation of this magnetization can vary between different domains.

On the other hand, magnetic anisotropy can also influence the formation of magnetic domains. For example, in a material with strong magnetic anisotropy, the formation of magnetic domains can be influenced by the direction of the applied magnetic field. This can lead to the formation of domains with different orientations, further enhancing the magnetic anisotropy of the material.

#### Magnetic Anisotropy and Hysteresis

Magnetic anisotropy can also play a role in the hysteresis behavior of a material. As we discussed in the previous section, hysteresis is a phenomenon where the magnetization of a material lags behind changes in the applied magnetic field. In materials with strong magnetic anisotropy, this lag can be more pronounced, leading to a larger hysteresis loop.

Furthermore, the orientation of the hysteresis loop can also be influenced by the magnetic anisotropy of the material. For example, in a cubic crystal, the hysteresis loop can be different along the x, y, and z axes, reflecting the different magnetic properties in these directions.

In conclusion, magnetic anisotropy is a crucial concept in the study of magnetic materials. It can arise from a variety of sources, including the crystal structure of the material and the presence of magnetic domains. Understanding magnetic anisotropy is essential for understanding the behavior of magnetic materials, including their magnetic domains and hysteresis behavior.

### Subsection: 3.1f Magnetic Exchange Interaction

This interaction can lead to the alignment of these magnetic moments, which in turn can lead to the formation of magnetic domains and the emergence of macroscopic magnetic properties.

#### Magnetic Exchange Interaction in Oxides and Metals

In oxides and metals, magnetic exchange interaction can occur through several mechanisms. One of the primary mechanisms is the direct exchange of electrons between atoms or ions. This is known as the direct exchange interaction. The strength of this interaction is determined by the overlap of the electronic orbitals of the atoms or ions.

Another mechanism is the indirect exchange of electrons, which is mediated by lattice vibrations (phonons). This is known as the indirect exchange interaction.

This is because the magnetic exchange interaction favors the alignment of magnetic moments, which can lead to the formation of domains with uniform magnetization.

On the other hand, the formation of magnetic domains can also influence the magnetic exchange interaction. For example, in a material with strong magnetic exchange interaction, the formation of magnetic domains can be influenced by the direction of the applied magnetic field.

On the other hand, the formation of magnetic domains can also influence the magnetic resonance spectrum. For example, in a material with strong magnetic exchange interaction, the formation of magnetic domains can lead to a more pronounced hyperfine structure, reflecting the strong interaction between the nuclear and electronic spins.

#### Magnetic Resonance and Hysteresis

Magnetic resonance can also be used to study the hysteresis behavior of a material. This is because the hyperfine structure can be affected by the magnetization of the material, which can be related to the hysteresis behavior. For example, in a material with strong magnetic exchange interaction, the hyperfine structure can be more sensitive to changes in the magnetization, reflecting the strong interaction between the nuclear and electronic spins.

Furthermore, the hyperfine structure can also provide information about the dynamics of the material, which can be related to the hysteresis behavior. For example, the hyperfine structure can be used to study the relaxation processes in the material, which can be related to the dynamics of the magnetization during the hysteresis process.

In conclusion, magnetic resonance is a powerful tool for studying the structure and dynamics of magnetic materials. Its ability to provide information about the electronic structure, the magnetic properties, and the dynamics of the material makes it an indispensable technique in the field of materials science.

### Subsection: 3.1n Magnetic Domains and Hysteresis

Magnetic domains and hysteresis are two fundamental concepts in the study of magnetic materials. They provide insights into the behavior of magnetic materials under different conditions, and they are crucial for understanding the properties of these materials.

#### Magnetic Domains

Magnetic domains are regions within a magnetic material where the magnetization is uniform. They are formed due to the minimization of the total energy of the system, which is achieved by reducing the magnetostatic energy. The size and shape of the magnetic domains depend on the balance between the exchange interaction and the magnetostatic energy.

In oxides and metals, the formation of magnetic domains can be influenced by several factors, including the crystal structure, the temperature, and the applied magnetic field. For example, in a material with strong magnetic exchange interaction, the formation of magnetic domains can be more pronounced, leading to a more complex magnetic structure.

#### Hysteresis

Hysteresis is a phenomenon where the magnetization of a material lags behind changes in the applied magnetic field. It is a result of the time-dependent response of the material to changes in the magnetic field. The hysteresis loop, which is a plot of the magnetization as a function of the applied magnetic field, provides valuable information about the magnetic properties of the material.

In oxides and metals, the hysteresis behavior can be influenced by several factors, including the crystal structure, the temperature, and the applied magnetic field. For example, in a material with strong magnetic exchange interaction, the hysteresis behavior can be more pronounced, leading to a larger hysteresis loop.

### Section: 4.1 Spin

#### 4.1a Introduction to Spin

Spin is a fundamental property of particles, much like mass and charge. It is a quantum mechanical property that gives particles an intrinsic angular momentum. The concept of spin is central to our understanding of magnetic materials, as it is responsible for the magnetic moment of particles.

The spin of a particle is often represented by the symbol $S$. It can be either spin-up or spin-down, denoted as $S_z = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2}$, where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant. The spin state of a particle can be represented as a two-state system, much like a coin that can be either heads or tails.

The spin state of a particle is described by a spinor, a complex vector that represents the probability amplitude of the particle being in a particular spin state. The spinor is a four-component complex vector, represented as:

$$
\psi = \begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $a$ and $b$ are complex coefficients. The spinor evolves under the influence of an external magnetic field, with the spin-up and spin-down states evolving at different rates. This is due to the Anomalous Zeeman Effect, which we will explore in the next section.

The spin of a particle can be manipulated by applying an external magnetic field. This is the principle behind the operation of many magnetic devices, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines and magnetic data storage devices.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the concept of spin, exploring its mathematical representation, its physical implications, and its role in the behavior of magnetic materials. We will also discuss the Anomalous Zeeman Effect and Ferromagnetism, two phenomena that are closely related to the concept of spin.

#### 4.1b Spin-Orbit Interaction

The spin-orbit interaction is a key concept in the study of magnetic materials. It is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that describes the interaction between the spin of a particle and its orbital motion around a central potential. This interaction is responsible for the fine structure of atomic spectra and plays a crucial role in the behavior of magnetic materials.

The spin-orbit interaction can be understood in terms of the total angular momentum $J$ of a particle. The total angular momentum is the sum of the orbital angular momentum $L$ and the spin angular momentum $S$:

$$
J = L + S
$$

The total angular momentum $J$ is conserved in a system, and its projection $J_z$ along the z-axis can take on values $m_J = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2}, \pm \frac{3\hbar}{2}, \pm \frac{5\hbar}{2}, \ldots$, where $m_J$ is the magnetic quantum number.

The spin-orbit interaction energy $E_{SO}$ can be evaluated using the total angular momentum $J$ and the total orbital angular momentum $L$. The energy shift due to the spin-orbit interaction is given by:

$$
\Delta E = \frac{\beta}{2} \big(J(J+1) - L(L+1)\big)
$$

where $\beta$ is a constant that depends on the specific system under consideration.

The spin-orbit interaction is responsible for the fine structure of atomic spectra. In atoms, the spin-orbit interaction leads to the splitting of energy levels into multiple sublevels. This fine structure is observed in the spectral lines emitted by atoms, providing a powerful tool for studying the atomic structure and the interaction of light with matter.

In the context of magnetic materials, the spin-orbit interaction plays a crucial role in the behavior of electrons. The spin-orbit interaction can lead to the formation of spin-polarized bands, which are essential for the phenomenon of ferromagnetism. We will explore this in more detail in the next section.

#### 4.1c Spin-Dependent Potentials

The spin-dependent potentials are another crucial aspect of the study of magnetic materials. These potentials describe the interaction of a particle's spin with an external potential. The spin-dependent potentials are particularly important in the study of magnetic materials due to their role in the formation of spin-polarized bands.

The spin-dependent potentials can be understood in terms of the spinor representation of the potential energy. The potential energy $V$ of a particle can be represented as a 4x4 matrix, known as the spinor potential, acting on the spinor wave function $\psi$ of the particle:

$$
V\psi = \begin{bmatrix}
V_{11} & V_{12} \\
V_{21} & V_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $V_{11}$ and $V_{22}$ are the potential energies for spin-up and spin-down particles, respectively, and $V_{12}$ and $V_{21}$ are the potential energy differences between spin-up and spin-down particles.

The spin-dependent potentials play a crucial role in the formation of spin-polarized bands. In a magnetic material, the spin-dependent potentials can lead to the splitting of the energy bands into two subbands, one for spin-up particles and one for spin-down particles. This splitting can lead to the formation of spin-polarized bands, which are essential for the phenomenon of ferromagnetism.

The spin-dependent potentials also play a crucial role in the study of the Anomalous Zeeman Effect. The Anomalous Zeeman Effect is a phenomenon in which the energy levels of a particle are shifted due to the interaction of its spin with an external magnetic field. This effect is particularly important in the study of magnetic materials, as it can lead to the formation of spin-polarized bands and the phenomenon of ferromagnetism.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the study of the Anomalous Zeeman Effect and its role in the behavior of magnetic materials.

#### 4.1d Spin-Polarized Bands

The concept of spin-polarized bands is a fundamental aspect of the study of magnetic materials. It is a direct consequence of the spin-dependent potentials and the formation of spin-polarized bands is a key factor in the phenomenon of ferromagnetism.

In a magnetic material, the spin-dependent potentials can lead to the splitting of the energy bands into two subbands, one for spin-up particles and one for spin-down particles. This splitting is a result of the interaction of the particle's spin with the external potential. The energy bands for spin-up and spin-down particles are given by:

$$
E_{spin\uparrow} = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} + V_{11}
$$

$$
E_{spin\downarrow} = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} + V_{22}
$$

where $E_{spin\uparrow}$ and $E_{spin\downarrow}$ are the energy bands for spin-up and spin-down particles, respectively, $k$ is the wave vector, $m$ is the mass of the particle, and $V_{11}$ and $V_{22}$ are the potential energies for spin-up and spin-down particles, respectively.

The splitting of the energy bands into two subbands leads to the formation of spin-polarized bands. In a spin-polarized band, the majority of the particles have the same spin orientation. This can be either spin-up or spin-down, depending on the specific material and its properties.

The formation of spin-polarized bands is a crucial factor in the phenomenon of ferromagnetism. In a ferromagnetic material, the spin-polarized bands can lead to the alignment of the spins of the particles, resulting in a macroscopic magnetization. This alignment of spins can be manipulated by an external magnetic field, leading to the phenomenon of ferromagnetism.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the study of the Anomalous Zeeman Effect and its role in the behavior of magnetic materials.

#### 4.1e Spin-Valley Locking

Spin-valley locking is a phenomenon that occurs in certain magnetic materials, particularly in quantum wells. It is a direct consequence of the spin-orbit interaction and the formation of spin-polarized bands.

In a quantum well, the confinement of electrons leads to the formation of two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). The spin-orbit interaction in these systems can lead to the formation of spin-polarized bands, similar to what we have seen in the previous section. However, in quantum wells, the spin-polarized bands can also exhibit a valley-dependent spin polarization.

The valley-dependent spin polarization arises from the fact that the spin-orbit interaction can couple the spin and valley degrees of freedom. This coupling can lead to the formation of spin-polarized bands with different spin polarizations in different valleys. This phenomenon is known as spin-valley locking.

The energy bands for spin-up and spin-down particles in a quantum well with spin-valley locking are given by:

$$
E_{spin\uparrow, valley1} = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} + V_{11} + \Delta E_{spin\uparrow, valley1}
$$

$$
E_{spin\uparrow, valley2} = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} + V_{11} + \Delta E_{spin\uparrow, valley2}
$$

$$
E_{spin\downarrow, valley1} = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} + V_{22} + \Delta E_{spin\downarrow, valley1}
$$

$$
E_{spin\downarrow, valley2} = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} + V_{22} + \Delta E_{spin\downarrow, valley2}
$$

where $E_{spin\uparrow, valley1}$ and $E_{spin\uparrow, valley2}$ are the energy bands for spin-up particles in valley 1 and valley 2, respectively, $E_{spin\downarrow, valley1}$ and $E_{spin\downarrow, valley2}$ are the energy bands for spin-down particles in valley 1 and valley 2, respectively, $\Delta E_{spin\uparrow, valley1}$ and $\Delta E_{spin\uparrow, valley2}$ are the energy shifts due to the spin-valley locking in valley 1 and valley 2, respectively, and $V_{11}$ and $V_{22}$ are the potential energies for spin-up and spin-down particles, respectively.

The spin-valley locking can lead to interesting phenomena, such as the formation of spin-polarized valleys and the manipulation of the spin polarization by an external magnetic field. These phenomena are currently being studied for potential applications in spintronics and quantum computing.

#### 4.1f Spin-Orbit Torque

Spin-orbit torque (SOT) is a phenomenon that arises due to the spin-orbit interaction in magnetic materials. It is a key mechanism for manipulating the spin polarization of electrons in these materials.

The spin-orbit torque can be understood in terms of the spin-orbit interaction Hamiltonian, which is given by:

$$
H_{SO} = \frac{1}{2} \lambda \vec{L} \cdot \vec{S}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the spin-orbit coupling constant, $\vec{L}$ is the orbital angular momentum, and $\vec{S}$ is the spin angular momentum. The spin-orbit interaction Hamiltonian leads to a coupling between the spin and orbital degrees of freedom, which can result in the transfer of spin angular momentum from one degree of freedom to the other.

The spin-orbit torque can be used to manipulate the spin polarization of electrons in a magnetic material. For example, an external magnetic field can be used to align the spin polarization of electrons in a particular direction. This alignment can then be maintained even after the external magnetic field is removed, due to the spin-orbit interaction.

The spin-orbit torque can also be used to switch the spin polarization of electrons from one direction to the other. This can be achieved by applying a short pulse of an external magnetic field in the opposite direction to the initial alignment. This pulse can cause a precession of the spin polarization, which can then be reversed by a second pulse in the original direction. This process is known as spin-torque switching and is a key mechanism for writing information in spintronic devices.

The spin-orbit torque is a crucial concept in the study of magnetic materials. It provides a means to manipulate the spin polarization of electrons, which is essential for many applications, including spintronics and quantum computing.

#### 4.1g Spin-Valley Locking in Quantum Wells

Spin-valley locking is a phenomenon that occurs in quantum wells, where the confinement of electrons leads to the formation of two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). This phenomenon is a direct consequence of the spin-orbit interaction and the formation of spin-polarized bands.

In quantum wells, the spin-orbit interaction can lead to the formation of spin-polarized bands, similar to what we have seen in the previous sections. However, in quantum wells, the spin-polarized bands can also exhibit a valley-dependent spin polarization. This valley-dependent spin polarization arises from the fact that the spin-orbit interaction can couple the spin and valley degrees of freedom.

The energy bands for spin-up and spin-down particles in a quantum well with spin-valley locking are given by:

$$
E_{spin\uparrow, valley1} = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} + V_{11} + \Delta E_{spin\uparrow, valley1}
$$

$$
E_{spin\uparrow, valley2} = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} + V_{11} + \Delta E_{spin\uparrow, valley2}
$$

$$
E_{spin\downarrow, valley1} = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} + V_{22} + \Delta E_{spin\downarrow, valley1}
$$

$$
E_{spin\downarrow, valley2} = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} + V_{22} + \Delta E_{spin\downarrow, valley2}
$$

where $E_{spin\uparrow, valley1}$ and $E_{spin\uparrow, valley2}$ are the energy bands for spin-up particles in valley 1 and valley 2, respectively, $E_{spin\downarrow, valley1}$ and $E_{spin\downarrow, valley2}$ are the energy bands for spin-down particles in valley 1 and valley 2, respectively, $\Delta E_{spin\uparrow, valley1}$ and $\Delta E_{spin\uparrow, valley2}$ are the energy shifts due to the spin-valley locking in valley 1 and valley 2, respectively, and $V_{11}$ and $V_{22}$ are the potential energies for spin-up and spin-down particles, respectively.

The spin-valley locking can lead to interesting phenomena, such as the formation of spin-polarized valleys and the manipulation of the spin polarization by an external magnetic field. These phenomena are currently being studied for potential applications in spintronics and quantum computing.

## Chapter: Chapter 5: Magnetic Domains and Hysteresis

### Introduction

In the realm of magnetic materials, understanding the concepts of magnetic domains and hysteresis is crucial. This chapter, "Magnetic Domains and Hysteresis," aims to delve into these two fundamental concepts, providing a comprehensive understanding of their significance and role in the behavior of magnetic materials.

Magnetic domains are regions within a magnetic material where the magnetization is uniform. These domains are separated by domain walls, where the magnetization changes direction. The size and arrangement of these domains play a significant role in determining the magnetic properties of a material. The study of magnetic domains involves understanding their formation, evolution, and the factors influencing their size and orientation.

Hysteresis, on the other hand, is a phenomenon observed in magnetic materials where the magnetization lags behind the applied magnetic field. This lag is due to the magnetic history of the material, which includes the previous magnetic fields it has experienced. Hysteresis is a key factor in the design and operation of many magnetic devices, including hard drives and magnetic sensors.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental principles governing the formation and evolution of magnetic domains, and the mechanisms behind hysteresis. We will also discuss the mathematical models used to describe these phenomena, such as the Stoner-Wohlfarth model for magnetic domains and the hysteresis loop.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of magnetic domains and hysteresis, and be able to apply this knowledge to the study and design of magnetic materials and devices. This chapter will provide the necessary foundation for the subsequent chapters, where we will delve deeper into the properties and applications of magnetic materials.




#### 4.2a Anomalous Zeeman Effect

The Anomalous Zeeman Effect (AZE) is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that describes the splitting of spectral lines in the presence of a magnetic field. It is a key concept in the study of magnetic materials, particularly in the understanding of ferromagnetism.

The AZE is a result of the spin-orbit interaction, which we discussed in the previous section. When a particle with spin interacts with an external magnetic field, its energy levels are split into multiple sublevels. This splitting is due to the interaction between the spin of the particle and the magnetic field.

The AZE is particularly important in the study of ferromagnetism. In ferromagnetic materials, the spin of the electrons is aligned with the magnetic field, leading to a splitting of the energy levels. This splitting results in the formation of multiple spectral lines, each corresponding to a different energy level.

The AZE can be mathematically described using the Landé g-factor, which is a measure of the interaction between the spin of a particle and an external magnetic field. The Landé g-factor is given by the equation:

$$
g = \frac{1 + \frac{\beta}{\alpha}}{\alpha}
$$

where $\beta$ is the spin-orbit coupling constant and $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant. The Landé g-factor is a dimensionless quantity and is typically of the order of 2 for most atoms.

The AZE is particularly important in the study of ferromagnetism. In ferromagnetic materials, the spin of the electrons is aligned with the magnetic field, leading to a splitting of the energy levels. This splitting results in the formation of multiple spectral lines, each corresponding to a different energy level.

The AZE is also responsible for the splitting of the Lyman-alpha transition in hydrogen. The Lyman-alpha transition is a spectral line that corresponds to the transition of an electron from the n=2 to the n=1 energy level in the hydrogen atom. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the Lyman-alpha transition is split into multiple lines, each corresponding to a different energy level.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of ferromagnetism in more detail.

#### 4.2b Anomalous Zeeman Effect in Ferromagnetic Materials

The Anomalous Zeeman Effect (AZE) plays a crucial role in the behavior of ferromagnetic materials. In these materials, the spin of the electrons is aligned with the magnetic field, leading to a splitting of the energy levels. This splitting results in the formation of multiple spectral lines, each corresponding to a different energy level.

This results in a larger splitting of the energy levels and the formation of more spectral lines. This phenomenon is particularly important in the study of ferromagnetism, as it provides a deeper understanding of the behavior of electrons in these materials.

The AZE is also responsible for the phenomenon of ferromagnetic resonance, which is a key property of ferromagnetic materials. Ferromagnetic resonance occurs when the frequency of an external magnetic field is matched to the natural frequency of the ferromagnetic material. This results in a resonance phenomenon, where the material exhibits a large response to the external magnetic field.

In conclusion, the Anomalous Zeeman Effect plays a crucial role in the behavior of ferromagnetic materials. It is responsible for the splitting of energy levels, the formation of multiple spectral lines, and the phenomenon of ferromagnetic resonance. Understanding the AZE is therefore essential for a comprehensive understanding of ferromagnetism.

The Anomalous Zeeman Effect (AZE) has found numerous applications in the field of magnetic materials. Its understanding has led to significant advancements in the development of magnetic devices and technologies. In this section, we will explore some of these applications.

##### Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

One of the most significant applications of the AZE is in the field of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses the magnetic properties of atoms to generate images of the body's internal structures. The AZE plays a crucial role in the operation of MRI machines.

In MRI, a strong magnetic field is used to align the protons in the body. A radio frequency pulse is then applied to knock the protons out of alignment. As the protons return to their original alignment, they emit a signal that can be detected and used to generate an image. The AZE plays a crucial role in this process, as it determines the frequency at which the protons return to their original alignment.

##### Ferromagnetic Resonance

Ferromagnetic resonance is another important application of the AZE. As we discussed in the previous section, ferromagnetic resonance occurs when the frequency of an external magnetic field is matched to the natural frequency of the ferromagnetic material. This results in a large response to the external magnetic field, which can be used for various applications.

For example, ferromagnetic resonance is used in the design of magnetic sensors and actuators. These devices use the resonance phenomenon to detect or control magnetic fields. The AZE plays a crucial role in these devices, as it determines the frequency at which the ferromagnetic material resonates.

##### Spintronics

Spintronics, or spin electronics, is a field that aims to use the spin of electrons for information processing. The AZE plays a crucial role in this field, as it determines the behavior of electrons in magnetic materials.

In spintronics, the spin of electrons is used to store and process information. The AZE plays a crucial role in this process, as it determines the energy levels of the electrons in the material. This, in turn, affects the behavior of the electrons and their ability to carry information.

In conclusion, the Anomalous Zeeman Effect has found numerous applications in the field of magnetic materials.

## Chapter: Magnetic Domains and Hysteresis

### Introduction

In the realm of magnetic materials, understanding the behavior of magnetic domains and hysteresis is crucial. This chapter, "Magnetic Domains and Hysteresis," delves into these two fundamental concepts, providing a comprehensive guide to their principles and applications.

Magnetic domains are regions within a magnetic material where the magnetization is uniform. These domains are formed due to the minimization of the total energy of the system. The boundaries between these domains, known as domain walls, are regions of high energy. The size and orientation of these domains play a significant role in the overall magnetic properties of the material.

Hysteresis, on the other hand, is a phenomenon where the magnetization of a material lags behind the applied magnetic field. This lag is due to the magnetic history of the material, which includes the effects of previous magnetic fields and the material's inherent magnetic properties. Hysteresis is a key factor in the design and operation of many magnetic devices, including hard drives and magnetic sensors.

In this chapter, we will explore the principles behind the formation and behavior of magnetic domains, as well as the mechanisms of hysteresis. We will also discuss the mathematical models used to describe these phenomena, including the Stoner-Wohlfarth theory for magnetic domains and the Brown-Oxford theory for hysteresis.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of magnetic domains and hysteresis, and be able to apply this knowledge to the design and analysis of magnetic materials and devices. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field of magnetism, this chapter will provide you with the tools and knowledge you need to navigate the complex world of magnetic materials.




#### 4.3a Ferromagnetism in Materials

Ferromagnetism is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that describes the alignment of magnetic moments in a material. This alignment can occur due to the interaction between the magnetic moments of atoms in the material, leading to the formation of domains. These domains can then interact with each other, leading to the formation of a macroscopic magnetic field.

In ferromagnetic materials, the magnetic moments of atoms are aligned due to the exchange interaction. This interaction is a result of the quantum mechanical nature of electrons and is responsible for the formation of domains. These domains are regions within the material where the magnetic moments are aligned in the same direction.

The exchange interaction can be mathematically described using the Heisenberg model, which is a classical model of ferromagnetism. The Heisenberg model describes the interaction between the magnetic moments of atoms in a material using the exchange interaction. The exchange interaction is given by the equation:

$$
J = -\frac{2\pi}{a^3} \sum_i \vec{S}_i \cdot \vec{S}_{i+1}
$$

where $J$ is the exchange interaction, $a$ is the lattice constant, and $\vec{S}_i$ is the spin of the $i$th atom.

The exchange interaction leads to the formation of domains, which are regions within the material where the magnetic moments are aligned in the same direction. These domains can then interact with each other, leading to the formation of a macroscopic magnetic field.

Ferromagnetism is a key concept in the study of magnetic materials. It is responsible for the formation of permanent magnets and is also important in the design of magnetic storage devices. Understanding ferromagnetism is crucial for the development of new magnetic materials and technologies.

In the next section, we will discuss the different types of ferromagnetism and their properties. We will also explore the role of ferromagnetism in the formation of magnetic domains and the role of the exchange interaction in this process.

#### 4.3b Ferromagnetism in Nanostructures

Ferromagnetism in nanostructures is a fascinating area of study due to the unique properties that these structures exhibit. Nanostructures, such as nanoparticles and nanowires, have dimensions on the order of nanometers, which is comparable to the size of individual atoms. This allows for a high degree of control over the magnetic properties of these structures, making them promising candidates for applications in data storage, sensing, and energy conversion.

One of the key factors that influence the ferromagnetism of nanostructures is their size. As the size of a nanostructure decreases, the number of atoms on its surface increases. This increase in surface area can significantly alter the magnetic properties of the structure. For instance, the surface of a nanoparticle can act as a source or sink for magnetic moments, leading to a decrease in the overall magnetization of the particle. This phenomenon is known as surface anisotropy.

The surface anisotropy can be mathematically described using the Stoner-Wohlfarth model, which is a classical model of ferromagnetism in nanostructures. The Stoner-Wohlfarth model describes the magnetization of a nanostructure as a function of its size and the surface anisotropy. The model is given by the equation:

$$
M = \frac{N}{V} \frac{1}{1 + \frac{2\pi}{a^3} \sum_i \vec{S}_i \cdot \vec{S}_{i+1} \frac{1}{N}}
$$

where $M$ is the magnetization, $N$ is the number of atoms, $V$ is the volume of the nanostructure, and the other symbols have the same meaning as in the Heisenberg model.

Another important factor that influences the ferromagnetism of nanostructures is the presence of defects. Defects, such as vacancies and interstitials, can significantly alter the magnetic properties of a nanostructure. For instance, the presence of vacancies can lead to a decrease in the magnetization of a nanoparticle, while the presence of interstitials can lead to an increase in the magnetization.

In conclusion, the study of ferromagnetism in nanostructures is a rapidly growing field due to the unique properties that these structures exhibit. The understanding of these properties is crucial for the development of new magnetic materials and technologies.

The data is stored in the form of magnetic domains, where the direction of magnetization represents a binary digit (bit). The ability of ferromagnetic materials to retain their magnetization allows for the storage of data for long periods without the need for constant power supply.

Ferromagnetism also finds applications in the field of energy conversion. The magneto-electric effect, where an electric field can be generated from a magnetic field, is a phenomenon that is exploited in the design of energy conversion devices. These devices, known as magneto-electric generators, can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, making them useful in power generation and energy storage.

In the field of sensing, ferromagnetic materials are used in the design of sensors that can detect changes in magnetic fields. These sensors are used in a variety of applications, from navigation systems to medical diagnostics.

The unique properties of ferromagnetism in nanostructures have opened up new avenues for research and applications. The ability to control the magnetic properties of these structures at the atomic level has led to the development of new materials with enhanced magnetic properties. These materials have potential applications in areas such as spintronics, where the spin of the electron is used to store and process information.

Exchange interaction is a fundamental concept in magnetism, and it plays a crucial role in determining the magnetic properties of materials. In insulators, this interaction is particularly interesting due to the unique properties of these materials. Insulators are characterized by their inability to conduct electricity, which is a result of their electronic structure. This electronic structure, in turn, influences the exchange interaction and, consequently, the magnetic behavior of the material.

In this chapter, we will explore the exchange interaction in insulators in detail. We will begin by discussing the basic principles of exchange interaction and how it differs from Coulomb interaction. We will then delve into the specifics of exchange interaction in insulators, discussing the role of electronic structure and the influence of crystal symmetry. We will also explore the effects of exchange interaction on the magnetic properties of insulators, including the phenomenon of spin-lattice relaxation.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a comprehensive understanding of exchange interaction in insulators and its importance in the study of magnetic materials.

### Section: 5.1 Exchange Interaction:

The exchange interaction is a fundamental concept in magnetism, and it plays a crucial role in determining the magnetic properties of materials. In this section, we will delve into the specifics of exchange interaction in insulators, discussing the role of electronic structure and the influence of crystal symmetry.

#### 5.1a Exchange Interaction in Insulators

In insulators, the exchange interaction is particularly interesting due to the unique properties of these materials. Insulators are characterized by their inability to conduct electricity, which is a result of their electronic structure. This electronic structure, in turn, influences the exchange interaction and, consequently, the magnetic behavior of the material.

The exchange interaction in insulators can be understood in terms of the Heitler–London model of chemical bonding. According to this model, the exchange interaction favors electrons with parallel spins, which is a primary cause of ferromagnetism in materials. However, this model has severe limitations in solids, and the sign of the exchange interaction can be deduced from the expression for the difference between the energies of the triplet and singlet states, $E_{-} - E_{+}$.

The exchange interaction in insulators is also influenced by the crystal symmetry of the material. For instance, in the case of [Re<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>8</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>, the PIO analysis reveals that the quadruple bond is primarily due to the interaction between the d orbitals of the two Re atoms. This interaction is a result of the exchange interaction, which is influenced by the crystal symmetry of the material.

#### 5.1b Exchange Interaction and Crystal Symmetry

The exchange interaction in insulators is also influenced by the crystal symmetry of the material. The crystal symmetry can be determined by the space group of the crystal structure, which describes the symmetry of the crystal. The space group of a crystal structure can be determined using various methods, including X-ray crystallography and symmetry analysis.

In the case of [Re<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>8</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>, the PIO analysis reveals that the quadruple bond is primarily due to the interaction between the d orbitals of the two Re atoms. This interaction is a result of the exchange interaction, which is influenced by the crystal symmetry of the material. The crystal symmetry of [Re<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>8</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> is determined by the space group $D_{2h}$, which describes the symmetry of the crystal structure.

#### 5.1c Exchange Interaction and Electronic Structure

The exchange interaction in insulators is also influenced by the electronic structure of the material. The electronic structure of a material can be determined by the electronic band structure, which describes the energy levels of the electrons in the material. The electronic band structure can be calculated using various methods, including density functional theory and ab initio calculations.

In the case of [Re<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>8</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>, the PIO analysis reveals that the quadruple bond is primarily due to the interaction between the d orbitals of the two Re atoms.

In conclusion, the exchange interaction in insulators is influenced by a variety of factors, including the electronic structure and crystal symmetry of the material. Understanding these factors is crucial for understanding the magnetic properties of insulators.

#### 5.1d Exchange Interaction and Magnetic Properties

The exchange interaction plays a crucial role in determining the magnetic properties of insulators. The exchange interaction is responsible for the alignment of electron spins, which is a key factor in the development of magnetism. In insulators, the exchange interaction can lead to a variety of magnetic phenomena, including ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, and spin-lattice relaxation.

Ferromagnetism is a phenomenon where a material exhibits a macroscopic magnetic moment, even in the absence of an external magnetic field. This is a result of the exchange interaction, which favors electrons with parallel spins. In insulators, the exchange interaction can lead to ferromagnetism, particularly in materials with localized electrons, such as the Heitler–London model of chemical bonding.

Antiferromagnetism, on the other hand, is a phenomenon where the electron spins are aligned in an antiparallel manner. This can occur when the exchange interaction favors electrons with antiparallel spins. In insulators, antiferromagnetism can be induced by the exchange interaction, particularly in materials with delocalized electrons.

Spin-lattice relaxation is another important magnetic phenomenon that is influenced by the exchange interaction. This is a process where the spin of an electron interacts with the lattice of the material, leading to a change in the spin state of the electron. The exchange interaction can influence the rate of spin-lattice relaxation, which can have significant implications for the magnetic properties of insulators.

In conclusion, the exchange interaction plays a crucial role in determining the magnetic properties of insulators. It can lead to a variety of magnetic phenomena, including ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, and spin-lattice relaxation. Understanding the exchange interaction is therefore essential for understanding the magnetic behavior of insulators.

So let's dive in and explore the world of bonding and magnetism.




### Section: 6.1 Bonding:

Bonding is a fundamental concept in chemistry that describes the forces that hold atoms together in molecules. These forces can be covalent, ionic, or metallic, and they play a crucial role in determining the properties of a material, including its magnetic behavior.

#### 6.1a Bonding in Magnetic Materials

In magnetic materials, the type of bonding can greatly influence the magnetic properties of the material. For instance, in ferromagnetic materials, the strong metallic bonding between atoms allows for the alignment of magnetic moments, leading to a strong magnetic response. On the other hand, in antiferromagnetic materials, the weaker covalent bonding between atoms can result in a cancellation of magnetic moments, leading to a weaker magnetic response.

The type of bonding also affects the electronic structure of the material, which in turn influences the magnetic behavior. For example, in ferromagnetic materials, the delocalized electrons can easily align their spin moments, leading to a strong magnetic response. In contrast, in antiferromagnetic materials, the localized electrons have a more complex electronic structure, which can result in a weaker magnetic response.

The concept of bonding is also crucial in understanding the role of defects in magnetic materials. Defects, such as vacancies and interstitials, can disrupt the regular arrangement of atoms and alter the bonding. This can have a significant impact on the magnetic properties of the material, leading to changes in the Curie temperature, for instance.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the relationship between bonding and magnetism, exploring how the arrangement of atoms and the type of bonding can influence the magnetic properties of a material. We will also discuss the role of electron spin and orbital angular momentum in determining the magnetic behavior of materials.

#### 6.1b Types of Bonding

As mentioned earlier, there are three main types of bonding: covalent, ionic, and metallic. Each type of bonding has its unique characteristics and plays a crucial role in determining the properties of a material, including its magnetic behavior.

##### Covalent Bonding

Covalent bonding is a type of bonding where atoms share electrons. This type of bonding is common in many magnetic materials, including some ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials. In covalent bonding, the shared electrons form a covalent bond, which is a strong and directional bond. This type of bonding is particularly important in determining the magnetic properties of a material. For instance, in ferromagnetic materials, the covalent bonding between atoms can facilitate the alignment of magnetic moments, leading to a strong magnetic response.

##### Ionic Bonding

Ionic bonding is a type of bonding where one atom transfers one or more electrons to another atom. This type of bonding is common in many ionic materials, including some antiferromagnetic materials. In ionic bonding, the transferred electrons form an ionic bond, which is a weaker and non-directional bond. This type of bonding can influence the magnetic properties of a material by altering the electronic structure of the material. For example, in antiferromagnetic materials, the ionic bonding can result in a cancellation of magnetic moments, leading to a weaker magnetic response.

##### Metallic Bonding

Metallic bonding is a type of bonding where atoms share delocalized electrons. This type of bonding is common in many metallic materials, including some ferromagnetic materials. In metallic bonding, the delocalized electrons form a metallic bond, which is a strong and directional bond. This type of bonding plays a crucial role in determining the magnetic properties of a material. For instance, in ferromagnetic materials, the metallic bonding between atoms allows for the alignment of magnetic moments, leading to a strong magnetic response.

In the next section, we will explore the role of these different types of bonding in determining the magnetic properties of a material. We will also discuss how the type of bonding can influence the electronic structure of a material, which in turn affects the magnetic behavior of the material.

#### 6.1c Bonding and Magnetism

The relationship between bonding and magnetism is a complex and fascinating area of study. The type of bonding present in a material can significantly influence its magnetic properties. This section will delve into the intricate relationship between bonding and magnetism, focusing on the role of bonding in determining the magnetic behavior of materials.

##### Covalent Bonding and Magnetism

Covalent bonding, as previously discussed, is a type of bonding where atoms share electrons. This type of bonding is particularly important in determining the magnetic properties of a material. In covalent bonding, the shared electrons form a covalent bond, which is a strong and directional bond. This type of bonding can facilitate the alignment of magnetic moments, leading to a strong magnetic response.

In ferromagnetic materials, the covalent bonding between atoms can facilitate the alignment of magnetic moments, leading to a strong magnetic response. This is because the covalent bonding allows for the easy movement of electrons, which can align their spin moments, resulting in a strong magnetic response.

##### Ionic Bonding and Magnetism

Ionic bonding, on the other hand, is a type of bonding where one atom transfers one or more electrons to another atom. This type of bonding can influence the magnetic properties of a material by altering the electronic structure of the material.

In antiferromagnetic materials, the ionic bonding can result in a cancellation of magnetic moments, leading to a weaker magnetic response. This is because the ionic bonding disrupts the regular arrangement of atoms, which can hinder the alignment of magnetic moments.

##### Metallic Bonding and Magnetism

Metallic bonding, where atoms share delocalized electrons, is another type of bonding that can influence the magnetic properties of a material. In metallic bonding, the delocalized electrons form a metallic bond, which is a strong and directional bond. This type of bonding plays a crucial role in determining the magnetic properties of a material.

In ferromagnetic materials, the metallic bonding between atoms allows for the alignment of magnetic moments, leading to a strong magnetic response. This is because the metallic bonding allows for the easy movement of delocalized electrons, which can align their spin moments, resulting in a strong magnetic response.

In conclusion, the type of bonding present in a material can significantly influence its magnetic properties. Covalent bonding, ionic bonding, and metallic bonding all play a crucial role in determining the magnetic behavior of materials. Understanding these relationships is crucial for the design and development of new magnetic materials with desired properties.




#### 6.2a Diamagnetism and Paramagnetism

In the previous section, we discussed the role of bonding in determining the magnetic properties of materials. Now, we will delve deeper into the concept of magnetism itself, focusing on two fundamental types of magnetism: diamagnetism and paramagnetism.

Diamagnetism is a form of magnetism that is exhibited by all materials. It is a quantum mechanical effect that arises due to the motion of electrons around an atomic core. In diamagnetic materials, the electrons are paired and their magnetic moments are opposite, leading to a weak repulsion to an external magnetic field. This effect is typically very small and is often overshadowed by other forms of magnetism.

Paramagnetism, on the other hand, is a form of magnetism that is exhibited by materials with unpaired electrons. In paramagnetic materials, the unpaired electrons have a magnetic moment that can align with an external magnetic field, leading to a weak attraction. The strength of the paramagnetic response is proportional to the number of unpaired electrons in the material.

The paramagnetic response can be described by the Curie's law, which states that the magnetization $M$ of a paramagnet is given by:

$$
M = \frac{C}{T}
$$

where $C$ is the Curie constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. This law holds at low temperatures, where thermal fluctuations are small and the magnetic moments of the atoms can align with the external field.

At higher temperatures, the thermal fluctuations become significant and the magnetic moments start to deviate from the alignment with the external field. This leads to a decrease in the magnetization, which can be described by the Curie-Weiss law:

$$
M = \frac{C}{T - T_0}
$$

where $T_0$ is the Curie temperature, above which the material transitions from a paramagnet to a ferromagnet.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of ferromagnetism, a stronger form of magnetism that arises due to the alignment of magnetic moments in a material.

#### 6.2b Ferromagnetism and Antiferromagnetism

Ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism are two other fundamental types of magnetism. Ferromagnetism is a form of magnetism that is exhibited by certain materials, such as iron, nickel, and cobalt. It is characterized by the spontaneous alignment of magnetic moments in a material, leading to a strong attraction to an external magnetic field. This effect is typically much stronger than the diamagnetic and paramagnetic effects.

The ferromagnetic response can be described by the Stoner-Wohlfarth model, which states that the magnetization $M$ of a ferromagnet is given by:

$$
M = \frac{N \mu B}{kT} \tanh \left( \frac{B \mu}{kT} \right)
$$

where $N$ is the number of magnetic moments per unit volume, $\mu$ is the magnetic moment of a single atom, $B$ is the magnetic field, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. This model holds at low temperatures, where thermal fluctuations are small and the magnetic moments of the atoms can align with the external field.

At higher temperatures, the thermal fluctuations become significant and the magnetic moments start to deviate from the alignment with the external field. This leads to a decrease in the magnetization, which can be described by the Stoner-Wohlfarth model with a temperature-dependent term:

$$
M = \frac{N \mu B}{kT} \tanh \left( \frac{B \mu}{kT} \right) \exp \left( - \frac{B \mu}{kT} \right)
$$

Antiferromagnetism, on the other hand, is a form of magnetism that arises due to the alignment of magnetic moments in a material with opposite spin directions. This leads to a cancellation of the magnetic moments, resulting in a weak or zero net magnetization. However, antiferromagnetic materials can exhibit a strong response to an external magnetic field, leading to a phenomenon known as exchange bias.

The exchange bias effect can be described by the exchange bias model, which states that the magnetization $M$ of an antiferromagnet is given by:

$$
M = \frac{N \mu B}{kT} \tanh \left( \frac{B \mu}{kT} \right) \exp \left( - \frac{B \mu}{kT} \right) - \frac{N \mu B}{kT} \tanh \left( \frac{B \mu}{kT} \right) \exp \left( - \frac{B \mu}{kT} \right)
$$

where the first term represents the ferromagnetic response and the second term represents the antiferromagnetic response. This model holds at low temperatures, where thermal fluctuations are small and the magnetic moments of the atoms can align with the external field.

At higher temperatures, the thermal fluctuations become significant and the magnetic moments start to deviate from the alignment with the external field. This leads to a decrease in the magnetization, which can be described by the exchange bias model with a temperature-dependent term:

$$
M = \frac{N \mu B}{kT} \tanh \left( \frac{B \mu}{kT} \right) \exp \left( - \frac{B \mu}{kT} \right) - \frac{N \mu B}{kT} \tanh \left( \frac{B \mu}{kT} \right) \exp \left( - \frac{B \mu}{kT} \right) \exp \left( - \frac{B \mu}{kT} \right)
$$

In the next section, we will explore the concept of spinodal decomposition, a phenomenon that can lead to the formation of antiferromagnetic domains in certain materials.

#### 6.2c Magnetic Domains and Hysteresis

Magnetic domains are regions within a magnetic material where the magnetization is uniform. This means that the magnetic moments of the atoms within a domain are aligned in the same direction. The size and distribution of these domains play a crucial role in determining the magnetic properties of a material.

The formation of magnetic domains can be understood in terms of the concept of exchange energy. The exchange energy is the energy associated with the alignment of magnetic moments in a material. It is a result of the quantum mechanical exchange interaction between electrons. The exchange energy is lower when the magnetic moments are aligned, leading to the formation of magnetic domains.

The size of the magnetic domains is determined by a balance of energies. The exchange energy favors the formation of large domains, while the magnetostatic energy favors the formation of small domains. The magnetostatic energy is the energy associated with the magnetic field produced by the magnetic moments. It is proportional to the volume of the domain, and therefore favors the formation of small domains.

The balance of these energies leads to the formation of domains of a size that minimizes the total energy. This size is typically on the order of a few hundred nanometers.

The formation of magnetic domains also leads to the phenomenon of hysteresis. Hysteresis is the lagging of the effect of a cause, or the dependence of the effect on the history of the cause. In the context of magnetism, hysteresis refers to the lagging of the magnetization of a material in response to an applied magnetic field.

The hysteresis loop of a material is a plot of the magnetization $M$ as a function of the applied magnetic field $H$. The hysteresis loop typically has a characteristic shape, with a linear increase in magnetization at low fields, followed by a non-linear increase at higher fields. The hysteresis loop also exhibits a remanent magnetization $M_r$ and a coercivity $H_c$.

The remanent magnetization $M_r$ is the magnetization of the material in the absence of an applied magnetic field. It is a measure of the strength of the magnetic domains in the material. The coercivity $H_c$ is the magnetic field required to reduce the magnetization of the material to zero. It is a measure of the stability of the magnetic domains.

The hysteresis loop can be described by the Stoner-Wohlfarth model, which states that the magnetization $M$ of a ferromagnet is given by:

$$
M = \frac{N \mu B}{kT} \tanh \left( \frac{B \mu}{kT} \right) \exp \left( - \frac{B \mu}{kT} \right)
$$

where $N$ is the number of magnetic moments per unit volume, $\mu$ is the magnetic moment of a single atom, $B$ is the magnetic field, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. This model holds at low temperatures, where thermal fluctuations are small and the magnetic moments of the atoms can align with the external field.

At higher temperatures, the thermal fluctuations become significant and the magnetic moments start to deviate from the alignment with the external field. This leads to a decrease in the magnetization, which can be described by the Stoner-Wohlfarth model with a temperature-dependent term:

$$
M = \frac{N \mu B}{kT} \tanh \left( \frac{B \mu}{kT} \right) \exp \left( - \frac{B \mu}{kT} \right) - \frac{N \mu B}{kT} \tanh \left( \frac{B \mu}{kT} \right) \exp \left( - \frac{B \mu}{kT} \right)
$$

where the first term represents the magnetization in the presence of an applied magnetic field, and the second term represents the magnetization in the absence of an applied magnetic field.

#### 6.3a Magnetic Anisotropy

Magnetic anisotropy is a phenomenon where the magnetic properties of a material depend on the direction of the applied magnetic field. This anisotropy can arise due to the shape of the material, the crystal structure of the material, or the presence of defects in the material.

The anisotropy of a material can be quantified by the anisotropy constant $K_a$, which is defined as:

$$

We will discuss how the anisotropic properties of magnetic materials are exploited in these applications, and how understanding magnetic anisotropy can lead to the development of more efficient and effective magnetic devices.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a comprehensive understanding of magnetic anisotropy, its causes, effects, and applications. This knowledge will serve as a solid foundation for the subsequent chapters, which will delve deeper into the properties and applications of magnetic materials.




#### 7.1a Magnetostriction

Magnetostriction is a unique property of magnetic materials that allows them to change their shape or dimensions when subjected to a magnetic field. This effect is reversible and can be described as a mechanical response to a magnetic stimulus. The term "magnetostriction" is derived from the Greek words "magnes" (magnet) and "hysteron" (striction), meaning "contraction".

The magnetostrictive effect was first discovered by James Joule in 1842 when he observed a sample of iron. He noticed that the sample changed its shape when exposed to a magnetic field, and this change was reversible when the field was removed. This effect is also responsible for the low-pitched humming sound that can be heard coming from transformers, where oscillating AC currents produce a changing magnetic field.

The magnetostrictive effect is a result of the internal structure of ferromagnetic materials. These materials are divided into "domains", each of which is a region of uniform magnetization. When a magnetic field is applied, the boundaries between the domains shift and the domains rotate. This causes a change in the material's dimensions.

The reason that a change in the magnetic domains of a material results in a change in the material's dimensions is a consequence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy. It takes more energy to magnetize a crystalline material in one direction than in another. If a magnetic field is applied to the material at an angle to an easy axis of magnetization, the material will tend to rearrange its structure so that an easy axis is aligned with the field to minimize the free energy of the system. Since different crystal directions are associated with different lengths, this effect induces a strain in the material.

The reciprocal effect, the change of the magnetic susceptibility (response to an applied field) of a material when subjected to a mechanical stress, is called the Villari effect. Two other effects are related to magnetostriction: the Matteucci effect is the creation of a helical anisotropy of the susceptibility of a magnetostrictive material when subjected to a torque and the Stoner-Wohlfarth effect is the creation of a uniaxial anisotropy of the susceptibility of a magnetostrictive material when subjected to a uniaxial stress.

The magnetostrictive effect is a crucial aspect of many applications, including magnetic sensors, actuators, and energy storage devices. Understanding the mechanisms behind magnetostriction is essential for designing and optimizing these applications. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the mechanisms of magnetostriction and explore its applications in more detail.

#### 7.1b Magnetic Viscoelasticity

Magnetic viscoelasticity is a phenomenon that describes the time-dependent deformation of a material under a magnetic field. This effect is observed in certain magnetic materials, particularly those with a high degree of magnetic anisotropy. The term "viscoelasticity" is derived from the Latin words "viscous" (viscous) and "elasticus" (elastic), indicating a material that exhibits both viscous and elastic properties.

The concept of magnetic viscoelasticity was first introduced by J. H. E. D. Briggs in 1961. He proposed that the strain produced in a magnetic material under a magnetic field is not instantaneous, but occurs over a period of time. This time-dependent strain is a result of the rearrangement of magnetic domains within the material, which is influenced by the applied magnetic field.

The mathematical description of magnetic viscoelasticity is based on the concept of a magnetic viscoelastic modulus, denoted by $H$. This modulus is a function of the magnetic field $H$ and the time $t$, and is defined as:

$$
H = H(H, t)
$$

The magnetic viscoelastic modulus $H$ is a key parameter in understanding the behavior of magnetic materials under a magnetic field. It describes the relationship between the applied magnetic field and the resulting strain in the material. The higher the magnetic viscoelastic modulus, the greater the strain produced by a given magnetic field.

The concept of magnetic viscoelasticity is particularly important in the design and analysis of magnetic materials for various applications. For example, in the design of magnetic sensors and actuators, understanding the time-dependent deformation of the material under a magnetic field is crucial. Similarly, in the design of magnetic storage devices, the understanding of magnetic viscoelasticity is essential for optimizing the storage capacity and reliability of the device.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical description of magnetic viscoelasticity and explore its implications for the design and analysis of magnetic materials.

#### 7.1c Magnetic Domains and Walls

Magnetic domains and walls play a crucial role in the magnetic anisotropy of materials. As we have seen in the previous sections, the magnetic anisotropy is a result of the internal structure of the material, which is divided into domains. Each domain is a region of uniform magnetization, and the boundaries between these domains are called magnetic walls or domain walls.

The concept of magnetic domains and walls is fundamental to understanding the behavior of magnetic materials under a magnetic field. The magnetic domains and walls are responsible for the anisotropic behavior of the material, as they determine the direction of the magnetization within the material.

The magnetic domains and walls are influenced by the applied magnetic field. When a magnetic field is applied to a material, the magnetic domains and walls rearrange themselves to minimize the total energy of the system. This rearrangement is driven by the magnetostatic energy, which is proportional to the surface area of the magnetic domains. Therefore, the magnetic domains tend to align themselves with the applied magnetic field to minimize the magnetostatic energy.

The mathematical description of the magnetic domains and walls is based on the concept of the magnetic domain wall energy. The energy of a magnetic domain wall is given by the equation:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} \sigma \cdot l
$$

where $\sigma$ is the surface energy density of the magnetic domain wall and $l$ is the length of the domain wall. The surface energy density $\sigma$ is a material-specific parameter, and it is typically determined experimentally.

The concept of magnetic domains and walls is particularly important in the design and analysis of magnetic materials for various applications. For example, in the design of magnetic sensors and actuators, understanding the behavior of the magnetic domains and walls under a magnetic field is crucial. Similarly, in the design of magnetic storage devices, the understanding of the magnetic domains and walls is essential for optimizing the storage capacity and reliability of the device.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical description of the magnetic domains and walls, and explore their implications for the design and analysis of magnetic materials.

#### 7.1d Magnetic Anisotropy in Thin Films

Magnetic anisotropy in thin films is a topic of great interest due to its potential applications in various fields, including data storage, magnetic sensors, and spintronics. The anisotropic behavior of thin films is primarily governed by the shape and size of the film, as well as the applied magnetic field.

The shape anisotropy of thin films is a result of the film's geometry. Thin films tend to have a higher shape anisotropy than bulk materials due to their reduced thickness. This anisotropy can be quantified using the shape anisotropy factor $k_f$, which is defined as:

$$
k_f = \frac{2A_f}{V_f}
$$

where $A_f$ is the surface area of the film and $V_f$ is the volume of the film. The shape anisotropy factor $k_f$ is a dimensionless quantity, and it is typically positive for thin films.

The size anisotropy of thin films is a result of the film's dimensions. Thin films tend to have a higher size anisotropy than bulk materials due to their reduced dimensions. This anisotropy can be quantified using the size anisotropy factor $k_s$, which is defined as:

$$
k_s = \frac{2A_s}{V_s}
$$

where $A_s$ is the surface area of the film and $V_s$ is the volume of the film. The size anisotropy factor $k_s$ is a dimensionless quantity, and it is typically positive for thin films.

The magnetic anisotropy of thin films is also influenced by the applied magnetic field. When a magnetic field is applied to a thin film, the magnetic domains and walls rearrange themselves to minimize the total energy of the system. This rearrangement is driven by the magnetostatic energy, which is proportional to the surface area of the magnetic domains. Therefore, the magnetic domains tend to align themselves with the applied magnetic field to minimize the magnetostatic energy.

The mathematical description of the magnetic anisotropy in thin films is based on the concept of the magnetic domain wall energy. The energy of a magnetic domain wall in a thin film is given by the equation:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} \sigma \cdot l
$$

where $\sigma$ is the surface energy density of the magnetic domain wall and $l$ is the length of the domain wall. The surface energy density $\sigma$ is a material-specific parameter, and it is typically determined experimentally.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical description of the magnetic anisotropy in thin films, and explore its implications for the design and analysis of magnetic materials.

## Chapter 8: Magnetic Domains

### Introduction

In the realm of magnetism, the concept of magnetic domains plays a pivotal role. This chapter, "Magnetic Domains," is dedicated to unraveling the intricacies of these domains and their significance in the broader context of magnetic materials.

Magnetic domains are regions within a magnetic material where the magnetization is uniform. These domains are separated by domain walls, where the magnetization changes direction. The size and arrangement of these domains can significantly influence the magnetic properties of a material. For instance, the coercivity of a material, which is a measure of its resistance to changes in magnetization, is largely determined by the size and distribution of these domains.

In this chapter, we will delve into the fundamental principles that govern the formation and behavior of magnetic domains. We will explore the factors that influence the size and shape of these domains, such as the material's crystal structure, temperature, and applied magnetic field. We will also discuss the mathematical models that describe these phenomena, such as the Stoner-Wohlfarth model and the Villari effect.

We will also touch upon the practical implications of magnetic domains. For instance, the size and distribution of magnetic domains can significantly impact the performance of magnetic devices, such as hard disk drives and magnetic sensors. Understanding these phenomena is therefore crucial for the design and optimization of these devices.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of magnetic domains, from the basic principles to the advanced mathematical models. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field of magnetism, we hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for you.

As we journey through the world of magnetic domains, we hope to illuminate the fascinating interplay between magnetism and materials science, and to equip you with the knowledge and tools to explore this exciting field further.




#### 7.1b Shape Anisotropy

Shape anisotropy is another important aspect of magnetic anisotropy. It refers to the directional dependence of a material's magnetic properties due to its shape or geometry. This anisotropy can be induced by the shape of the material, such as a thin film or a nanoparticle, or by the application of an external magnetic field.

The shape anisotropy can be understood in terms of the magnetization process. In a ferromagnetic material, the magnetization is not uniform throughout the material. It is concentrated in regions called magnetic domains, which are separated by domain walls. The shape of the material can influence the orientation of these domains and the direction of the magnetization within them.

For example, in a thin film, the domains tend to align with the plane of the film. This is because the energy required to create a domain wall is proportional to the area of the wall. Therefore, creating a domain wall perpendicular to the plane of the film requires more energy than creating a wall parallel to the plane. As a result, the magnetization in the film tends to align with the plane.

Similarly, in a nanoparticle, the shape of the particle can influence the orientation of the domains. For example, a spherical nanoparticle will have a different magnetization behavior than a rod-like nanoparticle. This can be exploited in applications such as data storage, where the shape anisotropy can be used to control the magnetic properties of the material.

The shape anisotropy can also be induced by the application of an external magnetic field. This is known as shape-field anisotropy. The external field can align the domains and the magnetization within them, leading to a directional dependence of the material's magnetic properties.

In conclusion, shape anisotropy is an important aspect of magnetic anisotropy. It refers to the directional dependence of a material's magnetic properties due to its shape or geometry. Understanding and controlling this anisotropy is crucial for the development of advanced magnetic materials and devices.

#### 7.1c Applications of Magnetic Anisotropy

Magnetic anisotropy, including shape anisotropy, has a wide range of applications in various fields. These applications leverage the directional dependence of magnetic properties to achieve specific functionalities. In this section, we will discuss some of the key applications of magnetic anisotropy.

##### Data Storage

One of the most significant applications of magnetic anisotropy is in data storage. The directional dependence of magnetic properties allows for the creation of magnetic domains and the storage of data in the form of magnetic bits. The shape anisotropy can be exploited to control the magnetic properties of the material, enabling the creation of high-density data storage devices.

For example, in a hard disk drive, the shape anisotropy of the magnetic material is used to control the orientation of the domains and the direction of the magnetization within them. This allows for the creation of tiny magnetic bits, which can store a single bit of data. By manipulating the shape anisotropy, it is possible to create high-density data storage devices.

##### Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

Magnetic anisotropy is also used in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), a medical imaging technique that uses the magnetic properties of materials to generate images of the body's internal structures. The shape anisotropy of the material can be exploited to control the direction of the magnetization, which can then be detected and used to create an image.

In MRI, a strong magnetic field is applied to the body, which aligns the domains and the magnetization within them. A radio frequency pulse is then applied, which causes the magnetization to precess around the direction of the applied field. By detecting the precession, it is possible to create an image of the body's internal structures.

##### Magnetic Sensors

Magnetic anisotropy is also used in magnetic sensors, which are devices that detect changes in magnetic fields. The shape anisotropy of the material can be exploited to create sensitive magnetic sensors.

For example, in a Hall effect sensor, the shape anisotropy of the material is used to create a Hall element, which is a device that detects changes in magnetic fields. The Hall element is a thin layer of magnetic material, which is subjected to a constant magnetic field. When a change in the magnetic field is detected, it causes a change in the magnetization of the material, which can be detected and used to generate a signal.

In conclusion, magnetic anisotropy, including shape anisotropy, has a wide range of applications in various fields. By understanding and controlling the directional dependence of magnetic properties, it is possible to create advanced magnetic materials and devices.

## Chapter 8: Magnetic Domains

### Introduction

In the realm of magnetism, the concept of magnetic domains plays a pivotal role. This chapter, "Magnetic Domains," is dedicated to unraveling the intricacies of these domains and their significance in the broader context of magnetic materials. 

Magnetic domains are regions within a magnetic material where the magnetization is uniform. These domains are separated by domain walls, where the magnetization changes direction. The size and arrangement of these domains can significantly influence the magnetic properties of a material. 

The study of magnetic domains is crucial for understanding the behavior of magnetic materials. It helps us comprehend how these materials respond to external magnetic fields, how they store and release magnetic energy, and how they interact with other magnetic materials. 

In this chapter, we will delve into the fundamental principles that govern the formation and behavior of magnetic domains. We will explore the factors that influence the size and shape of these domains, such as the material's crystal structure, temperature, and applied magnetic field. 

We will also discuss the concept of domain walls and their role in the magnetic properties of materials. We will examine how these walls can move and interact, leading to phenomena such as domain wall pinning and domain wall motion. 

Finally, we will look at the practical implications of magnetic domains in various applications, from data storage to magnetic resonance imaging. 

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of magnetic domains and their importance in the field of magnetism. You will be equipped with the knowledge to analyze and predict the behavior of magnetic materials under different conditions. 

So, let's embark on this journey to explore the fascinating world of magnetic domains.




#### 7.1c Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy

Magnetocrystalline anisotropy is a type of magnetic anisotropy that arises due to the crystal structure of a material. It is a result of the interaction between the magnetic moments of the atoms in the material and the crystal lattice. This anisotropy can significantly influence the magnetic properties of a material, making it an important topic in the study of magnetic materials.

The magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy is generally represented as an expansion in powers of the direction cosines of the magnetization. The magnetization vector can be written as `$\mathbf{M} = M_x \mathbf{e}_x + M_y \mathbf{e}_y + M_z \mathbf{e}_z$`, where `$M_x$`, `$M_y$`, and `$M_z$` are the components of the magnetization along the `$x$`, `$y$`, and `$z$` axes, respectively, and `$\mathbf{e}_x$`, `$\mathbf{e}_y$`, and `$\mathbf{e}_z$` are the unit vectors along these axes. Because of time reversal symmetry, only even powers of the cosines are allowed. The nonzero terms in the expansion depend on the crystal system ("e.g.", cubic or hexagonal). The "order" of a term in the expansion is the sum of all the exponents of magnetization components, "e.g.", `$M_x^2 M_y^2$` is second order.

In the case of uniaxial anisotropy, more than one kind of crystal system has a single axis of high symmetry (threefold, fourfold, or sixfold). The anisotropy of such crystals is called "uniaxial anisotropy". If the axis is taken to be the main symmetry axis of the crystal, the lowest order term in the energy is

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} K_1 \sin^2(\theta)
$$

where `$K_1$` is the uniaxial anisotropy constant, and `$\theta$` is the angle between the magnetization vector and the symmetry axis. The ratio `$K_1/V$` is an energy density (energy per unit volume), and can also be represented in spherical polar coordinates with `$r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$`, `$\theta = \arccos(z/\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2})$`, and `$\phi = \arctan(y/x)$`:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} K_1 r^2 \sin^2(\theta)
$$

The parameter `$K_1$`, often represented as `$K_u$`, has units of energy density and depends on composition and temperature.

The minima in this energy with respect to satisfy

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial \theta} = 0
$$

If `$K_1 > 0$`, the directions of lowest energy are the directions along the symmetry axis. The axis is called the "easy axis". If `$K_1 < 0$`, there is an "easy plane" perpendicular to the symmetry axis (the basal plane of the crystal).

Many models of magnetization represent the anisotropy as uniaxial and ignore higher order terms. However, if `$K_1 < 0$`, the lowest energy term does not determine the direction of the easy axes within the basal plane. For this, higher-order terms are needed, and these depend on the crystal system (hexagonal, tetragonal, or rhombohedral).

#### 7.1c.1 Hexagonal System

In a hexagonal system, the axis is an axis of sixfold rotation symmetry. The energy density is, to fourth order,

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} K_1 r^2 \sin^2(\theta) + \frac{1}{4} K_2 r^4 \sin^4(\theta) + \frac{1}{2} K_3 r^2 \sin^2(\theta) \cos^2(\phi)
$$

where `$K_2$` and `$K_3$` are higher-order anisotropy constants. Depending on the values and , there are four different kinds of anisotropy (isotropic, easy axis, easy plane, and complex).

#### 7.1c.2 Tetragonal System

In a tetragonal system, the axis is an axis of fourfold rotation symmetry. The energy density is, to fourth order,

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} K_1 r^2 \sin^2(\theta) + \frac{1}{4} K_2 r^4 \sin^4(\theta) + \frac{1}{2} K_3 r^2 \sin^2(\theta) \cos^2(\phi) + \frac{1}{2} K_4 r^2 \sin^2(\theta) \sin^2(\phi)
$$

where `$K_2$`, `$K_3$`, and `$K_4$` are higher-order anisotropy constants. Depending on the values and , there are six different kinds of anisotropy (isotropic, easy axis, easy plane, hard axis, hard plane, and complex).

#### 7.1c.3 Rhombohedral System

In a rhombohedral system, the axis is an axis of threefold rotation symmetry. The energy density is, to fourth order,

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} K_1 r^2 \sin^2(\theta) + \frac{1}{4} K_2 r^4 \sin^4(\theta) + \frac{1}{2} K_3 r^2 \sin^2(\theta) \cos^2(\phi) + \frac{1}{2} K_4 r^2 \sin^2(\theta) \sin^2(\phi) + \frac{1}{2} K_5 r^2 \sin^2(\theta) \cos^2(\phi) \cos^2(\phi)
$$

where `$K_2$`, `$K_3$`, `$K_4$`, and `$K_5$` are higher-order anisotropy constants. Depending on the values and , there are eight different kinds of anisotropy (isotropic, easy axis, easy plane, hard axis, hard plane, complex, rhombohedral, and complex).

In the next section, we will discuss the effects of these anisotropies on the magnetic properties of materials.




#### 7.1d Demagnetizing Field

The demagnetizing field is a crucial concept in the study of magnetic materials, particularly in understanding the behavior of magnetic domains and the phenomenon of magnetic anisotropy. It is a result of the interaction between the magnetization of a material and its own magnetic field.

The demagnetizing field is a vector quantity, and it is defined as the negative of the magnetic field that would be produced by a magnetization distribution identical to the actual magnetization distribution, but with the opposite direction. Mathematically, it can be represented as:

$$
\mathbf{H}_{demag} = -\mathbf{H}_{self}
$$

where `$\mathbf{H}_{demag}$` is the demagnetizing field and `$\mathbf{H}_{self}$` is the self-field.

The demagnetizing field plays a significant role in the calculation of the total magnetic field in a material. The total magnetic field `$\mathbf{H}_{total}$` is given by the sum of the applied magnetic field `$\mathbf{H}_{applied}$`, the demagnetizing field `$\mathbf{H}_{demag}$`, and the exchange field `$\mathbf{H}_{exchange}$`. This can be represented as:

$$
\mathbf{H}_{total} = \mathbf{H}_{applied} + \mathbf{H}_{demag} + \mathbf{H}_{exchange}
$$

The demagnetizing field is particularly important in the study of magnetic anisotropy. It is responsible for the internal magnetic fields that resist the magnetization of a material, and it is one of the factors that contribute to the anisotropy of a material's magnetic properties.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of the demagnetizing field and its role in the phenomenon of magnetic anisotropy.

#### 7.1e Magnetic Domains

Magnetic domains are regions within a magnetic material where the magnetization is uniform. This means that the magnetic moments of the atoms within a domain are aligned in the same direction. The size and distribution of these domains are influenced by the demagnetizing field, as well as other factors such as the material's microstructure and the applied magnetic field.

The concept of magnetic domains is crucial in understanding the behavior of magnetic materials. It is particularly important in the study of magnetic anisotropy, as the orientation of the magnetization within these domains can significantly affect the material's magnetic properties.

The demagnetizing field plays a key role in the formation and stability of magnetic domains. As mentioned earlier, the demagnetizing field is a vector quantity that represents the negative of the magnetic field produced by a magnetization distribution identical to the actual magnetization distribution, but with the opposite direction. This field acts to oppose the magnetization of a material, and it is particularly strong within the domains themselves.

The demagnetizing field can be calculated using the demagnetization tensor, which is a second-order tensor that describes the relationship between the magnetization and the demagnetizing field. The demagnetization tensor is defined as:

$$
\mathbf{N} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{H}_{demag}}{\partial \mathbf{M}}
$$

where `$\mathbf{N}$` is the demagnetization tensor, `$\mathbf{H}_{demag}$` is the demagnetizing field, and `$\mathbf{M}$` is the magnetization.

The demagnetization tensor is a crucial tool in the study of magnetic domains. It allows us to calculate the demagnetizing field at any point within a material, and it provides insight into the complex interplay between the magnetization and the demagnetizing field.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of magnetic domains in more detail, and we will discuss how the demagnetizing field influences their size and distribution.

#### 7.1f Magnetic Anisotropy in Thin Films

Magnetic anisotropy is a phenomenon that is particularly pronounced in thin films. The anisotropy arises due to the demagnetizing field, which is stronger in the plane of the film than perpendicular to it. This results in a difference in the magnetic properties of the film in the two directions.

The demagnetizing field in a thin film can be calculated using the demagnetization tensor, as discussed in the previous section. The demagnetization tensor for a thin film is given by:

$$
\mathbf{N} = \frac{1}{V} \int \mathbf{H}_{demag} \cdot \mathbf{M} \, dV
$$

where `$\mathbf{N}$` is the demagnetization tensor, `$\mathbf{H}_{demag}$` is the demagnetizing field, `$\mathbf{M}$` is the magnetization, and `$V$` is the volume of the film.

The demagnetization tensor for a thin film is a 3x3 matrix, and it can be used to calculate the demagnetizing field at any point within the film. The diagonal elements of the tensor represent the demagnetizing field in the three principal directions (x, y, and z), while the off-diagonal elements represent the coupling between the different directions.

The demagnetizing field in a thin film can also be represented as a vector, with the components given by the diagonal elements of the demagnetization tensor. This vector points in the direction of the demagnetizing field, and its magnitude represents the strength of the field.

The demagnetizing field in a thin film is particularly strong in the plane of the film, and it decreases rapidly as one moves perpendicular to the film. This results in a difference in the magnetic properties of the film in the two directions. For example, the coercivity, which is a measure of the resistance of a material to changes in its magnetization, is typically higher in the plane of the film than perpendicular to it.

In the next section, we will discuss how the demagnetizing field influences the magnetic properties of thin films, and we will explore some of the applications of magnetic anisotropy in thin films.

The anisotropy arises due to the demagnetizing field, which is stronger in the plane of the nanostructure than perpendicular to it. This results in a difference in the magnetic properties of the nanostructure in the two directions.

The demagnetizing field in a nanostructure can be calculated using the demagnetization tensor, as discussed in the previous sections. The demagnetization tensor for a nanostructure is given by:

$$
\mathbf{N} = \frac{1}{V} \int \mathbf{H}_{demag} \cdot \mathbf{M} \, dV
$$

where `$\mathbf{N}$` is the demagnetization tensor, `$\mathbf{H}_{demag}$` is the demagnetizing field, `$\mathbf{M}$` is the magnetization, and `$V$` is the volume of the nanostructure.

The demagnetization tensor for a nanostructure is a 3x3 matrix, and it can be used to calculate the demagnetizing field at any point within the nanostructure. The diagonal elements of the tensor represent the demagnetizing field in the three principal directions (x, y, and z), while the off-diagonal elements represent the coupling between the different directions.

The demagnetizing field in a nanostructure can also be represented as a vector, with the components given by the diagonal elements of the demagnetization tensor. This vector points in the direction of the demagnetizing field, and its magnitude represents the strength of the field.

The demagnetizing field in a nanostructure is particularly strong in the plane of the nanostructure, and it decreases rapidly as one moves perpendicular to the nanostructure. This results in a difference in the magnetic properties of the nanostructure in the two directions. For example, the coercivity, which is a measure of the resistance of a material to changes in its magnetization, is typically higher in the plane of the nanostructure than perpendicular to it.

In the next section, we will discuss how the demagnetizing field influences the magnetic properties of nanostructures, and we will explore some of the applications of magnetic anisotropy in nanostructures.

### Subsection: 8.1a Vibrating Sample Magnetometer

The Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) is a type of scalar magnetometer that is widely used for measuring the magnetic properties of materials. It operates on the principle of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), where the resonance frequency of protons (hydrogen nuclei) in a magnetic field is measured. This technique is highly sensitive and can provide accurate measurements of magnetic properties with a resolution of up to 1 ppm.

#### Principle of Operation

The VSM operates by placing a sample in a magnetic field and subjecting it to a high-frequency vibration. The sample is typically a thin disk or rod, and it is placed in a solenoid coil that creates a strong magnetic field. The protons in the sample align themselves with the magnetic field, and when the field is interrupted, they realign themselves with the ambient magnetic field. This realignment process is accompanied by a change in the resonance frequency of the protons, which can be measured using a lock-in amplifier.

The resonance frequency of the protons is given by the equation:

$$
f = \frac{\gamma B}{2\pi}
$$

where $f$ is the resonance frequency, $\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and $B$ is the magnetic field strength. The gyromagnetic ratio is a constant for a given material, and it is used to convert the measured resonance frequency into a magnetic field strength.

#### Applications of VSM

The VSM is a versatile instrument that is used for a variety of applications. It is commonly used for measuring the magnetic properties of thin films, multilayers, and nanostructures. It is also used for studying the magnetic properties of materials under different conditions, such as temperature and pressure.

One of the key advantages of the VSM is its sensitivity. It can provide accurate measurements of magnetic properties with a resolution of up to 1 ppm. This makes it an essential tool for studying the magnetic properties of materials at the nanoscale.

#### Limitations and Future Developments

Despite its many advantages, the VSM also has some limitations. One of the main limitations is its sensitivity to external magnetic fields. Any external magnetic field can interfere with the measurements, and this can be a significant source of error.

In the future, advancements in technology may help to overcome this limitation. Researchers are also exploring the use of VSM for studying the magnetic properties of biological samples, which could open up new avenues for research and applications.

### Conclusion

The Vibrating Sample Magnetometer is a powerful tool for studying the magnetic properties of materials. Its sensitivity and accuracy make it an essential instrument for researchers in the field of magnetic materials. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see further developments in this area, leading to even more precise and efficient methods for measuring magnetic anisotropy.

### Subsection: 8.1b Magneto-optical Kerr Effect

The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) is another type of torque measurement technique used to study the magnetic properties of materials. It is based on the Kerr effect, which is a change in the polarization of light when it interacts with a magnetic material. The MOKE is particularly useful for studying the magnetic anisotropy of materials, as it provides information about the changes in the polarization of light as it interacts with the material.

#### Principle of Operation

The MOKE operates by illuminating a sample with a beam of light and measuring the change in the polarization of the light as it interacts with the material. The sample is typically a thin film or layer, and it is placed in a magnetic field. The change in the polarization of the light is then measured using a polarimeter.

The MOKE is based on the Kerr effect, which is a change in the polarization of light when it interacts with a magnetic material. This effect is due to the anisotropic nature of the material, which causes a change in the speed of light for different orientations of the polarization. This change in speed leads to a change in the polarization of the light, which can be measured using a polarimeter.

The MOKE is particularly useful for studying the magnetic anisotropy of materials, as it provides information about the changes in the polarization of light as it interacts with the material. This information can then be used to determine the magnetic properties of the material, such as its magnetization and coercivity.

#### Applications of MOKE

The MOKE has a wide range of applications in the study of magnetic materials. It is commonly used for measuring the magnetic properties of thin films and multilayers, as well as for studying the magnetic anisotropy of materials. It is also used for investigating the effects of defects and interfaces on the magnetic properties of materials.

One of the key advantages of the MOKE is its sensitivity to small changes in the polarization of light. This makes it a powerful tool for studying the magnetic properties of materials at the nanoscale. Additionally, the MOKE is a non-destructive technique, making it ideal for studying the magnetic properties of delicate or expensive materials.

In conclusion, the MOKE is a valuable tool for studying the magnetic properties of materials, particularly for investigating the effects of anisotropy and defects. Its sensitivity and non-destructive nature make it a valuable addition to the toolbox of any materials scientist or engineer.

### Subsection: 9.1a Magnetoelastic Anisotropy in Ferromagnetic Materials

Ferromagnetic materials are a class of materials that exhibit magnetism due to the alignment of magnetic moments of atoms or ions. These materials are characterized by their ability to retain a magnetic moment even in the absence of an external magnetic field. The magnetoelastic anisotropy in these materials is a result of the interaction between the magnetic and mechanical properties of the material.

#### 9.1a.1 Magnetoelastic Anisotropy in Ferromagnetic Materials

The magnetoelastic anisotropy in ferromagnetic materials is a result of the coupling between the magnetic and mechanical properties of the material. This coupling is described by the magnetoelastic coupling coefficient, which is a measure of the change in the magnetic properties of the material due to a change in its mechanical properties. 

The magnetoelastic coupling coefficient is defined as the ratio of the change in the magnetic properties of the material to the change in its mechanical properties. It is typically denoted by the symbol $\alpha$ and is given by the equation:

$$
\alpha = \frac{\Delta M}{\Delta L}
$$

where $\Delta M$ is the change in the magnetic moment of the material and $\Delta L$ is the change in its length.

The magnetoelastic coupling coefficient is a measure of the strength of the magnetoelastic interaction in the material. A higher value of $\alpha$ indicates a stronger interaction and a greater degree of magnetoelastic anisotropy.

#### 9.1a.2 Types of Magnetoelastic Anisotropy in Ferromagnetic Materials

There are three main types of magnetoelastic anisotropy in ferromagnetic materials: shape anisotropy, crystal anisotropy, and strain anisotropy.

Shape anisotropy is a result of the shape of the material. Ferromagnetic materials can exhibit shape anisotropy if their shape is not symmetric. This can be due to the presence of a magnetic field during the manufacturing process or due to the material's response to an external magnetic field.

Crystal anisotropy is a result of the crystal structure of the material. Certain crystal structures, such as the body-centered cubic (bcc) structure, can exhibit magnetoelastic anisotropy due to the alignment of the magnetic moments of the atoms or ions in the crystal lattice.

Strain anisotropy is a result of the mechanical strain applied to the material. This can be due to the application of an external stress or due to the internal stresses induced by the magnetization of the material.

#### 9.1a.3 Applications of Magnetoelastic Anisotropy in Ferromagnetic Materials

The magnetoelastic anisotropy in ferromagnetic materials has a wide range of applications. One of the most common applications is in the design of magnetic storage devices, such as hard disk drives and magnetic random-access memory. The magnetoelastic anisotropy allows for the storage of data in a more compact and efficient manner.

Another application is in the field of biomedicine. Magnetoelastic anisotropy is used in the design of magnetic drug delivery systems, where the magnetoelastic properties of the material are used to control the release of drugs.

### Introduction

Magnetic materials are a crucial component in many modern technologies, from data storage to medical imaging. Understanding the behavior of these materials at the microscopic level is essential for optimizing their performance and developing new applications. In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of magnetic domain walls and domains, exploring their properties and how they contribute to the overall behavior of magnetic materials.

Magnetic domain walls and domains are fundamental to the behavior of magnetic materials. They are responsible for the formation of magnetic domains, which are regions within a material where the magnetization is uniform. These domains are separated by domain walls, which are regions of magnetic flux lines that connect the domains. The behavior of these walls and domains is governed by the principles of magnetism, and understanding them is crucial for understanding the behavior of magnetic materials.

In this chapter, we will explore the properties of magnetic domain walls and domains, including their formation, stability, and behavior under different conditions. We will also discuss the role of these walls and domains in the overall behavior of magnetic materials, including their response to external magnetic fields and their role in data storage and other applications.

We will also delve into the latest research in this field, discussing the latest advancements and future directions. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive guide to magnetic domain walls and domains, equipping readers with the knowledge and understanding necessary to explore this fascinating field further.




### Subsection: 10.1a Magnetic Domain Walls

Magnetic domain walls are the interfaces between adjacent magnetic domains. They are regions of magnetic flux lines that connect the domains, and their behavior is crucial to the overall behavior of magnetic materials. In this section, we will explore the properties of magnetic domain walls, including their formation, stability, and behavior under different conditions.

#### Formation of Magnetic Domain Walls

Magnetic domain walls are formed when a region of magnetization splits into two domains. This split is driven by the balance of several energies within the material, including the magnetic field energy and the domain wall energy. The magnetic field energy is proportional to the cube of the domain size, while the domain wall energy is proportional to the square of the domain size.

As the domains get smaller, the net energy saved by splitting decreases. The domains keep dividing into smaller domains until the energy cost of creating an additional domain wall is just equal to the field energy saved. Then the domains of this size are stable. In most materials, the domains are microscopic in size, around $10^{-4}$ - $10^{-6}$ m.

#### Stability of Magnetic Domain Walls

The stability of magnetic domain walls is determined by the balance of several energies within the material. Each time a region of magnetization splits into two domains, it creates a domain wall between the domains. The exchange interaction which creates the magnetization is a force which tends to align nearby dipoles so they point in the same direction. Forcing adjacent dipoles to point in different directions requires energy. Therefore, a domain wall requires extra energy, called the domain wall energy, which is proportional to the area of the wall.

The net amount that the energy is reduced when a domain splits is equal to the difference between the magnetic field energy saved, and the additional energy required to create the domain wall. The field energy is proportional to the cube of the domain size, while the domain wall energy is proportional to the square of the domain size. So as the domains get smaller, the net energy saved by splitting decreases. The domains keep dividing into smaller domains until the energy cost of creating an additional domain wall is just equal to the field energy saved. Then the domains of this size are stable.

#### Behavior of Magnetic Domain Walls

The behavior of magnetic domain walls is governed by the principles of magnetism. They are regions of magnetic flux lines that connect the domains, and their behavior is crucial to the overall behavior of magnetic materials. The behavior of these walls is influenced by several factors, including the applied magnetic field, the material properties, and the size and shape of the domains.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the behavior of magnetic domain walls, exploring their response to external magnetic fields and their role in the overall behavior of magnetic materials.

### Subsection: 10.1b Magnetic Domain Walls in Different Materials

The behavior of magnetic domain walls is not only influenced by the size and shape of the domains, but also by the material properties. Different materials have different magnetic properties, which can significantly affect the behavior of magnetic domain walls. In this section, we will explore the behavior of magnetic domain walls in different materials, including ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials.

#### Ferromagnetic Materials

Ferromagnetic materials are characterized by their ability to exhibit spontaneous magnetization. This means that even in the absence of an external magnetic field, these materials can develop a magnetic moment. The behavior of magnetic domain walls in ferromagnetic materials is largely determined by the exchange interaction, which is responsible for the alignment of magnetic dipoles within the material.

In ferromagnetic materials, the exchange interaction is typically strong enough to overcome the effects of thermal fluctuations. This results in a stable, uniform magnetization within each domain. However, when a domain splits into two, a domain wall is created where the magnetization is not uniform. The creation of this domain wall requires additional energy, known as the domain wall energy.

The domain wall energy in ferromagnetic materials is typically proportional to the area of the wall. This means that smaller domains, which have smaller walls, require less additional energy to create. As a result, in ferromagnetic materials, domains tend to be larger than in antiferromagnetic materials.

#### Antiferromagnetic Materials

Antiferromagnetic materials, on the other hand, do not exhibit spontaneous magnetization. Instead, the magnetic moments of the atoms in these materials are aligned in a regular pattern, with neighboring atoms having opposite orientations. This results in a net magnetization of zero.

In antiferromagnetic materials, the exchange interaction is typically weaker than in ferromagnetic materials. This means that thermal fluctuations can more easily disrupt the alignment of magnetic moments, leading to a higher likelihood of domain splitting. However, the domain wall energy in antiferromagnetic materials is typically proportional to the perimeter of the wall, rather than the area. This means that smaller domains, which have longer walls, require more additional energy to create. As a result, in antiferromagnetic materials, domains tend to be smaller than in ferromagnetic materials.

#### Comparison

In summary, the behavior of magnetic domain walls is influenced by the material properties, particularly the strength of the exchange interaction and the domain wall energy. In ferromagnetic materials, the exchange interaction is typically strong enough to overcome thermal fluctuations, resulting in larger domains and a domain wall energy proportional to the area. In antiferromagnetic materials, the exchange interaction is typically weaker, leading to smaller domains and a domain wall energy proportional to the perimeter.

### Subsection: 10.1c Applications of Magnetic Domain Walls

Magnetic domain walls play a crucial role in the behavior of magnetic materials, and their understanding is essential for the development of new magnetic technologies. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of magnetic domain walls, including their role in magnetic data storage and magnetic sensors.

#### Magnetic Data Storage

Magnetic data storage is a technology that uses the magnetization of a material to store data. This technology is widely used in hard disk drives, where data is stored in the form of magnetic domains. The size and stability of these domains are crucial for the storage capacity and reliability of the drive.

The behavior of magnetic domain walls is particularly important in magnetic data storage. The size of the domains, which is determined by the balance of several energies within the material, affects the storage capacity of the drive. The stability of the domains, which is determined by the exchange interaction and the domain wall energy, affects the reliability of the drive.

In magnetic data storage, the exchange interaction is typically strong enough to overcome the effects of thermal fluctuations, resulting in stable, uniform magnetization within each domain. However, when a domain splits into two, a domain wall is created where the magnetization is not uniform. The creation of this domain wall requires additional energy, known as the domain wall energy. This energy is typically proportional to the area of the wall, which means that smaller domains, which have smaller walls, require less additional energy to create. This allows for the creation of smaller domains, which increases the storage capacity of the drive.

#### Magnetic Sensors

Magnetic sensors are devices that detect changes in magnetic fields. These sensors are used in a variety of applications, including navigation, positioning, and security.

The behavior of magnetic domain walls is also important in magnetic sensors. The exchange interaction and the domain wall energy affect the sensitivity and reliability of the sensor. In magnetic sensors, the exchange interaction is typically weaker than in magnetic data storage, which allows for the detection of smaller changes in magnetic fields. The domain wall energy, which is typically proportional to the perimeter of the wall, affects the sensitivity of the sensor. Smaller domains, which have longer walls, require more additional energy to create, which increases the sensitivity of the sensor.

In conclusion, the understanding of magnetic domain walls is crucial for the development of new magnetic technologies. Their behavior affects the storage capacity and reliability of magnetic data storage devices, and the sensitivity and reliability of magnetic sensors.

### Subsection: 10.2a Magnetic Domains in Ferromagnetic Materials

Ferromagnetic materials are characterized by their ability to exhibit spontaneous magnetization, which is a result of the alignment of magnetic moments of atoms or ions in a material. This alignment can occur in different ways, leading to the formation of different types of magnetic domains. In this section, we will explore the different types of magnetic domains that can form in ferromagnetic materials, including single-domain particles, polydomain particles, and exchange-biased particles.

#### Single-Domain Particles

Single-domain particles are the simplest type of magnetic domain. They consist of a single magnetic domain, with a uniform magnetization throughout the particle. The formation of single-domain particles is favored in materials with high anisotropy, where the energy cost of creating domain walls is high. This results in a lower total energy when the material is divided into smaller, single-domain particles.

The energy of a single-domain particle can be expressed as:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2}K_uV - \mu_0\mu_rH_eV
$$

where $K_u$ is the uniaxial anisotropy constant, $V$ is the volume of the particle, $\mu_0$ is the vacuum permeability, $\mu_r$ is the relative permeability, and $H_e$ is the external magnetic field.

#### Polydomain Particles

Polydomain particles, on the other hand, consist of multiple magnetic domains. These domains can be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic, and they are separated by domain walls. The formation of polydomain particles is favored in materials with lower anisotropy, where the energy cost of creating domain walls is lower. This results in a lower total energy when the material is divided into larger, polydomain particles.

The energy of a polydomain particle can be expressed as:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2}K_uV - \mu_0\mu_rH_eV + \sigma A
$$

where $\sigma$ is the surface energy density and $A$ is the area of the domain walls.

#### Exchange-Biased Particles

Exchange-biased particles are a special type of magnetic domain that can form in materials with strong exchange interactions. These particles consist of a ferromagnetic domain and an antiferromagnetic domain, separated by a thin layer of antiferromagnetic material. The exchange interaction between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic domains results in a strong coupling between their magnetizations, leading to a stable, exchange-biased state.

The energy of an exchange-biased particle can be expressed as:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2}K_uV - \mu_0\mu_rH_eV + \sigma A + \Delta E
$$

where $\Delta E$ is the exchange interaction energy.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of magnetic domains that can form in antiferromagnetic materials.

### Subsection: 10.2b Magnetic Domains in Antiferromagnetic Materials

Antiferromagnetic materials are characterized by their ability to exhibit antiparallel alignment of magnetic moments of atoms or ions in a material. This alignment can occur in different ways, leading to the formation of different types of magnetic domains. In this section, we will explore the different types of magnetic domains that can form in antiferromagnetic materials, including single-domain particles, polydomain particles, and exchange-biased particles.

#### Single-Domain Particles

Single-domain particles in antiferromagnetic materials are similar to those in ferromagnetic materials. They consist of a single magnetic domain, with a uniform antiparallel alignment of magnetic moments throughout the particle. The formation of single-domain particles is favored in materials with high anisotropy, where the energy cost of creating domain walls is high. This results in a lower total energy when the material is divided into smaller, single-domain particles.

The energy of a single-domain particle in antiferromagnetic materials can be expressed as:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2}K_uV - \mu_0\mu_rH_eV
$$

where $K_u$ is the uniaxial anisotropy constant, $V$ is the volume of the particle, $\mu_0$ is the vacuum permeability, $\mu_r$ is the relative permeability, and $H_e$ is the external magnetic field.

#### Polydomain Particles

Polydomain particles in antiferromagnetic materials also consist of multiple magnetic domains. These domains can be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic, and they are separated by domain walls. The formation of polydomain particles is favored in materials with lower anisotropy, where the energy cost of creating domain walls is lower. This results in a lower total energy when the material is divided into larger, polydomain particles.

The energy of a polydomain particle in antiferromagnetic materials can be expressed as:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2}K_uV - \mu_0\mu_rH_eV + \sigma A
$$

where $\sigma$ is the surface energy density and $A$ is the area of the domain walls.

#### Exchange-Biased Particles

Exchange-biased particles in antiferromagnetic materials are a special type of magnetic domain that can form in materials with strong exchange interactions. These particles consist of a ferromagnetic domain and an antiferromagnetic domain, separated by a thin layer of antiferromagnetic material. The exchange interaction between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic domains results in a strong coupling between their magnetizations, leading to a stable, exchange-biased state.

The energy of an exchange-biased particle in antiferromagnetic materials can be expressed as:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2}K_uV - \mu_0\mu_rH_eV + \sigma A + \Delta E
$$

where $\Delta E$ is the exchange interaction energy.

### Subsection: 10.2c Exchange Bias in Magnetic Materials

Exchange bias is a phenomenon observed in magnetic materials where the magnetization of a ferromagnetic layer is influenced by the proximity of an antiferromagnetic layer. This effect is a result of the exchange interaction between the two layers, which can lead to a shift in the hysteresis loop of the ferromagnetic layer. This shift can be beneficial for certain applications, such as in magnetic data storage, where it can increase the coercivity of the material and improve data retention.

#### Exchange Bias in Ferromagnetic/Antiferromagnetic Bilayers

The exchange bias effect is typically studied in bilayers composed of a ferromagnetic layer and an antiferromagnetic layer. The ferromagnetic layer is typically composed of a thin film of a ferromagnetic material, such as iron or nickel, while the antiferromagnetic layer is composed of a thin film of an antiferromagnetic material, such as cobalt or manganese.

The exchange bias effect can be understood in terms of the exchange interaction between the two layers. The exchange interaction is a quantum mechanical effect that leads to a coupling between the magnetic moments of atoms in adjacent layers. In the case of a ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic bilayer, the exchange interaction can lead to a coupling between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic layers.

#### Exchange Bias and Magnetization

The exchange bias effect can be observed in the magnetization behavior of the ferromagnetic layer. When the ferromagnetic layer is in proximity to the antiferromagnetic layer, the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer can be shifted. This shift can be observed in the hysteresis loop of the ferromagnetic layer, which is a plot of the magnetization of the layer as a function of the applied magnetic field.

The exchange bias effect can be quantified in terms of the exchange bias field, $H_{eb}$, which is defined as the difference in the coercivity of the ferromagnetic layer with and without the antiferromagnetic layer. The exchange bias field can be expressed as:

$$
H_{eb} = H_{c} - H_{c0}
$$

where $H_{c}$ is the coercivity of the ferromagnetic layer with the antiferromagnetic layer, and $H_{c0}$ is the coercivity of the ferromagnetic layer without the antiferromagnetic layer.

#### Exchange Bias and Magnetic Domains

The exchange bias effect can also be understood in terms of the magnetic domains in the ferromagnetic layer. The exchange bias effect can lead to the formation of exchange-biased particles, which are particles that consist of a ferromagnetic domain and an antiferromagnetic domain, separated by a thin layer of antiferromagnetic material. These particles can have a stable, exchange-biased state, where the magnetizations of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic domains are coupled due to the exchange interaction.

The exchange bias effect can be beneficial for certain applications, such as in magnetic data storage, where it can increase the coercivity of the material and improve data retention. However, the exchange bias effect can also be a source of instability in magnetic materials, leading to phenomena such as exchange bias fatigue and exchange bias aging. These phenomena can limit the lifetime of magnetic materials and need to be considered in the design of magnetic devices.

## Chapter: Magnetic Resonance

### Introduction

Magnetic Resonance, a fascinating and complex field, is the focus of this chapter. It is a technique that uses the magnetic properties of certain materials to study their structure and behavior. This method has revolutionized many areas of science and technology, from medical diagnostics to materials science.

The concept of magnetic resonance is rooted in the quantum mechanical phenomenon of spin, a fundamental property of particles. When a material is subjected to a magnetic field, its atomic spins can align either parallel or antiparallel to the field. This alignment leads to a splitting of energy levels, a phenomenon known as the Zeeman effect. When the material is subjected to a second, rotating magnetic field, the spins can precess, or resonate, around the direction of the first field. This resonance is the basis of magnetic resonance techniques.

In this chapter, we will delve into the principles of magnetic resonance, starting with the basics of spin and the Zeeman effect. We will then explore the principles of resonance and how it is used in various applications. We will also discuss the mathematical formulation of these principles, using the powerful language of vector calculus and quantum mechanics.

We will also explore the practical aspects of magnetic resonance, including the design and operation of magnetic resonance instruments. We will discuss the challenges and opportunities in this field, and how research in magnetic resonance continues to push the boundaries of our understanding of materials and their properties.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to magnetic resonance, suitable for both students and researchers in the field. Whether you are new to the field or seeking to deepen your understanding, we hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource.

As we journey through the world of magnetic resonance, we hope to illuminate the beauty and power of this technique, and inspire you to explore it further.




### Subsection: 10.2a Domain Wall Motion

Domain wall motion is a crucial aspect of magnetic materials. It is the process by which magnetic domains move and rearrange themselves within a material. This motion is driven by the minimization of the total energy of the system, which is achieved by reducing the magnetic field energy and the domain wall energy.

#### Domain Wall Motion Mechanism

The mechanism of domain wall motion is governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, which describes the dynamics of the magnetization vector $m$ in a magnetic material. The equation is given by:

$$
\frac{d m}{dt} = -\gamma \mathbf{H} \times m + \alpha (\mathbf{H} \cdot \mathbf{m}) m
$$

where $\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio, $\mathbf{H}$ is the magnetic field, and $\alpha$ is the damping coefficient. The first term on the right-hand side represents the precession of the magnetization vector around the magnetic field, while the second term represents the damping of the motion due to energy dissipation.

When a magnetic domain splits into two, it creates a domain wall between the domains. The motion of the domain wall is driven by the exchange interaction, which tends to align nearby dipoles. The domain wall moves by flipping the magnetization of the adjacent dipoles, which requires energy. The energy required for this process is proportional to the area of the domain wall, as described by the domain wall energy.

#### Domain Wall Motion and Magnetic Anisotropy

The motion of domain walls is influenced by the magnetic anisotropy of the material. Magnetic anisotropy refers to the dependence of the magnetic properties of a material on the direction of the applied magnetic field. In materials with strong magnetic anisotropy, the motion of domain walls can be significantly affected by the direction of the applied magnetic field.

For example, in a material with easy axis anisotropy, the domain walls tend to move along the easy axis of magnetization. This is because the energy required for flipping the magnetization along the easy axis is lower than flipping it along the hard axis. As a result, the domain walls move more easily along the easy axis, leading to a preferred orientation of the domains.

#### Domain Wall Motion and Magnetic Domains

The motion of domain walls also affects the size and shape of magnetic domains. As the domains move and rearrange themselves, the domain walls also move, leading to changes in the domain size and shape. This process is crucial for the formation of new domains and the evolution of the magnetic structure of the material.

In conclusion, domain wall motion is a fundamental process in magnetic materials, driven by the minimization of the total energy of the system. It is influenced by the magnetic anisotropy of the material and plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of magnetic domains.




### Subsection: 10.2b Domain Wall Pinning

Domain wall pinning is a phenomenon that occurs in magnetic materials where the motion of domain walls is hindered by defects or impurities in the material. This pinning effect can significantly influence the magnetic properties of the material, including its coercivity and remanence.

#### Pinning Mechanism

The pinning mechanism is primarily governed by the interaction between the domain wall and the defect or impurity. The interaction can be attractive or repulsive, depending on the nature of the defect or impurity. In the case of an attractive interaction, the domain wall tends to be pinned at the defect or impurity, while in the case of a repulsive interaction, the domain wall tends to avoid the defect or impurity.

The pinning effect can be described mathematically using the pinning energy, which is the energy required to move the domain wall past the defect or impurity. The pinning energy is proportional to the pinning force, which is the force exerted by the defect or impurity on the domain wall. The pinning force can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
F_p = \frac{dE_p}{dx}
$$

where $F_p$ is the pinning force, $E_p$ is the pinning energy, and $x$ is the distance from the defect or impurity.

#### Pinning and Magnetic Anisotropy

The pinning of domain walls can also be influenced by the magnetic anisotropy of the material. In materials with strong magnetic anisotropy, the pinning of domain walls can be more pronounced, as the direction of the applied magnetic field can significantly affect the interaction between the domain wall and the defect or impurity.

For example, in a material with easy axis anisotropy, the pinning of domain walls can be more pronounced along the easy axis of magnetization. This is because the domain walls tend to align along the easy axis, and the interaction between the domain wall and the defect or impurity can be more significant along this axis.

In conclusion, domain wall pinning is a crucial aspect of magnetic materials that can significantly influence their magnetic properties. Understanding the pinning mechanism and its influence on magnetic anisotropy is essential for the design and optimization of magnetic materials for various applications.




### Subsection: 10.2c Domain Wall Engineering

Domain wall engineering is a crucial aspect of magnetic materials research, particularly in the development of racetrack memory. This technology, which utilizes the motion of magnetic domains along a nanowire, has shown promising results but faces several challenges that need to be addressed.

#### Domain Wall Engineering Challenges

One of the main challenges in domain wall engineering is the slow movement of magnetic domains. Early experimental devices could only move domains slowly, requiring current pulses on the orders of microseconds to move them successfully. This was unexpected and led to performance equal to that of hard drives, which is about 1000 times slower than predicted. Recent research has traced this problem to microscopic imperfections in the crystal structure of the wires, which led to the domains becoming "stuck" at these imperfections.

Another challenge is the high voltage required to drive the domains along the racetrack. The current density must be sufficiently high to push the domain walls, which can lead to high power draw. This is particularly problematic for racetrack technology, as the voltage required to drive the domains along the racetrack would be proportional to the length of the wire. This means that a longer wire would require a higher voltage, which can be problematic for practical applications.

#### Domain Wall Engineering Solutions

To address these challenges, researchers have proposed various solutions. One approach is to use an X-ray microscope to directly image the boundaries between the domains. This can help identify the locations of these imperfections and potentially avoid them during the fabrication process. Another solution is to use a staggered nanowire structure, which can pin the domain walls precisely. Experimental investigations have shown the effectiveness of staggered domain wall memory.

Another approach is to modify the magnetic properties of the material through composition modification. Techniques such as annealing induced diffusion and ion-implantation can be used to achieve this. These techniques can be used to introduce impurities or defects that can interact with the domain walls, potentially influencing their motion.

In conclusion, domain wall engineering is a crucial aspect of magnetic materials research, particularly in the development of racetrack memory. While there are several challenges that need to be addressed, ongoing research is making significant progress in overcoming these challenges.

## Chapter: Magnetic Resonance

### Introduction

Magnetic resonance, a fundamental concept in the study of magnetic materials, is the focus of this chapter. This phenomenon, which is governed by the principles of quantum mechanics, is a cornerstone in the understanding of magnetic materials and their properties. 

Magnetic resonance is a quantum mechanical effect that occurs when a system of magnetic moments, such as those found in atoms or molecules, are subjected to an external magnetic field. The system's magnetic moments align with the field, but due to quantum mechanical effects, they do not align perfectly. This results in a precession of the magnetic moments around the direction of the field, a phenomenon known as spin precession. 

The resonance occurs when the frequency of the external magnetic field matches the precession frequency of the magnetic moments. This resonance can be observed as a sharp increase in the absorption of electromagnetic radiation at a specific frequency, known as the resonance frequency. 

In this chapter, we will delve into the principles of magnetic resonance, exploring its mathematical description, its physical interpretation, and its implications for the behavior of magnetic materials. We will also discuss the techniques used to study magnetic resonance, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron spin resonance (ESR).

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of magnetization processes and their applications. This knowledge will serve as a solid foundation for further exploration into the fascinating world of magnetic materials.




### Section: 12.1 Magnetization Processes:

Magnetization is a fundamental property of materials that allows them to interact with magnetic fields. It is a crucial aspect of many modern technologies, including data storage, medical imaging, and energy conversion. In this section, we will explore the various processes involved in magnetization, providing a comprehensive guide to understanding this complex phenomenon.

#### 12.1a Hysteresis Loop

The hysteresis loop is a fundamental concept in magnetization processes. It is a graphical representation of the relationship between the magnetization of a material and the applied magnetic field. The hysteresis loop is typically represented as a function of the magnetization (M) and the applied magnetic field (H).

The hysteresis loop is divided into four regions: the virgin curve, the ascending branch, the descending branch, and the remanent magnetization. The virgin curve represents the initial magnetization of the material when it is first exposed to a magnetic field. The ascending branch represents the increase in magnetization as the applied magnetic field increases. The descending branch represents the decrease in magnetization as the applied magnetic field decreases. The remanent magnetization represents the residual magnetization of the material after the applied magnetic field is removed.

The hysteresis loop is a crucial concept in understanding the behavior of magnetic materials. It is used to characterize the magnetic properties of a material, such as its coercivity and remanence. The coercivity is the amount of magnetic field required to demagnetize the material, while the remanence is the residual magnetization of the material after the applied magnetic field is removed.

The hysteresis loop is also used to study the effects of external factors on magnetization. For example, the hysteresis loop can be used to study the effects of temperature, magnetic fields, and external stress on magnetization. This allows us to understand how these factors influence the magnetic properties of a material.

In addition to its applications in studying magnetic materials, the hysteresis loop also has practical applications. For example, it is used in the design of magnetic storage devices, such as hard drives and magnetic tapes. The hysteresis loop is also used in the design of magnetic sensors, which are used in a variety of applications, such as navigation and detection of magnetic fields.

In conclusion, the hysteresis loop is a fundamental concept in magnetization processes. It is used to characterize the magnetic properties of a material and to study the effects of external factors on magnetization. Its practical applications make it an essential tool in the field of magnetic materials. 


#### 12.1b Magnetic Domains

Magnetic domains are regions within a magnetic material where the magnetization is uniform. This means that the magnetic moments of the atoms within a domain are aligned in the same direction. The size and distribution of magnetic domains play a crucial role in the magnetization processes of a material.

The formation of magnetic domains is a result of the competition between the exchange interaction and the magnetostatic energy. The exchange interaction is a short-range interaction between neighboring atoms, while the magnetostatic energy is a long-range interaction between magnetic moments. In a magnetic material, the exchange interaction tends to align the magnetic moments of neighboring atoms, while the magnetostatic energy tends to align them in the opposite direction. This results in the formation of magnetic domains, where the magnetization is uniform and the magnetic moments are aligned in the same direction.

The size and distribution of magnetic domains can be controlled by applying an external magnetic field. When an external magnetic field is applied, it can align the magnetic moments of the atoms in a particular direction. This results in the formation of a single magnetic domain, where the magnetization is uniform and aligned in the direction of the applied field. This phenomenon is known as domain alignment and is a crucial step in the magnetization process.

The size and distribution of magnetic domains also play a crucial role in the hysteresis loop of a material. The hysteresis loop is a graphical representation of the relationship between the magnetization of a material and the applied magnetic field. It is divided into four regions: the virgin curve, the ascending branch, the descending branch, and the remanent magnetization. The size and distribution of magnetic domains can affect the shape and area of the hysteresis loop, which are important parameters in characterizing the magnetic properties of a material.

In addition to their role in the magnetization process, magnetic domains also have practical applications. For example, in magnetic storage devices, the size and distribution of magnetic domains can affect the storage capacity and reliability of the device. In magnetic sensors, the sensitivity and accuracy of the sensor can be improved by controlling the size and distribution of magnetic domains.

In conclusion, magnetic domains play a crucial role in the magnetization processes of a material. Their size and distribution can be controlled by applying an external magnetic field, and they have important implications for the hysteresis loop and practical applications. Further research and understanding of magnetic domains will continue to advance our understanding of magnetization processes and their applications.


#### 12.1c Magnetic Anisotropy

Magnetic anisotropy is a phenomenon that occurs in magnetic materials where the magnetic properties of the material depend on the direction of the applied magnetic field. This anisotropy can be due to the shape of the material, the crystal structure, or the presence of defects. In this section, we will explore the different types of magnetic anisotropy and their effects on the magnetization processes of a material.

One type of magnetic anisotropy is shape anisotropy, which occurs when the shape of the material is non-uniform. This can result in different magnetic properties in different directions, leading to anisotropic behavior. For example, a thin film of a magnetic material will have different magnetic properties than a bulk sample of the same material. This is because the shape of the film allows for easier alignment of magnetic moments in a particular direction, resulting in a higher magnetization.

Another type of magnetic anisotropy is crystal anisotropy, which occurs due to the crystal structure of the material. In some materials, the crystal structure can result in different magnetic properties in different directions. This can be due to the alignment of magnetic moments along the crystal axes, leading to anisotropic behavior. For example, in a cubic crystal, the magnetic moments may align along the [100] direction, resulting in different magnetic properties in the [100], [010], and [001] directions.

The third type of magnetic anisotropy is magnetocrystalline anisotropy, which occurs due to the interaction between the crystal structure and the applied magnetic field. This can result in a change in the magnetic properties of the material, leading to anisotropic behavior. For example, in a ferromagnetic material, the magnetocrystalline anisotropy can result in a change in the coercivity and remanence of the material, depending on the direction of the applied magnetic field.

Magnetic anisotropy can also be induced by external factors, such as stress or temperature. For example, applying a uniaxial stress to a magnetic material can result in a change in the magnetic properties, leading to anisotropic behavior. Similarly, changing the temperature of a magnetic material can also result in a change in the magnetic properties, leading to anisotropic behavior.

The effects of magnetic anisotropy on the magnetization processes of a material can be seen in the hysteresis loop. The hysteresis loop is a graphical representation of the relationship between the magnetization of a material and the applied magnetic field. In a material with magnetic anisotropy, the hysteresis loop can exhibit different shapes and areas depending on the direction of the applied magnetic field. This is due to the different magnetic properties of the material in different directions.

In conclusion, magnetic anisotropy is a crucial aspect of magnetization processes in magnetic materials. It can be due to the shape of the material, the crystal structure, or external factors such as stress and temperature. Understanding and controlling magnetic anisotropy is essential for the design and optimization of magnetic materials for various applications. 





#### 12.1b Magnetic Saturation

Magnetic saturation is a phenomenon that occurs in magnetic materials when they are subjected to a very strong magnetic field. In this state, the material is unable to increase its magnetization any further, regardless of the strength of the applied magnetic field. This is due to the fact that all the magnetic domains in the material have been aligned in the same direction, and there are no more domains available to be aligned.

The concept of magnetic saturation is crucial in understanding the behavior of magnetic materials. It is used to characterize the magnetic properties of a material, such as its saturation magnetization and saturation flux density. The saturation magnetization is the maximum magnetization that a material can achieve, while the saturation flux density is the maximum flux density that a material can support.

Magnetic saturation is also used to study the effects of external factors on magnetization. For example, the saturation magnetization and saturation flux density can be used to study the effects of temperature, magnetic fields, and external stress on magnetization. This allows us to understand the behavior of magnetic materials under different conditions and to design materials with specific magnetic properties for various applications.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of magnetic materials and their properties, including their behavior under magnetic saturation.

#### 12.1c Magnetic Domains

Magnetic domains are regions within a magnetic material where the magnetization is uniform. In other words, the magnetic moments of the atoms within a domain are aligned in the same direction. The size and distribution of these domains play a crucial role in determining the magnetic properties of a material.

The concept of magnetic domains is closely related to the concept of magnetic saturation. As we have seen in the previous section, when a material reaches magnetic saturation, all the magnetic domains have been aligned in the same direction. This is because the applied magnetic field is strong enough to overcome the internal magnetic fields within the domains, causing them to align in the same direction.

The size and distribution of magnetic domains can be influenced by various factors, including the material's composition, microstructure, and the applied magnetic field. For example, materials with a high concentration of impurities or defects tend to have smaller domains, while materials with a more uniform microstructure tend to have larger domains.

The study of magnetic domains is crucial in understanding the behavior of magnetic materials. It allows us to understand how the material responds to external magnetic fields and how its properties can be manipulated for various applications. In the next section, we will explore the different types of magnetic materials and their properties, including their behavior under magnetic domains.

#### 12.1d Magnetic Anisotropy

Magnetic anisotropy is a phenomenon that occurs in magnetic materials where the magnetic properties of the material depend on the direction of the applied magnetic field.

#### 12.1c Magnetic Reversal

Magnetic reversal is a phenomenon that occurs in magnetic materials when the direction of magnetization changes from one direction to the opposite direction. This can happen spontaneously, or it can be induced by an external magnetic field. The process of magnetic reversal is crucial in understanding the behavior of magnetic materials, as it can lead to changes in the material's magnetic properties.

The concept of magnetic reversal is closely related to the concept of magnetic domains. As we have seen in the previous section, magnetic domains are regions within a magnetic material where the magnetization is uniform. When a magnetic material undergoes a magnetic reversal, the direction of magnetization within these domains changes. This can lead to changes in the material's magnetic properties, such as its magnetization and permeability.

Magnetic reversal can occur in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials. In ferromagnetic materials, the magnetization can change direction due to the alignment of magnetic domains. In antiferromagnetic materials, the magnetization can change direction due to the flipping of spins within a domain.

The process of magnetic reversal can be described mathematically using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. This equation describes the evolution of the magnetization vector $m$ in a magnetic material under the influence of an external magnetic field $h$ and a damping term $\alpha$:

$$
\frac{dm}{dt} = \gamma m \times h + \alpha m \times (m \times h)
$$

where $\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio and $\alpha$ is the damping coefficient. This equation can be used to model the behavior of magnetic materials undergoing magnetic reversal, and it can help us understand the factors that influence the process of magnetic reversal.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of magnetic materials and their properties, including their behavior under magnetic reversal.

## Chapter: Magnetic Domains

### Introduction

Magnetic domains are a fundamental concept in the study of magnetic materials. They are regions within a material where the magnetic moments of atoms are aligned in the same direction. These domains play a crucial role in determining the overall magnetic properties of a material, such as its magnetization and permeability. In this chapter, we will delve into the world of magnetic domains, exploring their structure, behavior, and significance in various applications.

The concept of magnetic domains was first introduced by Pierre Curie in the late 19th century. He proposed that magnetic materials could be divided into smaller regions, each with its own magnetization. This idea was further developed by other scientists, leading to the discovery of the domain structure of magnetic materials. 

Magnetic domains are characterized by their size, shape, and orientation. The size of a domain is determined by the balance of energies within the material. Smaller domains have higher energies due to the presence of domain walls, which are regions of high energy where the magnetic moments of atoms are not aligned. As a result, larger domains are more stable and are favored by the material.

The shape of a domain is influenced by the external magnetic field. In the presence of an external field, domains tend to align themselves parallel to the field, reducing the overall energy of the system. This alignment can lead to the formation of long, thin domains, known as stripe domains, or short, wide domains, known as bubble domains.

The orientation of a domain is determined by the direction of the magnetic moments of atoms within the domain. In ferromagnetic materials, the magnetic moments are aligned parallel to each other, resulting in a strong magnetization. In antiferromagnetic materials, the magnetic moments are aligned in an antiparallel manner, leading to a weaker magnetization.

Understanding the behavior of magnetic domains is crucial for the design and optimization of magnetic materials for various applications. For instance, in magnetic storage devices, the size and orientation of domains play a significant role in determining the storage capacity and speed of the device. Similarly, in magnetic sensors, the sensitivity and accuracy of the sensor depend on the behavior of magnetic domains.

In the following sections, we will explore these topics in more detail, providing a comprehensive understanding of magnetic domains and their role in magnetic materials.

### Introduction

In the realm of magnetic materials, soft ferromagnetic materials hold a significant place. These materials are characterized by their ability to easily magnetize and demagnetize, making them ideal for applications such as data storage, transformers, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this chapter, we will delve into the behavior of soft ferromagnetic materials, exploring their unique properties and applications.

Soft ferromagnetic materials are typically composed of iron, nickel, and cobalt, and their behavior is governed by the principles of magnetism. Magnetism is a fundamental force of nature that arises from the spin of particles, particularly electrons. When these particles align in a particular direction, they create a magnetic moment, which can interact with other magnetic moments to form a magnetic field.

The behavior of soft ferromagnetic materials is influenced by several factors, including the material's microstructure, temperature, and applied magnetic field. The microstructure of a material refers to its internal structure, including the size, shape, and distribution of its magnetic domains. These domains are regions within the material where the magnetic moments are aligned in the same direction.

Temperature also plays a crucial role in the behavior of soft ferromagnetic materials. As the temperature increases, the thermal energy can disrupt the alignment of magnetic moments, leading to a decrease in the material's magnetization. This phenomenon is known as thermal demagnetization.

The applied magnetic field is another important factor that influences the behavior of soft ferromagnetic materials. When an external magnetic field is applied, it can align the magnetic moments in a particular direction, leading to an increase in the material's magnetization. This process is known as magnetization.

In this chapter, we will explore these factors in more detail, examining how they affect the behavior of soft ferromagnetic materials. We will also discuss the various applications of these materials, highlighting their importance in modern technology. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the behavior of soft ferromagnetic materials and their role in the world of magnetic materials.




### Subsection: 13.1a Magnetic Softness

Magnetic softness is a critical property of soft ferromagnetic materials that determines their suitability for various applications. It is defined as the ability of a material to easily change its magnetization direction in response to an external magnetic field. This property is crucial in applications such as data storage, where the material needs to be easily magnetized and demagnetized.

The magnetic softness of a material is influenced by several factors, including its microstructure, temperature, and applied magnetic field. 

#### Microstructure and Magnetic Softness

The microstructure of a material plays a significant role in determining its magnetic softness. The size, shape, and distribution of magnetic domains within the material can affect how easily the material can be magnetized and demagnetized. For instance, materials with smaller and more uniform magnetic domains tend to exhibit higher magnetic softness.

#### Temperature and Magnetic Softness

Temperature also plays a crucial role in determining the magnetic softness of a material. As the temperature increases, the thermal energy can disrupt the alignment of magnetic moments, leading to a decrease in the material's magnetization. This phenomenon is known as thermal demagnetization. However, at lower temperatures, the material's magnetization can increase due to the decrease in thermal energy.

#### Applied Magnetic Field and Magnetic Softness

The applied magnetic field is another important factor that influences the magnetic softness of a material. When an external magnetic field is applied, it can align the magnetic moments in a particular direction, leading to an increase in the material's magnetization. This process is known as magnetization. However, if the applied magnetic field is too strong, it can cause the material to become magnetically saturated, reducing its magnetic softness.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of magnetic softness and explore how it can be quantified using mathematical models.




### Subsection: 13.1b Magnetic Coercivity

Magnetic coercivity is another crucial property of soft ferromagnetic materials. It is defined as the minimum magnetic field strength required to demagnetize a material. This property is particularly important in applications where the material needs to retain its magnetization, such as in magnetic data storage.

#### Coercivity and Magnetic Domains

The coercivity of a material is closely related to its magnetic domains. As mentioned earlier, the size and distribution of magnetic domains within a material can affect its magnetic softness. Similarly, the coercivity of a material is influenced by the stability of its magnetic domains. Materials with more stable magnetic domains, i.e., those with larger coercivity, are less prone to demagnetization.

#### Coercivity and Magnetic Anisotropy

Magnetic anisotropy, the property of a material to exhibit different magnetic properties in different directions, can also affect the coercivity of a material. In anisotropic materials, the coercivity can vary depending on the direction of the applied magnetic field. This is because the magnetic domains in different directions may have different stabilities, leading to variations in the coercivity.

#### Coercivity and Magnetic Softness

The coercivity of a material is inversely proportional to its magnetic softness. Materials with high coercivity tend to be less magnetically soft, and vice versa. This relationship is crucial in the design and selection of materials for specific applications. For instance, in data storage applications, materials with high coercivity are preferred to ensure the stability of the stored data.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of magnetic anisotropy and its implications for soft ferromagnetic materials.

# Iron–nickel clusters

## Magnetic properties

The magnetic properties of metal clusters are strongly influenced by their size and surface ligands. In general, the magnetic moments in small metal clusters are larger than in the case of a macroscopic bulk metal structure. For example, the average magnetic moment per atom in Ni clusters was found to be 0.7-0.8 μB, as compared with 0.6 μB for bulk Ni. This is explained by longer metal–metal bonds in cluster structures than in bulk structures, a consequence of a larger s character of metal–metal bonds in clusters. Magnetic moments approach bulk values as cluster size increases, though this is often difficult to predict computationally.

Magnetic quenching is an important phenomenon that is well documented for Ni clusters, and represents a significant effect of ligands on metal cluster magnetism. It has been shown that CO ligands cause the magnetic moments of surface Ni atoms to go to zero and the magnetic moment of inner Ni atoms to decrease to 0.5 μB. In this case, the 4s-derived Ni–Ni bonding molecular orbitals experience repulsion with the Ni-CO σ orbital, which causes its energy level to increase so that 3d-derived molecular orbitals are filled instead. Furthermore, Ni-CO π backbonding leaves Ni slightly positive, causing more transfer of electrons to 3d-derived orbitals, which are less disperse than those of 4s. Together, these effects result in a 3d<sup>10</sup>, diamagnetic character of the ligated Ni atoms, and their magnetic moment decreases to zero.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have shown that these ligand-induced electronic effects are limited to only surface Ni atoms, and inner cluster atoms are virtually unperturbed. Experimental findings have described two electronically distinct cluster atoms, inner atoms and surface atoms. These results indicate the significant effect that a cluster's size has on its properties, magnetic and other.

Whether you are a student, researcher, or industry professional, this chapter will provide you with a solid foundation in the principles and applications of transport in magnetic materials. So, let's embark on this journey together, exploring the fascinating world of magnetic materials and their transport properties.




### Section: 17.1 Transport Phenomena:

Transport phenomena play a crucial role in the behavior of magnetic materials. These phenomena involve the movement of magnetic moments or spins within a material, which can be induced by an external magnetic field. In this section, we will explore the different types of transport phenomena, including spin transport, charge transport, and thermal transport. We will also discuss the factors that influence these transport phenomena, such as material properties, external fields, and temperature.

#### 17.1a Magnetoresistance

Magnetoresistance is a phenomenon that occurs in magnetic materials when their electrical resistance changes in response to an applied magnetic field. This effect is particularly significant in materials with a high degree of spin-orbit coupling, such as transition metal compounds. The magnetoresistance effect can be classified into two types: giant magnetoresistance (GMR) and tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR).

GMR is a large increase in the electrical resistance of a material when subjected to a magnetic field. It was first discovered in 1988 by the Nobel laureates Albert Fert and Peter Grünberg. GMR is typically observed in thin film structures composed of alternating ferromagnetic and non-magnetic layers. The magnetoresistance depends on many parameters such as the geometry of the device, its temperature, and the thicknesses of ferromagnetic and non-magnetic layers.

TMR, on the other hand, is a phenomenon that occurs in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). MTJs are composed of two ferromagnetic layers separated by a thin insulating layer. When a voltage is applied across the junction, electrons can tunnel through the insulating layer, and their spin orientation can be affected by the applied magnetic field. This results in a change in the junction's resistance, which can be as high as 60%.

The theoretical maximum for the TMR ratio has been predicted to be 10000%, but the largest observed values are only 604%. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is the presence of grain boundaries in the MgO barrier, which could affect the insulating properties of the junction. However, further research is needed to fully understand this phenomenon.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the principles and applications of magnetoresistance, exploring its role in various magnetic materials and devices.

#### 17.1b Spin Valve and Tunneling Magnetoresistance

Spin valves and tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) are two key applications of magnetoresistance. Spin valves are devices that utilize the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect, while TMR is a phenomenon observed in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs).

##### Spin Valves

Spin valves are devices that exploit the GMR effect to achieve large changes in electrical resistance. They are typically composed of alternating ferromagnetic and non-magnetic layers, with the ferromagnetic layers having different magnetization directions. When a magnetic field is applied, the magnetization directions of the ferromagnetic layers can be aligned, leading to a decrease in the device's resistance. This effect can be as large as 100%, making spin valves highly sensitive to magnetic fields.

The magnetoresistance of spin valves depends on many parameters, including the geometry of the device, its temperature, and the thicknesses of ferromagnetic and non-magnetic layers. For example, in a Co(1.2 nm)/Cu(1.1 nm) superlattice, increasing the thickness of copper layers from 1 to 10 nm decreased the magnetoresistance from 80 to 10% in the CIP geometry. Meanwhile, in the CPP geometry, the maximum magnetoresistance of 125% was observed for a copper layer thickness of 2.5 nm, which decreased to 60% when the thickness was increased to 10 nm.

##### Tunneling Magnetoresistance

Tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) is a phenomenon observed in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). MTJs are composed of two ferromagnetic layers separated by a thin insulating layer. When a voltage is applied across the junction, electrons can tunnel through the insulating layer, and their spin orientation can be affected by the applied magnetic field. This results in a change in the junction's resistance, which can be as high as 60%.

The theoretical maximum for the TMR ratio has been predicted to be 10000%, but the largest observed values are only 604%. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is the presence of grain boundaries in the MgO barrier, which could affect the insulating properties of the junction. However, further research is needed to fully understand this phenomenon.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the principles and applications of spin valves and TMR, exploring their role in various magnetic materials and devices.

#### 17.1c Thermal Spin Valve

The thermal spin valve is a novel type of magnetic device that utilizes the principles of magnetoresistance and thermal expansion. It is designed to exploit the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect, similar to spin valves, but with the added advantage of thermal tuning. This allows for the device to exhibit a large change in resistance with temperature, making it suitable for applications where temperature control is crucial.

The thermal spin valve is composed of a ferromagnetic layer sandwiched between two non-magnetic layers. The ferromagnetic layer is typically made of a material with high spin-orbit coupling, such as cobalt. The non-magnetic layers are typically made of materials with high thermal expansion coefficients, such as copper. When the device is heated, the non-magnetic layers expand, causing a change in the distance between the ferromagnetic layers. This change in distance can alter the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer, leading to a change in the device's resistance.

The thermal spin valve exhibits a large change in resistance with temperature, with a coefficient of thermal resistance (CTR) that can exceed 100%. This is significantly higher than the CTR of conventional spin valves, which typically range from 10 to 20%. The large CTR of the thermal spin valve makes it highly sensitive to temperature changes, making it suitable for applications where precise temperature control is required.

The thermal spin valve also exhibits a large magnetoresistance, similar to spin valves. This is due to the fact that the ferromagnetic layer in the thermal spin valve can exhibit a large change in magnetization with an applied magnetic field, leading to a large change in resistance. This makes the thermal spin valve highly sensitive to magnetic fields, making it suitable for applications where large changes in resistance are required.

The thermal spin valve is a promising device for applications where precise temperature control and large changes in resistance are required. Further research is needed to fully understand the principles behind its operation and to optimize its performance for specific applications.

## Chapter: Magnetic Domains and Hysteresis

### Introduction

In the realm of magnetic materials, understanding the behavior of magnetic domains and hysteresis is crucial. This chapter, Chapter 18, delves into the intricate world of these two fundamental concepts, providing a comprehensive guide to their principles, applications, and significance.

Magnetic domains are regions within a magnetic material where the magnetization is uniform. These domains are separated by domain walls, where the magnetization changes direction. The size and arrangement of these domains play a significant role in determining the magnetic properties of a material. The study of magnetic domains is essential for understanding the behavior of magnetic materials under different conditions.

Hysteresis, on the other hand, is a phenomenon where the response of a system depends on its history. In the context of magnetic materials, hysteresis refers to the lag between the change in the applied magnetic field and the resulting change in the magnetization of the material. This phenomenon is crucial in many applications, including magnetic data storage and magnetic sensors.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental principles governing the behavior of magnetic domains and hysteresis. We will delve into the mathematical models that describe these phenomena, such as the Stoner-Wohlfarth model for magnetic domains and the hysteresis loop equations. We will also discuss the experimental techniques used to study these phenomena, such as ferromagnetic resonance and magnetic force microscopy.

Furthermore, we will explore the applications of these concepts in various fields, including data storage, magnetic sensors, and spintronics. We will also discuss the challenges and future directions in the study of magnetic domains and hysteresis.

### Section: 18.1 Surface and Thin Film Properties:

Magnetic thin films have become increasingly important in modern technology due to their unique properties and applications. These films are typically composed of a thin layer of magnetic material, such as iron or cobalt, deposited onto a non-magnetic substrate. The thickness of these films can range from a few nanometers to a few micrometers, making them ideal for use in a variety of applications.

#### 18.1a Magnetic Thin Films

Magnetic thin films exhibit a range of properties that make them attractive for use in various applications. One of the most important properties is their magnetoresistance, which is the change in electrical resistance of a material in response to an applied magnetic field. This property is particularly useful in applications such as magnetic sensors and read heads for magnetic storage devices.

One of the most well-known effects related to magnetoresistance is the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect. This effect was first discovered in 1988 by Fert and Grünberg, who observed a significant increase in the electrical resistance of a magnetic multilayer structure when subjected to an external magnetic field. This effect has been extensively studied and has led to the development of new magnetic materials and devices.

The GMR effect is typically observed in films composed of alternating layers of ferromagnetic and non-magnetic materials. The ferromagnetic layers act as the magnetic poles, while the non-magnetic layers act as the insulators. When an external magnetic field is applied, the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layers aligns, reducing the resistance of the film. This effect is reversible and can be used to create highly sensitive magnetic sensors.

Another important property of magnetic thin films is their magnetic anisotropy. This refers to the dependence of a material's magnetic properties on its orientation. In thin films, this anisotropy can be exploited to create films with unique magnetic properties, such as uniaxial or planar anisotropy. This anisotropy can be controlled by adjusting the thickness and composition of the film, making it a valuable tool in the design of magnetic devices.

In addition to their magnetoresistance and anisotropy, magnetic thin films also exhibit other interesting properties, such as exchange interactions and surface effects. Exchange interactions refer to the interactions between the spins of atoms within a material, while surface effects refer to the changes in a material's properties at its surface. These properties can be exploited to create films with tailored magnetic properties for specific applications.

The fabrication of magnetic thin films is a complex process that requires precise control of the film's thickness and composition. This is typically achieved through techniques such as physical vapor deposition (PVD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). PVD involves the evaporation of a material and its subsequent deposition onto a substrate, while CVD involves the chemical reaction of gases to form a solid film. These techniques allow for the precise control of the film's thickness and composition, making them essential for the production of high-quality magnetic thin films.

In conclusion, magnetic thin films have a wide range of properties and applications that make them a crucial component in modern technology. Their unique properties, such as magnetoresistance and anisotropy, can be exploited to create highly sensitive magnetic sensors and tailored magnetic materials for specific applications. The fabrication of these films requires precise control of their thickness and composition, making it a complex but essential process in the production of magnetic devices.

# Spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy

## Applications of SP-STM

The spin polarized scanning tunneling microscope is a versatile instrument which has gained tremendous attention due to its enhanced surface sensitivity and lateral resolution up to atomic scale, and can be used as an important tool to study ferromagnetic materials, such as dysprosium (Dy), quasi-2D thin films, nano islands and quasi-1D nanowire that have high magnetic anisotropy, etc. In a study carried out by L. Berbil-Bautista et al., the magnetic domain wall or Néel wall of the width 2-5 nm present in these materials is observed by bringing the chromium (Cr)-coated tungsten tip close to the Dy layer. This causes the transfer of Dy particles from magnetic material on to the apex of the tip. The width of the domain wall is calculated as<math display="block">{\displaystyle w={\sqrt {2(A/k)}}}, </math> where <math display="inline">A</math> is exchange stiffness. The magnetic contrast is enhanced due to the presence of electronic states that are not occupied in the cluster of Dy atoms present on the apex of the tip. The formation of 360° domain walls in ferromagnetic films plays an important role in making magnetic random access memory devices. These domain walls are formed when an external magnetic field is applied along the easy direction of magnetic material. This forces the two 180° walls, which also have identical sense of rotation to come closer. In a study carried out by A. Kubetzka et al., the SP-STM was used to measure the evolution of 360° domain wall profiles of two atomic layer iron nanowires by varying the external magnetic field between 550-800 mT.

The quantum interference phenomena has been observed in cobalt islands deposited on copper(111) substrate. This has been attributed to the fact that scattering caused by surface state electron defects, such as terrace edges, impurities or adsorbates present on a densely packed noble metal surface. Spin polarized-STM has been used to investigate the surface and thin film properties of magnetic materials. This technique allows for the study of the magnetic properties of thin films at the atomic level, providing valuable insights into their behavior and potential applications.

### Subsection: 18.1b Surface Magnetism

Surface magnetism is a crucial aspect of thin film magnetism, as it plays a significant role in determining the overall magnetic properties of a thin film. The surface of a thin film is typically composed of a few atomic layers, and its magnetic properties can be significantly different from those of the bulk material. This is due to the presence of surface states and defects, which can alter the electronic structure and magnetic behavior of the film.

One of the key factors that influence surface magnetism is the presence of surface states. These are electronic states that exist at the surface of a material, and they can significantly affect the magnetic properties of a thin film. Surface states can be caused by the presence of impurities, defects, or the termination of a crystal lattice at the surface. These states can alter the electronic structure of the film, leading to changes in its magnetic properties.

Another important factor that affects surface magnetism is the presence of defects. These can be caused by imperfections in the crystal structure of the film, or by the presence of impurities. Defects can significantly alter the magnetic properties of a thin film, as they can disrupt the alignment of magnetic moments and create regions of magnetic disorder.

The study of surface magnetism is crucial for understanding the behavior of thin films and their potential applications. By using techniques such as spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, researchers can investigate the surface and thin film properties of magnetic materials at the atomic level. This allows for a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms and can lead to the development of new and improved magnetic materials.

### Subsection: 18.1c Magnetic Multilayers

Magnetic multilayers are a type of thin film that consists of alternating layers of ferromagnetic and non-magnetic materials. These layers are typically only a few nanometers thick and are deposited on a substrate to create a magnetic structure with unique properties. Magnetic multilayers have a wide range of applications, including in data storage, magnetic sensors, and spintronics.

#### 18.1c.1 Structure and Properties of Magnetic Multilayers

The structure of a magnetic multilayer is determined by the type of materials used and the thickness of each layer. The most common type of magnetic multilayer is the FeCoB/MgO/FeCoB structure, which is used in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). In this structure, the FeCoB layers act as the ferromagnetic layers, while the MgO layer acts as the non-magnetic insulating layer.

The properties of magnetic multilayers are highly dependent on their structure. The thickness of each layer can greatly affect the magnetoresistance of the multilayer. For example, in FeCoB/MgO/FeCoB MTJs, increasing the thickness of the copper layers from 1 to 10 nm decreased the magnetoresistance from 80% to 10%. This is due to the increased resistance of the copper layers, which act as a conduction path between the ferromagnetic layers.

#### 18.1c.2 Applications of Magnetic Multilayers

Magnetic multilayers have a wide range of applications due to their unique properties. One of the most common applications is in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), which are used in data storage and magnetic sensors. The high magnetoresistance of MTJs allows for the storage of large amounts of data and the detection of small magnetic fields.

Another important application of magnetic multilayers is in spintronics. Spintronics is a field that utilizes the spin of electrons to store and process information. Magnetic multilayers are used in spintronic devices to create magnetic domains with specific spin orientations, which can be used to store and manipulate information.

#### 18.1c.3 Future Developments in Magnetic Multilayers

As technology continues to advance, there is a growing need for magnetic materials with even higher magnetoresistance and lower resistance. This has led to ongoing research into the development of new magnetic multilayer structures.

### Section: 19.1 Magnetic Recording Principles:

Magnetic recording is a technology that has been widely used for data storage and retrieval. It involves the use of magnetic materials to store and retrieve data, making it a crucial component in modern technology. In this section, we will discuss the principles of magnetic recording, including the behavior of magnetic materials and the principles of magnetization.

#### 19.1a Magnetic Recording Techniques

There are several techniques used in magnetic recording, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. These techniques can be broadly categorized into two types: analog and digital.

Analog magnetic recording techniques involve the use of continuous signals to record and retrieve data. One of the most common analog techniques is the use of magnetic tapes, which were widely used in the past for data storage and retrieval. However, with the advent of digital technology, analog magnetic recording techniques have become obsolete.

Digital magnetic recording techniques, on the other hand, involve the use of discrete signals to record and retrieve data. One of the most common digital techniques is the use of hard disk drives, which have become the standard for data storage and retrieval in modern computers.

#### 19.1b Head-Media Interface

The head-media interface is a crucial component in magnetic recording. It is responsible for the transfer of data between the magnetic head and the magnetic media. The interface must be carefully designed to ensure efficient and reliable data transfer.

The head-media interface can be classified into two types: contact and non-contact. In contact interfaces, the magnetic head directly touches the magnetic media, while in non-contact interfaces, there is a gap between the head and the media. Non-contact interfaces are more commonly used in modern magnetic recording systems due to their higher data transfer rates and lower wear and tear on the media.

#### 19.1c Magnetic Recording Applications

Magnetic recording has a wide range of applications in various industries. One of the most common applications is in data storage and retrieval, where magnetic hard drives are used to store and access large amounts of data. Magnetic recording is also used in telecommunications, where it is used for data transmission and storage.

In the field of healthcare, magnetic recording is used for medical imaging, such as MRI scans. It is also used in the entertainment industry for recording and playback of audio and video signals.

In conclusion, magnetic recording is a crucial technology that has revolutionized data storage and retrieval. Its principles and techniques have been continuously evolving, and it continues to play a vital role in modern technology.

# WDC 65C02

## 65SC02

The 65SC02 is a variant of the WDC 65C02 without bit instructions # Disc Filing System

## Physical format

DFS conventionally uses one side of a double-density 5¼" floppy disc. Discs are formatted as either 40 or 80 track, giving a capacity of 100 or 200 KB per side (ten 256-byte sectors per track, with FM encoding).

The capacity is limited by the choice of the Intel 8271 controller in the original BBC Micro, which only supports FM encoding, not the MFM encoding which was already in common use by the time of the BBC Micro's launch. FM encoding gives half the recording capacity of MFM for a given physical disc density.

FM and MFM encoding are commonly referred to as "single density" and "double density", although the discs and drives are the same, unlike "high density", which uses different drives and discs.

Double-density 3½" discs can be formatted and used with 1770 DFS (the Intel 8271-based DFS has problems with many 3½" drives), giving the same "single-density" capacity with FM encoding, but this was not originally standard practice. 3½" discs were normally formatted as MFM "double density" using the later Advanced Disc Filing System, as this is present in all Acorn machines supplied with 3½" drives. As of 2009, 3½" drives are more commonly used with BBC Micros than in the past, including use with DFS, due to their greater availability and easier data interchange with more recent computers.

High-density 5¼" and 3½" discs are not supported by DFS.

### Single- and double-sided operation

The DFS does not directly support double-sided discs; instead, the two heads of a double-sided drive are treated as two separate logical drives. The DFS can support up to four volumes, numbered from 0 to 3. Drive 0 is the default with drive 1 representing a second drive attached to the cable. "Drive" 2 referred to the reverse side of drive 0, and "drive" 3 was the reverse of drive 1. There is no support for more than two physical drives.

Due to the incompatibility of the DFS with high-density discs, the use of double-sided discs is limited. This is because the DFS cannot directly access the data on the reverse side of a disc, making it difficult to use high-density discs with the system. However, with the advancements in technology, there are now ways to access the data on the reverse side of a disc, making it possible to use high-density discs with the DFS.

### Subsection: 19.1d Data Encoding

Data encoding is a crucial aspect of magnetic recording, as it determines how data is represented and stored on a magnetic medium. In this section, we will discuss the various techniques used for data encoding in magnetic recording.

#### Run-Length Limited (RLL) Coding

Run-Length Limited (RLL) coding is a technique used for data encoding in magnetic recording. It is a form of lossless data compression, where runs of data (sequences in which the same data value occurs in a row) are stored as a single data value and run length. This technique is commonly used in magnetic recording due to its simplicity and effectiveness in reducing the amount of data to be stored.

The RLL coding scheme is defined by a pair of numbers (a, b), where a and b are non-negative integers. The scheme works by encoding a sequence of data values as a sequence of (data value, run length) pairs. The run length is the number of consecutive data values that are equal to the current data value. The encoding process continues until all data values have been processed.

The decoding process is the reverse of the encoding process. The received sequence is split into (data value, run length) pairs. The data value is used to retrieve the corresponding data value from the original data sequence. The run length is used to retrieve the corresponding data values from the original data sequence. This process continues until all data values have been retrieved.

#### Modified Run-Length Limited (MRLL) Coding

Modified Run-Length Limited (MRLL) coding is a variation of RLL coding. It is used in magnetic recording to further reduce the amount of data to be stored. MRLL coding works by allowing for a larger range of run lengths compared to RLL coding. This allows for a more efficient representation of data on a magnetic medium.

The MRLL coding scheme is defined by a pair of numbers (a, b), where a and b are non-negative integers. The scheme works by encoding a sequence of data values as a sequence of (data value, run length) pairs, similar to RLL coding. However, in MRLL coding, the run length can be any non-negative integer, not just a and b. This allows for a more efficient representation of data on a magnetic medium.

#### Other Data Encoding Techniques

In addition to RLL and MRLL coding, there are other techniques used for data encoding in magnetic recording. These include:

- Delta Modulation: This technique works by representing the difference between consecutive data values, rather than the data values themselves. This reduces the amount of data to be stored, but also introduces some error.
- Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM): This technique works by representing the difference between consecutive data values using a binary code. This reduces the amount of data to be stored, but also introduces some error.
- Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM): This technique works by representing data values using a combination of amplitude and phase modulation. This allows for a more efficient representation of data on a magnetic medium, but also introduces some error.

### Section: 20.1 Magnetic Recording Materials:

Magnetic recording materials have been a crucial component in the development of data storage technology. These materials are responsible for the storage and retrieval of data in various forms, including magnetic tapes, hard drives, and credit cards. In this section, we will explore the fundamentals of magnetic recording materials, their properties, and their applications.

#### 20.1a Magnetic Particles

Magnetic particles are a key component in magnetic recording materials. These particles are typically made of ferromagnetic materials, such as iron oxides, and are responsible for storing and retrieving data. The size, shape, and distribution of these particles play a crucial role in the performance of magnetic recording materials.

One of the key properties of magnetic particles is their magnetic moment, which is the product of their magnetic dipole moment and their volume. The magnetic dipole moment is a measure of the strength of a particle's magnetic field, while the volume determines the size of the particle. The magnetic moment is a crucial factor in determining the coercivity and remanent magnetization of a material.

The magnetic moment of a particle can be calculated using the equation:

$$
\mu = \frac{V}{kT} \frac{\partial F}{\partial m}
$$

where $\mu$ is the magnetic moment, $V$ is the volume of the particle, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature, $F$ is the free energy, and $m$ is the magnetization.

The magnetic moment of a particle is also affected by its shape and distribution within a material. For example, particles with a high aspect ratio (length to width ratio) tend to have a higher magnetic moment, while particles with a more uniform distribution tend to have a higher remanent magnetization.

In addition to their magnetic properties, the size and shape of magnetic particles also play a crucial role in the performance of magnetic recording materials. Smaller particles have a higher surface area to volume ratio, which can improve the coercivity and remanent magnetization of a material. However, smaller particles can also lead to increased surface roughness, which can affect the durability of the material.

The shape of magnetic particles can also impact the performance of a material. For example, particles with a more spherical shape tend to have a higher coercivity, while particles with a more elongated shape tend to have a higher remanent magnetization. The distribution of particles within a material can also affect its overall magnetic properties.

In conclusion, magnetic particles are a crucial component in magnetic recording materials. Their size, shape, and distribution play a significant role in determining the performance of these materials. Understanding the properties and behavior of magnetic particles is essential for the development of advanced magnetic recording materials.





### Subsection: 20.1b Magnetic Thin Films for Recording Media

Magnetic thin films have become increasingly important in the development of magnetic recording materials. These films are typically made of a thin layer of ferromagnetic material, such as iron oxide, deposited onto a substrate. The use of thin films allows for higher storage densities and faster data access, making them essential for modern data storage technology.

One of the key properties of magnetic thin films is their coercivity, which is a measure of the strength of the magnetic field required to demagnetize the material. This property is crucial for determining the stability of the data stored in the film. A higher coercivity means that the data is more resistant to external magnetic fields, making it more stable.

The coercivity of a magnetic thin film can be controlled by adjusting the thickness of the film. Thicker films tend to have a higher coercivity, while thinner films have a lower coercivity. This is due to the fact that thicker films have a higher volume, which increases the magnetic moment and thus the coercivity.

Another important property of magnetic thin films is their remanent magnetization, which is the amount of magnetization retained by the material after an external magnetic field is removed. This property is crucial for determining the amount of data that can be stored in the film. A higher remanent magnetization means that more data can be stored in the film.

The remanent magnetization of a magnetic thin film can be controlled by adjusting the composition of the film. Films made of pure iron oxide tend to have a higher remanent magnetization, while films made of a mixture of iron oxide and other materials, such as barium ferrite, have a lower remanent magnetization.

In addition to their magnetic properties, the thickness and composition of magnetic thin films also play a crucial role in their performance. Thicker films tend to have a higher coercivity and remanent magnetization, while films made of a mixture of materials tend to have a lower coercivity and remanent magnetization.

Overall, the use of magnetic thin films in recording media has greatly improved the performance of data storage technology. With continued research and development, these films will continue to play a crucial role in the future of data storage.





### Subsection: 20.1c Magnetic Coatings

Magnetic coatings are an essential component of magnetic recording materials. They are thin layers of magnetic material that are applied to the surface of a substrate, such as a hard disk drive. These coatings play a crucial role in determining the performance and reliability of magnetic recording media.

One of the key properties of magnetic coatings is their magnetic permeability, which is a measure of how easily a material can be magnetized. This property is crucial for determining the amount of data that can be stored in a magnetic medium. A higher magnetic permeability means that more data can be stored in a given volume.

The magnetic permeability of a magnetic coating can be controlled by adjusting the composition of the coating. Coatings made of pure iron oxide tend to have a higher magnetic permeability, while coatings made of a mixture of iron oxide and other materials, such as barium ferrite, have a lower magnetic permeability.

Another important property of magnetic coatings is their coercivity, which is a measure of the strength of the magnetic field required to demagnetize the material. This property is crucial for determining the stability of the data stored in the coating. A higher coercivity means that the data is more resistant to external magnetic fields, making it more stable.

The coercivity of a magnetic coating can be controlled by adjusting the thickness of the coating. Thicker coatings tend to have a higher coercivity, while thinner coatings have a lower coercivity. This is due to the fact that thicker coatings have a higher volume, which increases the magnetic moment and thus the coercivity.

In addition to their magnetic properties, the thickness and composition of magnetic coatings also play a crucial role in their performance. Thicker coatings tend to have a higher magnetic permeability and coercivity, while thinner coatings have a lower magnetic permeability and coercivity. This is because thicker coatings have a higher volume, which increases the magnetic moment and thus the magnetic permeability and coercivity.

Furthermore, the composition of the coating can also affect its wear resistance and friction coefficient. Diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings, for example, have been shown to have excellent wear resistance and low friction coefficients, making them ideal for use in magnetic coatings. However, the properties of DLC coatings can vary depending on the deposition parameters and heat treatment, and further research is needed to fully understand and optimize their use in magnetic coatings.

In conclusion, magnetic coatings are a crucial component of magnetic recording materials. Their magnetic permeability, coercivity, and wear resistance play a significant role in determining the performance and reliability of magnetic media. Further research is needed to fully understand and optimize the properties of magnetic coatings for use in modern data storage technology.

One of the most well-known applications of magnetic materials is in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). MRI is a medical imaging technique that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the body's internal structures. The magnetic field is generated by a superconducting magnet, which is made of a coil of wire containing a high-temperature superconductor. This allows for a stronger and more uniform magnetic field, resulting in higher quality images.

#### Magnetic Levitation

Another important application of magnetic materials is in magnetic levitation. Magnetic levitation is the ability of a magnet to levitate or suspend another magnet or object in mid-air. This technology has been used in various industries, such as high-speed trains and magnetic bearings. Magnetic levitation is achieved by using the repulsive forces between two magnets, which allows for precise control and stability.

#### Magnetic Sensors

Magnetic sensors are another important application of magnetic materials. These sensors are used to measure magnetic fields and are essential in various industries, such as navigation, robotics, and automotive. Magnetic sensors are also used in medical devices, such as pacemakers and defibrillators. The sensitivity and accuracy of these sensors are crucial for their applications, and the use of magnetic materials plays a significant role in their performance.

#### Magnetic Domains

Magnetic domains are a fundamental concept in the study of magnetic materials. They are regions within a material where the magnetic moments of atoms are aligned in the same direction. The size and orientation of these domains can greatly affect the magnetic properties of a material. For example, in a ferromagnet, the domains are aligned in a specific direction, resulting in a strong magnetic field. However, in an antiferromagnet, the domains are aligned in opposite directions, resulting in a weaker magnetic field.

#### Magnetic Anisotropy

Magnetic anisotropy is another important concept in the study of magnetic materials. It refers to the dependence of a material's magnetic properties on its orientation. This anisotropy can be exploited in various applications, such as in magnetic storage devices. By aligning the magnetic domains in a specific direction, data can be stored and read with higher efficiency.

#### Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)

Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is a technique used to study the chemical composition of a sample by analyzing its magnetic properties. This technique is commonly used in biochemistry and materials science. MRS is based on the principle of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which is the interaction of nuclear spins with an external magnetic field. By using different types of magnetic materials, researchers can study the chemical composition of a sample with high sensitivity and accuracy.
