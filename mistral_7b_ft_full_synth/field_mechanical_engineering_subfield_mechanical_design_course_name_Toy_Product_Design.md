### Section: 2.2a Brainstorming Techniques

Brainstorming is a crucial tool in the creative process, allowing individuals and teams to generate a large number of ideas in a short period of time. It is a technique used to stimulate creativity and generate innovative ideas. In this section, we will explore the various brainstorming techniques that can be used in toy product design.

#### Nominal Group Technique

The Nominal Group Technique (NGT) is a structured brainstorming method that involves individual idea generation, anonymous idea presentation, and group discussion and evaluation. This technique is particularly useful when a group needs to generate a large number of ideas in a short period of time.

In the NGT, participants are asked to write their ideas anonymously. The facilitator then collects these ideas and the group votes on each idea. This process is called distillation. The top-ranked ideas may be sent back to the group or to subgroups for further brainstorming. This process continues until the group has re-evaluated the ideas and come up with a final list of ideas.

#### Group Passing Technique

The Group Passing Technique is a variation of the brainstorming method. In this technique, each person in a circular group writes down one idea, and then passes the piece of paper to the next person, who adds some thoughts. This continues until everybody gets his or her original piece of paper back. By this time, it is likely that the group will have extensively elaborated on each idea.

The group may also create an "idea book" and post a distribution list or routing slip to the front of the book. The first person to receive the book lists his or her ideas and then routes the book to the next person on the distribution list. This process continues until the distribution list is exhausted. A follow-up "read out" meeting is then held to discuss the ideas logged in the book.

#### Other Brainstorming Techniques

There are several other brainstorming techniques that can be used in toy product design, including:

- SCAMPER: This technique involves generating ideas by asking participants to think about a product in a new way.
- Mind Mapping: This technique involves creating a visual representation of ideas and their connections.
- Brainwriting: This technique involves writing ideas on paper and then sharing them with the group.
- Brainstorming with Pictures: This technique involves using visual aids to stimulate creativity and generate ideas.

Each of these techniques has its own strengths and can be used in different situations. The key is to find the technique that works best for your team and your specific design challenge.

In the next section, we will explore how to use these brainstorming techniques in the context of toy product design.

### Subsection: 5.1b Poster Design for Toy Products

Poster design is an essential aspect of toy product design. It involves creating visual representations of the product that effectively communicate its features, benefits, and target audience. Posters are a powerful tool for promoting and marketing toy products, as they can be used to create awareness, generate interest, and drive sales.

When designing a poster for a toy product, it is important to consider the target audience and their preferences. This will help determine the overall style and tone of the poster. For example, a poster for a toy aimed at young children may be brightly colored and playful, while a poster for a toy aimed at older children or adults may be more sleek and sophisticated.

The design of the poster should also effectively convey the key features and benefits of the toy. This can be achieved through the use of visuals, such as images or illustrations, as well as through the use of text. The text should be concise and informative, highlighting the most important aspects of the toy.

In addition to promoting the toy, posters can also be used to communicate important information, such as age recommendations, safety warnings, and product specifications. This information should be clearly and visibly presented on the poster, using a font and color scheme that is easy to read.

Posters can also be used to create a sense of urgency or exclusivity around the toy. This can be achieved through the use of limited-time offers, discounts, or exclusive promotions. By creating a sense of urgency, posters can encourage potential customers to make a purchase sooner rather than later.

Overall, poster design is a crucial aspect of toy product design. It allows designers to effectively communicate the features, benefits, and target audience of their product, while also creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity. By carefully considering the design and content of a poster, toy product designers can effectively promote and market their product to their target audience.





### Subsection: 5.1c Poster Design and Communication

Poster design is not just about creating a visually appealing image, but also about effectively communicating information to the target audience. In this section, we will discuss the key elements of poster design and how they contribute to effective communication.

#### Visual Hierarchy

Visual hierarchy refers to the arrangement of visual elements in a poster to guide the viewer's attention. This is achieved through the use of size, color, and placement of elements. The most important information should be presented in a larger and more prominent font, while less important information can be presented in a smaller and less prominent font. This allows the viewer to quickly scan the poster and understand the key features and benefits of the toy.

#### Color and Contrast

Color and contrast play a crucial role in poster design. The use of bright and vibrant colors can help create a sense of excitement and attract the viewer's attention. However, it is important to use colors that are appropriate for the target audience and the product. For example, a toy aimed at young children may benefit from bright and playful colors, while a toy aimed at older children or adults may benefit from more muted and sophisticated colors.

Contrast, on the other hand, refers to the difference between light and dark elements in a poster. A high contrast between elements can help create a sense of depth and draw the viewer's eye to the most important elements. This can be achieved through the use of dark and light colors, as well as through the use of different textures.

#### Typography

Typography refers to the use of text in a poster. It is important to choose a font that is easy to read and appropriate for the target audience. For example, a toy aimed at young children may benefit from a playful and child-friendly font, while a toy aimed at older children or adults may benefit from a more sophisticated and professional font.

In addition to choosing the right font, it is also important to consider the size and placement of text. The most important information should be presented in a larger and more prominent font, while less important information can be presented in a smaller and less prominent font. This allows the viewer to quickly scan the poster and understand the key features and benefits of the toy.

#### Imagery

Imagery refers to the use of images or illustrations in a poster. These can be used to showcase the toy and its features, as well as to create a sense of excitement and appeal to the target audience. It is important to choose images that are relevant to the toy and its target audience. For example, a toy aimed at young children may benefit from bright and colorful images, while a toy aimed at older children or adults may benefit from more realistic and detailed images.

In addition to choosing the right images, it is also important to consider the placement and size of images. They should be strategically placed to guide the viewer's attention and highlight the most important features of the toy.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, poster design is a crucial aspect of toy product design. It involves creating a visual representation of the toy that effectively communicates its features, benefits, and target audience. By considering the key elements of poster design, such as visual hierarchy, color and contrast, typography, and imagery, designers can create posters that effectively promote and market their toy products.





### Subsection: 5.2a Presenting Toy Design Ideas

Presenting toy design ideas is a crucial step in the product design process. It allows designers to effectively communicate their ideas and concepts to stakeholders, including clients, team members, and potential investors. In this section, we will discuss the key elements of idea presentation and how they contribute to effective communication.

#### Visual Aids

Visual aids, such as sketches, mock-ups, and prototypes, are essential in presenting toy design ideas. They allow designers to visually represent their concepts and ideas, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and provide feedback. Sketches can be used to quickly sketch out ideas and concepts, while mock-ups and prototypes can provide a more realistic representation of the final product.

#### Storytelling

Storytelling is a powerful tool in presenting toy design ideas. It allows designers to create a narrative around their concept, highlighting its features, benefits, and potential impact. By framing the idea as a story, designers can effectively communicate the emotional and psychological aspects of the toy, making it more relatable and engaging for stakeholders.

#### Communication Plan

A communication plan is a crucial component of idea presentation. It outlines the key messages and objectives of the presentation, as well as the target audience and communication channels. This helps designers to effectively tailor their presentation to the specific needs and interests of their stakeholders.

#### Feedback and Iteration

Idea presentation is not a one-time event, but rather an ongoing process. Designers should be open to feedback and willing to make revisions to their ideas based on stakeholder input.

One of the key benefits of interactive narrative in toy design is its potential for promoting learning and development. As mentioned in the previous chapter, branching narratives can address the four factors of learner motivation proposed by Malone (challenge, curiosity, control, and fantasy). By incorporating interactive narrative into toy products, children can actively engage with the story and make decisions that affect the outcome, fostering a sense of agency and motivation.

However, with the added complexity of interactive narrative, designers must also consider the potential for an incoherent and inconsistent user experience. As the number of decision points and branching structures increases, the type and number of algorithms necessary to manage the narrative also increase, risking a disjointed and unpredictable user experience. To overcome this challenge, designers must carefully plan and test the narrative structure, ensuring that the story remains coherent and consistent throughout the intervention.

To manage narratives within interactive systems, designers can employ two strategies: artificial intelligence (AI) and human moderation. AI, specifically narrative intelligence, enables an AI engine to dynamically generate descriptions based on users' actions at various points within the story. This approach allows for a more personalized and adaptive narrative experience for children. On the other hand, human moderation involves a team of moderators who manually manage the narrative and respond to user inputs, providing a more human-like interaction.

In conclusion, interactive narrative is a valuable tool in toy design, offering a more engaging and interactive experience for children. By carefully planning and testing the narrative structure and employing strategies such as AI and human moderation, designers can create a cohesive and enjoyable interactive narrative for children.

So, let's embark on this exciting journey through the history of toy design, and discover the fascinating stories behind the toys we have loved and played with over the years. 





### Section: 10.1 Evolution of Toy Design:

Toy design has come a long way since the early days of simple wooden toys. With the advancements in technology and manufacturing techniques, toy design has become more complex and sophisticated. In this section, we will explore the evolution of toy design and how it has shaped the toys we know and love today.

#### 10.1a Early History of Toy Design

The earliest known toys date back to ancient civilizations, where children played with simple objects such as stones, sticks, and clay. These toys were often made by the children themselves, using materials readily available in their environment. However, it was not until the 18th century that the concept of designing and manufacturing toys specifically for children emerged.

The Industrial Revolution brought about a significant change in toy design. With the rise of mass production and the availability of new materials, toy manufacturers were able to produce a wider range of toys at a lower cost. This led to the development of the first mass-produced toys, such as dolls, trains, and building blocks.

One of the pioneers of toy design during this time was Franz Kolb, a German pharmacist who invented plasticine in 1880. This soft, moldable material was a hit with children and was soon being produced commercially. Another visionary in toy design was Frank Hornby, who was responsible for the invention and production of three of the most popular lines of toys based on engineering principles in the twentieth century: Meccano, Hornby Model Railways, and Dinky Toys.

Meccano, introduced in 1901, was a model construction system that consisted of re-usable metal strips, plates, angle girders, wheels, axles, and gears, with nuts and bolts to connect the pieces and enable the building of working models and mechanical devices. This toy not only promoted creativity and problem-solving skills, but also introduced children to the principles of engineering and mechanics.

Dinky Toys, introduced in 1934, were die-cast toys that were modeled after real-life vehicles, such as cars, trains, and ships. These toys were highly detailed and realistic, providing children with a miniature version of the world around them. They were also one of the first toys to be marketed directly to children, with advertisements featuring popular cartoon characters of the time.

The Britains company, founded in 1893, revolutionized the production of toy soldiers with the invention of the process of hollow casting in lead. This allowed for more detailed and realistic figures, which became the industry standard for many years.

Puzzles also became popular during this time, with the publication of "Puzzles Old and New" in 1893. This book, written by the English lawyer and puzzle enthusiast Henry Ernest Dudeney, contained over 40 descriptions of puzzles with secret opening mechanisms. It became a reference work for puzzle games and was very popular at the time.

The Tangram puzzle, originally from China, also gained popularity in Europe and America during the 19th century. This puzzle, which involves arranging seven pieces to form a picture, was a hit with both children and adults.

In 1903, a year after publishing "Puzzles Old and New", Dudeney introduced the world to the first modern jigsaw puzzle. This puzzle, which involved fitting together pieces of a picture, was a hit with children and adults alike. It was also one of the first toys to be marketed directly to women, with advertisements featuring the puzzle as a "lady's pastime".

As we can see, the early history of toy design was marked by innovation and creativity. With the rise of mass production and the availability of new materials, toy designers were able to create a wider range of toys that were both educational and entertaining for children. These early toys laid the foundation for the toys we know and love today, and continue to inspire toy designers to push the boundaries of what is possible.

# Lego Trains

### The Gray Era (1980-91)

In 1980 the trains theme received a major overhaul (although in some markets, the second generation system was not introduced until 1981). The builds were adapted to the minifigure, which had been introduced in 1978, with buildings that were intended to integrate with the new Town theme. The color of the tracks was changed from blue to grey, and the 12-volt transformer changed to support utility functions in a more streamlined style with control switches that docked alongside the transformer, following the design style of increasingly streamlined model train controls of the time. The utility functions now included remotely controlled points, signals, wagon de-couplers and level crossings. The models gained a much more realistic appearance, including some with much longer carriage/wagon bodies and swivel bogies, and there were special windows which simulated having a pull-down glass section. Stickers were included allowing the owner to bedeck their trains with symbols of several European railway companies, such as DB, ÖBB, NS, SBB, DSB, NSB and British Rail. The railcar bases were now assembled from train-specific wheels and coupler and a greatly increased number of universal pieces. As with the previous generation, the electrical parts such as the train motor (7865) and the mains transformer unit (7864) were manufactured by Bühler on behalf of Lego. The transformer unit was also compatible with Technic motors.

Battery-operated trains were still available. The motor was kept unchanged. Upgrading a battery-operated train to a 12-volt electric train required changes to the train to fit the smaller, redesigned 12-volt motor underneath. The fixed wheels of the new 12-volt motor were black, finalizing the color scheme that had developed in the blue-track era, where 12-volt locomotives started to be distinguished by black wheels.

The 1980 train catalog and ideas book (7777) enticed Lego fans with nighttime dioramas featuring a train station and a train depot, both with working lights. The train station had a working signal and a train with a lighted headlight. The train depot had a working crane and a lighted signal. The train station also had a working crane and a lighted signal.
