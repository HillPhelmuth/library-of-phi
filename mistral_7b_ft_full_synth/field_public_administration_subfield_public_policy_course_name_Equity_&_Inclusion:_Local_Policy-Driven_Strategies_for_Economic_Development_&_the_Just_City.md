## Foreward

Welcome to "Equity & Inclusion: Local Policy-Driven Strategies for Economic Development & the Just City". This book aims to provide a comprehensive guide for policymakers, urban planners, and community leaders on how to create more equitable and inclusive cities through local policies.

The concept of equity and inclusion is not new. It has been a topic of discussion and debate for centuries, with philosophers, sociologists, and political scientists offering their perspectives on what it means and how it can be achieved. However, the practical application of these concepts in the realm of urban development and policy has been a challenge. This book aims to bridge that gap by providing a roadmap for local governments and communities to create more equitable and inclusive cities.

The book is structured around the idea of local policy-driven strategies. These strategies are designed to address the specific needs and challenges of a particular community, taking into account its unique characteristics and dynamics. This approach is in contrast to top-down policies that are often imposed on communities without considering their local context.

The book also emphasizes the importance of equity and inclusion in economic development. Economic development is not just about creating jobs and growing the economy. It is also about ensuring that all members of a community have equal access to opportunities and resources. This includes access to quality education, healthcare, housing, and employment opportunities.

To achieve equity and inclusion in economic development, local policies must be designed and implemented in a way that addresses the root causes of inequality and exclusion. This requires a deep understanding of the social, economic, and political dynamics at play in a community. It also requires a commitment to collaboration and partnership among all stakeholders, including government agencies, businesses, and community organizations.

In the following chapters, we will delve deeper into the concepts of equity and inclusion, exploring their historical and contemporary contexts, as well as their implications for urban development and policy. We will also examine case studies of successful local policies and strategies, providing practical examples and insights for readers to learn from.

I hope this book will serve as a valuable resource for those who are committed to creating more equitable and inclusive cities. Let us work together towards a future where all members of our communities have equal opportunities to thrive and prosper.


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the concept of equity and inclusion in the context of local policy-driven strategies for economic development and the just city. We have discussed the importance of creating a level playing field for all members of the community, regardless of their background or circumstances.

### Subsection: 1.1a Introduction to Planning

Planning is a crucial aspect of urban development, as it sets the foundation for the creation of a just city. It involves the process of envisioning, analyzing, and implementing strategies for the development of a community. Planning is not just about creating physical structures, but also about shaping the social, economic, and cultural fabric of a city.

#### Theoretical Foundations of Planning

The theoretical foundations of planning are rooted in various disciplines, including sociology, economics, and psychology. These theories provide a framework for understanding the complex dynamics of urban development and guide the planning process.

Modernist planning, for instance, is based on the principles of rationality, efficiency, and scientific management. It seeks to create order and predictability in the city, often through top-down approaches. On the other hand, Postmodernist planning emphasizes the importance of community participation, diversity, and sustainability. It recognizes the complexity and uncertainty of urban development and advocates for bottom-up approaches.

#### Practical Aspects of Planning

The practical aspects of planning involve the role of planners, stakeholders, and community engagement. Planners are professionals who have the requisite training to take or make decisions that will help or balance the society in order to have a functional, aesthetic, and convenient environment. They work closely with stakeholders, who are individuals or groups who have a vested interest in the planning process. Community engagement is crucial in the planning process, as it allows for diverse perspectives to be considered and leads to more effective and inclusive outcomes.

#### Challenges and Opportunities in Planning

The implementation of planning strategies can be challenging due to various factors, including limited resources, conflicting interests, and changing circumstances. However, these challenges also present opportunities for creativity and innovation. Planners can navigate these complexities by adopting flexible and adaptive planning approaches that can respond to changing needs and circumstances.

#### Planning for Equity and Inclusion

Planning plays a crucial role in promoting equity and inclusion in cities. It can be used to address issues of social and economic inequality, and create more inclusive and diverse communities. The concept of equity in planning refers to the fair distribution of resources and opportunities among all members of the community. Inclusion, on the other hand, refers to the active participation of diverse groups in the planning process.

In conclusion, planning is a complex and multifaceted process that involves both theory and practice. It is a crucial tool for creating equitable and inclusive cities, and requires the involvement of diverse stakeholders and the use of flexible and adaptive strategies. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the various aspects of planning, including its history, principles, and approaches.




### Subsection: 1.1b History of Planning

The history of planning is as old as human civilization itself. Early societies had to plan their settlements and land use to survive and thrive. The ancient Greeks, for instance, had a well-developed system of land surveying and planning, which they used to lay out their cities and farms. The Roman Empire also had a sophisticated system of urban planning, with straight roads, public buildings, and aqueducts.

#### The Rise of Modern Planning

The modern era of planning began in the 19th century, with the advent of industrialization and urbanization. As cities grew in size and complexity, the need for systematic planning became more pressing. The British engineer and planner Patrick Geddes, often referred to as the "father of town planning," was one of the pioneers of modern planning. He advocated for a holistic approach to planning, taking into account not just the physical aspects of a city, but also its social, economic, and cultural dimensions.

#### The Influence of Urban Planning Theories

The theories of urban planning have evolved over time, reflecting the changing nature of cities and society. The modernist planning theories, which emerged in the early 20th century, were heavily influenced by the principles of rationality, efficiency, and scientific management. They sought to create order and predictability in the city, often through top-down approaches.

Postmodernist planning theories, on the other hand, emerged in the late 20th century. They emphasize the importance of community participation, diversity, and sustainability. They recognize the complexity and uncertainty of urban development and advocate for bottom-up approaches.

#### The Role of Planners and Stakeholders

The role of planners and stakeholders in the planning process has also evolved over time. In the early days of planning, planners were primarily technical experts, responsible for designing and implementing physical structures. However, as the complexity of urban development increased, the role of planners expanded to include social, economic, and political aspects.

Stakeholders, too, have become increasingly important in the planning process. As urban development involves a wide range of interests and impacts, it is crucial to involve all relevant stakeholders in the planning process. This not only ensures that the planning process is inclusive and equitable, but also increases the likelihood of successful implementation.

#### The Challenges and Opportunities of Planning

Despite the advancements in planning theory and practice, the implementation of planning strategies can still be challenging. Limited resources, conflicting interests, and changing circumstances can pose significant obstacles. However, these challenges also present opportunities for innovation and creativity. With the right strategies and approaches, planners can navigate these challenges and create vibrant, sustainable, and equitable cities.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the theoretical underpinnings of planning and its practical applications. We have seen how planning is a complex process that involves the integration of various disciplines and the consideration of multiple factors. We have also discussed the importance of equity and inclusion in planning, and how these principles can be used to create more just and sustainable cities.

As we move forward in this book, we will delve deeper into the strategies and tools that can be used to implement these principles in local contexts. We will also examine case studies and examples of successful planning initiatives that have achieved equity and inclusion, providing valuable insights and lessons for future planning efforts.

## Chapter: Chapter 2: Theories of Urban Development

### Introduction

Urban development is a complex and multifaceted process that shapes the physical, social, and economic landscape of cities. It is a process that is influenced by a myriad of factors, including government policies, economic conditions, social dynamics, and technological advancements. In this chapter, we will delve into the various theories that explain the process of urban development.

Theories of urban development provide a framework for understanding the dynamics of urban growth and change. They help us to make sense of the complex interplay between the physical, social, and economic aspects of urban development. They also provide insights into the factors that drive urban development, the processes through which urban development occurs, and the outcomes of urban development.

In this chapter, we will explore a range of theories of urban development, including the traditional theories of urban development, such as the urbanization theory and the urban growth theory, as well as the more contemporary theories, such as the smart city theory and the inclusive city theory. We will also discuss the implications of these theories for urban planning and policy-making.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a deeper understanding of the theories of urban development and their relevance for urban planning and policy-making. You will also be equipped with the knowledge and tools to critically evaluate and apply these theories in your own work and research.




### Subsection: 1.1c Planning Theories

Planning theories are the conceptual frameworks that guide the planning process. They provide a rationale for why certain decisions are made and offer a basis for evaluating the outcomes of planning. In this section, we will explore some of the key planning theories that have shaped the field of planning.

#### Rational Planning Theory

Rational planning theory is one of the earliest and most influential planning theories. It assumes that planners have access to all the necessary information and can make decisions based on a rational analysis of that information. The theory is based on the principles of rational choice, which assumes that individuals make decisions based on their preferences and the information available to them.

In the context of planning, rational planning theory suggests that planners should gather all the relevant information, evaluate alternative solutions, and make a decision based on the one that maximizes the overall welfare of the community. This theory is often used in the planning of large-scale projects, such as the development of a new city or the construction of a major infrastructure project.

#### Participatory Planning Theory

Participatory planning theory emphasizes the importance of community participation in the planning process. It recognizes that planning decisions affect the lives of the community members, and therefore, they should have a say in the decisions that are made. This theory is often used in the planning of small-scale projects, such as the development of a neighborhood or the improvement of a local park.

Participatory planning theory suggests that planners should involve the community in the planning process, listen to their concerns and needs, and take these into account in the decision-making process. This theory is based on the principles of democracy and social justice, which argue that those who are affected by a decision have a right to participate in the decision-making process.

#### Sustainable Planning Theory

Sustainable planning theory is a relatively recent addition to the field of planning. It is based on the principles of sustainability, which aim to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This theory emphasizes the importance of considering the long-term impacts of planning decisions and of promoting sustainable practices in all aspects of planning.

Sustainable planning theory suggests that planners should consider the environmental, social, and economic impacts of their decisions, and strive to minimize the negative impacts while maximizing the positive ones. This theory is often used in the planning of large-scale projects, such as the development of a new city or the construction of a major infrastructure project.

#### Equity Planning Theory

Equity planning theory is a relatively new theory that focuses on the issue of equity in planning. It recognizes that planning decisions can have a significant impact on the distribution of resources and opportunities in a community. This theory emphasizes the importance of promoting equity in planning, which means ensuring that all members of the community have equal access to resources and opportunities.

Equity planning theory suggests that planners should consider the potential impacts of their decisions on different groups in the community, and strive to promote equity by providing equal access to resources and opportunities for all. This theory is often used in the planning of small-scale projects, such as the development of a neighborhood or the improvement of a local park.




### Subsection: 1.2a The Planning Process

The planning process is a systematic approach to decision-making that involves the identification of goals, the collection and analysis of data, the development of alternatives, and the selection of a preferred course of action. It is a critical component of urban development and plays a crucial role in shaping the future of cities.

#### The Planning Process in Theory

The planning process can be understood through the lens of the Analytic Network Process (ANP). ANP is a decision-making method that allows for the consideration of multiple criteria and the integration of qualitative and quantitative information. It involves the construction of a decision network, where decisions are represented as nodes and criteria as links. The process of ANP can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Understanding the ANP: The first step in the planning process is to understand the ANP and its properties. This involves familiarizing oneself with the concept of a decision network and the role of criteria in decision-making.

2. Constructing the decision network: The next step is to construct the decision network. This involves identifying the decisions to be made, the criteria to be considered, and the alternatives to be evaluated.

3. Evaluating the alternatives: Once the decision network is constructed, the alternatives are evaluated against each criterion. This involves assigning weights to each criterion and each alternative, and then using these weights to calculate a supermatrix.

4. Aggregating the criteria: The next step is to aggregate the criteria. This involves using the supermatrix to calculate a weighted sum of the criteria, which represents the overall preference for each alternative.

5. Selecting the preferred alternative: The final step is to select the preferred alternative. This involves identifying the alternative with the highest weighted sum and making a decision based on this.

#### The Planning Process in Practice

In practice, the planning process can be more complex and messy than the theoretical model suggests. It often involves multiple stakeholders with different interests, limited information, and uncertainty about the future. However, the principles of the planning process remain relevant. Planners must still strive to understand the problem, gather and analyze data, develop alternatives, and make decisions based on a rational analysis of the information available.

The planning process is not a one-time event, but a continuous cycle of decision-making. It involves monitoring and evaluating the outcomes of decisions, learning from successes and failures, and making adjustments to the plan as necessary. This iterative process is crucial for ensuring that the plan remains relevant and effective in the face of changing circumstances.

In the next section, we will explore some of the key challenges and opportunities in the planning process, and discuss how planners can navigate these in the pursuit of equitable and inclusive urban development.




### Subsection: 1.2b Planning Tools and Techniques

Planning tools and techniques are essential for the effective implementation of the planning process. They provide a structured approach to decision-making and help to ensure that all relevant factors are considered. In this section, we will explore some of the key planning tools and techniques that are used in urban development.

#### Planning Tools

Planning tools are instruments that assist planners in the decision-making process. They can be used to collect and analyze data, develop alternatives, and evaluate the impacts of different decisions. Some common planning tools include:

1. Geographic Information Systems (GIS): GIS is a powerful tool that allows planners to visualize and analyze spatial data. It can be used to map out land use patterns, identify areas of high growth, and assess the impacts of development on the environment.

2. Urban Models: Urban models are mathematical representations of urban systems. They can be used to simulate the effects of different policies and interventions on the urban environment. For example, the Simple Function Point method can be used to estimate the size and complexity of a software system, which can be useful in urban planning.

3. Decision Support Systems (DSS): DSS are computer-based tools that assist planners in decision-making. They can be used to evaluate alternatives, compare different scenarios, and make recommendations based on data analysis.

#### Planning Techniques

Planning techniques are methods used to develop and evaluate alternatives. They provide a structured approach to decision-making and help to ensure that all relevant factors are considered. Some common planning techniques include:

1. Analytic Network Process (ANP): As discussed in the previous section, ANP is a decision-making method that allows for the consideration of multiple criteria and the integration of qualitative and quantitative information. It involves the construction of a decision network, where decisions are represented as nodes and criteria as links.

2. Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA): CBA is a technique used to evaluate the costs and benefits of different alternatives. It involves assigning values to the costs and benefits of each alternative and comparing them to determine the most beneficial option.

3. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA): EIA is a technique used to assess the potential environmental impacts of a proposed development. It involves collecting and analyzing data on the environmental conditions of a site and the potential impacts of development.

In the next section, we will explore how these planning tools and techniques can be used in the context of equity and inclusion in urban development.





### Subsection: 1.2c Planning Ethics

Planning ethics is a crucial aspect of urban development and the just city. It involves the consideration of moral principles and values in the planning process. In this section, we will explore the ethical considerations that planners must take into account when making decisions that affect the lives of individuals and communities.

#### Ethical Principles in Planning

There are several ethical principles that guide the planning process. These include:

1. Social Justice: This principle emphasizes the fair distribution of resources and opportunities among all members of a community. It requires planners to consider the needs and interests of marginalized and disadvantaged groups in their decisions.

2. Sustainability: This principle recognizes the long-term impacts of planning decisions on the environment and future generations. It requires planners to consider the environmental and social consequences of their actions.

3. Participation: This principle emphasizes the importance of involving all stakeholders in the planning process. It requires planners to engage with the community and consider their input in decision-making.

4. Integrity: This principle requires planners to act with honesty, transparency, and accountability in their decision-making. It prohibits corruption and conflicts of interest.

#### Ethical Dilemmas in Planning

Despite the existence of ethical principles, planners often face ethical dilemmas in their work. These are situations where there is a conflict between ethical principles, or where following one principle may result in violating another. For example, a planner may face a dilemma when trying to balance the needs of a community with the need for economic development.

#### Ethical Decision-Making

To address ethical dilemmas, planners must use ethical decision-making techniques. These techniques provide a structured approach to evaluating ethical issues and making decisions. One such technique is the Analytic Network Process (ANP), which allows planners to consider multiple criteria and integrate qualitative and quantitative information in their decisions.

#### Ethical Codes and Guidelines

Professional organizations, such as the American Planning Association (APA) and the International Association for Public Participation (IAP2), have developed ethical codes and guidelines for planners. These codes and guidelines provide a framework for ethical decision-making and help planners navigate ethical dilemmas.

In conclusion, planning ethics is a crucial aspect of urban development and the just city. It requires planners to consider the needs and interests of all stakeholders, the long-term impacts of their decisions, and the ethical principles that guide their work. By adhering to ethical principles and using ethical decision-making techniques, planners can ensure that their decisions are fair, sustainable, and just.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the complex and ever-evolving landscape of urbanization and globalization, and how these phenomena have shaped the rise and fall of industrial cities. As we navigate through the intricacies of these topics, we will explore the lessons learned and the implications for local policy-driven strategies for economic development and the just city.

Urbanization, the process of migration from rural to urban areas, has been a defining feature of human societies throughout history. However, the scale and pace of urbanization in the modern era, driven by globalization, have been unprecedented. Globalization, the process of interaction and integration among people, companies, and governments worldwide, has profoundly influenced urbanization, leading to the rise of megacities and the fall of industrial cities.

The rise of industrial cities, characterized by large-scale manufacturing and heavy industry, was a key driver of economic growth and modernization in the 19th and 20th centuries. However, the fall of these cities, often due to deindustrialization and the relocation of industries to other regions or countries, has left many cities grappling with economic decline, social challenges, and environmental degradation.

In this chapter, we will explore the historical context of urbanization and globalization, examining the factors that have driven these phenomena and their impacts on cities. We will also delve into the lessons learned from the rise and fall of industrial cities, and how these lessons can inform local policy-driven strategies for economic development and the just city.

As we navigate through this complex landscape, we will also consider the implications of these phenomena for equity and inclusion, exploring how urbanization and globalization have shaped patterns of inequality and exclusion in cities, and how local policies can address these issues.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of urbanization and globalization, their impacts on cities, and the lessons learned for local policy-driven strategies for economic development and the just city. It is our hope that this exploration will contribute to the ongoing discussions and debates about the future of our cities in an increasingly urbanized and globalized world.




### Subsection: 2.1a Industrialization and Urbanization

The Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century, marked a significant turning point in human history. It was characterized by the rapid growth of modern industry, leading to massive urbanization and the rise of new great cities. This period saw a shift from rural communities to urban areas, as new opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants into urban areas. 

The growth of industry led to the rise of cities like Manchester, which had a population of 10,000 in 1717 but had burgeoned to 2.3 million by 1911. This rapid urbanization was a direct result of the Industrial Revolution, which transformed the economic landscape of Europe and other regions.

However, this urbanization also brought about significant social and economic challenges. The division of labor led to the husband taking paid labor jobs outside the home, while the wife was reduced to unpaid household work. This led to a decline in the status of women, as they lost their economic importance. 

Women's historians have debated the effect of the Industrial Revolution and capitalism generally on the status of women. Alice Clark argues that capitalism lowered the status of women, while Ivy Pinchbeck argues that capitalism created the conditions for women's emancipation. 

The Industrial Revolution also led to the creation of a new class of workers, the proletariat, who were employed in factories and other industrial settings. This class was characterized by its lack of ownership of the means of production, leading to a stark divide between the wealthy industrialists and the impoverished workers.

The rise of industrial cities also brought about significant environmental challenges. The rapid growth of industry led to pollution and other environmental degradation, which had a profound impact on the health and well-being of urban dwellers.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the implications of urbanization and globalization for local policy-driven strategies for economic development and the just city.




### Subsection: 2.1b The Rise of the Industrial City

The rise of the industrial city was a direct result of the Industrial Revolution. As industries began to shift from rural areas to urban centers, the need for labor and housing increased exponentially. This led to the rapid growth of cities, as people migrated from rural areas in search of employment opportunities.

The rise of the industrial city was characterized by several key features. First, the division of labor led to the creation of a new class of workers, the proletariat. These workers were employed in factories and other industrial settings, and were characterized by their lack of ownership of the means of production. This led to a stark divide between the wealthy industrialists and the impoverished workers.

Second, the rise of the industrial city was accompanied by significant social and economic challenges. The rapid growth of cities led to overcrowding, poor living conditions, and the spread of diseases such as cholera and typhoid. Women, who were often reduced to unpaid household work, experienced a decline in their social and economic status.

Third, the rise of the industrial city brought about significant environmental challenges. The rapid growth of industry led to pollution and other environmental degradation, which had a profound impact on the health and well-being of urban dwellers.

The rise of the industrial city also led to the development of new technologies and industries. The use of steam power, for example, revolutionized manufacturing processes and led to the development of new industries such as steel production and railroad construction.

However, the rise of the industrial city also brought about significant social and economic challenges. The rapid growth of cities led to overcrowding, poor living conditions, and the spread of diseases such as cholera and typhoid.

The rise of the industrial city also led to the development of new technologies and industries. The use of steam power, for example, revolutionized manufacturing processes and led to the development of new industries such as steel production and railroad construction.

In the next section, we will explore the fall of the industrial city and the lessons that can be learned from this period of urbanization and globalization.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the profound impact of urbanization and globalization on the rise and fall of industrial cities. We have seen how these two forces have shaped the economic development and social fabric of cities across the world, and how they continue to influence the policies and strategies of local governments.

The rise of industrial cities was marked by rapid economic growth, the creation of new industries, and the migration of people from rural areas to urban centers. However, this growth was not without its challenges. The concentration of people and industries in urban areas led to issues of overcrowding, pollution, and social inequality. These challenges were further exacerbated by the globalization of trade and commerce, which intensified competition and increased the pressure on cities to adapt and innovate.

The fall of industrial cities, on the other hand, was characterized by a decline in manufacturing industries, the loss of jobs, and the deterioration of urban infrastructure. This decline was often accompanied by social and economic crises, as cities struggled to cope with the changing economic landscape.

The lessons from the rise and fall of industrial cities are clear: urbanization and globalization are powerful forces that can drive economic development, but they also pose significant challenges that must be addressed through careful planning and policy-making. Local governments play a crucial role in navigating these challenges, and their strategies for economic development and the just city must be informed by a deep understanding of these forces.

## Chapter: Chapter 3: The Just City: Equity, Inclusion, and Local Policy

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the complex interplay between urbanization, globalization, and the rise and fall of industrial cities. We have seen how these forces have shaped the economic landscape of cities, creating both opportunities and challenges. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the concept of the "just city," a city that strives to achieve equity and inclusion for all its residents, regardless of their socio-economic status, race, gender, or any other characteristic.

The just city is a concept that is deeply rooted in the principles of social justice and human rights. It is a city where everyone has equal access to opportunities and resources, and where all voices are heard and valued. It is a city where the policies and decisions made by local governments are designed to promote equity and inclusion, and to address the needs and concerns of all its residents.

In this chapter, we will explore the role of local policy in creating a just city. We will discuss how local governments can use policy tools and strategies to promote equity and inclusion, and to address the challenges of urbanization and globalization. We will also examine the role of community engagement and participation in shaping local policies, and how these can contribute to the creation of a more just and inclusive city.

As we delve into the topic of the just city, it is important to keep in mind that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Each city is unique, with its own set of challenges and opportunities. Therefore, the policies and strategies that work in one city may not necessarily work in another. However, by understanding the principles and practices of equity and inclusion, and by learning from the experiences of other cities, we can develop more effective and sustainable policies that promote a just and inclusive urban environment.




### Subsection: 2.1c The Fall of the Industrial City

The fall of the industrial city was a gradual process that began in the late 19th century and continued through the 20th century. This decline was largely driven by the relocation of industries to suburban areas and other countries, as well as the rise of new industries and technologies.

The fall of the industrial city was characterized by several key features. First, the relocation of industries led to a decline in employment opportunities in urban centers. This was particularly evident in the United States, where the manufacturing sector lost over 5 million jobs between 1998 and 2010 (Bernanke, 2010).

Second, the fall of the industrial city was accompanied by significant social and economic challenges. The decline in employment opportunities led to increased poverty and social inequality, as well as the deterioration of urban infrastructure. This was particularly evident in the United States, where the decline of the industrial city was accompanied by the rise of the "urban crisis" in the 1960s and 1970s (Bernanke, 2010).

Third, the fall of the industrial city brought about significant environmental challenges. The relocation of industries led to the abandonment of urban industrial sites, which often became contaminated with hazardous waste. This posed significant environmental and health risks to urban communities.

The fall of the industrial city also led to the decline of urban manufacturing, which was a key driver of economic growth in the 19th and early 20th centuries. This decline was largely driven by the rise of new industries and technologies, such as the information technology industry, which has been a major driver of economic growth in the United States since the 1980s (Bernanke, 2010).

However, the fall of the industrial city also brought about significant opportunities for urban renewal and revitalization. The decline of industries has led to the availability of large tracts of land in urban centers, which can be repurposed for new uses such as housing, parks, and mixed-use developments. This has the potential to improve the quality of life for urban residents and contribute to the economic revitalization of urban areas.

In conclusion, the fall of the industrial city has been a complex and multifaceted process, with significant implications for urban communities and economies. Understanding the lessons from this process is crucial for developing effective strategies for economic development and the just city in the 21st century.





### Subsection: 2.2a Globalization and Urbanization

Globalization and urbanization have been two of the most significant factors shaping the modern world. The rise of globalization, characterized by increased interconnectedness and interdependence among countries, has had a profound impact on urbanization, which refers to the growth and development of cities. In this section, we will explore the relationship between globalization and urbanization, and how they have influenced the rise and fall of the industrial city.

#### Globalization and Urbanization

Globalization has been a key driver of urbanization. The increased connectivity and trade facilitated by globalization have led to the growth of urban areas as centers of economic activity. This is evident in the rapid urbanization seen in many developing countries, where the rise of globalization has led to the growth of large urban centers. For example, in China, the urban population has grown from 17% in 1978 to 52% in 2010, largely driven by the country's integration into the global economy (World Bank, 2011).

However, globalization has also brought about significant challenges for urbanization. The increased competition and interconnectedness among countries have led to the relocation of industries, resulting in the decline of urban manufacturing. This has been particularly evident in the United States, where the manufacturing sector has lost over 5 million jobs since 1998 (Bernanke, 2010).

#### The Rise and Fall of the Industrial City

The rise of globalization has been closely tied to the rise and fall of the industrial city. The industrial city, characterized by large-scale manufacturing and heavy industry, was a key driver of economic growth in the 19th and early 20th centuries. However, the rise of globalization has led to the relocation of industries, resulting in the decline of the industrial city.

The fall of the industrial city has been accompanied by significant social and economic challenges. The decline in employment opportunities has led to increased poverty and social inequality, as well as the deterioration of urban infrastructure. This has been particularly evident in the United States, where the decline of the industrial city has been accompanied by the rise of the "urban crisis" in the 1960s and 1970s (Bernanke, 2010).

#### Environmental Challenges

The fall of the industrial city has also brought about significant environmental challenges. The relocation of industries has led to the abandonment of urban industrial sites, which often become contaminated with hazardous waste. This poses significant environmental and health risks to urban communities.

In conclusion, globalization and urbanization have been closely intertwined, with globalization driving the growth of urban areas and the relocation of industries. However, this relationship has also brought about significant challenges, particularly for the industrial city. As we continue to navigate the complexities of globalization and urbanization, it is crucial to consider the lessons learned from the rise and fall of the industrial city to ensure equitable and sustainable urban development.





### Subsection: 2.2b Impacts of Globalization on Cities

Globalization has had a profound impact on cities, both positive and negative. On one hand, it has led to increased connectivity and trade, resulting in economic growth and development. On the other hand, it has also brought about challenges such as income inequality, environmental degradation, and social exclusion.

#### Economic Growth and Development

Globalization has been a key driver of economic growth and development in cities. The increased connectivity and trade facilitated by globalization have led to the growth of urban areas as centers of economic activity. This is evident in the rapid urbanization seen in many developing countries, where the rise of globalization has led to the growth of large urban centers. For example, in China, the urban population has grown from 17% in 1978 to 52% in 2010, largely driven by the country's integration into the global economy (World Bank, 2011).

#### Income Inequality

However, globalization has also brought about significant challenges for cities, particularly in terms of income inequality. The relocation of industries and the rise of the service sector have led to the decline of manufacturing jobs, resulting in job losses and income inequality. This is evident in the United States, where the manufacturing sector has lost over 5 million jobs since 1998 (Bernanke, 2010). This has led to a concentration of wealth in urban areas, resulting in income inequality and social exclusion.

#### Environmental Degradation

Globalization has also had a significant impact on the environment. The increased trade and consumption facilitated by globalization have led to increased resource extraction and pollution, resulting in environmental degradation. This is evident in the rise of deforestation, which has been linked to globalization and urbanization. Prior to these patterns of human connection, countries would have been more localized in their resource efforts and relied mainly on self-supporting goods and services. Rather than outsourcing their needs, countries would have been more likely to rely on local resources and production. However, with the rise of globalization and urbanization, there has been a shift towards outsourcing and reliance on distant locations for resources, leading to increased environmental degradation (Telecoupling, globalization and urbanization).

#### Social Exclusion

Finally, globalization has also led to social exclusion in cities. The rapid pace of change brought about by globalization has made it more vulnerable to socioeconomic and environmental crises. This is particularly true for marginalized communities and minority groups, who may be disproportionately affected by the impacts of globalization. For example, the rise of the service sector has led to job losses and income inequality, particularly for low-skilled workers. This has resulted in social exclusion and marginalization for these communities.

In conclusion, globalization has had a profound impact on cities, both positive and negative. While it has led to economic growth and development, it has also brought about challenges such as income inequality, environmental degradation, and social exclusion. As cities continue to urbanize and globalize, it is important to address these challenges and develop policies and strategies that promote equity and inclusion in the just city.





### Subsection: 2.2c Strategies for Sustainable Urbanization

As we have seen in the previous section, globalization has had a profound impact on cities, both positive and negative. To address these challenges and ensure the sustainability of our urban areas, it is crucial to implement effective strategies for sustainable urbanization.

#### Sustainable Urbanization

Sustainable urbanization is a concept that aims to balance the needs of the present and future generations while ensuring the social, economic, and environmental well-being of the city. It involves the careful planning and management of urban development to create livable, resilient, and inclusive cities.

#### Strategies for Sustainable Urbanization

There are several strategies that can be implemented to promote sustainable urbanization. These include:

- **Green Infrastructure**: Green infrastructure, such as green roofs, rain gardens, and permeable pavements, can help mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization on the environment. These features can reduce stormwater runoff, improve air quality, and provide habitat for wildlife, among other benefits.

- **Public Transportation**: The development of efficient and sustainable public transportation systems can reduce the reliance on private vehicles, thereby reducing traffic congestion and air pollution. This can be achieved through the implementation of policies that promote the use of public transportation, such as congestion pricing and the provision of subsidies for public transportation.

- **Mixed-Use Development**: Mixed-use development, where residential, commercial, and recreational spaces are integrated into a single development, can help create more vibrant and livable communities. This can reduce the need for travel and promote a sense of community.

- **Inclusive Design**: Inclusive design, which takes into account the needs and abilities of all members of the community, can help create more equitable and inclusive cities. This can be achieved through the implementation of policies that promote universal design and the provision of affordable housing options.

- **Sustainable Energy Systems**: The development of sustainable energy systems, such as renewable energy sources and energy-efficient buildings, can help reduce the environmental impact of urban areas. This can be achieved through the implementation of policies that promote the use of renewable energy sources and the provision of incentives for energy-efficient building design.

In conclusion, sustainable urbanization is crucial for the well-being of our cities and their inhabitants. By implementing these strategies, we can create more livable, resilient, and inclusive cities that meet the needs of the present and future generations.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the complex relationship between urbanization and globalization, and how these processes have shaped the development of cities throughout history. We have seen how the rise of the industrial city was a direct result of urbanization and globalization, as cities became hubs of economic activity and centers of innovation. However, we have also seen how the fall of these industrial cities was a consequence of the same processes, as globalization led to the relocation of industries and the decline of local economies.

We have also discussed the lessons that can be learned from this history, and how they can inform our approach to economic development and the creation of just cities in the future. We have seen that sustainable and equitable development requires a careful balance between urbanization and globalization, and that local policies and strategies can play a crucial role in achieving this balance.

## Chapter: Chapter 3: The Role of Government in Economic Development

### Introduction

The role of government in economic development is a topic of great importance and complexity. It is a subject that has been studied extensively by economists, political scientists, and policymakers alike. This chapter will delve into the intricacies of this topic, exploring the various ways in which governments can influence and shape economic development.

Economic development is a multifaceted process that involves the growth and improvement of a nation's economic, social, and political well-being. It is a process that is influenced by a myriad of factors, including government policies, market forces, and technological advancements. The role of government in this process is crucial, as it is the government that sets the rules of the game, creates the institutional framework, and provides the public goods necessary for economic development.

In this chapter, we will explore the various ways in which governments can influence economic development. We will discuss the different types of government interventions, such as fiscal and monetary policies, and how they can be used to stimulate economic growth. We will also examine the role of government in creating a conducive environment for private sector development, and how it can facilitate the flow of investment and trade.

Furthermore, we will delve into the challenges and controversies surrounding government intervention in the economy. We will discuss the potential trade-offs between government intervention and market efficiency, and how governments can navigate these trade-offs to achieve their development objectives.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of government in economic development. It is designed to equip readers with the knowledge and tools necessary to critically analyze and evaluate government policies and interventions in the economy. Whether you are a student, a policymaker, or a citizen interested in understanding the role of government in economic development, this chapter will provide you with a solid foundation.




### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the complex relationship between urbanization and globalization, and how it has shaped the rise and fall of industrial cities.

## Chapter 3: Equity & Inclusion: The Role of Local Policy:




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the intersection of urban social movements and new space claims in the United States. Urban social movements have been a driving force for change in American cities, advocating for equity and inclusion in various aspects of urban life. These movements have been instrumental in shaping policies and initiatives that aim to address issues of social, economic, and racial inequality.

At the same time, there has been a growing trend of new space claims in urban areas, as communities and organizations seek to reclaim and repurpose underutilized or abandoned spaces. These new space claims have the potential to transform the physical landscape of cities and create new opportunities for marginalized communities.

We will delve into the history and evolution of urban social movements, examining their impact on urban development and policy-making. We will also explore the various forms of new space claims, from community land trusts to pop-up parks, and their potential for promoting equity and inclusion in cities.

Through this exploration, we hope to shed light on the complex and ever-evolving landscape of urban social movements and new space claims, and their role in creating more equitable and inclusive cities.

### Section: 3.1 U.S. Urban Social Movements and New Space Claims:

### Subsection (optional): 3.1a Origins of Urban Social Movements

Urban social movements have played a crucial role in shaping the landscape of American cities. These movements have been instrumental in advocating for equity and inclusion in various aspects of urban life, including housing, education, and employment. In this section, we will explore the origins of urban social movements and their impact on urban development and policy-making.

#### The Garden City Movement

One of the earliest urban social movements in the United States was the Garden City movement, founded by Ebenezer Howard in the late 19th century. Howard's ideas were expressed in his book "Garden Cities of To-morrow" (1898), which proposed a new model for urban development that combined the best of both the countryside and the city.

Howard's vision was to create a new environment called "Town-Country," where individuals would establish a limited-dividend company to buy cheap agricultural land and develop it with investment from manufacturers and housing for the workers. This model aimed to address the issues of overcrowding and poor living conditions in urban areas, while also providing a more sustainable and livable environment for residents.

The Garden City movement had a significant impact on urban development in the United States. It inspired the creation of several garden cities, including Letchworth, Brentham Garden Suburb, and Welwyn Garden City, which became models for future urban planning and development.

#### The New Urbanism Movement

In the 1980s, a new urban social movement emerged, known as the New Urbanism. This movement aimed to revitalize and improve the quality of life in urban areas by promoting walkability, mixed-use development, and traditional architectural styles.

The New Urbanism movement was a response to the negative effects of urban sprawl and the loss of community in modern cities. It advocated for a more human-scale and pedestrian-friendly approach to urban development, with a focus on creating vibrant and livable communities.

The New Urbanism movement has had a significant impact on urban development in the United States. It has influenced policies and initiatives at the local, state, and federal levels, and has led to the creation of more walkable and sustainable communities.

#### The Role of Urban Social Movements in Policy-Making

Urban social movements have played a crucial role in shaping urban policies and initiatives. By advocating for equity and inclusion, these movements have brought attention to issues that may have otherwise been overlooked. They have also provided a platform for marginalized communities to voice their concerns and advocate for change.

In recent years, there has been a growing trend of new space claims in urban areas, as communities and organizations seek to reclaim and repurpose underutilized or abandoned spaces. These new space claims have the potential to transform the physical landscape of cities and create new opportunities for marginalized communities.

In the next section, we will explore the various forms of new space claims and their potential for promoting equity and inclusion in cities.

We have also discussed the role of local policies in promoting these principles. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the practical application of these concepts by examining community development at the bargaining table.

Community development is a process that involves the active participation of community members in identifying and addressing their needs and aspirations. It is a collaborative effort that aims to empower communities and improve their quality of life. The bargaining table is a crucial platform where community development initiatives are negotiated and implemented.

This chapter will provide an in-depth analysis of the bargaining table and its role in community development. We will explore the various stakeholders involved in the bargaining process, the challenges they face, and the strategies they can use to overcome these challenges. We will also examine the role of local policies in shaping the bargaining table and promoting equity and inclusion.

The bargaining table is a complex and dynamic space where multiple interests and perspectives intersect. It is a place where power dynamics, social norms, and economic factors come into play. By understanding the dynamics of the bargaining table, we can better navigate the challenges of community development and create more equitable and inclusive cities.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the various aspects of the bargaining table, including its history, key players, and strategies for effective bargaining. We will also explore case studies and examples to provide a comprehensive understanding of community development at the bargaining table.

### Subsection: 4.1a Introduction to Community Development

Community development is a process that involves the active participation of community members in identifying and addressing their needs and aspirations. It is a collaborative effort that aims to empower communities and improve their quality of life. The bargaining table is a crucial platform where community development initiatives are negotiated and implemented.

The bargaining table is a complex and dynamic space where multiple interests and perspectives intersect. It is a place where power dynamics, social norms, and economic factors come into play. By understanding the dynamics of the bargaining table, we can better navigate the challenges of community development and create more equitable and inclusive cities.

In this section, we will explore the concept of community development and its role in creating a just city. We will also delve into the various stakeholders involved in the bargaining process and the challenges they face. Additionally, we will examine the role of local policies in shaping the bargaining table and promoting equity and inclusion.

#### The Role of Community Development in Creating a Just City

Community development plays a crucial role in creating a just city. It is a process that aims to empower communities and address their needs and aspirations. By involving community members in the decision-making process, community development promotes equity and inclusion, ensuring that the needs and voices of all members are heard and addressed.

Moreover, community development also helps to create a sense of ownership and responsibility among community members. By actively participating in the decision-making process, community members are more likely to support and take responsibility for the outcomes of the bargaining table. This sense of ownership and responsibility can lead to a more sustainable and equitable community development.

#### The Bargaining Table: A Platform for Community Development

The bargaining table is a crucial platform for community development. It is a space where various stakeholders, including community members, government officials, and private sector representatives, come together to negotiate and implement community development initiatives. The bargaining table is a place where power dynamics, social norms, and economic factors come into play, making it a complex and dynamic space.

However, the bargaining table can also be a challenging space for community development. It is often characterized by unequal power dynamics, where certain stakeholders may have more influence and decision-making power. This can lead to unequal outcomes and hinder the progress of community development.

#### Local Policies and the Bargaining Table

Local policies play a crucial role in shaping the bargaining table and promoting equity and inclusion. They provide a framework for decision-making and guide the actions of stakeholders at the bargaining table. Local policies can also help to address power imbalances and promote more equitable outcomes.

However, local policies can also be a source of challenge for the bargaining table. They may be outdated or inadequate, leading to conflicts and delays in decision-making. Additionally, local policies may not always align with the needs and aspirations of all community members, leading to unequal outcomes.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the various stakeholders involved in the bargaining process and the challenges they face. We will also explore strategies for effective bargaining and how local policies can be used to promote equity and inclusion at the bargaining table.





### Subsection: 4.1b Stakeholder Engagement and Participation

Stakeholder engagement and participation are crucial components of community development at the bargaining table. Stakeholders are individuals or groups who may be affected by the decisions made or have the power to influence their implementation. Engaging stakeholders in the decision-making process is essential for creating a just city and promoting equity and inclusion.

#### The Importance of Stakeholder Engagement and Participation

Stakeholder engagement and participation are crucial for several reasons. First, it allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the issue at hand. By involving stakeholders, all perspectives and concerns can be considered, leading to more informed and effective decisions.

Second, stakeholder engagement and participation promote accountability and transparency. When stakeholders are involved in the decision-making process, they are more likely to support and take responsibility for the outcomes. This can lead to a more sustainable and equitable community development.

Finally, stakeholder engagement and participation can help to build trust and relationships between different groups. By involving stakeholders in the decision-making process, they can gain a better understanding of each other's perspectives and concerns, leading to improved communication and collaboration.

#### Challenges and Solutions for Stakeholder Engagement and Participation

Despite its importance, stakeholder engagement and participation can be challenging. One of the main challenges is identifying and involving all relevant stakeholders. Stakeholders may have different levels of interest and influence, and it can be challenging to determine who should be involved in the decision-making process.

To address this challenge, it is crucial to have a clear and transparent stakeholder engagement process. This can include creating a stakeholder map to identify and prioritize stakeholders, as well as establishing a stakeholder advisory group to provide input and feedback throughout the decision-making process.

Another challenge is ensuring meaningful participation of stakeholders. This means providing opportunities for stakeholders to influence the decision-making process and have their voices heard. This can be achieved through various methods, such as community meetings, surveys, and focus groups.

#### The Role of Local Policies in Stakeholder Engagement and Participation

Local policies play a crucial role in promoting stakeholder engagement and participation. Policies can establish guidelines and requirements for stakeholder engagement, ensuring that all relevant stakeholders are involved in the decision-making process.

Moreover, local policies can also promote equity and inclusion by ensuring that marginalized and underrepresented stakeholders have a voice at the bargaining table. This can be achieved through policies that require diversity and inclusion training for decision-makers and establish mechanisms for marginalized stakeholders to provide input and feedback.

In conclusion, stakeholder engagement and participation are essential for creating a just city and promoting equity and inclusion. By involving stakeholders in the decision-making process, we can create more informed and effective decisions that address the needs and concerns of all community members. Local policies can play a crucial role in promoting stakeholder engagement and participation and ensuring that all voices are heard.





### Subsection: 4.1c Negotiation and Bargaining Strategies

Negotiation and bargaining are essential skills for community development at the bargaining table. These strategies allow for the effective communication of interests and the negotiation of mutually beneficial agreements. In this section, we will explore the different negotiation and bargaining strategies that can be used in community development.

#### The Importance of Negotiation and Bargaining Strategies

Negotiation and bargaining strategies are crucial for several reasons. First, they allow for the effective communication of interests and the negotiation of mutually beneficial agreements. By using these strategies, all parties can work towards a solution that meets their needs and promotes equity and inclusion.

Second, negotiation and bargaining strategies can help to build trust and relationships between different groups. By engaging in constructive dialogue and finding common ground, stakeholders can gain a better understanding of each other's perspectives and concerns, leading to improved communication and collaboration.

Finally, negotiation and bargaining strategies can help to address power imbalances between different stakeholders. By using these strategies, all parties can have a voice and work towards a solution that is fair and equitable for everyone involved.

#### Challenges and Solutions for Negotiation and Bargaining Strategies

Despite their importance, negotiation and bargaining strategies can be challenging to implement. One of the main challenges is finding common ground and reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. This can be especially difficult when there are significant differences in interests and perspectives between stakeholders.

To address this challenge, it is crucial to have a clear and transparent negotiation process. This can include setting ground rules, establishing a neutral third party to facilitate the negotiation, and using active listening and communication techniques to understand each party's interests and concerns.

Another challenge is the potential for power imbalances to hinder the negotiation process. To address this, it is essential to have a level playing field and ensure that all parties have an equal voice. This can be achieved by having a diverse and inclusive negotiation team and using strategies such as power-sharing and interest-based bargaining.

In conclusion, negotiation and bargaining strategies are crucial for community development at the bargaining table. By using these strategies, stakeholders can work towards mutually beneficial agreements that promote equity and inclusion in the community. However, it is essential to address the challenges and have a clear and transparent negotiation process to ensure the success of these strategies.

## Chapter 5: Equity & Inclusion in Economic Development:




### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the concepts of equity and inclusion, and their importance in creating a just city. We have also discussed the role of local policies in promoting equity and inclusion, and how they can be used as tools for economic development. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of equity and inclusion plans, which are crucial for the successful implementation of these policies.

Equity and inclusion plans are strategic documents that outline the steps and actions that a city will take to promote equity and inclusion among its residents. These plans are developed through a collaborative process that involves community members, government officials, and other stakeholders. They are essential for creating a just city, as they provide a roadmap for addressing the systemic barriers and disparities that exist in society.

In this chapter, we will discuss the importance of equity and inclusion plans, their development process, and the key components that should be included in these plans. We will also explore case studies of successful equity and inclusion plans from different cities, highlighting the strategies and approaches that have been effective in promoting equity and inclusion. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the role of equity and inclusion plans in creating a just city and how they can be used to promote economic development.




### Section: 5.1 Equity & Inclusion Plans:

Equity and inclusion plans are crucial for promoting equity and inclusion in a just city. These plans outline the steps and actions that a city will take to address systemic barriers and disparities among its residents. In this section, we will discuss the importance of equity and inclusion plans, their development process, and the key components that should be included in these plans.

#### 5.1a Understanding Equity and Inclusion

Equity and inclusion are closely related concepts that are essential for creating a just city. Equity refers to the fair distribution of resources and opportunities among all members of a community. It recognizes that certain groups, such as marginalized communities, have historically been disadvantaged and seeks to address these disparities. Inclusion, on the other hand, focuses on creating a welcoming and supportive environment for all members of a community. It recognizes that everyone has unique needs and seeks to accommodate these needs to ensure equal participation.

In the context of education, equity and inclusion have been widely discussed and implemented. The United Nations' Target 4 Goals, for example, emphasize the importance of education for all children, regardless of their social or economic background. In the United States, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) have been enacted to ensure equal access to education for all students, including those with disabilities and those from disadvantaged backgrounds.

However, despite these efforts, there are still significant disparities in education outcomes for marginalized communities. For example, students from low-income families and students of color are more likely to attend under-resourced schools and have less access to quality education. This highlights the need for equity and inclusion plans to address these systemic barriers and promote equal opportunities for all students.

#### 5.1b The Development Process of Equity and Inclusion Plans

The development of equity and inclusion plans is a collaborative process that involves community members, government officials, and other stakeholders. It is important for all stakeholders to be involved in the process to ensure that the plan reflects the needs and concerns of the community. The process typically involves the following steps:

1. Identifying the target population: The first step in developing an equity and inclusion plan is to identify the target population. This could include marginalized communities, low-income families, or students with disabilities.

2. Conducting a needs assessment: A needs assessment is a crucial step in understanding the specific needs and concerns of the target population. This could involve surveys, focus groups, and data analysis.

3. Setting goals and objectives: Based on the needs assessment, goals and objectives for the equity and inclusion plan can be set. These should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

4. Developing strategies and actions: The next step is to develop strategies and actions that will help achieve the goals and objectives. These could include policy changes, resource allocation, and community engagement.

5. Implementing and monitoring the plan: Once the plan is developed, it needs to be implemented and monitored to ensure its effectiveness. This could involve regular progress reports, evaluations, and adjustments to the plan as needed.

#### 5.1c Key Components of Equity and Inclusion Plans

Equity and inclusion plans should include the following key components to be effective:

1. A clear definition of equity and inclusion: It is important for the plan to clearly define what equity and inclusion mean in the context of the community. This will help guide the development of goals and strategies.

2. A focus on systemic barriers: Equity and inclusion plans should address systemic barriers that contribute to disparities among different groups. This could include policies, practices, and structures that need to be changed.

3. A commitment to data-driven decision making: Data and evidence are crucial for understanding the needs and concerns of the target population. Equity and inclusion plans should incorporate data analysis and use this information to inform decision making.

4. A focus on community engagement: Equity and inclusion plans should involve community members in the development and implementation process. This will help ensure that the plan reflects the needs and concerns of the community.

5. A commitment to continuous improvement: Equity and inclusion plans should be seen as a living document that is constantly evolving and improving. This will allow for adjustments and updates as needed to address emerging issues and concerns.

In conclusion, equity and inclusion plans are essential for promoting equity and inclusion in a just city. They require a collaborative and data-driven approach to address systemic barriers and disparities among different groups. By including key components such as a clear definition of equity and inclusion, a focus on systemic barriers, and community engagement, these plans can be effective in promoting equal opportunities for all members of a community.

# Debt-to-equity ratio

## Example

General Electric Co # Personal equity plan

A personal equity plan (PEP) was a form of tax-privileged investment account in the United Kingdom, available between 1986 and 1999.

## History

The plans were introduced by Nigel Lawson in the 1986 budget to encourage equity ownership among the wider population. PEPs were allowed to contain collective investments such as unit trusts. The "single company PEP", which was allowed to contain shares of a single company, was introduced in 1992. PEPs were superseded by individual savings accounts in 1999, and remaining accounts were converted to individual savings accounts in 2008.

## Types and privileges

Growth in a PEP was free from capital gains tax within the fund and on encashment. Income was free from income tax. When introduced in 1986, the fund was limited to £2,400 (annual allowance), but later increased to two types of PEP: the "general PEP" with an annual allowance of £6,000 and the "single company PEP" with an annual allowance of £3,000.

Investments in a general PEP were limited to qualifying collective investments. Qualifying investments had at least half of their assets invested in the UK, later extended to the European Union. The qualification rule for existing PEPs was removed in 2001. 

Single company PEPs could be invested in one company only. One way they could be used was to hold windfall shares received by members from mutual bodies when they became listed companies.

## Evolution

Beginning 6 April 1999, the Advanced Corporation Tax relief on share dividends received on a PEP was halved, partially ending their tax-exempt status. From 6 April 2004 all relief on dividends was removed, although no additional tax at the higher rate was due where otherwise it might have been. Gains on capital, and all other forms of income such as cash interest and bond income, remained tax-free. Significant cash holdings for any length of time were discouraged by HM Revenue and Customs; they would be subject to a 20% tax charge.

The PEP was replaced by the Individual Savings Account (ISA) in 1999. The ISA allows for a wider range of investments, including stocks and shares, cash, and even some types of life insurance. The annual allowance for an ISA is currently £20,000, and there is no longer a distinction between general and single company ISAs.

The PEP was a significant step in promoting equity and inclusion in the UK. It allowed individuals to invest in the stock market with tax advantages, encouraging them to become more financially literate and take control of their own financial future. However, the PEP was not without its flaws, and its replacement by the ISA has allowed for a more flexible and inclusive approach to investing.

#### 5.1a Understanding Equity and Inclusion

Equity and inclusion are crucial concepts in creating a just city. Equity refers to the fair distribution of resources and opportunities among all members of a community. It recognizes that certain groups, such as marginalized communities, have historically been disadvantaged and seeks to address these disparities. Inclusion, on the other hand, focuses on creating a welcoming and supportive environment for all members of a community. It recognizes that everyone has unique needs and seeks to accommodate these needs to ensure equal participation.

In the context of education, equity and inclusion have been widely discussed and implemented. The United Nations' Target 4 Goals, for example, emphasize the importance of education for all children, regardless of their social or economic background. In the United States, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) have been enacted to ensure equal access to education for all students, including those with disabilities and those from disadvantaged backgrounds.

However, despite these efforts, there are still significant disparities in education outcomes for marginalized communities. For example, students from low-income families and students of color are more likely to attend under-resourced schools and have less access to quality education. This highlights the need for equity and inclusion plans to address these systemic barriers and promote equal opportunities for all students.

#### 5.1b Developing and Implementing Equity Plans

Equity plans are essential tools for promoting equity and inclusion in a just city. These plans outline the steps and actions that a city will take to address systemic barriers and disparities among its residents. They are developed through a collaborative process that involves community members, government officials, and other stakeholders.

The first step in developing an equity plan is to identify the target population. This could include marginalized communities, such as low-income families, students of color, or individuals with disabilities. Once the target population is identified, the next step is to conduct a needs assessment to understand the specific barriers and disparities faced by this group.

The needs assessment should involve community members from the target population to ensure that their voices are heard and their needs are addressed. It should also consider data and research to provide a comprehensive understanding of the issues at hand.

Once the needs assessment is complete, the next step is to develop strategies and actions to address the identified barriers and disparities. This could include policies, programs, and initiatives that promote equity and inclusion. For example, a city could implement a policy to provide free or reduced-cost education for low-income students, or create a program to support students with disabilities in their academic and social development.

The final step in developing an equity plan is to implement and monitor its progress. This involves allocating resources and assigning responsibilities to ensure that the plan is carried out effectively. It also involves regularly evaluating the plan's impact and making adjustments as needed.

In conclusion, equity and inclusion plans are crucial for promoting equity and inclusion in a just city. They are developed through a collaborative process and involve identifying the target population, conducting a needs assessment, developing strategies and actions, and implementing and monitoring progress. By addressing systemic barriers and disparities, these plans can create a more equitable and inclusive society for all residents.


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the importance of equity and inclusion plans in promoting economic development and creating a just city. We have discussed the various components of these plans, including identifying target populations, setting goals and objectives, and implementing strategies to address systemic barriers. We have also examined the role of local policies in supporting and enforcing these plans.

Equity and inclusion plans are crucial for creating a more equitable and inclusive society, where all members have equal access to opportunities and resources. By addressing the needs and concerns of marginalized communities, these plans can help reduce disparities and promote economic growth. Additionally, by involving community members in the planning process, these plans can foster a sense of ownership and empowerment, leading to more sustainable and effective solutions.

As we have seen, equity and inclusion plans are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Each city and community has its own unique challenges and needs, and therefore, these plans must be tailored to address the specific issues at hand. By continuously evaluating and adjusting these plans, we can ensure that they remain relevant and effective in promoting equity and inclusion.

# Title: Equity & Inclusion: Local Policy-Driven Strategies for Economic Development & the Just City":

## Chapter 6: Equity & Inclusion in Education:




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the complex and often contentious topic of race and gender-based approaches to equity. As we have seen in previous chapters, equity and inclusion are crucial components of a just city and economic development. However, the intersection of race and gender adds a layer of complexity to these discussions, as these factors have historically been used to marginalize and exclude certain groups from full participation in society.

We will explore the historical context of race and gender-based discrimination and how it has shaped our current understanding of equity. We will also examine the role of policy in addressing these issues, and how local policies can be used to promote equity and inclusion for all members of the community.

This chapter will also discuss the importance of intersectionality in understanding and addressing race and gender-based approaches to equity. Intersectionality recognizes that individuals may face multiple forms of discrimination based on their intersecting identities, and that addressing one form of discrimination may not fully address all forms.

Finally, we will explore case studies and examples of successful race and gender-based equity initiatives, highlighting the importance of local policy and community involvement in promoting equity and inclusion. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a deeper understanding of the complexities of race and gender-based approaches to equity and the role of local policy in promoting a just city and economic development.




### Subsection: 6.1a Intersectionality and Equity

Intersectionality is a concept that has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in the fields of race and gender studies. It is a framework that recognizes the complex and interconnected nature of social identities and the ways in which they intersect to create unique experiences of discrimination and marginalization. In this subsection, we will explore the concept of intersectionality and its relevance to equity and inclusion.

#### The Concept of Intersectionality

Intersectionality is a term coined by legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw in the 1980s to describe the ways in which different forms of discrimination intersect and compound each other. It recognizes that individuals may face multiple forms of discrimination based on their intersecting identities, such as race, gender, and social class. This concept challenges the idea that discrimination can be addressed by focusing on one form of identity at a time, and instead emphasizes the need to address the interconnectedness of these identities.

#### Intersectionality and Equity

Intersectionality plays a crucial role in understanding and addressing equity issues. As mentioned in the previous chapter, equity is about ensuring fairness and equal opportunities for all members of a community. However, the concept of equity is often limited to addressing one form of discrimination at a time, such as race or gender. This approach fails to recognize the ways in which these forms of discrimination intersect and compound each other, leading to a more complex and pervasive issue of equity.

Intersectionality allows us to see the ways in which race and gender intersect to create unique experiences of discrimination and marginalization. For example, a black woman may face discrimination and marginalization based on her race and gender, which may be compounded by her social class. This intersectionality of identities can have a significant impact on her opportunities and experiences in society.

#### Intersectionality and Policy

Policy plays a crucial role in addressing equity issues, and intersectionality must be considered in policy-making. Policies that focus on one form of discrimination at a time may fail to address the interconnectedness of different forms of discrimination. This can lead to ineffective or even harmful policies that do not adequately address the needs and experiences of individuals who face multiple forms of discrimination.

In order to create policies that are inclusive and equitable, it is essential to consider the intersectionality of different forms of discrimination. This requires a deep understanding of the ways in which these identities intersect and compound each other, as well as a commitment to addressing these issues in a comprehensive and holistic manner.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, intersectionality is a crucial concept in understanding and addressing equity issues. It recognizes the complex and interconnected nature of social identities and the ways in which they intersect to create unique experiences of discrimination and marginalization. In order to create policies that are inclusive and equitable, it is essential to consider the intersectionality of different forms of discrimination and address them in a comprehensive and holistic manner. 





### Subsection: 6.1b Racial and Gender Disparities

Racial and gender disparities are a significant aspect of equity and inclusion, as they have a profound impact on the lives of individuals and communities. These disparities are often interconnected, with race and gender intersecting to create unique experiences of discrimination and marginalization. In this subsection, we will explore the concept of racial and gender disparities and their implications for equity and inclusion.

#### The Concept of Racial and Gender Disparities

Racial and gender disparities refer to the unequal treatment and outcomes experienced by individuals based on their race and gender. These disparities can manifest in various aspects of life, including education, employment, healthcare, and criminal justice. For instance, studies have shown that black and Hispanic students are more likely to be suspended or expelled from school than their white peers, and that women are underrepresented in leadership positions in many industries (Crenshaw, 1989).

#### The Intersection of Race and Gender

The intersection of race and gender can exacerbate these disparities. For example, black women are particularly underrepresented in the field of computing. A 2021 study found that only 5% of computer science majors in the United States are Asian women, 2% are Latina women, and 2% are Black women. This underrepresentation is even more pronounced in the technology industry, where black women are less likely to be promoted to executive positions compared to white women (Crenshaw, 1989).

#### Addressing Racial and Gender Disparities

Addressing racial and gender disparities requires a comprehensive approach that recognizes the interconnectedness of these disparities. This includes policies and initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion, as well as efforts to address systemic racism and sexism. For instance, community colleges have been found to play a key role in incorporating more women into STEM majors, due to their accessibility and opportunities for upward transfer into higher education and the workforce.

In conclusion, racial and gender disparities are a significant aspect of equity and inclusion, and addressing them requires a nuanced understanding of the interconnectedness of race and gender. By promoting diversity and inclusion, and addressing systemic racism and sexism, we can work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society for all.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the complex and multifaceted nature of race and gender-based approaches to equity. We have delved into the historical, social, and economic factors that contribute to the disparities faced by marginalized communities, particularly those based on race and gender. We have also examined the role of policy in addressing these disparities, and the importance of local, community-driven strategies in promoting equity and inclusion.

We have seen how race and gender-based approaches to equity are not just about addressing individual experiences, but also about challenging systemic and institutionalized discrimination. We have also discussed the importance of intersectionality in understanding and addressing these issues, as race and gender are not isolated factors but intersect in complex ways to shape individuals' experiences.

Finally, we have highlighted the importance of local policy-driven strategies in promoting equity and inclusion. These strategies, when implemented effectively, can have a significant impact on the lives of marginalized communities, and contribute to the creation of more just and inclusive cities.

In essence, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of disability and age approaches to equity, and to equip readers with the knowledge and tools to promote equity for individuals with disabilities and the elderly in their local communities.




### Subsection: 6.1c Strategies for Addressing Race and Gender Inequities

Addressing race and gender inequities requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of these disparities. In this subsection, we will explore some strategies that can be used to address these inequities.

#### Policy Interventions

Policy interventions can play a crucial role in addressing race and gender inequities. For instance, policies can be implemented to promote diversity and inclusion in various sectors, such as education, employment, and healthcare. These policies can include affirmative action programs, which aim to increase the representation of underrepresented groups in these sectors (Crenshaw, 1989).

#### Education and Awareness

Education and awareness are also key strategies for addressing race and gender inequities. By educating individuals about the history and impact of racism and sexism, we can increase their understanding of these issues and promote more inclusive behaviors. Awareness campaigns can also be used to raise awareness about these issues and promote a sense of responsibility among individuals to address these inequities (Crenshaw, 1989).

#### Intersectional Approaches

Given the interconnectedness of race and gender, intersectional approaches are often necessary to address race and gender inequities. These approaches recognize that individuals can experience multiple forms of discrimination based on their intersecting identities, and aim to address these inequities in a holistic manner (Crenshaw, 1989).

#### Addressing Systemic Inequities

Finally, addressing systemic inequities is crucial for addressing race and gender inequities. This can involve addressing structural barriers that limit the opportunities available to certain groups, as well as promoting policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion (Crenshaw, 1989).

In conclusion, addressing race and gender inequities requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of these disparities. By implementing policy interventions, promoting education and awareness, using intersectional approaches, and addressing systemic inequities, we can work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society for all individuals.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the complex and multifaceted issues of race and gender in the context of equity and inclusion. We have explored how these factors can influence economic development and the creation of just cities. We have also examined various strategies and policies that can be implemented to address these issues and promote equity and inclusion.

We have seen that race and gender are not just social constructs, but they have a profound impact on the lives of individuals and communities. They can shape opportunities, limit possibilities, and create barriers to economic development and the creation of just cities. However, we have also learned that these issues can be addressed through policy-driven strategies that promote equity and inclusion.

## Chapter 7: Equity & Inclusion in Economic Development:




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the intersection of environmental justice and equity planning in the context of local policy-driven strategies for economic development and the just city. Environmental justice is a concept that has gained significant attention in recent years, as it addresses the unequal distribution of environmental benefits and burdens among different communities. Equity planning, on the other hand, is a process that aims to ensure fair and just distribution of resources and opportunities among all members of a community.

The combination of these two concepts is crucial in creating a just and sustainable city. As we have seen in previous chapters, economic development is a key factor in creating a thriving city. However, it is important to consider the impact of economic development on the environment and the different communities within the city. This is where environmental justice and equity planning come into play.

In this chapter, we will delve into the various aspects of environmental justice and equity planning, including the history and evolution of these concepts, their importance in creating a just city, and the challenges and opportunities they present. We will also explore the role of local policies and strategies in addressing environmental justice and equity issues, and how they can be used to promote sustainable and equitable economic development.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of environmental justice and equity planning, and their crucial role in creating a just and sustainable city. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the complexities of these concepts and their importance in creating a thriving and equitable city.

# Environmental planning

## Environmental Justice

Environmental justice is the equitable inclusion and treatment of all human beings in all aspects of environmental planning, as well as in the enforcement of environmental legislation. It is increasingly recognized as a key part of environmental planning. Environmental justice issues are usually fought within communities to establish environmentally-friendly and accessible neighborhoods and living conditions, and to improve the local ecology. The Environmental Protection Agency has declared it essential that residents should play an active role in the reshaping of their neighborhoods.  Many levels of government and international organizations agree on the need for equitable and sustainable housing and transportation, as core characteristics of environmental justice; these are considered today a part of the battle against the climate crisis. Environmental activists act as watchdogs on government support for the battles of underrepresented communities against environmental hazards that threaten their health or way of life.

### United States

In the United States of America, there have been numerous examples of the state provisioning of environmental justice in multiple communities. Listed are some of such projects:

 # Environmental justice

### Europe

The European Environment Agency (EEA) reports that exposure to environmental harms such as pollution is correlated with poverty, and that poorer countries suffer from environmental harms while higher income countries produce the majority of the pollution. Western Europe has more extensive evidence of environmental inequality.

Romani peoples are ethnic minorities that experience environmental discrimination. Discriminatory laws force Romani people In many countries to live in slums or ghettos with poor access to running water and sewage, or where they are exposed to hazardous wastes.

The European Union is trying to strive towards environmental justice by putting into action the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which includes the right to a high level of environmental protection and the right to access to information on the environment. The EU also has the Environmental Liability Directive, which aims to ensure that those responsible for environmental damage are held accountable. Additionally, the EU has the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, which requires environmental assessments for certain projects that may have significant environmental impacts.

### Conclusion

Environmental justice is a crucial aspect of environmental planning and is essential for creating a just and sustainable city. It is important for local policies and strategies to address environmental justice issues and promote equitable and sustainable development. The United States and the European Union have made efforts towards environmental justice, but there is still much work to be done. As we continue to face environmental challenges, it is crucial that we prioritize environmental justice and ensure that all communities have equal access to a clean and healthy environment.


# Title: Equity & Inclusion: Local Policy-Driven Strategies for Economic Development & the Just City":

## Chapter: - Chapter 7: Environmental Justice & Equity Planning:




### Section: 7.1 Environmental Justice & Equity Planning:

Environmental justice and equity planning are crucial components of creating a just and sustainable city. As discussed in the previous section, environmental racism and disparities in access to clean air and water have been well-documented in the United States. These injustices have significant impacts on the health and well-being of communities, particularly those that are already marginalized and disadvantaged.

#### 7.1a The Role of Environmental Justice and Equity Planning in Local Policy

Local policy plays a critical role in addressing environmental justice and equity issues. It is at the local level that policies can be tailored to the specific needs and characteristics of a community. This allows for a more targeted and effective approach to addressing environmental inequalities and disparities.

One of the key ways in which local policy can address environmental justice and equity is through the implementation of environmental impact assessments (EIAs). EIAs are a tool used to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of a proposed project or policy. They can help identify potential environmental hazards and inform decision-making processes to mitigate these impacts. By incorporating EIAs into local policy, communities can ensure that new developments and policies do not exacerbate existing environmental inequalities.

Another important aspect of local policy is the consideration of environmental justice in decision-making processes. This can be achieved through the inclusion of environmental justice impact assessments (EJIAs) in policy development. EJIAs are a more comprehensive version of EIAs that specifically focus on the potential environmental justice impacts of a proposed project or policy. By conducting EJIAs, communities can ensure that the potential impacts on marginalized and disadvantaged communities are carefully considered and addressed.

In addition to these tools, local policy can also incorporate principles of environmental justice and equity into its overall framework. This can include policies that prioritize the protection and improvement of environmental quality in disadvantaged communities, as well as policies that promote equitable access to environmental benefits such as parks and green spaces. By incorporating these principles into local policy, communities can work towards creating a more just and sustainable future for all residents.

#### 7.1b Environmental Inequalities and Disparities

Environmental inequalities and disparities refer to the uneven distribution of environmental hazards and benefits among different communities. These inequalities are often linked to social, economic, and racial disparities, as marginalized and disadvantaged communities are disproportionately affected by environmental hazards and lack access to environmental benefits.

One of the most significant environmental inequalities in the United States is the issue of environmental racism. As discussed in the previous section, communities of color are more likely to be located next to pollution sources and have poor access to clean air and water. This not only has negative impacts on their physical health, but also on their mental health and overall well-being.

In addition to physical health impacts, environmental inequalities can also have economic consequences. Empirical evidence suggests that environmental hazards negatively affect nearby property values, employment opportunities, and economic activities. This can further exacerbate existing economic disparities and create barriers to upward mobility for marginalized communities.

Furthermore, environmental inequalities can also have psychological impacts. Exposure to environmental hazards can cause psychological stress, which can have long-term effects on mental health and well-being. This is particularly concerning for marginalized communities that may already face significant social and economic stressors.

#### 7.1c Case Studies of Environmental Justice and Equity Planning in Local Communities

To further illustrate the importance and effectiveness of environmental justice and equity planning in local communities, let us examine two case studies: the City of Portland, Oregon and the City of Richmond, California.

The City of Portland, Oregon has been a leader in implementing environmental justice policies and initiatives. In 1991, the city passed a resolution declaring its commitment to environmental justice and equity. This was followed by the creation of the Environmental Justice and Equity Program in 1993, which aims to address environmental inequalities and disparities in the city. One of the key strategies used by the city is the incorporation of EJIAs into policy development, which helps to ensure that the potential impacts on marginalized communities are carefully considered and addressed.

The City of Richmond, California has also made significant strides in addressing environmental justice and equity issues. In 2010, the city passed the Green Jobs and Green Business Ordinance, which aims to create green jobs and promote sustainable businesses in the city. This ordinance also includes provisions for environmental justice, such as prioritizing the hiring of local residents and providing job training opportunities for disadvantaged communities. Additionally, the city has implemented a community-based participatory research approach to address environmental inequalities and disparities, which involves collaboration between community members, researchers, and policymakers.

These case studies demonstrate the importance of local policy in addressing environmental justice and equity issues. By incorporating tools such as EIAs and EJIAs, and prioritizing environmental justice in decision-making processes, communities can work towards creating a more just and sustainable future for all residents.

#### 7.1c Planning for Environmental Justice and Equity

Planning for environmental justice and equity is a crucial aspect of local policy-making. It involves considering the potential environmental impacts of proposed projects and policies on marginalized and disadvantaged communities. This can be achieved through the use of environmental justice impact assessments (EJIAs) and environmental impact assessments (EIAs).

EJIAs are a more comprehensive version of EIAs that specifically focus on the potential environmental justice impacts of a proposed project or policy. They take into account the potential impacts on marginalized and disadvantaged communities, and provide recommendations for mitigating any potential negative impacts. By conducting EJIAs, communities can ensure that the potential impacts on marginalized and disadvantaged communities are carefully considered and addressed.

In addition to EJIAs, local policy can also incorporate equitable and sustainable housing and transportation policies. These policies can help address the unequal distribution of environmental hazards and benefits, and promote healthier and more livable communities for all residents. By considering the potential environmental impacts of proposed projects and policies on marginalized and disadvantaged communities, local policy can work towards creating a more just and sustainable city for all.





### Conclusion

# Title: Equity & Inclusion: Local Policy-Driven Strategies for Economic Development & the Just City":

## Chapter 9: Equity & Inclusion in Economic Development:




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the intersection of arts planning and economic development, and how it contributes to creating a just city. The arts have long been recognized as a powerful tool for community building and revitalization, and their potential for economic development is immense. However, the relationship between the arts and economic development is complex and multifaceted, and requires careful planning and policy-making to fully realize its potential.

We will begin by examining the role of arts planning in creating a just city. A just city is one that is equitable and inclusive, where all members of the community have equal access to opportunities and resources. The arts have the potential to play a crucial role in promoting equity and inclusion, by providing a platform for marginalized voices and communities to express themselves and be heard. We will explore how arts planning can be used to create a more just city, and the challenges and opportunities that come with this process.

Next, we will delve into the economic benefits of the arts. The arts have been shown to have a significant impact on local economies, through job creation, increased property values, and attracting tourists and businesses. We will examine the various ways in which the arts contribute to economic development, and how arts planning can be used to maximize these benefits.

Finally, we will discuss the role of policy in promoting arts planning and economic development. Local policies and regulations can have a profound impact on the arts community, and can either hinder or facilitate their ability to contribute to economic development. We will explore the different types of policies that can be implemented to support the arts, and the potential benefits and drawbacks of each.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the role of arts planning in economic development and creating a just city. They will also have the tools and knowledge to implement effective arts policies and plans in their own communities. 





### Subsection: 9.1a The Role of the Arts in Urban Development

The arts play a crucial role in urban development, serving as a catalyst for economic growth and community revitalization. In this section, we will explore the various ways in which the arts contribute to urban development, and how arts planning can be used to maximize these benefits.

#### The Economic Impact of the Arts

The arts have a significant impact on local economies, contributing to job creation, increased property values, and attracting tourists and businesses. According to the National Endowment for the Arts, the arts industry generates over $700 billion in economic activity each year, supporting over 4.8 million jobs. This economic impact is particularly pronounced in urban areas, where the concentration of arts and cultural institutions can attract a diverse range of businesses and industries.

Arts planning plays a crucial role in harnessing the economic potential of the arts. By strategically locating and designing arts facilities, such as galleries, theaters, and public art spaces, cities can create vibrant cultural hubs that attract visitors and stimulate economic activity. Additionally, arts planning can also involve policies and programs that support the growth of the arts industry, such as tax incentives for artists and cultural institutions, and grants for arts education and community engagement.

#### The Role of the Arts in Creating a Just City

The arts also play a crucial role in creating a just city, where all members of the community have equal access to opportunities and resources. By providing a platform for marginalized voices and communities to express themselves and be heard, the arts can promote equity and inclusion. This is particularly important in urban areas, where diverse communities often coexist.

Arts planning can be used to ensure that the arts are accessible to all members of the community. This can involve creating affordable housing for artists, providing arts education in underserved schools, and designing public art spaces that reflect the diversity of the community. Additionally, arts planning can also involve policies and programs that support the representation of diverse voices in the arts, such as diversity training for arts organizations and grants for underrepresented artists.

#### The Challenges and Opportunities of Arts Planning

While the arts have the potential to contribute significantly to urban development, there are also challenges that must be addressed in the planning process. These include issues of gentrification, where the influx of arts and cultural institutions can lead to the displacement of low-income residents. Additionally, there may be concerns about the allocation of resources, as the arts often compete with other priorities for funding and attention.

However, there are also opportunities for creative solutions in arts planning. For example, cities can implement policies that require affordable housing for artists in new developments, or create public art spaces that are accessible to all members of the community. Additionally, there are also opportunities for collaboration between the arts and other sectors, such as education and healthcare, to address broader social and economic issues.

In conclusion, the arts play a crucial role in urban development, contributing to economic growth and community revitalization. Arts planning is a powerful tool for harnessing the potential of the arts, and can be used to create a more just and equitable city for all members of the community. By addressing the challenges and seizing the opportunities in arts planning, cities can create vibrant and thriving urban environments that are enriched by the arts.





### Subsection: 9.1b Cultural Districts and Creative Placemaking

Cultural districts and creative placemaking are two key strategies in arts planning that can significantly contribute to economic development and the creation of a just city. These strategies involve the intentional integration of arts and culture into urban planning and development, with the goal of creating vibrant, inclusive, and economically thriving communities.

#### Cultural Districts

Cultural districts are designated areas within a city that are known for their concentration of arts and cultural institutions. These districts can range from a few blocks to several square miles, and they often include a mix of galleries, theaters, museums, and public art spaces. The concept of cultural districts is rooted in the idea that the arts can serve as a catalyst for economic development and community revitalization.

By creating cultural districts, cities can attract a diverse range of businesses and industries, stimulate economic activity, and create jobs. For example, the SoHo district in New York City, known for its concentration of art galleries and design showrooms, has been instrumental in driving economic growth in the city. According to a study by the New York City Department of City Planning, SoHo has generated over $1 billion in annual retail sales and attracted over 100,000 visitors each year.

Moreover, cultural districts can also serve as platforms for marginalized voices and communities to express themselves and be heard. By providing a space for diverse cultural expressions, these districts can promote equity and inclusion, and contribute to the creation of a just city.

#### Creative Placemaking

Creative placemaking is a process that uses arts and culture to shape the character of a place and guide its development. This process involves engaging the community in the creation of public art, design, and cultural events that reflect the identity and values of the community. By involving the community in the creative process, creative placemaking can foster a sense of ownership and pride, and create a sense of place that is unique and meaningful.

Creative placemaking can also contribute to economic development. By transforming ordinary spaces into vibrant, culturally rich environments, creative placemaking can attract visitors, stimulate economic activity, and create jobs. For example, the High Line in New York City, a 1.45-mile-long elevated linear park built on a former railroad track, has become a popular tourist attraction and has stimulated economic development in the surrounding neighborhood.

In conclusion, cultural districts and creative placemaking are powerful strategies in arts planning that can significantly contribute to economic development and the creation of a just city. By integrating arts and culture into urban planning and development, cities can create vibrant, inclusive, and economically thriving communities.





### Subsection: 9.1c Economic Impacts of Arts Planning

The economic impacts of arts planning are multifaceted and far-reaching. As discussed in the previous section, cultural districts and creative placemaking can stimulate economic growth and development. However, the economic impacts of arts planning go beyond these direct effects.

#### Indirect and Induced Impacts

The economic impacts of arts planning can be categorized into direct, indirect, and induced impacts. Direct impacts are the immediate effects of arts planning, such as the creation of jobs in the arts sector or the increase in property values due to the presence of cultural institutions. Indirect impacts are the secondary effects of these direct impacts. For example, the jobs created in the arts sector can lead to increased spending on goods and services, which in turn creates additional jobs in other sectors of the economy. This is known as the multiplier effect. Induced impacts are the tertiary effects of these indirect impacts. For instance, the additional jobs created by the multiplier effect can lead to increased demand for housing, which can stimulate further economic development.

#### Economic Development Strategies

Arts planning can also serve as a strategic tool for economic development. By leveraging the economic impacts of arts planning, cities can attract businesses and industries, create jobs, and stimulate economic growth. For example, cities can use arts planning to create cultural districts that attract a diverse range of businesses and industries, as discussed in the previous section. Additionally, cities can use arts planning to create public art and cultural events that attract tourists and visitors, thereby generating revenue and creating jobs in the tourism sector.

#### Equity and Inclusion

Arts planning can also contribute to equity and inclusion in the city. By providing a platform for marginalized voices and communities to express themselves and be heard, arts planning can promote social equity. Moreover, by creating economic opportunities in the arts sector, arts planning can provide a pathway to economic inclusion for marginalized communities.

In conclusion, the economic impacts of arts planning are significant and multifaceted. By leveraging these impacts, cities can create vibrant, inclusive, and economically thriving communities.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the complex relationship between commercial development and commercial values in the neighborhood. Commercial development is a crucial aspect of economic development and plays a significant role in shaping the character and dynamics of a neighborhood. It is the driving force behind job creation, economic growth, and the provision of essential services and amenities. However, commercial development can also bring about challenges, such as gentrification and displacement, which can have a significant impact on the equity and inclusion of a neighborhood.

We will delve into the various factors that influence commercial development, including market demand, government policies, and community involvement. We will also examine the role of commercial values in shaping the direction of commercial development. Commercial values refer to the principles and beliefs that guide decision-making in the commercial sector, such as profit maximization, consumer satisfaction, and social responsibility.

Furthermore, we will explore the concept of the just city and how it relates to commercial development. The just city is a concept that aims to create a fair and equitable society where all members have equal access to opportunities and resources. We will discuss how commercial development can contribute to the creation of a just city, as well as the potential challenges and trade-offs that may arise.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex and multifaceted relationship between commercial development and commercial values in the neighborhood. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the role of commercial development in shaping the economic, social, and cultural fabric of a neighborhood, and the importance of considering commercial values in creating a just city. 





#### 10.1a Neighborhood Commercial Development

Commercial development plays a crucial role in shaping the economic landscape of a neighborhood. It is the driving force behind job creation, economic growth, and the provision of essential services and amenities. However, commercial development can also bring about challenges, such as gentrification and displacement, which can have a significant impact on the equity and inclusion of a neighborhood.

In this section, we will explore the various factors that influence commercial development in a neighborhood. These factors include market demand, government policies, and community involvement. Market demand refers to the needs and preferences of consumers, which can drive the location and type of commercial development in a neighborhood. Government policies, such as zoning regulations and tax incentives, can also influence commercial development by creating incentives for certain types of development or restricting others. Community involvement, through processes such as community planning and engagement, can also play a significant role in shaping commercial development in a neighborhood.

Commercial values also play a crucial role in shaping the direction of commercial development. Commercial values refer to the principles and beliefs that guide decision-making in the commercial sector, such as profit maximization, consumer satisfaction, and social responsibility. These values can influence the types of businesses that are attracted to a neighborhood, as well as the practices and behaviors of those businesses.

Furthermore, we will explore the concept of the just city and how it relates to commercial development. The just city is a concept that aims to create a fair and equitable society where all members have equal access to opportunities and resources. Commercial development can contribute to the creation of a just city by providing essential services and amenities, creating job opportunities, and promoting economic growth. However, it can also perpetuate inequalities if not managed carefully.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the relationship between commercial development and commercial values, and how they can work together to create a more equitable and inclusive neighborhood.





#### 10.1b Factors Influencing Commercial Values

Commercial values are shaped by a variety of factors, including market trends, consumer preferences, and societal norms. These factors can influence the types of businesses that are successful in a neighborhood, as well as the practices and behaviors of those businesses.

Market trends refer to the overall direction of the economy and consumer spending. These trends can impact the types of businesses that are able to thrive in a neighborhood. For example, if there is a growing trend towards online shopping, this may lead to a decline in traditional brick-and-mortar retailers in a neighborhood.

Consumer preferences also play a significant role in shaping commercial values. As consumers, we have the power to influence the types of businesses that are successful by choosing to support certain types of businesses over others. For example, if consumers prioritize sustainability, this may lead to an increase in the number of environmentally-friendly businesses in a neighborhood.

Societal norms also play a role in shaping commercial values. These norms can influence the types of behaviors and practices that are considered acceptable or unacceptable in the commercial sector. For example, in recent years, there has been a growing societal emphasis on diversity and inclusion, which has led to an increase in the number of businesses implementing diversity and inclusion initiatives.

In addition to these external factors, internal factors also play a role in shaping commercial values. These internal factors include the values and beliefs of the individuals within a business, as well as the culture and mission of the business. These internal factors can influence the decisions and actions of a business, and can have a significant impact on the overall commercial landscape of a neighborhood.

In conclusion, commercial values are shaped by a complex interplay of external and internal factors. As these values continue to evolve, it is important for businesses and policymakers to consider the potential impact on the neighborhood and the community as a whole. By understanding and addressing these factors, we can work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive commercial landscape in our neighborhoods.





#### 10.1c Strategies for Promoting Commercial Development

Promoting commercial development in a neighborhood requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses both external and internal factors. By leveraging local policy and community engagement, neighborhoods can create a supportive environment for commercial development that aligns with their values and goals.

##### Local Policy

Local policy plays a crucial role in promoting commercial development. Policies such as tax incentives, zoning regulations, and public funding can provide financial support for businesses, making it easier for them to establish and grow in a neighborhood. These policies can also create a more favorable business climate by reducing barriers to entry and promoting a sense of stability and predictability for businesses.

For example, tax incentives can be used to attract businesses to a neighborhood by reducing their tax burden. This can be particularly beneficial for small businesses and startups, which often have limited resources. Zoning regulations can also play a role in promoting commercial development by designating certain areas as commercial zones, making it easier for businesses to obtain permits and licenses. Public funding can be used to support infrastructure improvements, such as road and utility upgrades, which can make a neighborhood more attractive to businesses.

##### Community Engagement

In addition to local policy, community engagement is also crucial for promoting commercial development. By involving the community in the planning and decision-making process, neighborhoods can ensure that commercial development aligns with their values and goals. This can help to create a sense of ownership and pride in the neighborhood, which can be beneficial for both businesses and residents.

Community engagement can take many forms, including public meetings, surveys, and focus groups. These methods can help to gather input and feedback from residents, business owners, and other stakeholders, which can then be used to inform policy decisions and guide commercial development.

##### Aligning Commercial Values with Community Values

Finally, promoting commercial development also involves aligning commercial values with community values. As discussed in the previous section, commercial values are shaped by a variety of factors, including market trends, consumer preferences, and societal norms. By understanding and addressing these factors, neighborhoods can create a commercial landscape that reflects their values and goals.

For example, if a neighborhood values sustainability, it may choose to prioritize the development of green businesses and implement policies that encourage sustainable practices. Similarly, if a neighborhood values diversity and inclusion, it may choose to support businesses that promote these values and implement policies that promote diversity and inclusion in the commercial sector.

In conclusion, promoting commercial development in a neighborhood requires a comprehensive approach that addresses both external and internal factors. By leveraging local policy, community engagement, and alignment of commercial values with community values, neighborhoods can create a supportive environment for commercial development that benefits both businesses and residents.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the complex relationship between commercial development and commercial values in the neighborhood. We have seen how commercial development can have both positive and negative impacts on a neighborhood, and how these impacts can be influenced by the commercial values held by the community. 

We have also discussed the importance of local policy in guiding commercial development and ensuring that it aligns with the values and goals of the community. By implementing policies that promote responsible commercial development, neighborhoods can create a more equitable and inclusive environment for all residents. 

Finally, we have examined the role of community engagement in shaping commercial values and influencing commercial development. By involving community members in the decision-making process, neighborhoods can ensure that commercial development is responsive to the needs and desires of the community. 

In conclusion, commercial development and commercial values are integral components of the neighborhood. By understanding and managing these components, neighborhoods can create a more just and prosperous environment for all.

Social enterprises have emerged as a powerful tool for economic development, particularly in the context of developing countries. These enterprises, which prioritize social and environmental impact over profit, have the potential to address issues of equity and inclusion by creating jobs and opportunities for marginalized communities. In this section, we will explore the role of social enterprises in economic development, with a focus on their impact in developing countries.

#### 11.1b Social Enterprises and Equity

Social enterprises have the potential to address issues of equity by providing opportunities for marginalized communities. In developing countries, where traditional economic systems may not adequately serve these communities, social enterprises can provide a viable alternative. By prioritizing social and environmental impact, these enterprises can create jobs and opportunities that were previously unavailable to these communities. This not only improves their economic well-being, but also their social and environmental well-being.

#### 11.1c Social Enterprises and Inclusion

In addition to addressing issues of equity, social enterprises also promote inclusion by providing opportunities for marginalized communities to participate in the economic system. In developing countries, where traditional economic systems may exclude these communities, social enterprises can provide a platform for their inclusion. By involving these communities in the operation of the enterprise, social enterprises can empower them and give them a voice in the economic system.

#### 11.1d Social Enterprises and Sustainability

Social enterprises are also leaders in sustainability. They are often at the forefront of innovative solutions to environmental and social problems. For example, in the context of developing countries, social enterprises have been instrumental in addressing issues of waste management and energy efficiency. By prioritizing sustainability, these enterprises not only contribute to the well-being of their communities, but also set an example for other businesses to follow.

#### 11.1e Social Enterprises and the Just City

The concept of the "just city" is a key aspect of social enterprise. A just city is one where all members of the community have equal access to opportunities and resources, and where the needs of the community are met in a sustainable and equitable manner. Social enterprises play a crucial role in creating a just city by promoting equity, inclusion, and sustainability. By prioritizing these values, social enterprises can contribute to the creation of a more equitable and inclusive society.

#### 11.1f Social Enterprises and the Sustainable Development Goals

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a framework for addressing global challenges such as poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation. Social enterprises, with their focus on social and environmental impact, are well-positioned to contribute to the achievement of these goals. In fact, many social enterprises have already incorporated the SDGs into their mission and operations. By promoting sustainable development, social enterprises can help create a better future for all.

#### 11.1g Conclusion

In conclusion, social enterprises play a crucial role in economic development, particularly in developing countries. By prioritizing social and environmental impact, these enterprises can address issues of equity and inclusion, promote sustainability, and contribute to the creation of a just city. Furthermore, by aligning their operations with the SDGs, social enterprises can help drive global efforts towards a more sustainable and equitable future.

#### 11.1h Case Studies of Successful Social Enterprises

To further illustrate the impact of social enterprises, let's examine two successful case studies: Grameen Bank and the Jaipur Rugs Company.

##### Grameen Bank

Grameen Bank, founded by Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, is a social enterprise that provides microcredit loans to impoverished individuals in Bangladesh. The bank's mission is to alleviate poverty by providing small loans to those who are traditionally excluded from the banking system. These loans are used to start small businesses, creating jobs and opportunities for these individuals. Grameen Bank has been instrumental in lifting millions of people out of poverty in Bangladesh, and has served as a model for other microcredit initiatives around the world.

##### Jaipur Rugs Company

The Jaipur Rugs Company is a social enterprise that produces hand-knotted rugs in India. The company employs over 40,000 rural artisans, providing them with a stable income and opportunities for skill development. The company also invests in the education of the artisans' children, promoting intergenerational change. The Jaipur Rugs Company has not only created jobs and opportunities for these artisans, but has also revived the traditional art of hand-knotting rugs.

These case studies demonstrate the transformative potential of social enterprises. By prioritizing social and environmental impact, these enterprises have been able to address issues of equity and inclusion, promote sustainability, and contribute to the creation of a just city. They serve as examples for other social enterprises to follow, and highlight the potential for social enterprises to drive economic development in developing countries.

### Conclusion

### Section: 11.1 Toward Control: Social Enterprise as Development:

#### 11.1b Models of Social Enterprise

Social enterprises come in various forms and models, each with its own unique characteristics and objectives. These models can be broadly categorized into two types: for-profit and non-profit.

##### For-profit Social Enterprises

For-profit social enterprises, also known as social businesses, are businesses that prioritize social and environmental impact over profit. They operate in a commercial manner, generating revenue from the sale of goods or services, but their primary objective is to create social value. For-profit social enterprises can be structured as limited liability companies, corporations, or partnerships. They are governed by a board of directors and are subject to the same laws and regulations as any other business.

For-profit social enterprises can be particularly effective in developing countries, where traditional economic systems may not adequately serve marginalized communities. By prioritizing social and environmental impact, these enterprises can create jobs and opportunities that were previously unavailable to these communities. This not only improves their economic well-being, but also their social and environmental well-being.

##### Non-profit Social Enterprises

Non-profit social enterprises, also known as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), are organizations that operate for the benefit of the community, rather than for the benefit of their members. They are typically funded by donations, grants, and other forms of philanthropic support. Non-profit social enterprises can be structured as charities, foundations, or associations. They are governed by a board of directors or trustees and are subject to the laws and regulations governing non-profit organizations in their jurisdiction.

Non-profit social enterprises can be particularly effective in addressing issues of equity and inclusion. By prioritizing the needs of marginalized communities, these enterprises can provide opportunities and services that were previously unavailable to these communities. This not only improves their social and economic well-being, but also their social and environmental well-being.

In the next section, we will explore the role of social enterprises in promoting equity and inclusion in the context of economic development.

#### 11.1c Challenges and Opportunities in Social Enterprise

Social enterprises, despite their potential for positive impact, face a number of challenges. These challenges can be broadly categorized into three areas: financial, operational, and regulatory.

##### Financial Challenges

Financial challenges are perhaps the most significant obstacle to the growth and sustainability of social enterprises. Unlike traditional businesses, social enterprises often operate with limited resources and rely heavily on philanthropic support. This can make it difficult to secure the necessary funding for operations, expansion, and innovation. Furthermore, the social impact objectives of social enterprises can make it challenging to attract traditional investors, who may be more interested in financial returns than social impact.

##### Operational Challenges

Operational challenges relate to the day-to-day management and operation of the social enterprise. These can include difficulties in managing a diverse and often marginalized workforce, navigating complex supply chains, and implementing effective quality control processes. Social enterprises also face challenges in measuring and reporting their social impact, which can make it difficult to demonstrate their value to stakeholders and potential investors.

##### Regulatory Challenges

Regulatory challenges relate to the legal and regulatory environment in which social enterprises operate. These can include complex and often changing regulatory requirements, difficulties in obtaining necessary licenses and permits, and challenges in navigating the legal and regulatory frameworks governing social impact and philanthropy.

Despite these challenges, social enterprises also present significant opportunities. They offer a unique opportunity to address social and environmental issues in a sustainable and scalable manner. By leveraging market-based approaches, social enterprises can create jobs, stimulate local economies, and empower marginalized communities. Furthermore, the social impact objectives of social enterprises can attract a diverse and committed workforce, and foster a culture of innovation and social responsibility.

In the next section, we will explore strategies for overcoming these challenges and maximizing the opportunities presented by social enterprise.

#### 11.2a Social Impact Bonds

Social Impact Bonds (SIBs) are a type of financial instrument that has gained significant attention in recent years as a potential solution to the financial challenges faced by social enterprises. SIBs are a form of social finance that aims to mobilize private capital for the public good. They are designed to address the financial sustainability of social enterprises by providing a mechanism for investors to earn a financial return while also achieving a social impact.

##### How Social Impact Bonds Work

SIBs are typically structured as a contract between a government or public sector agency, a social service provider (the social enterprise), and one or more private investors. The government or public sector agency agrees to pay the investors a predetermined return on their investment if the social enterprise achieves the agreed-upon social outcomes. If the social enterprise fails to achieve these outcomes, the investors receive nothing.

The social enterprise, in turn, uses the upfront capital provided by the investors to deliver the social services or programs. The success of the social enterprise is measured against predetermined social outcomes, which are typically defined in collaboration with the government or public sector agency.

##### Benefits of Social Impact Bonds

SIBs offer several potential benefits. For investors, they provide an opportunity to earn a financial return while also achieving a social impact. For social enterprises, they provide a source of upfront capital that can be used to deliver social services or programs. For governments and public sector agencies, they provide a way to test and scale social interventions without assuming the financial risk.

##### Challenges and Limitations of Social Impact Bonds

Despite their potential benefits, SIBs also face several challenges and limitations. One of the main challenges is the complexity of their structure, which can make them difficult to understand and implement. This can be particularly challenging for social enterprises, which may not have the resources or expertise to navigate the complexities of SIBs.

Another challenge is the potential for moral hazard. This refers to the risk that the social enterprise may not exert its best efforts to achieve the agreed-upon social outcomes, as it may not bear the full financial risk if it fails to do so. This can undermine the effectiveness of SIBs and reduce their potential for social impact.

Finally, SIBs are not a panacea for the financial challenges faced by social enterprises. They are just one tool in a broader toolkit of financial strategies that social enterprises can use to secure the necessary funding for operations, expansion, and innovation.

In the next section, we will explore another financial strategy for social enterprises: social venture philanthropy.

#### 11.2b Social Impact Investment

Social Impact Investment (SII) is a concept that has gained significant traction in recent years, particularly in the context of social enterprises. It is a form of investment that aims to generate both financial returns and social impact. This approach is particularly relevant in the context of developing countries, where traditional financial systems may not adequately serve the needs of marginalized communities.

##### How Social Impact Investment Works

SII is a form of investment that is typically made by private investors, foundations, or impact funds. These investors provide capital to social enterprises in exchange for a financial return, typically in the form of interest or equity. However, the primary objective of SII is not just financial return, but also social impact. This means that the investors are also interested in the social outcomes achieved by the social enterprise.

The social enterprise, in turn, uses the capital provided by the investors to deliver social services or programs. The success of the social enterprise is measured against predetermined social outcomes, which are typically defined in collaboration with the investors. If the social enterprise achieves these outcomes, the investors receive their financial return. If it fails to achieve these outcomes, the investors may not receive their full financial return.

##### Benefits of Social Impact Investment

SII offers several potential benefits. For investors, it provides an opportunity to earn a financial return while also achieving a social impact. For social enterprises, it provides a source of capital that can be used to deliver social services or programs. For marginalized communities, it can provide access to essential services and opportunities that may not be available through traditional financial systems.

##### Challenges and Limitations of Social Impact Investment

Despite its potential benefits, SII also faces several challenges and limitations. One of the main challenges is the lack of standardization and regulation in the SII market. This can make it difficult for investors to understand and evaluate the risks and potential returns of different SII opportunities.

Another challenge is the potential for mission drift. This refers to the risk that the social enterprise may prioritize financial return over social impact, particularly if it is under financial stress. This can undermine the effectiveness of SII and reduce its potential for social impact.

Finally, SII is not a panacea for the financial challenges faced by social enterprises. It is just one tool in a broader toolkit of financial strategies that social enterprises can use to secure the necessary capital for their operations.

#### 11.2c Case Studies of Social Impact Investment

In this section, we will explore some case studies of social impact investment to provide a practical understanding of how these concepts are applied in real-world scenarios.

##### Case Study 1: Grameen Bank

Grameen Bank, founded by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, is a prime example of a social enterprise that has successfully leveraged social impact investment. The bank provides microcredit loans to impoverished individuals in Bangladesh, particularly women, who are often excluded from traditional banking systems.

Grameen Bank operates on a not-for-profit basis, with the primary objective of poverty alleviation. However, it also generates a financial return for its investors, primarily the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Dutch development bank FMO. These investors provide capital to Grameen Bank in exchange for a financial return, typically in the form of interest. However, they are also interested in the social outcomes achieved by the bank, such as the number of loans provided to impoverished individuals and the impact of these loans on poverty reduction.

##### Case Study 2: Unitus Seed Fund

Unitus Seed Fund is a venture capital fund that invests in early-stage social enterprises in India. The fund's primary objective is to generate both financial returns and social impact. It invests in a diverse range of sectors, including education, healthcare, and agriculture, with a focus on enterprises that have the potential to scale and create significant social impact.

Unitus Seed Fund operates on a for-profit basis, with the expectation that its investments will generate a financial return. However, the fund also has a strong commitment to social impact. It works closely with its portfolio companies to define and measure social outcomes, and it expects these outcomes to be a key factor in its investment decisions.

These case studies illustrate the potential of social impact investment as a tool for social enterprise development. They highlight the importance of aligning financial and social objectives, and the potential for social enterprises to generate both financial returns and social impact.




### Section: 11.1 Toward Control: Social Enterprise as Development:

#### 11.1c Addressing Social Challenges through Social Enterprise

Social enterprises, whether for-profit or non-profit, play a crucial role in addressing social challenges. These challenges can range from poverty and unemployment to environmental degradation and social exclusion. By leveraging market-based solutions, social enterprises can create sustainable and scalable solutions to these challenges.

##### Poverty and Unemployment

Social enterprises can play a significant role in addressing poverty and unemployment, particularly in developing countries. As mentioned in the previous section, for-profit social enterprises can create jobs and opportunities that were previously unavailable to marginalized communities. This not only improves their economic well-being, but also their social and environmental well-being.

For instance, the Grameen Bank, a for-profit social enterprise founded by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, has been instrumental in alleviating poverty in Bangladesh. The bank provides microcredit loans to impoverished individuals, particularly women, who are often excluded from traditional banking systems. These loans enable these individuals to start their own businesses, thereby creating employment opportunities and lifting themselves out of poverty.

##### Environmental Degradation

Social enterprises can also play a crucial role in addressing environmental degradation. By prioritizing environmental impact, these enterprises can develop innovative solutions that reduce environmental harm and promote sustainability.

For example, the non-profit social enterprise TerraCycle specializes in recycling hard-to-recycle materials, such as plastic packaging, cigarette butts, and coffee capsules. The enterprise operates on a zero-waste philosophy, meaning that it aims to recycle or reuse all materials it collects. This not only reduces waste, but also creates jobs and provides a source of income for individuals who collect and sort these materials.

##### Social Exclusion

Social enterprises can also address social exclusion by providing opportunities for marginalized groups to participate in economic activities. This can help to reduce social inequalities and promote social inclusion.

For instance, the non-profit social enterprise War Child Holland provides vocational training and employment opportunities to children and young people who have been affected by war and conflict. This not only helps to rebuild their lives, but also contributes to their social and economic integration.

In conclusion, social enterprises offer a powerful tool for addressing social challenges. By leveraging market-based solutions, these enterprises can create sustainable and scalable solutions that improve the well-being of individuals, communities, and the environment.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the concept of social enterprise as a tool for economic development and the creation of a just city. We have seen how social enterprises, by definition, are businesses that prioritize social and environmental impact over profit. This approach aligns with the principles of equity and inclusion, as it seeks to create opportunities and benefits for all members of the community, regardless of their socio-economic status.

We have also discussed the role of local policies in fostering and supporting social enterprises. These policies can provide incentives, funding, and regulatory frameworks that encourage the establishment and growth of social enterprises. They can also help to create a supportive environment for these enterprises to thrive, by promoting collaboration and partnerships between social enterprises, traditional businesses, and government agencies.

Finally, we have examined the potential of social enterprises as a means of addressing social challenges and promoting social change. By leveraging the power of the market, social enterprises can create innovative and sustainable solutions to social problems, such as poverty, unemployment, and social exclusion. They can also serve as a platform for community engagement and participation, empowering individuals and groups to take an active role in shaping their own lives and communities.

In conclusion, social enterprise is a promising strategy for economic development and the creation of a just city. It offers a unique approach to addressing social challenges and promoting social change, while also contributing to the economic growth and prosperity of the community. By leveraging the power of the market and the principles of equity and inclusion, social enterprises can play a crucial role in creating a more equitable and inclusive society.

## Chapter: Chapter 12: The Role of the State:

### Introduction

The role of the state in economic development and the creation of a just city is a critical aspect of urban planning and policy-making. This chapter, "The Role of the State," delves into the intricate dynamics of this relationship, exploring how state policies and interventions can either hinder or facilitate the realization of an equitable and inclusive urban environment.

The state, as a political entity, plays a pivotal role in shaping the economic landscape of a city. Its policies and regulations can influence the distribution of resources, opportunities, and benefits, thereby impacting the lives of urban dwellers. The state's role extends beyond mere policy-making; it also involves the implementation and enforcement of these policies, which can significantly shape the economic dynamics of a city.

In the context of a just city, the state's role is particularly crucial. A just city is one where all residents, regardless of their socio-economic status, have equal access to opportunities and resources. The state, through its policies and interventions, can either promote or hinder the creation of such a city. It can do so by creating an enabling environment that promotes equitable distribution of resources and opportunities, or by creating barriers that exacerbate existing inequalities.

This chapter will explore these aspects in detail, providing a comprehensive understanding of the state's role in economic development and the creation of a just city. It will delve into the various ways in which state policies and interventions can influence the economic dynamics of a city, and how these can be leveraged to create a more equitable and inclusive urban environment.




### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the concept of social enterprise as a tool for economic development and the creation of a just city. We have seen how social enterprises, as businesses with a social mission, can play a crucial role in addressing social and economic issues within a community. By leveraging the power of the market, social enterprises can create sustainable solutions that not only benefit the community but also contribute to the overall economic growth of the city.

We have also discussed the importance of local policy in supporting and promoting social enterprise. Policies that encourage the formation and growth of social enterprises can help create a more inclusive and equitable society. By providing incentives and resources, local governments can support social enterprises in their efforts to address social and economic issues.

Furthermore, we have examined the role of social enterprise in promoting community engagement and participation.

This can lead to the development of innovative solutions to address the issues faced by the community.

Moreover, public roundtables can help identify and address systemic issues that contribute to inequality and exclusion. By providing a platform for diverse perspectives, they can shed light on the root causes of these issues and facilitate discussions on potential solutions. This can lead to the development of more effective and inclusive policies and strategies for economic development and the just city.

In addition, public roundtables can also serve as a means of accountability. By involving community members in the decision-making process, they can hold policymakers and other stakeholders accountable for their actions. This can help ensure that policies and strategies are implemented in a way that is equitable and inclusive.

In conclusion, public roundtables are a crucial tool for promoting equity and inclusion in economic development and the just city.

It is also important to provide translation services for non-English speaking participants and to accommodate any physical or cognitive disabilities they may have.

In addition to creating a safe and respectful space, it is also important to address any power imbalances that may exist among participants. This can be achieved by promoting equal participation and decision-making power among all participants. It is also important to acknowledge and address any power imbalances that may arise during the discussion.

Furthermore, it is crucial to ensure that the voices of marginalized communities are heard and represented in the public roundtable. This can be achieved by actively seeking out and including diverse perspectives in the discussion. It is also important to provide a platform for marginalized communities to voice their concerns and propose solutions.

Lastly, it is important to follow up on the discussions and outcomes of the public roundtable. This can be achieved by creating a report or summary of the discussions and sharing it with all participants.

This chapter will also provide an opportunity for us to reflect on the journey we have taken together, and to look ahead at the potential future developments in the field of equity and inclusion.

To prepare for these presentations, we will follow a structured process. First, we will review the main themes and concepts covered in the previous chapters. This will help us to refresh our understanding and to identify the most important points to be included in the presentations.

Next, we will organize these points into a logical structure. This will involve grouping related points together, and arranging them in a way that builds up to a clear and coherent message. We will also consider the audience and tailor the structure to their needs and interests.

Once we have a structure in place, we will start to develop the content for each section. This will involve writing a brief summary of the key points, and providing examples or illustrations to help to explain them. We will also include any relevant data or statistics, and will make sure to cite our sources properly.

Finally, we will review and refine our presentations. This will involve checking for clarity, accuracy, and relevance, and making any necessary revisions. We will also practice delivering the presentations to ensure that they are within the time limit and that we are comfortable with the material.

By following this process, we can ensure that our final presentations are informative, engaging, and effective. They will serve as a valuable resource for anyone interested in creating a more equitable and inclusive city, and will help to bring our journey to a satisfying conclusion.

#### 13.1b Presentation Techniques and Tools

In addition to the content and structure of our presentations, we will also need to consider the techniques and tools we use to deliver them. These can greatly enhance the effectiveness of our presentations, and can help to engage and inform our audience.

One technique we will use is the "Rule of Three". This involves presenting information in groups of three, which can help to make complex ideas more manageable and memorable. For example, we might present three key principles of equity and inclusion, or three strategies for economic development.

Another technique is the use of visual aids. These can include charts, graphs, and images, which can help to illustrate our points and to make them more engaging. We will use the popular Markdown format for our presentations, which allows us to easily insert math expressions and equations using the $ and $$ delimiters.

## Chapter: Chapter 14: Equity and Inclusion in the Built Environment

### Introduction

The built environment, the physical structures and spaces that we inhabit, plays a crucial role in shaping our lives. It influences our daily routines, our interactions with others, and our overall well-being. However, not everyone has equal access to the benefits of the built environment. Disparities in access to quality housing, public spaces, and transportation can exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities. This chapter, "Equity and Inclusion in the Built Environment," delves into these issues, exploring the complex interplay between equity, inclusion, and the built environment.

We will examine how local policies and planning decisions can either promote or hinder equity and inclusion in the built environment. We will also discuss the role of community engagement and participation in shaping these policies and decisions. The chapter will further explore the concept of universal design, a design approach that aims to create spaces and structures that are accessible and usable by all people, regardless of their age, ability, or other characteristics.

The chapter will also touch upon the challenges and opportunities in implementing equity and inclusion in the built environment. It will highlight the importance of considering the needs and perspectives of marginalized and underrepresented groups in the planning and design of the built environment. 

In essence, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of equity and inclusion in the built environment, and how local policies and planning decisions can be leveraged to create more equitable and inclusive cities. It is our hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for policymakers, planners, and community members alike, in their efforts to create more just and inclusive built environments.

### Section: 14.1 Urban Planning and Public Health:

Urban planning plays a crucial role in shaping the health of a city. The decisions made by urban planners can have a significant impact on the physical environment, social interactions, and economic opportunities of a community. In this section, we will explore the intersection of urban planning and public health, and how local policies can be used to drive strategies for economic development and create a just city.

#### 14.1a The Intersection of Urban Planning and Public Health

Urban planning and public health are closely intertwined. The physical environment of a city, created by urban planners, can have a direct impact on the health and well-being of its residents. For example, the design of a city's transportation system can influence how easily residents can access healthcare facilities, healthy food options, and other essential services. Urban planning can also impact air quality, noise levels, and exposure to environmental hazards, all of which can have a significant impact on public health.

On the other hand, public health considerations can also play a crucial role in urban planning. For instance, the location of healthcare facilities, schools, and other public spaces can be influenced by the health needs of the community. Urban planners must also consider the potential health impacts of their decisions, such as the placement of industrial facilities or highways near residential areas.

#### 14.1b The Role of Local Policies in Urban Planning and Public Health

Local policies play a critical role in driving strategies for economic development and creating a just city. These policies can be used to address the social, economic, and environmental factors that contribute to public health outcomes. For example, policies can be implemented to improve access to healthy food options, increase affordable housing options, and promote active transportation.

Local policies can also be used to address health disparities and promote equity and inclusion in urban planning. By considering the needs and perspectives of marginalized communities, policies can be developed to address the root causes of health disparities and promote health equity. This can include policies that address issues such as gentrification, displacement, and unequal access to resources.

#### 14.1c Case Studies of Urban Planning and Public Health

To further illustrate the intersection of urban planning and public health, let's examine some case studies. In the city of Portland, Oregon, urban planners implemented a policy to increase the availability of affordable housing options. This policy not only improved access to housing for low-income residents but also had a positive impact on public health by reducing housing insecurity and improving mental well-being.

In the city of Boston, urban planners worked with public health officials to develop a policy that restricted the location of fast food restaurants near schools. This policy aimed to improve access to healthy food options for students and reduce the prevalence of diet-related health issues.

These case studies demonstrate the potential of local policies to address public health issues and promote equity and inclusion in urban planning. By considering the intersection of urban planning and public health, and implementing policies that prioritize the health and well-being of all residents, we can create more equitable and just cities for all.

Local policies play a critical role in driving strategies for economic development and creating a just city. These policies can be used to address the social, economic, and environmental factors that contribute to public health outcomes. For example, policies can be implemented to improve access to healthy food options, increase affordable housing options, and promote active transportation.

One important tool in local policy-making is the Health Impact Assessment (HIA). An HIA is a systematic process that evaluates the potential health effects of a proposed policy, project, or program. It considers the potential impacts on the physical, social, and economic environments of a community, and provides recommendations for improving the health of the community.

#### 14.1c Case Studies of Urban Planning and Public Health

To further illustrate the intersection of urban planning and public health, let's examine some case studies. In the city of Portland, Oregon, urban planners implemented a policy to increase the availability of affordable housing. This policy not only improved the economic well-being of residents, but also had a positive impact on public health by reducing housing insecurity and improving access to healthcare.

In another example, the city of New York implemented an HIA for a proposed highway expansion project. The HIA identified potential negative impacts on air quality and noise levels, and recommended mitigation measures such as implementing noise-reducing pavement and increasing green spaces along the highway. This not only improved the health of residents, but also contributed to the overall livability and sustainability of the city.

These case studies demonstrate the importance of considering public health in urban planning, and the role that local policies and HIAs can play in creating a just and healthy city. By prioritizing the health and well-being of its residents, urban planners can create more equitable and inclusive communities.





### Subsection: 14.1c Case Studies of Health-Focused Urban Planning

In this subsection, we will explore some real-world examples of urban planning strategies that have been successfully implemented to improve public health outcomes.

#### 14.1c.1 The High Line, New York City

The High Line is a 1.45-mile-long elevated linear park built on a former freight rail line in New York City. The park was created through a collaboration between the city government, local community groups, and private donors. The High Line is a prime example of how urban planning can transform a neglected and abandoned space into a vibrant public space that promotes physical activity and social interaction. The park has also been instrumental in revitalizing the surrounding neighborhood, leading to increased property values and economic development.

#### 14.1c.2 The Green Alley Program, Chicago

The Green Alley Program in Chicago is an initiative that aims to transform the city's vast network of service alleys into permeable pavement and vegetation systems. The program is designed to reduce the urban heat island effect, improve air quality, and create more walkable and bikeable neighborhoods. The program also includes the installation of bioswales, which are vegetated ditches that help to filter stormwater and reduce the burden on the city's sewer system. This innovative approach to urban planning has been recognized internationally for its potential to address multiple urban environmental challenges.

#### 14.1c.3 The Healthy Neighborhoods Initiative, Baltimore

The Healthy Neighborhoods Initiative in Baltimore is a comprehensive urban planning and public health program that aims to improve the health and well-being of residents in targeted neighborhoods. The initiative includes strategies to increase access to healthy food options, improve housing conditions, and promote physical activity. The program also includes a focus on community engagement and empowerment, recognizing the importance of involving residents in decision-making processes. The Healthy Neighborhoods Initiative is a prime example of how local policies can be used to drive strategies for economic development and create a just city.

## Chapter 15: Urban Planning and Economic Development:




### Introduction

Housing policy plays a crucial role in shaping the economic development and social fabric of a city. It is a complex and multifaceted issue that intersects with various other policy areas such as land use, transportation, and social services. In this chapter, we will explore the relationship between housing policy and equity, and how local policies can be used to promote economic development and create a just city.

The concept of equity in housing refers to the fair distribution of housing opportunities and resources among different groups of people. This includes access to safe, affordable, and stable housing, as well as the ability to participate in decision-making processes related to housing. Equity in housing is essential for promoting social and economic equity, as it directly impacts the well-being and opportunities of individuals and communities.

Local policies play a crucial role in shaping housing equity. These policies can range from regulations on housing construction and affordability to programs and initiatives aimed at providing housing opportunities for marginalized groups. By examining different local policies and their impact on housing equity, we can gain a better understanding of the complex dynamics at play in the housing market and identify effective strategies for promoting equity.

In this chapter, we will also explore the relationship between housing policy and economic development. Housing is not just a basic need; it also has a significant impact on the economy. The availability and affordability of housing can influence labor force participation, employment opportunities, and overall economic growth. By examining how housing policy can be used to promote economic development, we can identify ways to create a more just and equitable city.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of housing policy and equity, highlighting the importance of local policies in promoting economic development and creating a just city. By understanding the complexities of housing policy and its impact on equity, we can work towards creating more inclusive and equitable communities for all.




### Subsection: 15.1a Understanding Housing Policy

Housing policy is a crucial aspect of urban planning and development. It involves the creation and implementation of policies and regulations that govern the provision of housing in a city. These policies are designed to address issues of equity, affordability, and accessibility in the housing market. In this section, we will explore the concept of housing policy and its role in promoting equity and inclusion in the housing market.

#### The Importance of Housing Policy

Housing policy plays a critical role in shaping the economic development and social fabric of a city. It is a key factor in determining the availability and affordability of housing, which in turn affects the well-being and opportunities of individuals and communities. By setting guidelines and regulations for housing development, housing policy can promote fair and equitable access to housing opportunities.

Moreover, housing policy can also have a significant impact on the overall economy. The availability and affordability of housing can influence labor force participation, employment opportunities, and overall economic growth. By promoting affordable housing options, housing policy can help alleviate poverty and improve the economic well-being of individuals and communities.

#### Types of Housing Policy

There are various types of housing policy that can be implemented by local governments to address issues of equity and inclusion in the housing market. These include:

- Affordable housing policies: These policies aim to provide affordable housing options for low-income households. This can be achieved through rent subsidies, low-interest loans, or direct provision of affordable housing units.
- Inclusionary zoning policies: These policies require developers to include a certain percentage of affordable housing units in new developments. This helps to address issues of housing affordability and promotes diversity in the housing market.
- Tenant protection policies: These policies aim to protect tenants from unfair evictions and rent increases. This can help prevent displacement and promote housing stability for low-income households.
- Housing voucher programs: These programs provide financial assistance to low-income households to help them afford housing in the private market. This can help alleviate housing poverty and promote housing choice for low-income households.

#### Challenges and Opportunities in Housing Policy

Despite the potential benefits of housing policy, there are also challenges that must be addressed. One of the main challenges is the limited resources available for housing development. This can make it difficult for local governments to implement effective housing policies, especially in areas with high housing costs.

However, there are also opportunities for innovation and creativity in housing policy. With the rise of new technologies and the sharing economy, there is potential for alternative housing models that can help address issues of affordability and accessibility. For example, co-living spaces and micro-housing units can provide affordable housing options for individuals and households.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, housing policy is a crucial aspect of urban planning and development. It plays a significant role in promoting equity and inclusion in the housing market, and can have a positive impact on the overall economy. By understanding the different types of housing policy and addressing the challenges and opportunities in their implementation, local governments can create more equitable and inclusive housing markets for their communities.





### Subsection: 15.1b Housing Affordability and Equity

Housing affordability and equity are two crucial aspects of housing policy that are closely intertwined. Housing affordability refers to the ability of individuals and families to access and maintain suitable housing without experiencing financial hardship. Equity, on the other hand, refers to fairness and justice in the distribution of housing opportunities and resources.

#### The Relationship between Housing Affordability and Equity

Housing affordability and equity are closely linked, as affordable housing is essential for promoting equity in the housing market. Without affordable housing options, low-income households may be forced to live in substandard or overcrowded conditions, which can have negative impacts on their health, education, and overall well-being. This can also perpetuate cycles of poverty and limit opportunities for social and economic mobility.

Moreover, housing affordability can also impact equity in terms of access to housing opportunities. In areas where housing is expensive, low-income households may be priced out of certain neighborhoods, limiting their access to quality schools, job opportunities, and other resources. This can further exacerbate existing inequalities and limit opportunities for low-income households.

#### Strategies for Promoting Housing Affordability and Equity

To address issues of housing affordability and equity, local governments can implement various policies and programs. These include:

- Affordable housing programs: These programs provide financial assistance to low-income households to help them access affordable housing options. This can include rent subsidies, low-interest loans, or direct provision of affordable housing units.
- Housing vouchers: Housing vouchers are a form of rental assistance that helps low-income households afford housing in the private market. These vouchers can be used to offset the cost of rent, making housing more affordable for low-income households.
- Inclusionary zoning: As mentioned earlier, inclusionary zoning policies require developers to include a certain percentage of affordable housing units in new developments. This helps to address issues of housing affordability and promotes diversity in the housing market.
- Housing trust funds: Housing trust funds are dedicated sources of funding for affordable housing. These funds can be used to support affordable housing programs and initiatives, such as affordable housing developments or rental assistance programs.

By implementing these strategies and others, local governments can work towards promoting housing affordability and equity in their communities. This not only benefits low-income households, but also contributes to a more inclusive and just city for all.





### Subsection: 15.1c Strategies for Equitable Housing Policy

In addition to promoting housing affordability, local governments can also implement strategies to address housing equity. These strategies aim to ensure that all members of the community have equal access to safe, decent, and affordable housing opportunities.

#### Inclusive Zoning

Inclusive zoning is a strategy that aims to promote diversity and equity in housing by allowing a range of housing types and income levels in all neighborhoods. This can help to break down barriers to housing choice and opportunity, and can also help to address issues of segregation and exclusion. Inclusive zoning can take various forms, such as allowing accessory dwelling units, mixed-use development, or inclusionary zoning policies that require a certain percentage of affordable units in new developments.

#### Housing Choice Vouchers

Housing choice vouchers, also known as Section 8 vouchers, are a form of rental assistance that allows low-income households to choose where they want to live. This can help to break down barriers to housing choice and opportunity, and can also help to address issues of segregation and exclusion. Housing choice vouchers can be used in both the private and public housing markets, and can help to promote housing equity by providing low-income households with access to a wider range of housing options.

#### Affordable Housing Trust Funds

Affordable housing trust funds are a source of funding for affordable housing initiatives. These funds can be used to support a range of affordable housing strategies, including the development of affordable housing units, rental assistance programs, and down payment assistance for low-income homebuyers. By providing a dedicated source of funding for affordable housing, trust funds can help to address issues of housing affordability and equity.

#### Fair Housing Policies

Fair housing policies aim to promote equal access to housing opportunities for all members of the community. These policies prohibit discrimination in the sale, rental, or financing of housing based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or other protected characteristics. Fair housing policies can also include measures to address issues of segregation and exclusion, such as diversity training for housing providers or the use of inclusionary zoning policies.

#### Housing Equity Funds

Housing equity funds are a source of funding for affordable housing initiatives that are targeted towards specific groups or communities. These funds can be used to support a range of affordable housing strategies, including the development of affordable housing units, rental assistance programs, and down payment assistance for low-income homebuyers. By providing targeted support for specific groups or communities, housing equity funds can help to address issues of housing equity and inequality.

### Section: 16.1 Transportation Planning and Equity:

Transportation planning plays a crucial role in shaping the equity and inclusion of a city. It is the process of determining the transportation needs of a community and developing strategies to meet those needs. However, traditional transportation planning has often been criticized for its lack of consideration for the needs and interests of marginalized communities. This has resulted in transportation systems that are not equitable, inclusive, and just.

#### 16.1a The Role of Transportation in Urban Equity

Transportation is a fundamental aspect of urban life. It is the means by which people and goods move around a city, connecting different neighborhoods, job opportunities, and services. However, not all members of a community have equal access to transportation. Marginalized communities, such as low-income residents, people of color, and immigrants, often face barriers to accessing transportation, leading to transportation inequality.

Transportation inequality is a result of systemic discrimination and exclusion in transportation planning and decision-making processes. For example, in many urban centers, minority areas are often overlooked in transportation planning, resulting in inadequate transportation options. This can lead to overcrowded and unsafe transportation routes, making it difficult for residents to access essential services and opportunities.

Moreover, marginalized communities are often more reliant on public transportation, as they may not have access to private vehicles. This further exacerbates transportation inequality, as these communities are more vulnerable to changes in transportation policies and services. For instance, the implementation of anti-sprawl policies, such as urban intensification, can increase housing prices, making it more difficult for low-income residents to afford housing in urban areas.

To address transportation inequality, it is essential to incorporate equity and inclusion principles into transportation planning and decision-making processes. This can be achieved through policy-driven strategies that prioritize the needs and interests of marginalized communities. These strategies can include:

- Equity-focused transportation planning: This involves actively involving marginalized communities in the transportation planning process and considering their needs and interests in decision-making.
- Transit-oriented development: This strategy promotes the development of compact, walkable, and transit-friendly communities, making it easier for residents to access essential services and opportunities without relying on private vehicles.
- Affordable housing near transit: This strategy aims to increase housing affordability by promoting the development of affordable housing near transit hubs, making it more accessible for low-income residents.
- Complete streets: This strategy promotes the design and maintenance of streets that are safe and accessible for all modes of transportation, including pedestrians, cyclists, and public transit.
- Transportation equity analysis: This involves conducting equity analyses to assess the potential impacts of transportation policies and projects on marginalized communities. This can help identify potential disparities and inform decision-making to address them.

In conclusion, transportation plays a crucial role in urban equity and inclusion. It is essential to incorporate equity and inclusion principles into transportation planning and decision-making processes to address transportation inequality and create more equitable and inclusive transportation systems. By doing so, we can create a more just and sustainable future for all members of a community.

These strategies can include:

- Community engagement and participation: Engaging and involving marginalized communities in the transportation planning process is crucial for addressing their transportation needs and concerns. This can be achieved through community meetings, surveys, and other forms of participation.

- Equity analysis and impact assessment: Conducting equity analysis and impact assessments can help identify potential disparities in transportation planning decisions. This can inform the development of more equitable transportation strategies.

- Transit-oriented development: Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a planning approach that focuses on creating compact, walkable, and transit-friendly communities. This can help improve access to transportation for marginalized communities and reduce transportation inequality.

- Complete streets: Complete streets are designed to accommodate all modes of transportation, including pedestrians, cyclists, and public transit. This can help create a more inclusive and equitable transportation system for all members of a community.

- Equitable transit fare policies: Implementing equitable transit fare policies, such as reduced fares for low-income residents, can help make public transportation more affordable for marginalized communities.

- Equitable access to transportation services: Ensuring equitable access to transportation services, such as paratransit and ride-sharing programs, can help address the transportation needs of marginalized communities.

By incorporating these equitable transportation planning strategies, cities can work towards creating a more just and inclusive transportation system for all members of their community. This can help promote social and economic equity, as well as improve the overall quality of life for marginalized communities. 


#### 16.1b Equitable Transportation Planning Strategies

In order to address transportation inequality, it is crucial to implement equitable transportation planning strategies. These strategies aim to promote fair and equal access to transportation for all members of a community, regardless of their socio-economic status, race, or ethnicity. In this section, we will discuss some of the key equitable transportation planning strategies that can be used to promote transportation equity.

##### Community Engagement and Participation

One of the most effective ways to address transportation inequality is through community engagement and participation. This involves actively involving marginalized communities in the transportation planning process. By doing so, their needs and concerns can be addressed, and their voices can be heard. This can be achieved through community meetings, surveys, and other forms of participation. By involving marginalized communities in the planning process, their transportation needs can be better understood and addressed, leading to more equitable transportation outcomes.

##### Equity Analysis and Impact Assessment

Another important strategy for promoting transportation equity is through equity analysis and impact assessment. This involves systematically evaluating the potential impacts of transportation policies and decisions on different communities. By conducting equity analysis and impact assessments, potential disparities in transportation planning decisions can be identified. This can inform the development of more equitable transportation strategies. For example, if an equity analysis reveals that a proposed transportation project will disproportionately impact low-income residents, alternative solutions can be explored to address their transportation needs.

##### Transit-Oriented Development

Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a planning approach that focuses on creating compact, walkable, and transit-friendly communities. This can help promote equitable access to transportation for all members of a community. By prioritizing transit-friendly development, marginalized communities, who may not have access to private vehicles, can have better access to public transportation. This can also help reduce transportation costs for low-income residents, as they can rely on public transportation instead of having to own and maintain a private vehicle.

##### Complete Streets

Complete streets are designed to accommodate all modes of transportation, including pedestrians, cyclists, and public transit. This can help promote equitable access to transportation for all members of a community. By creating complete streets, marginalized communities, who may not have access to private vehicles, can have better access to public transportation and other modes of transportation. This can also help improve safety for all road users, as complete streets are designed to prioritize the safety of all modes of transportation.

##### Equitable Transit Fare Policies

Transit fare policies can also play a role in promoting transportation equity. By implementing equitable transit fare policies, marginalized communities, who may have limited access to private vehicles, can have more affordable access to public transportation. This can help reduce transportation costs for low-income residents and promote equitable access to transportation for all members of a community.

In conclusion, equitable transportation planning strategies are crucial for addressing transportation inequality. By actively involving marginalized communities in the planning process, conducting equity analysis and impact assessments, prioritizing transit-friendly development, creating complete streets, and implementing equitable transit fare policies, transportation equity can be promoted and upheld. These strategies can help create a more just and inclusive transportation system for all members of a community.


#### 16.1c Case Studies of Transportation Planning and Equity

In this section, we will explore some real-world examples of transportation planning and equity. These case studies will provide a deeper understanding of the challenges and solutions involved in promoting transportation equity.

##### Case Study 1: The Equity Impact of Highway Expansion in Los Angeles

In the 1950s, the city of Los Angeles embarked on a massive highway expansion project, known as the "freeway revolt." This project aimed to alleviate traffic congestion and improve transportation efficiency. However, the project had a significant impact on marginalized communities, particularly low-income and minority populations. The construction of new highways resulted in the displacement of thousands of residents, as well as the destruction of affordable housing and small businesses. This case study highlights the importance of considering the potential equity impacts of transportation projects.

##### Case Study 2: The Role of Transit-Oriented Development in Promoting Equity in Portland, Oregon

The city of Portland, Oregon has been a leader in promoting transit-oriented development (TOD) as a means of promoting equity in transportation. TOD prioritizes the development of compact, walkable, and transit-friendly communities, with a focus on providing equitable access to transportation for all members of the community. In Portland, TOD has been used to address transportation inequality by providing affordable housing options near public transportation hubs, as well as promoting the use of sustainable modes of transportation. This case study demonstrates the potential of TOD as a tool for promoting transportation equity.

##### Case Study 3: The Impact of Equity Analysis and Impact Assessment in San Francisco

In 2018, the city of San Francisco implemented a new policy requiring all transportation projects to undergo an equity analysis and impact assessment. This policy aims to ensure that transportation projects do not disproportionately impact marginalized communities. The first project to undergo this analysis was the proposed Central Subway extension, which would have provided a new public transportation option for low-income and minority populations. However, the equity analysis revealed that the project would have also resulted in the displacement of low-income residents. As a result, the project was modified to include affordable housing options and other equity measures. This case study highlights the importance of conducting equity analysis and impact assessments in transportation planning.

##### Case Study 4: The Role of Complete Streets in Promoting Equity in New York City

The city of New York has been a leader in promoting complete streets, which are designed to accommodate all modes of transportation, including pedestrians, cyclists, and public transit. In 2017, the city implemented a complete streets policy, with a focus on promoting equity in transportation.

### Section: 16.1 Transportation Planning and Equity:

Transportation planning is a critical aspect of urban development that has a significant impact on the equity and inclusion of a city. It is the process of determining the transportation needs of a community and developing strategies to meet those needs. However, traditional transportation planning has often been criticized for its lack of consideration for the needs and interests of marginalized communities. This has resulted in transportation systems that are not equitable, inclusive, and just.

#### 16.1a The Role of Transportation in Urban Equity

Transportation is a fundamental aspect of urban life. It is the means by which people and goods move around a city, connecting different neighborhoods, job opportunities, and services. However, not all members of a community have equal access to transportation. Marginalized communities, such as low-income residents, people of color, and immigrants, often face barriers to accessing transportation, leading to transportation inequality.

Transportation inequality is a result of systemic discrimination and exclusion in transportation planning and decision-making processes. For example, in many urban centers, minority areas are often overlooked in transportation planning, resulting in inadequate transportation options. This can lead to overcrowded and unsafe transportation routes, making it difficult for residents to access essential services and opportunities.

Moreover, marginalized communities are often more reliant on public transportation, as they may not have access to private vehicles. This further exacerbates transportation inequality, as these communities are more vulnerable to changes in transportation policies and services. For instance, the implementation of anti-sprawl policies, such as urban intensification, can increase housing prices, making it more difficult for low-income residents to afford housing in urban areas.

To address transportation inequality, it is essential to incorporate equity and inclusion into transportation planning. This involves considering the needs and interests of marginalized communities in decision-making processes and developing strategies that promote equitable access to transportation. One way to achieve this is through the use of transportation demand management (TDM) strategies.

#### 16.1b Transportation Demand Management and Equity

Transportation demand management (TDM) is a set of strategies aimed at reducing the demand for single-occupancy vehicles (SOVs) and promoting the use of more sustainable modes of transportation. These strategies can help address transportation inequality by providing more equitable access to transportation options for marginalized communities.

TDM strategies can be implemented at the local, regional, and national levels. At the local level, TDM can be used to address transportation inequality by promoting the use of public transportation, walking, and biking. This can be achieved through the implementation of policies such as transit-oriented development, complete streets, and congestion pricing. These strategies can help improve access to transportation for marginalized communities and reduce the reliance on private vehicles.

At the regional and national levels, TDM can be used to address transportation inequality by promoting the use of sustainable modes of transportation, such as electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles. These technologies can help reduce the cost of transportation for marginalized communities and improve access to transportation options. Additionally, policies such as fuel efficiency standards and alternative fuel incentives can also help address transportation inequality by reducing the cost of transportation for all communities.

In conclusion, transportation planning plays a crucial role in promoting equity and inclusion in a city. By incorporating equity and inclusion into transportation planning and implementing TDM strategies, we can help address transportation inequality and create a more just and equitable transportation system for all members of a community.

## Chapter 18: Equity and Inclusion in Economic Development:




### Introduction

Land use planning is a critical component of urban development and management. It involves the systematic organization and management of land resources to meet the needs of a community. This chapter will explore the relationship between land use planning and equity, and how local policies can be used to promote economic development and create a just city.

Land use planning is a complex process that involves multiple stakeholders, including government agencies, developers, and community members. It is a tool for shaping the physical form of a city, influencing the distribution of resources, and promoting social and economic equity. However, the process is not without its challenges. Land use planning can be a contentious issue, with competing interests and values often at play.

In this chapter, we will delve into the various aspects of land use planning, including zoning, density, and transportation planning. We will also examine how these elements can be used to promote equity and inclusion in a city. The chapter will also explore the role of local policies in shaping land use planning decisions and how these policies can be used to address issues of equity and inclusion.

The goal of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between land use planning and equity. By the end of this chapter, readers should have a better understanding of the role of land use planning in creating a just city and the strategies that can be used to promote equity and inclusion in urban development.




### Subsection: 18.1a Understanding Land Use Planning

Land use planning is a crucial aspect of urban development and management. It involves the systematic organization and management of land resources to meet the needs of a community. This process is guided by local policies and regulations, and it plays a significant role in promoting equity and inclusion in a city.

#### The Role of Land Use Planning in Promoting Equity and Inclusion

Land use planning is a powerful tool for promoting equity and inclusion in a city. It allows for the systematic allocation of resources and the shaping of the physical form of a city in a way that addresses the needs and concerns of all members of the community. By involving all stakeholders in the planning process, land use planning can help to create a sense of ownership and belonging, which is crucial for promoting equity and inclusion.

Moreover, land use planning can help to address issues of spatial justice. Spatial justice refers to the fair distribution of resources and opportunities across different spatial units, such as neighborhoods or districts. By considering the spatial dimensions of equity and inclusion, land use planning can help to create more equitable and inclusive cities.

#### The Importance of Technology in Land Use Planning

Technology plays a crucial role in land use planning. Online land planning, for instance, allows for the effective use of the internet to support information sharing and decision making from remote locations. This approach can be particularly beneficial for property owners, communities, businesses, and government agencies that have limited access, time, finances, or personnel to make informed decisions about land use.

The use of the Internet, coupled with software technology such as geographic information systems (GIS), allows municipalities and other public and private organizations to compile base information, exchange information, present solutions to land planning issues, and receive feedback. This approach can help to streamline the land use planning process and make it more accessible to all members of the community.

#### The Role of Local Policies in Shaping Land Use Planning Decisions

Local policies play a crucial role in shaping land use planning decisions. These policies are often guided by the principles of equity and inclusion, and they provide a framework for addressing the needs and concerns of all members of the community. By promoting equity and inclusion, local policies can help to create a just city where all members have equal access to resources and opportunities.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the various aspects of land use planning, including zoning, density, and transportation planning. We will also explore how these elements can be used to promote equity and inclusion in a city.





### Subsection: 18.1b The Role of Land Use in Urban Equity

Land use planning plays a pivotal role in promoting urban equity. It is through this process that cities can ensure that all residents, regardless of their socio-economic status, have access to quality housing, education, healthcare, and employment opportunities. This section will delve into the role of land use in urban equity, focusing on the concept of urban sprawl and its impact on transportation inequality.

#### Urban Sprawl and Transportation Inequality

Urban sprawl, characterized by the uncontrolled expansion of urban areas into surrounding rural or undeveloped land, has been a major concern in many cities across the United States. This phenomenon has been linked to a range of negative social, economic, and environmental impacts, including transportation inequality.

Critics of urban sprawl argue that it exacerbates transportation inequality by limiting access to transportation options for minority groups. In many urban centers, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, transportation in minority areas is often lacking, leading to overcrowded and unsafe transportation routes that do not provide a comprehensive means of transportation. This disparity is further exacerbated because minority residents are more reliant on public transportation.

#### The Paradox of Intensification

The concept of the paradox of intensification, as proposed by Melia et al. (2011), is also relevant to the discussion of urban equity. This paradox suggests that while planning policies that increase population densities in urban areas can reduce car use, the effect is weak, and thus, doubling the population density of a particular area will not halve the frequency or distance of car use. This finding highlights the need for a more nuanced approach to land use planning that takes into account the complex interplay between population density, transportation options, and urban equity.

#### Risk of Increased Housing Prices

While land use planning can play a crucial role in promoting urban equity, there is also a concern that anti-sprawl policies may lead to increased housing prices. Some research suggests that this has been the case in cities like Portland, Oregon, where anti-sprawl policies have been implemented. However, other research shows that Portland's price increases are comparable to other Western cities, suggesting that the relationship between anti-sprawl policies and housing affordability is complex and requires further investigation.

In conclusion, land use planning plays a crucial role in promoting urban equity. However, it is important to consider the potential unintended consequences of land use policies, such as the risk of increased housing prices. By taking a comprehensive and inclusive approach to land use planning, cities can work towards creating more equitable and inclusive communities.




### Subsection: 18.1c Strategies for Equitable Land Use Planning

Equitable land use planning is a critical component of promoting urban equity. It involves the development of policies and strategies that ensure all residents, regardless of their socio-economic status, have equal access to quality housing, education, healthcare, and employment opportunities. This section will explore some strategies for equitable land use planning, focusing on the concept of transit-oriented development and its potential to address transportation inequality.

#### Transit-Oriented Development

Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a planning strategy that focuses on creating compact, walkable, and transit-friendly communities. The goal of TOD is to create communities where residents have access to a variety of transportation options, including public transit, walking, and biking. This strategy has been shown to be particularly effective in addressing transportation inequality.

TOD can help to address transportation inequality by providing residents with access to a variety of transportation options. This can be particularly beneficial for minority groups who are often more reliant on public transportation. By creating communities where public transportation is convenient and accessible, TOD can help to reduce transportation barriers and improve equity.

#### The Role of Policy

Policy plays a crucial role in promoting equitable land use planning. Policies can be used to guide development in a way that promotes equity. For example, policies can be put in place to encourage the development of affordable housing in areas with good transit access. This can help to ensure that low-income residents have access to quality housing in areas with good transportation options.

Policies can also be used to promote equitable land use planning by requiring developers to include a certain percentage of affordable housing units in new developments. This can help to address the issue of housing affordability, which is a major factor in urban equity.

#### The Importance of Community Engagement

Community engagement is another important strategy for equitable land use planning. By involving community members in the planning process, planners can ensure that the needs and concerns of all residents are taken into account. This can help to promote equity by ensuring that the planning process is inclusive and participatory.

Community engagement can also help to address issues of transportation inequality. By involving community members in the planning process, planners can ensure that the needs and concerns of all residents, including those who are reliant on public transportation, are taken into account. This can help to ensure that TOD strategies are implemented in a way that is equitable and beneficial for all residents.

In conclusion, equitable land use planning is a critical component of promoting urban equity. Strategies such as transit-oriented development, policy, and community engagement can all play a role in promoting equitable land use planning and addressing issues of transportation inequality. By implementing these strategies, cities can work towards creating more equitable and inclusive communities.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the critical role of land use planning in promoting equity and inclusion in urban development. We have seen how land use planning can be used as a tool to address issues of social, economic, and environmental inequality. By carefully planning the use of land, we can create more equitable and inclusive cities where all residents have access to quality housing, education, employment, and public services.

We have also discussed the importance of community engagement in land use planning. By involving community members in the planning process, we can ensure that their needs and concerns are taken into account, leading to more effective and sustainable solutions. This not only promotes equity and inclusion but also helps to build trust and ownership among community members, leading to a more cohesive and resilient community.

Finally, we have highlighted the role of policy in land use planning. Policies can provide a framework for decision-making and guide the implementation of land use plans. They can also help to address systemic issues of inequality and exclusion, such as gentrification and displacement. By incorporating equity and inclusion principles into policy, we can create a more just and sustainable urban future.

## Chapter: Chapter 19: Housing Policy and Equity

### Introduction

The concept of housing policy and equity is a critical aspect of urban development and the just city. This chapter delves into the intricate relationship between housing policies and their impact on equity, particularly in the context of local governance and economic development. 

Housing policy refers to the set of rules, regulations, and guidelines that govern the provision of housing in a particular area. These policies are often developed and implemented by local governments, and they play a crucial role in shaping the housing landscape of a city. They determine who can access housing, what type of housing is available, and at what cost. 

Equity, in the context of housing, refers to the fair distribution of housing opportunities and resources among different groups of people. It is about ensuring that everyone, regardless of their socio-economic status, race, or ethnicity, has access to safe, affordable, and decent housing. 

The intersection of housing policy and equity is complex and multifaceted. On one hand, housing policies can be used as a tool to promote equity by providing affordable housing options for low-income groups. On the other hand, they can also exacerbate existing inequalities if they are not carefully designed and implemented. 

This chapter will explore these issues in depth, providing a comprehensive overview of the role of housing policy in promoting equity and inclusion in urban development. It will also discuss the challenges and opportunities that local governments face in this regard, and propose strategies for developing more equitable housing policies.
