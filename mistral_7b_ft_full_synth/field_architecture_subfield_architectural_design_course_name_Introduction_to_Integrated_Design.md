## Explanations

### Better-than-average heuristic

Alicke and Govorun proposed the idea that, rather than individuals consciously reviewing and thinking about their own abilities, behaviors and characteristics and comparing them to those of others, it is likely that people instead have what they describe as an "automatic tendency to assimilate positively-evaluated social objects toward ideal trait conceptions". For example, if an individual evaluated themselves as honest, they would be likely to then exaggerate their characteristic towards their perceived ideal position on a scale of honesty. Importantly, Alicke noted that this ideal position is not always the top of the scale; for example, with honesty, someone who is always brutally honest may be regarded as rude—the ideal is a balance, perceived differently by different individuals.

### Egocentrism

Another explanation for how the better-than-average effect works is egocentrism. This is the idea that an individual places greater importance and significance on their own abilities, characteristics, and behaviors than those of others. Egocentrism is therefore a less overtly self-serving bias. According to egocentrism, individuals will overestimate themselves in relation to others because they believe that they have an advantage that others do not have, as an individual considering their own performance and another's performance will consider their performance to be better, even when they are in fact equal. Kruger (1999) found support for the egocentrism explanation in his research involving participant ratings of their ability on easy and difficult tasks. It was found that individuals were consistent in their ratings of themselves as above the median in the tasks classified as "easy" and below the median in the tasks classified as "difficult", regardless of their actual ability. In this experiment the better-than-average effect was observed when individuals were asked to rate their own performance on a task, compared to when they were asked to rate the performance of a hypothetical individual. This suggests that egocentrism plays a role in the better-than-average effect, as individuals are more likely to overestimate their own abilities when asked to rate themselves.

### Section: 20.1 Course Reflection:

#### 20.1b Applying Knowledge

As we conclude our journey through "Introduction to Integrated Design: A Comprehensive Guide", it is important to not only reflect on what we have learned, but also to apply this knowledge in practical ways. The principles, processes, and applications of integrated design are not just theoretical concepts, but tools that can be used to solve real-world problems.

One of the key ways to apply our knowledge is through the use of intelligent instructional software. As we have learned, such software can provide embedded "adaptive individualized example fading mechanism[s]" that can tailor fading of worked examples to individual students' growing expertise levels. This can help to reduce cognitive load and improve learning results, particularly for students who may be experiencing the expertise reversal effect.

For example, consider the software Cognitive Tutor, which can trace student learning and assess knowledge acquisition. In response to learner assessments, the software can provide optimal example fading that addresses the individual learner's needs. This can help to ensure that learners do not experience the expertise reversal effect, and can continue to progress in a way that minimizes this effect.

However, it is important to note that the use of intelligent instructional software is not a panacea. As with any tool, it is important to use it effectively and appropriately. This requires ongoing assessment of learner progress, and the ability to make adjustments to adapt and provide optimal example fading. It also requires a deep understanding of the principles and processes of integrated design, and the ability to apply these principles in a practical and effective way.

In conclusion, applying our knowledge is not just about using tools like intelligent instructional software. It is about developing a deep understanding of integrated design, and the ability to apply this understanding in practical ways. It is about learning to see the world in a more holistic and systemic way, and to strive for solutions that are not only effective but also sustainable and resilient. As we move forward in our careers, this ability will continue to be a valuable skill, as we strive to create innovative and sustainable solutions to the complex problems of the future.




### Subsection: 20.1c Future Courses

As we conclude our journey through "Introduction to Integrated Design: A Comprehensive Guide", it is important to look ahead and consider what future courses might hold. The field of integrated design is constantly evolving, and as we continue to learn and apply the principles, processes, and applications of integrated design, we must also be prepared to adapt and learn new things.

One of the key areas of future learning in integrated design is the use of artificial intuition. As we have learned, artificial intuition is a concept that is still being explored and developed. It involves the use of algorithms and machine learning techniques to mimic human intuition, and it has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach design problems.

For example, consider the concept of artificial intuition in design. As we have learned, artificial intuition can be used to generate design solutions that are not only functional, but also aesthetically pleasing. This can help to bridge the gap between design and engineering, and can lead to more holistic and integrated designs.

However, the use of artificial intuition in design also raises important ethical and societal questions. As with any technology, it is important to consider the potential implications and consequences of using artificial intuition in design. This will be an important area of study in future courses.

Another area of future learning in integrated design is the use of artificial intuition in education. As we have learned, intelligent instructional software can already provide embedded "adaptive individualized example fading mechanism[s]" that can tailor fading of worked examples to individual students' growing expertise levels. In the future, we can expect to see more advanced forms of artificial intuition being used in education, such as personalized learning algorithms that can adapt to each student's individual learning needs.

In conclusion, the future of integrated design is full of exciting possibilities. As we continue to learn and apply the principles, processes, and applications of integrated design, we must also be prepared to adapt and learn new things. The use of artificial intuition in design and education will be key areas of study in future courses, and we can expect to see many more advancements and developments in these areas.
