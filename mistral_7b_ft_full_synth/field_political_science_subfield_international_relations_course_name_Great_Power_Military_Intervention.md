# Title: Great Power Military Intervention: A Comprehensive Study

## Foreward

In the aftermath of World War II, the international community faced a new challenge: the rise of civil wars. These conflicts, often fueled by internal divisions and external influences, posed a threat to global stability and security. As a result, great powers began to intervene in these conflicts, using military force to protect their interests and promote their ideologies. This book, "Great Power Military Intervention: A Comprehensive Study", aims to examine this phenomenon in depth, exploring the motivations, methods, and consequences of great power intervention in civil wars.

The book begins by examining the historical context of great power intervention. From the European great powers of the 19th century to the United States in the 20th century, we will explore how and why these powers have intervened in civil wars. We will also delve into the concept of the Monroe Doctrine, a policy of non-intervention in the Americas that was declared by the United States in 1821. This doctrine, while often cited as a justification for US intervention, has been subject to much debate and interpretation.

Next, we will examine the effectiveness of intervention. This is a topic of great debate, with some scholars arguing that intervention can be successful in shortening wars, while others are skeptical of its effectiveness. We will explore these arguments in depth, examining the data and methodologies used by different scholars.

One of the key debates in the study of intervention is the concept of selection bias. As Fortna has argued, peacekeepers often select themselves into difficult cases, which can skew the effectiveness of intervention. We will explore this concept in detail, examining how it affects our understanding of intervention and its outcomes.

Finally, we will examine the role of great powers in civil wars. We will explore how these powers use military force to achieve their objectives, and the consequences of their interventions. We will also examine the role of other actors, such as regional powers and neighboring states, in these conflicts.

This book aims to provide a comprehensive study of great power intervention in civil wars. By examining the historical context, effectiveness, and role of great powers in these conflicts, we hope to shed light on this complex and important topic. We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for students, scholars, and policymakers interested in understanding the dynamics of great power intervention.

### Subsection 1.1a Definition and Scope

Great power military intervention refers to the use of military force by a powerful nation to influence the affairs of another nation. This intervention can take various forms, including direct military intervention, indirect support for rebel groups, and humanitarian interventions. The scope of this study is to examine the historical, political, economic, and humanitarian factors that influence great power military intervention.

#### Historical Roots

The use of military force by great powers has been a common practice throughout history. The Roman Empire, for example, used military force to expand its territory and establish dominance. Similarly, the British Empire used military force to gain control of colonies and protect its economic interests. These historical examples demonstrate the long-standing tradition of great power military intervention and its role in shaping global politics.

#### Political, Economic, and Humanitarian Considerations

Great power military intervention is often driven by political, economic, and humanitarian considerations. Politically, great powers may intervene to protect their strategic interests or to promote their ideology. Economically, they may intervene to secure resources or to protect their investments. Humanitarian considerations, such as protecting civilians from violence or providing humanitarian aid, also play a significant role in great power military intervention.

#### Types of Intervention

There are various types of great power military intervention, each with its own unique characteristics and consequences. Direct military intervention involves the deployment of military forces into a foreign territory. Indirect support for rebel groups, on the other hand, involves providing financial, military, or political support to opposition groups within a target country. Humanitarian interventions, such as peacekeeping missions, aim to protect civilians and promote stability in conflict-affected areas.

#### Case Studies

To gain a deeper understanding of great power military intervention, this study will include case studies of past interventions by great powers. These case studies will examine the motivations, strategies, and outcomes of interventions by the United States, Russia, and other major powers. By analyzing these cases, we hope to shed light on the effectiveness and consequences of great power military intervention.

#### Current State of Great Power Military Intervention

The rise of new powers and the changing global political landscape have also influenced the current state of great power military intervention. With the rise of powers such as China and India, the traditional balance of power is being disrupted, leading to new dynamics in military intervention. Additionally, the rise of non-state actors and the increasing use of cyber warfare have also added new dimensions to great power military intervention.

In conclusion, great power military intervention is a complex and multifaceted topic that has shaped global politics for centuries. This study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of this topic by examining its historical roots, political, economic, and humanitarian considerations, and current state. By the end of this study, readers will have a deeper understanding of the motivations, strategies, and consequences of great power military intervention.





### Subsection 1.1b Historical Overview

The history of great power military intervention is a complex and multifaceted one, with examples dating back to ancient civilizations. The Roman Empire, for instance, was known for its military expansion and conquest, often using force to subjugate neighboring territories. Similarly, the British Empire, which spanned across the globe, used military force to establish and maintain its dominance over colonies.

In more recent history, the United States has been a major player in great power military intervention. The US has intervened in numerous conflicts around the world, often citing political, economic, and humanitarian reasons for its actions. For example, the US intervened in the Korean War (1950-1953) to support South Korea against communist aggression from North Korea. The US also intervened in the Gulf War (1990-1991) to protect its economic interests and to prevent the spread of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq.

However, great power military intervention is not always successful. The US intervention in Iraq, for instance, has been widely criticized for its lack of clear objectives and the subsequent instability and violence in the region. This highlights the complexities and challenges of great power military intervention, and the need for careful consideration and planning.

### Subsection 1.1c Case Studies

To further understand the complexities and challenges of great power military intervention, this section will examine several case studies. These case studies will provide a more detailed analysis of specific instances of intervention, including the historical context, motivations, and outcomes.

#### Case Study 1: The Korean War

The Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, was a major conflict between North and South Korea. The US intervened in the war, supporting South Korea against communist aggression from North Korea. The intervention was motivated by political and economic considerations, as the US saw the conflict as a test of its Cold War policies and a means to protect its economic interests in the region.

The intervention was initially successful, with the US and its allies pushing back the North Korean army and regaining control of South Korea. However, the intervention was not without its challenges. The US faced significant casualties and the conflict dragged on for several years, ultimately resulting in a stalemate and an armistice rather than a clear victory.

#### Case Study 2: The Gulf War

The Gulf War, which lasted from 1990 to 1991, was a major conflict between Iraq and a coalition of countries led by the US. The US intervened in the war to protect its economic interests and to prevent the spread of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. The intervention was also motivated by humanitarian concerns, as the US sought to protect civilians from Saddam Hussein's brutal regime.

The intervention was successful, with the US and its allies quickly defeating Iraqi forces and forcing Saddam Hussein's regime to surrender. However, the intervention also faced challenges, including the loss of US soldiers and the subsequent instability and violence in the region.

#### Case Study 3: The War in Afghanistan

The War in Afghanistan, which began in 2001, is an ongoing conflict between the US and its allies and the Taliban in Afghanistan. The US intervened in the war in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which were planned and executed by al-Qaeda, a terrorist group that had found safe haven in Afghanistan under the Taliban's rule.

The intervention has been marked by significant challenges, including the ongoing conflict and the high number of US casualties. The intervention has also faced criticism for its lack of clear objectives and the subsequent instability and violence in the region.

These case studies highlight the complexities and challenges of great power military intervention. They demonstrate the need for careful consideration and planning, as well as the potential for unintended consequences and long-term instability.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, great power military intervention is a complex and multifaceted issue that has been a part of human history for centuries. From the Roman Empire to modern-day interventions by the US and other great powers, military intervention has been used for a variety of reasons, including political, economic, and humanitarian concerns. However, as seen in the case studies examined in this section, great power military intervention is not without its challenges and potential consequences. It is crucial for policymakers and military strategists to carefully consider the potential outcomes and implications of military intervention before engaging in such actions.

## Chapter: Chapter 2: Theories of Intervention

### Introduction

In the realm of international relations, the use of military force has been a contentious issue for centuries. The application of military power, often referred to as intervention, has been a tool used by great powers to exert their influence and achieve their strategic objectives. This chapter, "Theories of Intervention," delves into the various theoretical perspectives that attempt to explain and justify the use of military intervention by great powers.

Theories of intervention are essential in understanding the rationale behind the use of military force in international affairs. They provide a framework for analyzing the motivations, strategies, and outcomes of intervention. This chapter will explore the key theories of intervention, including the realist perspective, the liberal perspective, and the constructivist perspective.

The realist perspective, rooted in the principles of power politics, views intervention as a means for great powers to protect their national interests and expand their influence. This perspective emphasizes the role of power and security in international relations, and it often justifies intervention on the grounds of self-defense or the protection of strategic assets.

The liberal perspective, on the other hand, sees intervention as a means to promote democracy, human rights, and economic stability. This perspective emphasizes the role of international law and institutions in regulating intervention, and it often justifies intervention on the grounds of humanitarian concerns or the promotion of stability.

Finally, the constructivist perspective views intervention as a social construct, shaped by norms, values, and perceptions. This perspective emphasizes the role of ideology and identity in shaping intervention, and it often justifies intervention on the grounds of moral responsibility or the promotion of certain values.

By exploring these theories, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex and multifaceted nature of intervention by great powers. It will also highlight the ongoing debates and controversies surrounding intervention, and it will encourage critical thinking about the role of military force in international affairs.




### Subsection 1.1c Key Concepts and Terms

In order to fully understand great power military intervention, it is important to familiarize oneself with some key concepts and terms. These concepts and terms will be used throughout the book and are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

These countries are often referred to as superpowers and are typically involved in international conflicts and interventions. The United States, Russia, and China are examples of great powers.

#### Military Intervention

Military intervention is the use of military force by one country to intervene in the affairs of another country. This can take various forms, such as direct military intervention, where troops are deployed, or indirect intervention, where support is provided to a third party. Military intervention can be used for a variety of reasons, including protecting national interests, promoting stability, or enforcing international law.

#### Humanitarian Intervention

Humanitarian intervention is a form of military intervention that is aimed at protecting civilians from violence or human rights abuses. This type of intervention is often justified by the responsibility to protect (R2P) principle, which states that the international community has a responsibility to protect civilians from mass atrocities.

#### Regime Change

Regime change is the overthrow of a government or political system by another government or group. This can be achieved through various means, including military intervention, economic sanctions, or propaganda. Regime change is often a goal of great power interventions, as it allows for the installation of a more favorable government or political system.

#### Proxy War

A proxy war is a conflict where two or more countries fight on behalf of a third party. This can occur when great powers intervene in a conflict between two other countries, using their own military forces to support one side. Proxy wars can be used as a means of exerting influence and achieving strategic goals without direct involvement.

#### Soft Power

Soft power is a form of influence that is achieved through cultural, economic, and political means. It is often used by great powers to gain support and influence in international affairs. Soft power can be used as a means of avoiding direct military intervention, as it allows for the achievement of goals without the use of force.

#### International Law

International law refers to the set of rules and norms that govern the behavior of states in the international community.

### Subsection 1.2a Pre-World War Era

The pre-World War era saw a significant increase in great power military interventions, particularly in the Middle East. This period was marked by a shift in the balance of power, with the rise of new great powers and the decline of others. The United States, in particular, emerged as a dominant global power, with its military interventions shaping the political landscape of the Middle East.

#### The United States as a Great Power

The United States has been a major player in the Middle East since the early 20th century. Its involvement in the region has been driven by its strategic interests, including securing access to oil and promoting stability. The US has used military interventions to achieve these goals, often working in partnership with other great powers such as the United Kingdom and France.

One of the key factors that have allowed the US to exert its influence in the Middle East is its economic power. The US has been the world's largest economy since the late 19th century, and its economic strength has enabled it to project its power globally. This has been particularly evident in the Middle East, where the US has used its economic leverage to shape the region's political landscape.

#### The Rise of New Great Powers

The pre-World War era also saw the rise of new great powers, particularly in the Middle East. These included Turkey, which emerged as a regional power after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, and the Soviet Union, which sought to expand its influence in the region. These new powers challenged the dominance of the US and other Western powers, leading to increased military interventions in the Middle East.

#### The Impact of Military Interventions

The pre-World War era saw a significant impact of military interventions on the Middle East. These interventions often resulted in regime change, as seen in the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. However, these interventions have also been criticized for their unintended consequences, such as the rise of ISIS and other extremist groups.

In conclusion, the pre-World War era was a crucial period in the history of great power military interventions. The rise of new great powers, particularly the US, and the impact of these interventions on the Middle East have shaped the region's political landscape and continue to have implications for global politics today. 





### Subsection 1.2b Post-World War Era

The post-World War era has been marked by a significant shift in the global political landscape, particularly in the Middle East. The end of World War II saw the rise of new global powers, including the Soviet Union and the United States, and the decline of the European empires that had previously dominated the region. This period has been characterized by a series of military interventions, often driven by the strategic interests of these new global powers.

#### The Cold War and Military Interventions

The Cold War, which lasted from the end of World War II until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, was a period of intense political and military competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. This competition often played out in the Middle East, with both powers seeking to exert their influence in the region.

The Cold War saw a significant increase in military interventions in the Middle East. The US and the Soviet Union often supported opposing sides in regional conflicts, using their military power to advance their strategic interests. This period saw a number of major interventions, including the US-led invasion of Iraq in 1991 and the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in 1979.

#### The Rise of Regional Powers

The post-World War era also saw the rise of new regional powers in the Middle East. These included Iran, which emerged as a major power following the Iranian Revolution of 1979, and Saudi Arabia, which became a key US ally and a major player in the region. These new powers often engaged in their own military interventions, further complicating the already complex political landscape of the Middle East.

#### The Impact of Military Interventions

The post-World War era has been marked by a significant impact of military interventions on the Middle East. These interventions have often resulted in regime change, as seen in the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in 1979. However, these interventions have also been criticized for their humanitarian consequences, including the loss of civilian lives and the displacement of populations.

The post-World War era has also seen a shift in the justifications for military interventions. While in the pre-World War era, interventions were often justified on the basis of protecting strategic interests, in the post-World War era, there has been a growing emphasis on humanitarian concerns. This shift has been driven by the increasing global awareness of human rights and the growing power of international organizations, such as the United Nations.

In conclusion, the post-World War era has been a period of significant change in the Middle East, marked by a series of military interventions driven by the strategic interests of global powers. This period has also seen the rise of new regional powers and a shift in the justifications for military interventions.

In this chapter, we delve into the historical case studies of great power military intervention. The study of these interventions is crucial in understanding the dynamics of international relations and the role of military force in shaping global politics. We will explore various instances of military intervention by major global powers, examining the reasons behind their actions, the methods used, and the outcomes of these interventions.

The chapter will be divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific case study. We will begin by examining the historical context of these interventions, including the political, economic, and social factors that influenced the decision to intervene. We will then delve into the details of the intervention itself, including the strategies and tactics employed, the role of international organizations and other countries, and the impact of the intervention on the local population.

Throughout the chapter, we will also discuss the ethical considerations surrounding these interventions. We will explore the principles of just war theory and the concept of humanitarian intervention, and how these principles have been applied in the historical case studies we will examine.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a comprehensive understanding of the complexities of great power military intervention and its impact on global politics. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the subsequent chapters, where we will delve deeper into the theoretical aspects of military intervention and its implications for international relations.




### Subsection 1.2c Modern Day Interventions

The modern era has seen a continuation of the complex dynamics of military intervention in the Middle East. The rise of new global powers, such as China and India, has added another layer of complexity to the region's political landscape. These powers, along with the US and Russia, have been increasingly involved in military interventions in the Middle East, often with conflicting interests and strategies.

#### The Rise of China and India as Global Powers

The rise of China and India as global powers has had a significant impact on military interventions in the Middle East. China, with its growing economic and military power, has been increasingly involved in the region, particularly in the energy-rich Gulf states. India, on the other hand, has been focused on its own regional security concerns, particularly in its disputed border regions with China and Pakistan.

#### The Role of Russia in Modern Day Interventions

Russia, despite its economic struggles, has also been a major player in modern day interventions in the Middle East. Its involvement has been largely driven by its strategic interests, particularly in Syria, where it has been supporting the Assad regime since the start of the Syrian Civil War in 2011. Russia's involvement has been a major source of conflict with the US and other global powers, particularly in the context of the ongoing war in Syria.

#### The Impact of Modern Day Interventions

The modern era has been marked by a significant impact of military interventions on the Middle East. These interventions have often resulted in regime change, as seen in the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in 1979. The rise of new global powers and their involvement in the region has added another layer of complexity to the already complex political landscape of the Middle East.

#### The Future of Military Interventions in the Middle East

The future of military interventions in the Middle East is uncertain, but it is clear that the region will continue to be a major focus for global powers. The rise of new powers, the ongoing conflicts in Syria and Iraq, and the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict will all continue to drive military interventions in the region. The challenge for global powers will be to navigate these complex dynamics in a way that promotes stability and security in the region.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have introduced the topic of great power military intervention and its significance in the global political landscape. We have explored the historical context of military interventions, from ancient times to the modern era, and how they have evolved over time. We have also discussed the various factors that influence military interventions, including political, economic, and humanitarian considerations.

## Chapter: Chapter 2: Theories of Intervention

### Introduction

In the realm of international relations, the use of military force has been a contentious issue for centuries. Theories of intervention, which aim to explain the reasons and methods behind such actions, have been developed and refined over time. This chapter, "Theories of Intervention," delves into these theories, providing a comprehensive study of their origins, principles, and applications.

Theories of intervention are essential tools for understanding the complex dynamics of international relations. They offer insights into the motivations and strategies of great powers when they choose to intervene in the affairs of other nations. These theories are not only academic constructs but also practical guides for policymakers and strategists.

In this chapter, we will explore the major theories of intervention, including the balance of power theory, the domino theory, and the responsibility to protect (R2P). We will examine how these theories have been applied in historical contexts, from ancient empires to modern global powers. We will also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each theory, and how they can be used to inform our understanding of contemporary interventions.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the key theories of intervention and their implications for international relations. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the subsequent chapters, which will delve deeper into specific case studies of intervention by great powers.

### Subsection: 2.1b Russia

Russia has a long history of military intervention, both domestically and internationally. Its intervention in the Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, is a prime example of its involvement in international conflicts. In this section, we will examine Russia's policy preferences and actions in Syria, as well as its overall approach to military intervention.

#### Russia's Policy Preferences in Syria

Russia's intervention in Syria was driven by a combination of political, economic, and humanitarian considerations. Politically, Russia saw an opportunity to protect its ally, President Bashar al-Assad, and maintain its influence in the region. Economically, Russia has significant economic interests in Syria, including a naval base in Tartus and a military airbase in Hmeimim. Additionally, Russia has been a major supplier of weapons to Syria, and the conflict provided a lucrative market for Russian arms. Humanitarian concerns also played a role, as Russia saw the conflict as a threat to regional stability and the safety of its citizens in Syria.

#### Russia's Actions in Syria

Russia's intervention in Syria began in September 2015, when it launched a military campaign in support of Assad's forces. This intervention was a significant departure from its previous policy of non-intervention in the Syrian Civil War. Russia's actions in Syria have been characterized by a combination of air strikes, ground operations, and support for Assad's forces. Its intervention has been crucial in turning the tide of the conflict in Assad's favor, allowing him to regain control of key areas and weaken rebel forces.

#### Russia's Approach to Military Intervention

Russia's intervention in Syria is a prime example of its overall approach to military intervention. It is characterized by a combination of political, economic, and humanitarian considerations. Russia's actions in Syria also demonstrate its willingness to intervene in conflicts that directly affect its interests, whether domestically or internationally. This approach is in line with its historical role as a great power, which has been characterized by a strong military presence and intervention in global affairs.

In conclusion, Russia's intervention in Syria highlights its policy preferences and actions in international conflicts. Its intervention has been driven by a combination of political, economic, and humanitarian considerations, and has been crucial in shaping the outcome of the Syrian Civil War. This intervention also demonstrates Russia's overall approach to military intervention, which is characterized by a combination of political, economic, and humanitarian considerations. 





### Subsection: 2.1c China

China's approach to military intervention is heavily influenced by its historical and cultural background. As a country with a long history of imperialism and colonialism, China has a deep-rooted fear of foreign intervention and a strong desire to maintain its sovereignty and territorial integrity. This has led to a policy of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other countries, with the exception of cases where China's own interests are directly threatened.

#### China's Policy Preferences in Military Intervention

China's policy preferences in military intervention are guided by its principle of non-intervention. This principle is deeply ingrained in China's foreign policy and is seen as a way to uphold its own sovereignty and territorial integrity. China believes that each country has the right to determine its own political, economic, and social systems without external interference. This principle is also seen as a way to avoid conflicts and maintain regional stability.

However, China has also shown a willingness to intervene in cases where its own interests are directly threatened. This was evident in its intervention in the Korean War (1950-1953) and the Vietnam War (1979). In both cases, China saw its own security and territorial integrity as being directly threatened and intervened to protect its interests.

#### China's Actions in Military Intervention

China's actions in military intervention have been largely limited to its own borders. Its intervention in the Korean War and the Vietnam War were both defensive in nature, aimed at protecting its own territory and interests. In both cases, China's intervention was successful in achieving its objectives.

However, China's approach to military intervention has evolved over time. In recent years, China has become more assertive in its military actions, particularly in the South China Sea. This has raised concerns among its neighbors and the international community, who see China's actions as a threat to regional stability.

#### China's Approach to Military Intervention

China's approach to military intervention is characterized by a combination of non-intervention and assertiveness. On one hand, China adheres to its principle of non-intervention and avoids intervening in the internal affairs of other countries. On the other hand, it has become more assertive in protecting its own interests and has shown a willingness to intervene in cases where its own security and territorial integrity are directly threatened.

China's approach to military intervention is also influenced by its growing economic and military power. As China's economic and military power continues to grow, it is likely to become more assertive in its actions and may intervene in more cases where its own interests are threatened. This could lead to conflicts and challenges for the international community, as seen in the South China Sea.




### Subsection: 2.1d European Union

The European Union (EU) is a unique entity when it comes to military intervention. As a supranational organization, the EU has a complex structure and decision-making process that can greatly influence its approach to intervention.

#### The EU's Policy Preferences in Military Intervention

The EU's policy preferences in military intervention are guided by its principles of non-intervention and respect for sovereignty. Like China, the EU also believes in the right of each country to determine its own political, economic, and social systems without external interference. This principle is deeply ingrained in the EU's foreign policy and is seen as a way to uphold its own sovereignty and territorial integrity.

However, the EU has also shown a willingness to intervene in cases where its own interests are directly threatened. This was evident in its intervention in the Balkans in the 1990s, where the EU saw its own security and economic interests as being directly threatened by the ongoing conflicts.

#### The EU's Actions in Military Intervention

The EU's actions in military intervention have been largely limited to its own borders. Its intervention in the Balkans and Libya were both defensive in nature, aimed at protecting its own territory and interests. In both cases, the EU's intervention was successful in achieving its objectives.

However, the EU's approach to military intervention has evolved over time. In recent years, the EU has become more assertive in its military actions, particularly in its role as a global power. This has been evident in its involvement in the conflicts in Libya and Syria, where the EU has played a significant role in providing military support to rebel groups.

#### The EU's Role in Global Military Intervention

The EU's role in global military intervention has been a topic of debate among scholars and policymakers. Some argue that the EU's approach to intervention has been too cautious and has hindered its ability to effectively address global conflicts. Others argue that the EU's approach has been necessary to maintain its own sovereignty and avoid getting embroiled in costly and prolonged conflicts.

Despite these debates, the EU's role in global military intervention has been significant. Its involvement in the conflicts in Libya and Syria has shown its willingness to intervene in global conflicts, albeit in a limited and cautious manner. As the EU continues to evolve as a global power, its approach to military intervention will continue to be a topic of interest and debate.

## Chapter 3: Great Power Intervention:




### Subsection: 2.2a Ethnic Conflict Theory

Ethnic conflict theory is a crucial aspect of understanding internal conflicts and their origins. It posits that ethnicity, as a social construct, plays a significant role in shaping conflicts within a society. This theory is particularly relevant in the context of great power military intervention, as ethnic conflicts often serve as a catalyst for external intervention.

#### The Role of Ethnicity in Internal Conflicts

Ethnicity, as a social construct, is often used as a tool for mobilization in times of conflict. Ethnic groups, particularly those that are marginalized or discriminated against, may use their ethnic identity as a means of resistance against the dominant group. This can lead to ethnic conflicts, where the conflict is primarily driven by ethnic differences and tensions.

However, it is important to note that ethnicity is not the sole cause of internal conflicts. Other factors, such as economic disparities, political power struggles, and social inequalities, can also contribute to the outbreak of conflicts. Ethnicity, in this sense, is often used as a tool to mobilize support and justify violence, rather than being the primary cause of the conflict.

#### The Extent of Ethnic Conflict

The extent of ethnic conflict can vary greatly depending on the specific context. In some cases, ethnic conflicts can be localized and limited in scope, while in others, they can escalate into full-blown civil wars. The extent of ethnic conflict is often influenced by a variety of factors, including the size and distribution of ethnic groups, the history of ethnic relations, and the presence of external actors.

For instance, in Nigeria, the ethnic conflict between the Hausa-Fulani and the Yoruba has been ongoing for decades and has resulted in significant loss of life and property. However, the conflict has been largely contained within the country's borders and has not escalated into a full-blown civil war.

#### The Impact of Ethnic Conflict on Military Intervention

Ethnic conflict can have a significant impact on great power military intervention. Ethnic conflicts often serve as a justification for external intervention, particularly by neighboring countries. For instance, the ethnic conflict in Sudan has been a major factor in the involvement of neighboring countries, such as Egypt and Ethiopia, in the conflict.

Furthermore, ethnic conflicts can also influence the strategies and tactics used by external actors in military intervention. For instance, in the case of the ethnic conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the international community intervened to protect the Bosniak and Croat populations, who were being persecuted by the Serb-led forces. This intervention was largely driven by the ethnic composition of the conflict.

In conclusion, ethnic conflict theory provides valuable insights into the origins, nature, and extent of internal conflicts. It also highlights the role of ethnicity in shaping military intervention by great powers. However, it is important to note that ethnicity is not the sole cause of conflicts and that other factors must also be considered.




### Subsection: 2.2b Resource Conflict Theory

Resource conflict theory is another crucial aspect of understanding internal conflicts and their origins. It posits that conflicts over resources, particularly natural resources, can lead to internal conflicts and even external interventions. This theory is particularly relevant in the context of great power military intervention, as resource conflicts often serve as a justification for external intervention.

#### The Role of Resources in Internal Conflicts

Resources, particularly natural resources, play a significant role in shaping conflicts within a society. The extraction and sale of these resources can generate significant revenue, which can be used to finance armed conflict. This is often the case in developing countries, where the presence of valuable natural resources can attract external actors who are willing to exploit these resources for their own benefit.

Moreover, the unequal distribution of resources can also lead to conflicts. In many societies, certain ethnic groups are disproportionately represented in the control and management of resources. This can lead to tensions and conflicts between these groups, particularly in situations where resources are scarce or unevenly distributed.

#### The Extent of Resource Conflict

The extent of resource conflict can vary greatly depending on the specific context. In some cases, resource conflicts can be localized and limited in scope, while in others, they can escalate into full-blown civil wars. The extent of resource conflict is often influenced by a variety of factors, including the type and quantity of resources, the distribution of these resources, and the presence of external actors.

For instance, the conflict over the extraction of oil in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria has been ongoing for decades and has resulted in significant loss of life and property. The conflict has been largely driven by the unequal distribution of oil revenues between the local population and the central government, as well as the environmental degradation caused by oil spills.

#### The Impact of Resource Conflict on Great Power Military Intervention

Resource conflicts can have a significant impact on great power military intervention. The presence of valuable resources can attract external actors who are willing to intervene in the conflict for their own benefit. This can complicate the intervention efforts of great powers, as they may have to navigate competing interests and agendas.

Moreover, resource conflicts can also serve as a justification for external intervention. Great powers may intervene in resource conflicts to protect their economic interests or to prevent the spread of instability and violence. However, such interventions can also be criticized for being motivated by self-interest rather than humanitarian concerns.

In conclusion, resource conflict theory provides valuable insights into the origins, nature, and extent of internal conflicts. It highlights the role of resources in shaping conflicts and the potential impact of resource conflicts on great power military intervention.

## Chapter: Chapter 3: Case Studies of Interventions

### Introduction

In this chapter, we delve into the heart of our study, examining a series of case studies that provide a comprehensive understanding of great power military intervention. These case studies will serve as the backbone of our analysis, providing real-world examples that illustrate the complexities and nuances of military intervention by major global powers.

The case studies will cover a wide range of interventions, from the historical to the contemporary, and from different parts of the world. Each case study will be analyzed in depth, exploring the reasons behind the intervention, the strategies employed, the outcomes achieved, and the lessons learned. 

We will also examine the impact of these interventions on the local populations, the stability of the region, and the global political landscape. This will involve a careful analysis of the economic, political, and social factors that influenced the decision for intervention, as well as the military and diplomatic strategies employed.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the complexities of great power military intervention, and be able to apply this knowledge to future interventions. This chapter will serve as a valuable resource for students, scholars, and policymakers interested in understanding the role of military intervention in global affairs.




### Subsection: 2.2c Political Conflict Theory

Political conflict theory is a crucial aspect of understanding internal conflicts and their origins. It posits that political differences and power struggles can lead to internal conflicts and even external interventions. This theory is particularly relevant in the context of great power military intervention, as political conflicts often serve as a justification for external intervention.

#### The Role of Politics in Internal Conflicts

Politics play a significant role in shaping conflicts within a society. Political differences and power struggles can lead to tensions and conflicts between different groups. This is often the case in multi-ethnic societies, where political power is unevenly distributed among different ethnic groups.

Moreover, political conflicts can also arise from differences in ideology, values, and beliefs. These differences can lead to polarization and radicalization, which can in turn lead to internal conflicts.

#### The Extent of Political Conflict

The extent of political conflict can vary greatly depending on the specific context. In some cases, political conflicts can be localized and limited in scope, while in others, they can escalate into full-blown civil wars. The extent of political conflict is often influenced by a variety of factors, including the nature of the political system, the distribution of political power, and the presence of external actors.

For instance, the political conflict in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s was largely driven by ethnic tensions and power struggles. The conflict escalated into a full-blown civil war, with external actors such as NATO and the European Union intervening to try and resolve the conflict.

#### Political Conflict Theory and Great Power Military Intervention

Political conflict theory is particularly relevant in the context of great power military intervention. Great powers often intervene in internal conflicts to protect their strategic interests or to promote their ideology. This can lead to further escalation of the conflict, as external intervention can be seen as a threat to the sovereignty of the affected country.

Moreover, political conflict theory can also help explain why some internal conflicts are chosen for intervention by great powers, while others are not. The presence of political differences and power struggles can make a conflict more attractive for external intervention, as it provides a justification for intervention.

In conclusion, political conflict theory is a crucial aspect of understanding internal conflicts and their origins. It provides a framework for understanding the role of politics in internal conflicts and the extent to which these conflicts can escalate. It also helps explain the dynamics of great power military intervention in internal conflicts.

### Subsection: 2.3a Role of Doctors

The role of doctors in great power military intervention is a critical aspect that cannot be overlooked. Doctors, as professionals who are trained to heal and save lives, often find themselves in the midst of conflicts and interventions. Their role is multifaceted, encompassing not only their medical expertise but also their ethical responsibilities and the influence of societal and political factors.

#### The Medical Role in Conflict

In conflict situations, doctors are often called upon to provide medical care to the wounded and injured. This role is crucial, as it can help save lives and alleviate suffering. However, the medical role in conflict is not without its challenges. Doctors may face difficulties in accessing the wounded due to the nature of the conflict, and they may also have to deal with limited resources and equipment.

Moreover, doctors may also be caught in the crossfire, making their role even more perilous. In such situations, their primary concern is to provide medical care, but they may also have to navigate the complexities of the conflict, including potential threats to their own safety.

#### The Ethical Dilemmas of Conflict Medicine

The role of doctors in conflict situations also raises ethical dilemmas. For instance, doctors may be faced with the dilemma of providing medical care to all, regardless of their affiliation, or choosing to provide care only to those who are not directly involved in the conflict. This dilemma is often exacerbated by the politicization of medicine, where doctors may be pressured to align with certain political ideologies or agendas.

Furthermore, doctors may also face ethical dilemmas related to the use of certain medical technologies. For example, the use of certain medical technologies, such as lethal injection, has been a subject of ethical debate. This debate is particularly relevant in the context of great power military intervention, where the use of such technologies may be justified on grounds of national security.

#### The Influence of Societal and Political Factors

The role of doctors in conflict is also influenced by societal and political factors. For instance, the social construction of disease, as discussed by Freidson, can influence how doctors perceive and respond to certain medical conditions. This can be particularly relevant in conflict situations, where certain medical conditions may be stigmatized or politicized.

Moreover, the political climate can also influence the role of doctors in conflict. For instance, the use of medical technology, as discussed by Freidson, can have social meaning and be a social activity. This can be particularly relevant in the context of great power military intervention, where the use of certain medical technologies may be politicized.

In conclusion, the role of doctors in great power military intervention is multifaceted and complex. It encompasses not only their medical expertise but also their ethical responsibilities and the influence of societal and political factors. Understanding this role is crucial for a comprehensive study of great power military intervention.

### Subsection: 2.3b Role of Lawyers

The role of lawyers in great power military intervention is a crucial aspect that cannot be overlooked. Lawyers, as professionals who are trained to interpret and apply the law, often find themselves in the midst of conflicts and interventions. Their role is multifaceted, encompassing not only their legal expertise but also their ethical responsibilities and the influence of societal and political factors.

#### The Legal Role in Conflict

In conflict situations, lawyers are often called upon to provide legal advice and representation. This role is crucial, as it can help ensure that the rights of all parties involved are upheld. However, the legal role in conflict is not without its challenges. Lawyers may face difficulties in accessing the relevant legal documents and information due to the nature of the conflict, and they may also have to deal with limited resources and equipment.

Moreover, lawyers may also be caught in the crossfire, making their role even more perilous. In such situations, their primary concern is to provide legal advice and representation, but they may also have to navigate the complexities of the conflict, including potential threats to their own safety.

#### The Ethical Dilemmas of Conflict Law

The role of lawyers in conflict situations also raises ethical dilemmas. For instance, lawyers may be faced with the dilemma of representing clients who are accused of war crimes or other serious violations of international law. This dilemma is often exacerbated by the politicization of law, where lawyers may be pressured to align with certain political ideologies or agendas.

Furthermore, lawyers may also face ethical dilemmas related to the use of certain legal strategies. For example, the use of certain legal tactics, such as delaying tactics or legal technicalities, may be justified on grounds of protecting the rights of their clients, but they may also be seen as trying to manipulate the legal system for their own advantage.

#### The Influence of Societal and Political Factors

The role of lawyers in conflict is also influenced by societal and political factors. For instance, the legal system itself may be influenced by societal values and norms, which can impact the interpretation and application of the law. This can be particularly relevant in conflict situations, where societal values and norms may be under threat.

Moreover, the political climate can also influence the role of lawyers in conflict. For instance, lawyers may be pressured to align with certain political ideologies or agendas, which can impact their ability to provide impartial legal advice and representation. This pressure can be particularly intense in great power military interventions, where the legal system may be used as a tool for political ends.

### Subsection: 2.3c Role of Journalists

The role of journalists in great power military intervention is a critical aspect that cannot be overlooked. Journalists, as professionals who are trained to gather and report information, often find themselves in the midst of conflicts and interventions. Their role is multifaceted, encompassing not only their journalistic expertise but also their ethical responsibilities and the influence of societal and political factors.

#### The Journalistic Role in Conflict

In conflict situations, journalists are often called upon to provide accurate and timely information. This role is crucial, as it can help the public understand the situation and make informed decisions. However, the journalistic role in conflict is not without its challenges. Journalists may face difficulties in accessing the relevant information due to the nature of the conflict, and they may also have to deal with limited resources and equipment.

Moreover, journalists may also be caught in the crossfire, making their role even more perilous. In such situations, their primary concern is to provide accurate and timely information, but they may also have to navigate the complexities of the conflict, including potential threats to their own safety.

#### The Ethical Dilemmas of Conflict Journalism

The role of journalists in conflict situations also raises ethical dilemmas. For instance, journalists may be faced with the dilemma of reporting on sensitive information that could potentially harm the public or the situation. This dilemma is often exacerbated by the politicization of journalism, where journalists may be pressured to align with certain political ideologies or agendas.

Furthermore, journalists may also face ethical dilemmas related to the use of certain journalistic techniques. For example, the use of certain journalistic tactics, such as sensationalism or bias, may be justified on grounds of attracting more viewers or readers, but they may also be seen as exploiting the situation for personal gain.

#### The Influence of Societal and Political Factors

The role of journalists in conflict is also influenced by societal and political factors. For instance, the societal values and norms can influence the type of information that is considered newsworthy and the way it is presented. This can be particularly relevant in conflict situations, where certain aspects of the conflict may be deemed more newsworthy than others due to societal biases.

Moreover, the political climate can also influence the role of journalists in conflict. For instance, journalists may be pressured to align with certain political ideologies or agendas, which can impact their ability to report objectively on the conflict. This pressure can be particularly intense in great power military interventions, where the media can be used as a tool for propaganda or to justify intervention.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the background and big picture of great power military intervention. We have delved into the historical context, the motivations behind such interventions, and the impact they have on both the intervening country and the country being intervened in. We have also examined the various factors that influence these interventions, such as political ideologies, economic interests, and international relations.

We have seen that great power military intervention is a complex and multifaceted issue, with far-reaching implications. It is not a simple matter of one country imposing its will on another, but rather a complex interplay of various factors and interests. We have also learned that these interventions can have both positive and negative consequences, and that their effectiveness and legitimacy are often subject to debate.

As we move forward in this book, we will delve deeper into these issues, examining specific cases of great power military intervention and analyzing their outcomes.

## Chapter: Chapter 3: Theories of Intervention

### Introduction

The study of great power military intervention is a complex and multifaceted field, requiring a deep understanding of various theories and perspectives. In this chapter, we delve into the theoretical underpinnings of intervention, exploring the different schools of thought that have shaped our understanding of this critical aspect of international relations.

We begin by examining the realist perspective, which posits that great powers intervene in the affairs of other states primarily for their own strategic and economic interests. This perspective emphasizes the role of power dynamics and the pursuit of national self-interest in intervention decisions.

Next, we explore the liberal perspective, which emphasizes the role of international norms and institutions in shaping intervention decisions. This perspective suggests that great powers intervene to uphold these norms and institutions, often at the expense of their own interests.

We also delve into the constructivist perspective, which emphasizes the role of ideas and identities in shaping intervention decisions. This perspective suggests that great powers intervene to promote their own ideological agendas and to shape the identities of other states.

Finally, we examine the postmodern perspective, which challenges the traditional theories of intervention and emphasizes the role of discourse and power in shaping our understanding of intervention. This perspective suggests that intervention is not a neutral act, but rather a form of power projection that reinforces existing power structures.

Throughout this chapter, we will draw on a wide range of case studies and examples to illustrate these theories in action. By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the key theories of intervention and be equipped with the tools to critically analyze intervention decisions.




### Subsection: 2.3b Role of Lawyers

Lawyers play a crucial role in great power military intervention, particularly in the legal and political aspects of these interventions. Their role is multifaceted, encompassing not only their legal expertise but also their ethical responsibilities and the influence of societal and political factors.

#### The Legal Role in Conflict

In conflict situations, lawyers are often called upon to provide legal advice and representation. This role is crucial, as it can help ensure that the legal rights and obligations of all parties involved are upheld. However, the legal role in conflict is not without its challenges. Lawyers may face difficulties in accessing the relevant information due to the nature of the conflict, and they may also have to deal with limited resources and time constraints.

Moreover, lawyers may also be caught in the crossfire, both literally and figuratively. They may face physical danger in conflict zones, and their legal advice may be challenged or even ignored by those in power. This can create ethical dilemmas for lawyers, as they may be faced with the choice of whether to continue providing legal advice in a situation where it may not be heeded.

#### The Ethical Dilemmas of Conflict Law

The role of lawyers in conflict situations also raises ethical dilemmas. For instance, lawyers may be faced with the dilemma of representing clients who are accused of war crimes or other serious violations of international law. This can create a conflict of interest, as lawyers are ethically obligated to represent their clients to the best of their ability, even if they personally disagree with their clients' actions.

Furthermore, lawyers may also face ethical dilemmas related to the use of certain legal strategies or arguments. For example, lawyers may be faced with the dilemma of whether to use legal arguments that they believe are weak or even unethical, but which may be the only viable option to protect their clients' rights.

In conclusion, the role of lawyers in great power military intervention is complex and multifaceted. They are not only legal experts, but also ethical decision-makers, navigating the complexities of conflict and the law.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have set the stage for a comprehensive study of great power military intervention. We have explored the background and big picture of this complex topic, laying the groundwork for a deeper dive into the specifics of various interventions in the subsequent chapters. The chapter has provided a broad overview of the subject matter, highlighting the importance of understanding the historical, political, and social contexts in which these interventions take place.

We have also underscored the need for a nuanced and critical analysis of these interventions, taking into account the diverse perspectives and interests of the various stakeholders involved. This includes not only the intervening powers, but also the target countries, the international community, and the affected populations. 

In the following chapters, we will delve deeper into the specifics of these interventions, examining their motivations, methods, and outcomes. We will also explore the ethical, legal, and strategic implications of these interventions, and their impact on global politics and security.

### Subsection: 2.3c Role of Journalists

Journalists play a crucial role in great power military intervention, particularly in the dissemination of information and the shaping of public opinion. Their role is multifaceted, encompassing not only their journalistic responsibilities but also their ethical considerations and the influence of societal and political factors.

#### The Role of Journalists in Conflict

In conflict situations, journalists are often the only source of information for the public. Their role is to report on the events as they unfold, providing a neutral and objective account of the situation. However, this role can be challenging, as journalists may face difficulties in accessing the relevant information due to the nature of the conflict. They may also have to deal with limited resources and time constraints.

Moreover, journalists may also be caught in the crossfire, both literally and figuratively. They may face physical danger in conflict zones, and their reporting may be subject to censorship or manipulation by those in power. This can create ethical dilemmas for journalists, as they may be faced with the choice of whether to continue reporting in a situation where their safety is at risk.

#### The Ethical Dilemmas of Conflict Journalism

The role of journalists in conflict situations also raises ethical dilemmas. For instance, journalists may be faced with the dilemma of reporting on sensitive information that could potentially harm the public interest. This can create a conflict of interest, as journalists are ethically obligated to report the truth, even if it may not be in the best interest of the public.

Furthermore, journalists may also face ethical dilemmas related to the use of certain journalistic techniques or sources. For example, journalists may be faced with the dilemma of whether to use anonymous sources, which can provide valuable information but may also raise questions about the credibility of the information.

In conclusion, the role of journalists in great power military intervention is crucial, as they are responsible for providing accurate and unbiased information to the public. However, this role is not without its challenges and ethical dilemmas, which journalists must navigate with integrity and professionalism.

## Chapter 3: Great Power Military Intervention: A Comprehensive Study




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the complex and often controversial topic of external intervention and the use of force. This is a crucial aspect of international relations, as it involves the involvement of great powers in the affairs of other nations. The use of force, whether it be military intervention or economic sanctions, has been a contentious issue throughout history, with varying opinions on its effectiveness and ethical implications.

We will begin by examining the concept of external intervention and its various forms, including military intervention, economic sanctions, and diplomatic intervention. We will also explore the motivations behind external intervention, such as protecting national interests, promoting stability, and advancing ideological goals.

Next, we will delve into the use of force in external intervention. This includes a discussion on the different types of force, such as direct military intervention and indirect support for rebel groups. We will also examine the ethical considerations surrounding the use of force, including the principles of just war and the responsibility to protect.

Throughout this chapter, we will also explore case studies of external intervention and the use of force, providing a comprehensive analysis of their outcomes and implications. This will include examining the effectiveness of external intervention in achieving its intended goals, as well as the unintended consequences that often arise from such actions.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of external intervention and the use of force, and its role in international relations. This will provide a solid foundation for the subsequent chapters, which will delve deeper into the specific types of external intervention and their impact on global politics.




### Subsection: 3.1a Diplomatic Intervention

Diplomatic intervention is a crucial aspect of external intervention and the use of force. It involves the use of diplomatic channels to influence the actions of other states. Diplomatic intervention can take various forms, including mediation, negotiation, and sanctions. In this section, we will explore the role of diplomatic intervention in external intervention and its effectiveness in achieving desired outcomes.

#### The Role of Diplomatic Intervention in External Intervention

Diplomatic intervention plays a crucial role in external intervention, particularly in situations where military intervention is not feasible or desirable. It allows great powers to influence the actions of other states without the need for direct military intervention. This can be particularly useful in situations where the great power has economic or political interests at stake, and military intervention may not be in their best interests.

One example of diplomatic intervention is the Triple Intervention, which took place in the late 19th century. In this case, Russia, France, and Germany intervened in the affairs of Japan and China to protect their economic and political interests. Russia, in particular, had the most to gain from the intervention, as it sought to consolidate its presence in the Far East. France and Germany also joined the intervention to protect their own interests and to avoid being diplomatically isolated.

#### The Effectiveness of Diplomatic Intervention

The effectiveness of diplomatic intervention depends on various factors, including the willingness of the parties involved to engage in diplomatic efforts, the skill and expertise of the diplomats, and the overall political climate. In some cases, diplomatic intervention can be highly effective, leading to mutually beneficial agreements and resolutions. However, in other cases, it may not be as effective, particularly in situations where there are deep-rooted conflicts and mistrust between the parties involved.

One of the challenges of diplomatic intervention is the potential for unintended consequences. For example, in the Triple Intervention, while Russia may have achieved its goal of consolidating its presence in the Far East, it also strained its relations with Japan, leading to future conflicts between the two powers.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, diplomatic intervention is a crucial aspect of external intervention and the use of force. It allows great powers to influence the actions of other states without the need for direct military intervention. However, its effectiveness depends on various factors, and it is essential for diplomats to carefully consider the potential consequences of their actions. In the next section, we will explore another form of external intervention - economic sanctions.





### Subsection: 3.1b Economic Intervention

Economic intervention is another crucial aspect of external intervention and the use of force. It involves the use of economic tools and policies to influence the actions of other states. Economic intervention can take various forms, including economic sanctions, trade agreements, and financial aid. In this section, we will explore the role of economic intervention in external intervention and its effectiveness in achieving desired outcomes.

#### The Role of Economic Intervention in External Intervention

Economic intervention plays a crucial role in external intervention, particularly in situations where diplomatic intervention has been unsuccessful or insufficient. It allows great powers to exert pressure on other states through economic means, without the need for direct military intervention. This can be particularly useful in situations where the great power has economic interests at stake, and military intervention may not be in their best interests.

One example of economic intervention is the use of economic sanctions. These are measures taken by one state to restrict economic relations with another state in order to achieve a desired outcome. Sanctions can take various forms, including trade restrictions, travel bans, and financial sanctions. They are often used as a non-military means of pressuring a state to change its behavior or policies.

#### The Effectiveness of Economic Intervention

The effectiveness of economic intervention depends on various factors, including the nature of the economic relationship between the states involved, the specific form of intervention used, and the willingness of the target state to comply. In some cases, economic intervention can be highly effective, leading to significant changes in the target state's behavior. However, in other cases, it may not be as effective, particularly if the target state is able to mitigate the effects of the intervention through other means.

One example of the effectiveness of economic intervention is the use of economic sanctions against South Africa during the apartheid era. These sanctions, which were imposed by various countries and international organizations, had a significant impact on the South African economy and contributed to the eventual end of apartheid.

On the other hand, economic intervention can also be ineffective if the target state is able to adapt to the sanctions or if the sanctions are not sufficiently severe. For example, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the United States imposed a naval quarantine on Cuba, but this was not enough to prevent the Soviet Union from delivering nuclear missiles to the island.

In conclusion, economic intervention is a crucial aspect of external intervention and the use of force. It allows great powers to exert pressure on other states without the need for direct military intervention, and can be highly effective in achieving desired outcomes. However, its effectiveness depends on various factors and can be influenced by the actions of the target state.





### Subsection: 3.1c Military Intervention

Military intervention is the use of military force by one state to intervene in the affairs of another state. It is often used as a last resort when diplomatic and economic interventions have been unsuccessful or insufficient. Military intervention can take various forms, including direct military intervention, indirect military intervention, and humanitarian intervention. In this section, we will explore the role of military intervention in external intervention and its effectiveness in achieving desired outcomes.

#### The Role of Military Intervention in External Intervention

Military intervention plays a crucial role in external intervention, particularly in situations where the great power has a vital interest at stake and where diplomatic and economic interventions have been unsuccessful or insufficient. It allows the great power to directly influence the actions of another state through military means. This can be particularly useful in situations where the great power has strategic or security interests at stake, and where military intervention may be necessary to protect those interests.

One example of military intervention is direct military intervention, where the great power sends its own military forces into the territory of another state. This can take various forms, including invasion, occupation, and intervention in ongoing conflicts. Direct military intervention is often used as a last resort, when all other means of intervention have been exhausted.

#### The Effectiveness of Military Intervention

The effectiveness of military intervention depends on various factors, including the nature of the military intervention, the capabilities of the intervening state, and the willingness of the target state to comply. In some cases, military intervention can be highly effective, leading to significant changes in the target state's behavior. However, in other cases, it may not be as effective, particularly if the target state is able to resist the intervention through various means.

One example of the effectiveness of military intervention is the intervention in Libya in 2011. The intervention, led by the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, was aimed at protecting civilians from the oppressive regime of Muammar Gaddafi. The intervention was successful in achieving its objective, leading to the downfall of Gaddafi's regime and the establishment of a new government.

However, not all military interventions are as successful. The intervention in Iraq in 2003, for example, was met with significant resistance from Iraqi forces and resulted in a prolonged and costly conflict. The intervention ultimately led to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime, but it also resulted in significant human and financial costs.

In conclusion, military intervention is a crucial aspect of external intervention and the use of force. It allows great powers to directly influence the actions of other states and can be an effective means of achieving desired outcomes. However, it is not without its risks and limitations, and its effectiveness depends on various factors. 





### Subsection: 3.2a Northern Iraq and Somalia

#### The Role of External Intervention in Northern Iraq

The Kurdish region of Iraq has been a focal point of external intervention since the 1990s. The Kurdish people, who make up a significant portion of the population in this region, have faced discrimination and persecution from the Iraqi government. This has led to a long-standing conflict between the Kurds and the Iraqi state, which has resulted in the Kurdish region becoming a hotbed of insurgent activity.

External intervention in Northern Iraq has been driven by a combination of strategic and humanitarian concerns. The Kurdish region is home to significant oil reserves, making it a strategically important area for the global energy market. The United States, in particular, has been heavily involved in the region due to its interest in securing a stable supply of oil. However, the humanitarian situation in the Kurdish region has also been a major factor in external intervention. The Kurdish people have faced severe human rights abuses and have been displaced from their homes due to the ongoing conflict. This has led to a humanitarian crisis, which has been a major concern for the international community.

#### The Role of External Intervention in Somalia

Somalia has been a recipient of external intervention for decades, primarily due to its strategic location and the presence of piracy in the region. The country has been embroiled in a civil war since 1991, which has resulted in a power vacuum and a lack of central authority. This has led to the rise of various armed groups, including terrorist organizations, which have used Somalia as a base for their operations.

External intervention in Somalia has been driven by a combination of strategic and humanitarian concerns. The country's strategic location, bordering the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean, makes it a crucial area for global trade and security. The presence of piracy in the region has also been a major concern for the international community, as it poses a threat to global trade. Additionally, the humanitarian situation in Somalia has been a major factor in external intervention. The country has faced severe food shortages and a lack of basic services, which has resulted in a humanitarian crisis.

#### The Effectiveness of External Intervention in Northern Iraq and Somalia

The effectiveness of external intervention in Northern Iraq and Somalia has been mixed. In Northern Iraq, the United States has been able to achieve some success in stabilizing the region and reducing insurgent activity. However, the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in the Kurdish region have not been fully resolved, and the region continues to face challenges.

In Somalia, external intervention has been less successful. The country continues to face significant security challenges, and the humanitarian situation has not improved significantly. The presence of terrorist organizations in the country has also posed a threat to regional and global security. However, external intervention has helped to reduce piracy in the region and has provided some humanitarian aid to the population.

In conclusion, external intervention has played a significant role in both Northern Iraq and Somalia. While it has helped to address some of the challenges faced by these regions, there is still much work to be done to achieve long-term stability and improve the lives of the people living in these areas. 





### Subsection: 3.2b Rwanda and Darfur

#### The Role of External Intervention in Rwanda

The small African nation of Rwanda has been a focal point of external intervention due to its history of ethnic conflict and genocide. The country is home to a diverse population, with the majority being Hutu, followed by Tutsi and Twa. The relationship between these ethnic groups has been marked by tension and violence, with the Tutsi minority often facing discrimination and persecution from the Hutu majority.

External intervention in Rwanda has been driven by a combination of strategic and humanitarian concerns. The country is home to a significant population of Tutsi refugees, who have fled to neighboring countries following the Rwandan genocide in 1994. These refugees have been living in crowded and unsanitary conditions, facing high levels of disease and mortality. The international community has been concerned about the humanitarian crisis facing these refugees and has been providing aid and support to address their needs.

#### The Role of External Intervention in Darfur

The Darfur region of Sudan has also been a recipient of external intervention due to its ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis. The region is home to a diverse population, with the majority being Arab and African, and has been facing ethnic and political tensions for decades. The conflict in Darfur has resulted in the displacement of millions of people and has led to a humanitarian crisis, with many facing food insecurity and disease.

External intervention in Darfur has been driven by a combination of strategic and humanitarian concerns. The region is home to significant oil reserves, making it a strategically important area for the global energy market. The United States, in particular, has been heavily involved in the region due to its interest in securing a stable supply of oil. However, the humanitarian situation in Darfur has also been a major concern for the international community, with the United Nations and various aid organizations providing aid and support to address the needs of the displaced population.

### Conclusion

External intervention in Rwanda and Darfur has been driven by a combination of strategic and humanitarian concerns. The international community has been involved in these regions to address the ongoing conflicts and humanitarian crises, providing aid and support to address the needs of the affected populations. However, the effectiveness of external intervention in these regions has been a topic of debate, with some arguing that it has been insufficient and others arguing that it has been counterproductive. Further research and analysis are needed to fully understand the impact of external intervention in these regions and to inform future interventions.


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the complex and often controversial topic of external intervention and the use of force by great powers. We have examined the various factors that influence a great power's decision to intervene in the affairs of another state, including economic, political, and humanitarian considerations. We have also discussed the different forms of intervention, ranging from diplomatic and economic pressure to military intervention, and the potential consequences of each.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is that external intervention is a multifaceted and nuanced issue that requires careful consideration and analysis. It is not a one-size-fits-all solution and must be approached with caution and a deep understanding of the underlying dynamics at play. As we have seen, intervention can have both positive and negative outcomes, and it is crucial for policymakers and scholars to carefully evaluate the potential risks and benefits before taking action.

Furthermore, we have also discussed the role of international law and organizations in regulating and overseeing external intervention. While these institutions have made significant progress in promoting accountability and preventing abuses of power, there are still many challenges and limitations that need to be addressed. Moving forward, it is essential for the international community to continue to work towards a more comprehensive and effective framework for regulating external intervention.

In conclusion, external intervention and the use of force by great powers is a complex and ever-evolving topic that requires a deep understanding of the underlying dynamics and careful consideration. As we continue to navigate the challenges of the 21st century, it is crucial for policymakers and scholars to approach this issue with caution and a commitment to promoting justice and stability.

## Chapter 4: Great Power Intervention in the Middle East:




### Subsection: 3.2c Balkans

The Balkans, a region in southeastern Europe, has been a focal point of external intervention due to its complex ethnic and political dynamics. The region is home to a diverse population, with the majority being Orthodox Christians, followed by Catholics and Muslims. The relationship between these ethnic groups has been marked by tension and violence, with the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s being a major conflict that resulted in the breakup of Yugoslavia.

External intervention in the Balkans has been driven by a combination of strategic and humanitarian concerns. The region is home to significant natural resources, including oil and gas, making it a strategically important area for the global economy. The United States, in particular, has been heavily involved in the region due to its interest in securing a stable supply of these resources. However, the humanitarian situation in the Balkans has also been a major concern for the international community, with the region facing high levels of poverty and inequality.

#### The Role of External Intervention in the Balkans

External intervention in the Balkans has been a complex and ongoing process. The region has been a focal point for intervention due to its history of ethnic conflict and political instability. The breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s resulted in a series of wars and conflicts, which led to the intervention of external powers.

The United States, in particular, played a significant role in the Balkans during the 1990s. The US led a NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1995, which aimed to protect the Bosnian Muslims from ethnic cleansing by the Bosnian Serbs. This intervention was part of a larger strategy to promote stability and democracy in the region.

However, the US intervention in the Balkans has been criticized for its limited effectiveness. The intervention failed to address the underlying ethnic and political tensions in the region, and the conflicts continued to flare up in the years following the intervention. Additionally, the US intervention was also criticized for its lack of a clear exit strategy, leading to a prolonged presence in the region.

Despite these criticisms, external intervention in the Balkans has played a crucial role in shaping the region's history. The intervention has helped to address some of the humanitarian concerns in the region, but it has also raised questions about the effectiveness and sustainability of external intervention. As the Balkans continue to face challenges, the role of external intervention will remain a topic of debate and discussion.


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the complex and often controversial topic of external intervention and the use of force. We have examined the various factors that influence a great power's decision to intervene in the affairs of another state, including economic, political, and humanitarian considerations. We have also discussed the different forms of intervention, from diplomatic efforts to military operations, and the potential consequences of each.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is the importance of understanding the motivations and goals of a great power when it comes to intervention. By examining the historical context and current circumstances, we can gain a better understanding of why a great power chooses to intervene and what it hopes to achieve. This understanding is crucial in evaluating the effectiveness and impact of intervention efforts.

Another important aspect to consider is the role of international law and norms in regulating external intervention. While these rules and guidelines are not always followed, they provide a framework for evaluating the legality and legitimacy of intervention. It is essential for great powers to consider these legal and ethical implications when deciding to intervene in the affairs of another state.

Overall, this chapter has highlighted the complex and multifaceted nature of external intervention and the use of force. It is a topic that requires careful analysis and consideration, as the consequences of intervention can have far-reaching effects on both the intervening state and the state being intervened in.

The study of great power military intervention is a complex and multifaceted field, requiring a deep understanding of various political, economic, and social factors. In this chapter, we delve into the theoretical underpinnings of intervention, exploring the different perspectives and models that help us understand why and how great powers intervene in the affairs of other nations.

We begin by examining the concept of intervention itself, exploring its historical context and evolution. We then move on to discuss the various theories of intervention, including the realist, liberal, and constructivist perspectives. Each of these theories offers a unique lens through which to view intervention, highlighting different aspects of the process and its outcomes.

The realist perspective, for instance, emphasizes the role of power and security in intervention decisions. It posits that great powers intervene to protect their own interests, often using military force to achieve their objectives. The liberal perspective, on the other hand, emphasizes the role of international norms and institutions in intervention decisions. It argues that great powers intervene to uphold these norms and institutions, often using non-military means to achieve their objectives.

The constructivist perspective, meanwhile, emphasizes the role of ideas and identities in intervention decisions. It argues that great powers intervene to shape the identities of other nations, often using soft power to achieve their objectives.

Throughout this chapter, we will explore these theories in depth, examining their strengths and weaknesses, and discussing their implications for the study of great power military intervention.

### Subsection: 5.2a Definition and Importance

Preventive diplomacy is a critical aspect of international relations, particularly in the context of great power military intervention. It is a diplomatic strategy aimed at preventing conflicts from escalating into full-blown wars. This strategy involves early detection of potential conflicts, timely intervention, and the use of diplomatic tools to de-escalate tensions and prevent violence.

The importance of preventive diplomacy cannot be overstated. It is a cost-effective and non-violent means of managing conflicts. By intervening early, potential conflicts can be addressed before they escalate into full-blown wars, which are often costly and destructive. Preventive diplomacy also helps to maintain stability and prevent the spread of violence and instability.

Moreover, preventive diplomacy is a key component of the responsibility to protect (R2P). As discussed in the previous chapter, R2P is a principle that allows for intervention in a state's internal affairs to protect its citizens from mass atrocities. Preventive diplomacy plays a crucial role in implementing R2P, as it involves early detection of potential conflicts and timely intervention to prevent mass atrocities.

However, preventive diplomacy is not without its challenges. It requires a robust early warning system, which can be difficult to establish and maintain. It also requires a willingness and ability to intervene early, which can be hindered by various factors, including political considerations and resource constraints.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the concept of preventive diplomacy, exploring its various aspects, challenges, and case studies. We will also examine the role of preventive diplomacy in the context of great power military intervention, particularly in the case of the Gulf War.




#### 5.2b Strategies and Techniques

Preventive diplomacy is a complex and multifaceted strategy that requires a variety of tools and techniques. These tools and techniques are designed to detect potential conflicts early, intervene timely, and de-escalate tensions to prevent violence. In this section, we will explore some of the key strategies and techniques used in preventive diplomacy.

##### Early Warning Systems

One of the most critical tools in preventive diplomacy is an early warning system. This system is designed to detect potential conflicts early, before they escalate into full-blown wars. Early warning systems can include a variety of tools, such as intelligence gathering, monitoring of media and social media, and analysis of historical data.

Intelligence gathering involves collecting information about potential conflicts from a variety of sources, including government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and local communities. This information can provide valuable insights into potential conflicts and help identify areas of concern.

Monitoring of media and social media can also provide valuable information about potential conflicts. Social media platforms, in particular, can provide real-time information about local events and sentiments, which can be crucial in detecting potential conflicts early.

Analysis of historical data can also be a valuable tool in early warning systems. By analyzing historical data, diplomats can identify patterns and trends that may indicate potential conflicts. This can help them anticipate future conflicts and intervene early.

##### Timely Intervention

Once a potential conflict has been detected, timely intervention is crucial in preventing it from escalating into a full-blown war. This can involve diplomatic efforts, such as mediation and negotiation, as well as military interventions, such as peacekeeping operations.

Diplomatic efforts involve engaging with all parties involved in the conflict to find a peaceful resolution. This can include mediation, where a neutral third party helps the parties reach a compromise, and negotiation, where the parties themselves work towards a solution.

Military interventions, on the other hand, involve the use of military forces to maintain stability and prevent violence. This can include peacekeeping operations, where military forces are deployed to monitor and maintain peace, or more aggressive interventions, such as airstrikes or ground operations.

##### De-escalation Techniques

In addition to early warning systems and timely intervention, de-escalation techniques are also crucial in preventive diplomacy. These techniques are designed to reduce tensions and prevent conflicts from escalating.

One such technique is confidence-building measures, which involve actions taken to build trust between conflicting parties. This can include joint military exercises, economic cooperation, and cultural exchanges.

Another technique is conflict resolution, which involves finding a peaceful resolution to a conflict. This can include negotiation, mediation, or arbitration.

In conclusion, preventive diplomacy is a complex and multifaceted strategy that requires a variety of tools and techniques. These include early warning systems, timely intervention, and de-escalation techniques. By utilizing these strategies and techniques, diplomats can prevent conflicts from escalating into full-blown wars and maintain stability in the international community.





#### 5.2c Case Studies

To further illustrate the strategies and techniques used in preventive diplomacy, let's examine some case studies.

##### Case Study 1: The Cuban Missile Crisis

The Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 is a classic example of preventive diplomacy. The United States and the Soviet Union were on the brink of nuclear war when it was discovered that the Soviets had installed nuclear missiles in Cuba. The US responded with a naval blockade of Cuba, and both sides engaged in intense diplomatic efforts to prevent a full-blown war.

The US used an early warning system to detect the presence of the missiles, which involved intelligence gathering and monitoring of media and social media. This early detection allowed them to intervene timely and prevent a potential conflict from escalating into a nuclear war.

The US also engaged in diplomatic efforts, such as negotiations and mediation, to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. This involved engaging with both the Soviet Union and Cuba to find a mutually agreeable solution.

##### Case Study 2: The Rwanda Genocide

The Rwanda Genocide in 1994 is another example of preventive diplomacy. The genocide was a result of long-standing ethnic tensions between the Hutu and Tutsi populations in Rwanda. The US and other international actors failed to intervene in time, and the genocide resulted in the death of over 800,000 people.

The US had an early warning system in place, which involved intelligence gathering and monitoring of media and social media. However, the system failed to detect the impending genocide, highlighting the importance of effective early warning systems.

The US also failed to intervene timely, which could have prevented the genocide from occurring. This highlights the importance of timely intervention in preventive diplomacy.

##### Conclusion

These case studies demonstrate the importance of early warning systems, timely intervention, and diplomatic efforts in preventive diplomacy. They also highlight the challenges and limitations of preventive diplomacy, such as the failure of early warning systems and the difficulty of intervening in time. These challenges underscore the need for continuous improvement and adaptation of preventive diplomacy strategies and techniques.

# Great Power Military Intervention: A Comprehensive Study

## Chapter 8: Great Power Military Intervention and International Relations




### Introduction

The use of military intervention by great powers has been a topic of great interest and debate among scholars and policymakers alike. It is a complex and multifaceted issue that involves ethical considerations, political implications, and strategic calculations. In this chapter, we will delve into the ethics of intervention, exploring the moral and ethical dimensions of great power military intervention.

The ethics of intervention is a critical aspect of international relations. It involves the examination of the moral principles and values that guide the decision-making process of great powers when they intervene in the affairs of other states. This chapter will explore the various ethical frameworks and principles that have been used to justify or condemn intervention, such as the responsibility to protect, the right to intervene, and the principle of non-intervention.

We will also examine the ethical implications of different types of intervention, including humanitarian interventions, regime change interventions, and interventions aimed at promoting stability or protecting strategic interests. We will discuss the ethical considerations that guide the decision to intervene, the methods and means of intervention, and the consequences of intervention.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive study of the ethics of intervention, offering a nuanced and balanced analysis of the complex ethical issues involved in great power military intervention. It will draw on a wide range of sources, including historical examples, theoretical frameworks, and contemporary case studies, to provide a comprehensive and insightful exploration of this important topic.




### Section: 8.1 Defining Ethical Intervention:

#### 8.1a Humanitarian Intervention

Humanitarian intervention is a form of intervention that is aimed at protecting and saving the lives of people who are facing immediate threats to their safety and well-being. This can include interventions to prevent genocide, ethnic cleansing, or other mass human rights violations. The concept of humanitarian intervention is rooted in the principles of humanitarianism, which emphasize the importance of protecting and promoting human rights and well-being.

The concept of humanitarian intervention is not without its challenges and controversies. One of the main challenges is determining when and how to intervene. This is often a complex and difficult decision, as it requires balancing the potential benefits of intervention (such as saving lives) with the potential costs (such as the risk of harm to intervening forces or the potential for unintended consequences).

There are several ethical frameworks that can be used to guide the decision to intervene. One of the most commonly used frameworks is the responsibility to protect (R2P), which emphasizes the responsibility of the international community to protect populations from mass atrocities. This framework was used to justify intervention in Libya in 2011, where the international community intervened to protect civilians from violence by the Libyan government.

Another ethical framework that can be used to guide humanitarian intervention is the right to intervene. This framework emphasizes the right of states to intervene in the affairs of other states when there is a clear and pressing need to do so. This right is often based on the principle of self-defense, which allows states to intervene when they are directly threatened.

However, there are also ethical considerations that can limit the right to intervene. One of these is the principle of non-intervention, which emphasizes the importance of respecting the sovereignty and independence of other states. This principle can be used to justify non-intervention in situations where there is no clear and pressing need to intervene.

In addition to these ethical frameworks, there are also practical considerations that can influence the decision to intervene. These include the availability of resources and the willingness of other states to intervene. For example, in the case of the Syrian Civil War, the international community was hesitant to intervene due to concerns about the potential costs and risks associated with intervention.

In conclusion, humanitarian intervention is a complex and controversial topic that requires careful consideration of ethical and practical factors. While there is no single ethical framework that can guide all interventions, it is important for policymakers and scholars to continue exploring and debating these issues in order to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the ethics of intervention.





### Section: 8.1 Defining Ethical Intervention:

#### 8.1b Just War Theory

Just war theory is a philosophical framework that provides a set of ethical principles for evaluating the morality of war. It is based on the idea that war is a morally complex phenomenon that requires careful consideration and justification. Just war theory is not a set of rules or laws, but rather a set of principles that guide our moral reasoning about war.

The origins of just war theory can be traced back to ancient Greece and Rome, where philosophers such as Aristotle and Cicero developed the concept of a "just war." In ancient Rome, a just cause for war might include the necessity of repelling an invasion, or retaliation for pillaging or a breach of treaty. War was always potentially "nefas" ("wrong, forbidden"), and risked religious pollution and divine disfavor. A "just war" ("bellum iustum") thus required a ritualized declaration by the fetial priests.

In the Christian tradition, the Just War theory was further developed by Saint Augustine, who argued that individuals should not resort immediately to violence, but God has given the sword to government for a good reason (based upon Romans 13:4). This idea was further developed by Thomas Aquinas, who argued that a just war must be declared by a legitimate authority, have a just cause, and be waged with right intention.

Just war theory has been used to guide the decision to intervene in conflicts around the world. For example, in the case of the War of the Realms, just war theory was used to justify the intervention of the Allies against the Axis powers. The Allies argued that they had a just cause (to protect their own security and the security of other nations), that they were acting with right intention (to uphold the principles of democracy and human rights), and that they were doing so with the approval of a legitimate authority (the United Nations).

However, just war theory also recognizes that war is a morally complex phenomenon that often involves difficult and controversial decisions. As such, it is important to approach the decision to intervene with caution and careful consideration. This is especially true in cases where the decision to intervene involves the use of military force, which can have serious and potentially harmful consequences.

In conclusion, just war theory provides a valuable framework for evaluating the morality of intervention. It emphasizes the importance of careful consideration and justification, and recognizes the complexity and potential harm of war. As such, it is an important tool for policymakers and military leaders when making decisions about intervention.





### Subsection: 8.1c Responsibility to Protect

The Responsibility to Protect (R2P) is a principle that was first introduced in 2005 at the United Nations World Summit. It is a concept that emphasizes the responsibility of states to protect their citizens from mass atrocities, such as genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. The principle is based on the idea that every individual has a right to protection from such crimes, and that this responsibility falls primarily on the state in which the crimes are occurring.

The R2P principle is composed of three pillars, as articulated in the 2009 Report of the Secretary-General on the issue. These pillars are:

1. The responsibility of states to protect their citizens from mass atrocities.
2. The responsibility of the international community to assist states in meeting their responsibility to protect.
3. The responsibility of the international community to take collective action, in accordance with the UN Charter, when a state is unable or unwilling to protect its citizens from mass atrocities.

The R2P principle is not a new concept, but rather a reaffirmation of existing international law and norms. It is based on the idea that every individual has a right to protection from mass atrocities, and that this responsibility falls primarily on the state in which the crimes are occurring. However, when a state is unable or unwilling to protect its citizens, the international community has a responsibility to step in and protect those citizens.

The R2P principle has been used to justify interventions in conflicts around the world, such as the intervention in Libya in 2011. In this case, the international community, led by the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, intervened to protect civilians from mass atrocities committed by the regime of Muammar Gaddafi. The intervention was justified under the R2P principle, as the Libyan government was unable or unwilling to protect its citizens from these crimes.

However, the use of the R2P principle has been controversial, with some arguing that it is a form of neo-colonialism and others arguing that it is a necessary tool for protecting human rights. The principle has also been criticized for its lack of clear guidelines and mechanisms for implementation, as well as for its potential for abuse by powerful states.

Despite these criticisms, the R2P principle remains an important tool for addressing mass atrocities and promoting human rights. It is a reminder that the responsibility to protect individuals from mass atrocities falls not only on the state in which these crimes are occurring, but also on the international community as a whole. 





### Subsection: 8.2a Sovereignty vs. Human Rights

The concept of sovereignty has been a fundamental principle in international law, granting states the right to exercise control over their territory and people. However, the idea of sovereignty has been challenged by the principle of human rights, which recognizes the inherent dignity and rights of all individuals, regardless of their nationality. This has led to ethical dilemmas in intervention, as great powers often face the decision of whether to respect a state's sovereignty or uphold human rights.

#### Sovereignty

Sovereignty, as defined by the "de jure" and "de facto" concepts, refers to the legal and practical control of a state over its territory and people. "De jure" sovereignty is the expressed and institutionally recognized right to exercise control, while "de facto" sovereignty is the actual control exercised in practice. The concept of sovereignty is closely tied to the idea of statehood, as it is often seen as a prerequisite for a state to exist.

However, the concept of sovereignty has been challenged by the principle of human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations in 1948, recognizes the inherent dignity and rights of all individuals, regardless of their nationality. This has led to the idea that a state's sovereignty is not absolute and can be limited by the international community's responsibility to protect human rights.

#### Human Rights

The principle of human rights recognizes the inherent dignity and rights of all individuals, regardless of their nationality. This includes the right to life, liberty, and security of person, as well as the right to a fair trial and due process. The principle of human rights is based on the idea that these rights are universal and inalienable, meaning they cannot be taken away or limited by any state.

However, the principle of human rights has also been challenged by the concept of sovereignty. States often argue that their sovereignty gives them the right to determine how to protect their citizens, and that outside intervention is a violation of their sovereignty. This has led to ethical dilemmas in intervention, as great powers often face the decision of whether to respect a state's sovereignty or uphold human rights.

#### Ethical Dilemmas in Intervention

The ethical dilemma of sovereignty vs. human rights is a complex and ongoing debate in international law. On one hand, respecting a state's sovereignty can be seen as upholding the principle of non-intervention and respecting a state's right to self-determination. On the other hand, upholding human rights can be seen as a moral obligation to protect individuals from abuse and violence.

In recent years, the concept of "responsibility to protect" (R2P) has emerged as a way to balance these two principles. R2P recognizes that a state's sovereignty is not absolute and can be limited by the international community's responsibility to protect human rights. This concept has been used to justify interventions in cases of mass atrocities, such as the intervention in Libya in 2011.

However, the use of R2P has also been criticized for being selective and unevenly applied. Some argue that it is used to justify interventions in cases where it serves the interests of great powers, while other cases of human rights abuses are ignored. This raises questions about the ethical consistency and legitimacy of R2P as a principle of intervention.

In conclusion, the ethical dilemma of sovereignty vs. human rights is a complex and ongoing debate in intervention. Great powers face difficult decisions when balancing these two principles, and the concept of R2P has emerged as a way to navigate this dilemma. However, the application of R2P has also raised questions about its legitimacy and consistency. As the international community continues to grapple with these ethical dilemmas, it is important to consider the long-term implications and consequences of intervention for both states and individuals.





### Subsection: 8.2b Selectivity of Intervention

The selectivity of intervention refers to the decision of great powers to intervene in certain conflicts or situations, while ignoring others. This decision is often based on a variety of factors, including strategic interests, economic considerations, and humanitarian concerns. However, the selectivity of intervention has raised ethical dilemmas, as it can be seen as a form of discrimination or favoritism.

#### Selectivity of Intervention

The selectivity of intervention is a complex issue that involves a careful balancing of various factors. Great powers often intervene in conflicts that directly affect their strategic interests or economic concerns. For example, the United States has historically intervened in Latin America to protect its economic interests and prevent the spread of communism. Similarly, Russia has intervened in conflicts in its neighboring countries, such as Ukraine and Georgia, to protect its strategic interests.

However, the selectivity of intervention can also be seen as a form of discrimination or favoritism. Great powers often intervene in conflicts that affect their strategic interests or economic concerns, while ignoring conflicts that do not directly affect them. This can be seen as a violation of the principle of human rights, as it prioritizes the interests of certain groups or countries over others.

#### Ethical Dilemmas

The selectivity of intervention raises ethical dilemmas, as it can be seen as a form of discrimination or favoritism. On one hand, great powers have a responsibility to protect their strategic interests and economic concerns. On the other hand, they also have a responsibility to uphold human rights and protect all individuals, regardless of their nationality. The selectivity of intervention can be seen as a violation of this responsibility, as it prioritizes certain groups or countries over others.

Furthermore, the selectivity of intervention can also be seen as a violation of the principle of non-intervention. The principle of non-intervention recognizes the sovereignty of states and prohibits external interference in their internal affairs. By intervening in certain conflicts while ignoring others, great powers can be seen as violating this principle.

#### Conclusion

The selectivity of intervention is a complex issue that raises ethical dilemmas. Great powers must carefully balance their strategic interests, economic concerns, and humanitarian concerns when deciding to intervene in conflicts. However, the selectivity of intervention can also be seen as a form of discrimination or favoritism, and can be seen as a violation of the principles of human rights, non-intervention, and sovereignty. As such, it is important for great powers to carefully consider the ethical implications of their interventions and strive to uphold the principles of justice and equality in their decision-making processes.





### Subsection: 8.2c Unintended Consequences

The concept of unintended consequences is a crucial aspect of the ethics of intervention. Unintended consequences refer to the unforeseen and often undesirable outcomes that result from an intervention. These consequences can have a significant impact on the affected population and can even lead to further conflicts or humanitarian crises.

#### Unintended Consequences

Unintended consequences can arise from both military and non-military interventions. For example, in the case of military intervention, the use of force can lead to civilian casualties, destruction of infrastructure, and further instability in the region. These consequences can have long-lasting effects on the affected population and can even lead to a worsening of the situation.

Similarly, non-military interventions, such as economic sanctions, can also have unintended consequences. While these interventions may be intended to put pressure on a regime or government, they can also have a negative impact on the civilian population, leading to shortages of essential goods and services.

#### Ethical Dilemmas

The concept of unintended consequences raises ethical dilemmas, as it can be difficult to predict and control the outcomes of an intervention. Great powers must carefully consider the potential unintended consequences of their actions and take steps to mitigate them. However, this can be a challenging task, as unintended consequences are often unforeseen and can have a significant impact on the affected population.

Furthermore, the concept of unintended consequences can also be seen as a violation of the principle of human rights. Great powers have a responsibility to protect the rights and well-being of all individuals, and unintended consequences can have a negative impact on the affected population. This raises ethical dilemmas, as great powers must balance their responsibility to protect their strategic interests and economic concerns with their responsibility to uphold human rights.

In conclusion, the concept of unintended consequences is a crucial aspect of the ethics of intervention. Great powers must carefully consider the potential unintended consequences of their actions and take steps to mitigate them. However, the unpredictable nature of unintended consequences can make this task challenging, and it raises ethical dilemmas that must be carefully addressed.





### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the ethical considerations surrounding great power military intervention. We have discussed the various ethical frameworks that can be used to evaluate the morality of intervention, including utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics. We have also examined the role of international law and human rights in shaping the ethical landscape of intervention.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to evaluating the ethics of intervention. Each intervention must be examined on its own merits, taking into account the specific circumstances and goals of the intervention. This requires a nuanced and critical analysis of the situation, as well as a deep understanding of the ethical principles at stake.

Furthermore, we have seen that great power intervention can have both positive and negative consequences. While intervention can be used to protect human rights and promote stability, it can also lead to unintended consequences and further harm. Therefore, it is crucial for policymakers and military leaders to carefully consider the ethical implications of intervention and to prioritize the protection of human rights and the well-being of all affected parties.

In conclusion, the ethics of intervention is a complex and multifaceted topic that requires careful consideration and analysis. By understanding the various ethical frameworks and principles at play, we can better evaluate the morality of intervention and make more informed decisions about its use.

### Subsection: 9.1b UN Peacekeeping Missions

The United Nations has been involved in numerous peacekeeping missions since its inception in 1945. These missions are aimed at maintaining international peace and security, and are often deployed in conflict-ridden regions to monitor and observe ceasefires, facilitate dialogue between warring parties, and provide humanitarian aid. The Indian Armed Forces have been a significant contributor to UN peacekeeping missions, with current deployments in Lebanon, the Congo, and Sudan and South Sudan.

#### UN Peacekeeping Missions in Lebanon

The Indian Armed Forces have been deployed in Lebanon since 1998, as part of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). The mission's primary objective is to monitor the ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon, and to assist the Lebanese Armed Forces in maintaining security in the region. The Indian contingent, consisting of one infantry battalion group and a Level II hospital, has been deployed in UNIFIL since its inception. The current situation in Lebanon is tense and volatile due to the ongoing crisis in Syria, and the UNIFIL's mandate is renewed annually by the United Nations Security Council.

#### UN Peacekeeping Missions in the Congo

The Indian Armed Forces have been deployed in the Congo since 2005, as part of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO). The mission's mandate was initially limited to monitoring the ceasefire and facilitating dialogue between warring parties, but it has since been expanded to include a more proactive role in maintaining peace and security in the region. The Indian contingent, consisting of an extended Chapter VII mandate with an augmented infantry brigade group, army aviation contingent, and formed police units, has been deployed in MONUSCO since its inception. The current situation in the Congo is volatile and uncertain, with the presence of various armed groups and ongoing political instability.

#### UN Peacekeeping Missions in Sudan and South Sudan

The Indian Armed Forces have been deployed in Sudan and South Sudan since 2005, as part of the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) and the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS). The missions' primary objectives are to monitor the ceasefire and facilitate dialogue between warring parties, as well as to provide humanitarian aid to the affected populations. The Indian contingent, consisting of two infantry battalion groups, sector HQ, engineer company, signal company, and a Level-II hospital, has been deployed in UNMIS and UNMISS since their inception. The latest political developments in the region have led to widespread inter-tribe violence and large-scale displacement of locals, posing significant challenges for the peacekeeping missions.

The involvement of international organizations, such as the United Nations, in military interventions is crucial for maintaining international peace and security. Their role in peacekeeping missions, as seen in the case of India's deployments in Lebanon, the Congo, and Sudan and South Sudan, is essential for preventing further escalation of conflicts and promoting stability in these regions. However, these missions also face challenges and limitations, such as the ongoing political instability and violence in the Congo and Sudan, which can hinder their effectiveness. It is important for international organizations to continue to play a proactive role in maintaining peace and security in these regions, and for countries like India to continue their contributions to UN peacekeeping missions.




### Section: 9.1c Case Studies

The United Nations played a significant role in the intervention in Libya in 2011. The intervention was a response to the popular uprising against the regime of Muammar Gaddafi, which had been in power for 42 years. The UN Security Council, under Resolution 1973, authorized the use of all necessary means to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas under threat of attack. This resolution was passed with the support of the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, who were among the first countries to intervene in Libya.

The UN Security Council also established the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) to provide support to the Libyan people and facilitate dialogue among Libyan parties. The mission was led by Abdoun Brahimi, a former Foreign Minister of Algeria. UNSMIL was responsible for monitoring the ceasefire, facilitating dialogue between the Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) and the Gaddafi regime, and providing humanitarian aid to the Libyan people.

The intervention in Libya was a complex operation that involved multiple actors, including the UN, NATO, and various regional and international organizations. The UN played a crucial role in coordinating these efforts and ensuring that the intervention was carried out in a manner that respected international law and human rights.

#### 9.1c.2 United Nations Intervention in Syria

The intervention was initially led by the United States, but was later taken over by NATO.

The intervention in Afghanistan has been one of the longest and most costly interventions in NATO's history. It has involved a significant military presence, including ground troops and air support, as well as efforts to rebuild the country's infrastructure and institutions. Despite these efforts, the intervention has been largely unsuccessful, with the Taliban still controlling large parts of the country and the threat of terrorism remaining a significant concern.

#### 9.2a.3 NATO Intervention in Kosovo

The NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1999 is another notable example of NATO's role in intervention. The intervention was a response to the ethnic cleansing of the Albanian population in Kosovo by Serbian forces. The intervention was authorized by the United Nations Security Council under Resolution 1199, which called for a ceasefire and negotiations between the Serbian government and the KLA.

NATO led the military operations in Kosovo, including air strikes against Serbian forces and ground operations to protect the Albanian population. The intervention resulted in the withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo and the establishment of an independent Kosovo.

In conclusion, NATO plays a significant role in intervention, both in its own region and beyond. Its interventions have been driven by its commitment to maintaining stability and security, and have often been authorized by the United Nations. However, the effectiveness of these interventions has been a subject of debate, with some arguing that they have been too interventionist and others arguing that they have been too cautious.

## Chapter 1:0: Intervention by Great Powers:




### Introduction

In the realm of international relations, the role of non-state actors has become increasingly significant. These actors, which include non-governmental organizations (NGOs), multinational corporations, and religious groups, often have their own agendas and interests that may align or conflict with those of great powers. As such, their involvement in military interventions can have a profound impact on the outcome and effectiveness of these interventions.

This chapter, "The Role of Non-State Actors," delves into the complex dynamics of non-state actors in great power military interventions. It explores the various types of non-state actors, their motivations, and their methods of operation. It also examines the ways in which these actors interact with great powers and influence the course of military interventions.

The chapter begins by defining non-state actors and discussing their role in international relations. It then delves into the specific types of non-state actors, providing examples and case studies to illustrate their involvement in military interventions. The chapter also examines the impact of non-state actors on the effectiveness of military interventions, both positive and negative.

Finally, the chapter concludes with a discussion on the challenges and opportunities presented by non-state actors in great power military interventions. It highlights the importance of understanding and engaging with these actors in order to achieve successful outcomes in military interventions.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the various aspects of non-state actors in great power military interventions, providing a comprehensive understanding of their role and impact. 




### Subsection: 10.1a Humanitarian NGOs

Humanitarian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) play a crucial role in great power military interventions. These organizations are often the first responders in crisis situations, providing aid and assistance to affected populations. They are also involved in long-term development and humanitarian efforts, working to address the root causes of conflict and instability.

#### The Role of Humanitarian NGOs in Military Interventions

Humanitarian NGOs are often involved in military interventions as part of their mandate to provide aid and assistance to affected populations. They work alongside great powers and other international actors to address the immediate needs of affected communities. This can include providing food, shelter, and medical assistance, as well as helping to rebuild infrastructure and communities.

In addition to their role in providing aid, humanitarian NGOs also play a crucial role in advocacy and lobbying efforts. They often work to raise awareness about the situation on the ground and advocate for policy changes and increased support from great powers and other international actors. This can be particularly important in situations where there is a lack of political will or resources to address the root causes of conflict and instability.

#### The Impact of Humanitarian NGOs on Military Interventions

The involvement of humanitarian NGOs can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of military interventions. Their presence can help to mitigate the negative effects of intervention, such as displacement and disruption of daily life. They can also provide valuable information and insights to great powers and other international actors, helping to inform decision-making and strategy.

However, the involvement of humanitarian NGOs can also pose challenges to military interventions. Their presence can complicate the security situation, as they may be targeted by armed groups or become caught in the crossfire. They may also have conflicting interests and priorities, which can create tensions and hinder the overall effectiveness of intervention efforts.

#### The Role of Humanitarian NGOs in Post-Intervention Recovery

In addition to their role in military interventions, humanitarian NGOs also play a crucial role in post-intervention recovery efforts. They are often involved in long-term development and humanitarian efforts, working to address the root causes of conflict and instability. This can include providing education and training, promoting peacebuilding and reconciliation, and supporting economic development.

The involvement of humanitarian NGOs in post-intervention recovery efforts is essential for ensuring sustainable and long-term stability in affected regions. Their presence can help to address the underlying issues that contribute to conflict and instability, and their work can have a positive impact on the lives of affected populations.

### Conclusion

Humanitarian NGOs play a crucial role in great power military interventions. Their involvement can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of intervention efforts, both during and after the intervention. As such, it is important for great powers and other international actors to work closely with humanitarian NGOs to ensure the success of military interventions and promote long-term stability in affected regions.





### Subsection: 10.1b Advocacy NGOs

Advocacy non-governmental organizations (NGOs) play a crucial role in great power military interventions. These organizations are often involved in advocating for the rights and needs of affected populations, and work to influence policy and decision-making at the local, national, and international level.

#### The Role of Advocacy NGOs in Military Interventions

Advocacy NGOs are often involved in military interventions as part of their mandate to protect and promote the rights and needs of affected populations. They work alongside great powers and other international actors to address the root causes of conflict and instability. This can include advocating for policy changes, lobbying for increased support and resources, and raising awareness about the situation on the ground.

In addition to their role in advocacy, advocacy NGOs also play a crucial role in monitoring and reporting on human rights abuses and violations. They often have a presence on the ground and are able to gather first-hand information, which can be used to inform decision-making and strategy.

#### The Impact of Advocacy NGOs on Military Interventions

The involvement of advocacy NGOs can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of military interventions. Their presence can help to ensure that the rights and needs of affected populations are taken into account in decision-making processes. They can also provide valuable information and insights to great powers and other international actors, helping to inform decision-making and strategy.

However, the involvement of advocacy NGOs can also pose challenges to military interventions. Their presence can complicate the security situation, as they may be targeted by armed groups or become caught in the crossfire. Additionally, their advocacy efforts may be seen as interference by great powers and other international actors, leading to tensions and conflicts.

Despite these challenges, the role of advocacy NGOs in military interventions is crucial. Their presence and efforts can help to mitigate the negative effects of intervention and promote long-term stability and peace. 





### Subsection: 10.1c Challenges and Critiques

While non-state actors, particularly non-governmental organizations (NGOs), have played a significant role in great power military interventions, their involvement has not been without challenges and critiques. In this section, we will explore some of the key challenges and critiques faced by NGOs in their role in military interventions.

#### Challenges Faced by NGOs in Military Interventions

One of the main challenges faced by NGOs in military interventions is the issue of security. As mentioned in the previous section, the presence of NGOs can complicate the security situation, making them targets for armed groups or putting them at risk of being caught in the crossfire. This can hinder their ability to carry out their work effectively and can also put their lives at risk.

Another challenge faced by NGOs is the issue of access. In many conflict situations, NGOs may face restrictions on their access to affected populations or areas. This can limit their ability to gather information and provide aid, hindering their effectiveness in addressing the root causes of conflict.

#### Critiques of NGO Involvement in Military Interventions

Despite their important role in military interventions, NGOs have also faced criticism for their involvement. Some critics argue that NGOs can be seen as agents of Western powers, promoting their own agendas and interests rather than the needs of the affected population. This can lead to mistrust and hinder their ability to effectively address the needs of the population.

Additionally, some critics argue that NGOs can perpetuate a neoliberal agenda, promoting market-based solutions and privatization in situations where these may not be appropriate or effective. This can lead to further marginalization and exploitation of affected populations.

#### Addressing Challenges and Critiques

To address these challenges and critiques, it is important for NGOs to work closely with local communities and organizations, building trust and understanding. This can help to mitigate concerns about their intentions and promote a more collaborative and effective approach.

In terms of security, NGOs can work with great powers and other international actors to develop strategies for protecting their personnel and assets. This can include training and equipment for security personnel, as well as protocols for responding to security threats.

In terms of access, NGOs can work with local authorities and other international actors to advocate for increased access to affected populations and areas. This can include using their influence and resources to pressure for policy changes or working with local organizations to bypass restrictions.

In terms of critiques, NGOs can address concerns about their agendas and intentions by being transparent and accountable in their work. This can include regular reporting and evaluation of their activities, as well as involving affected populations in decision-making processes.

In conclusion, while NGOs face challenges and critiques in their role in military interventions, their involvement is crucial in addressing the root causes of conflict and promoting the rights and needs of affected populations. By addressing these challenges and critiques, NGOs can continue to play a valuable role in great power military interventions.





### Subsection: 10.2a Definition and Role

Private military companies (PMCs) are private companies that provide military and security services to governments, international organizations, and other non-state actors. These companies have become increasingly prevalent in modern conflicts, with their role and impact on intervention efforts being a topic of great interest and debate.

PMCs are often hired by governments or international organizations to provide a range of services, including training and advising local forces, providing logistical support, and even engaging in direct combat operations. They are often seen as a cost-effective and efficient alternative to deploying their own troops, especially in situations where there is a lack of local support or resources.

However, the role of PMCs in intervention efforts has also been a subject of controversy. Some argue that their presence can complicate the security situation, as they may be seen as mercenaries or private armies. This can lead to increased hostility and resistance from local populations, hindering the overall effectiveness of intervention efforts.

Furthermore, the use of PMCs has also raised ethical concerns. Some argue that their use can lead to a lack of accountability and oversight, as they are not subject to the same rules and regulations as traditional military forces. This can result in human rights abuses and other violations, further complicating the already complex situation in conflict zones.

Despite these concerns, PMCs continue to play a significant role in intervention efforts. Their ability to provide specialized skills and resources makes them a valuable asset in modern conflicts. However, it is important for policymakers and military leaders to carefully consider the potential risks and implications of their use, and to ensure that they are used in a responsible and ethical manner.

### Subsection: 10.2b Ethical and Legal Issues

The use of private military companies (PMCs) in intervention efforts has raised significant ethical and legal concerns. These concerns stem from the lack of accountability and oversight of PMCs, as well as their potential impact on the local population and the overall effectiveness of intervention efforts.

One of the main ethical concerns surrounding PMCs is their potential for human rights abuses. As private companies, PMCs are not subject to the same rules and regulations as traditional military forces. This can lead to a lack of accountability and oversight, making it difficult to hold them accountable for any human rights violations they may commit. This is especially concerning in situations where PMCs are operating in countries with weak legal systems or where their actions may go unnoticed by the international community.

Furthermore, the use of PMCs can also complicate the already complex situation in conflict zones. Their presence can be seen as a threat by local populations, leading to increased hostility and resistance. This can hinder the overall effectiveness of intervention efforts and further escalate the conflict.

From a legal perspective, the use of PMCs also raises concerns. The legal status of PMCs is often unclear, and their actions may not be covered by international laws and regulations. This can make it difficult to hold them accountable for their actions, especially in situations where their actions may be deemed illegal.

In addition to these ethical and legal concerns, there are also questions surrounding the effectiveness of PMCs. While they may provide specialized skills and resources, their presence can also complicate the security situation and hinder the overall effectiveness of intervention efforts.

Despite these concerns, PMCs continue to play a significant role in intervention efforts. Their ability to provide specialized skills and resources makes them a valuable asset in modern conflicts. However, it is important for policymakers and military leaders to carefully consider the potential risks and implications of their use, and to ensure that they are used in a responsible and ethical manner.

### Subsection: 10.2c Case Studies

To further understand the role of private military companies (PMCs) in intervention efforts, it is important to examine case studies of their involvement in different conflicts. By analyzing these case studies, we can gain a better understanding of the ethical and legal issues surrounding PMCs and their impact on intervention efforts.

One such case study is the involvement of PMCs in the conflict in Iraq. In 2007, the US government hired the private security company Blackwater to provide security for its diplomats in Iraq. However, Blackwater employees were involved in a shooting incident in Baghdad that resulted in the deaths of 17 civilians. This incident sparked international outrage and raised questions about the accountability and oversight of PMCs.

Another case study is the involvement of PMCs in the conflict in Syria. In 2014, the US government hired the private military company Academi (formerly known as Blackwater) to train Syrian rebels in their fight against the Assad regime. However, it was later revealed that some of the trainees had ties to extremist groups, raising concerns about the effectiveness and oversight of PMCs in intervention efforts.

These case studies highlight the ethical and legal issues surrounding PMCs and their involvement in intervention efforts. They also demonstrate the need for better accountability and oversight mechanisms to ensure that PMCs are operating in a responsible and ethical manner.

In addition to these case studies, there have been numerous reports of human rights abuses and legal violations by PMCs in various conflict zones around the world. These reports further emphasize the need for a comprehensive study of the role of PMCs in intervention efforts and the ethical and legal issues surrounding their involvement.

### Conclusion

The use of private military companies (PMCs) in intervention efforts has raised significant ethical and legal concerns. Their lack of accountability and oversight, potential for human rights abuses, and impact on the local population and overall effectiveness of intervention efforts make it crucial for policymakers and military leaders to carefully consider their use. A comprehensive study of the role of PMCs is necessary to address these concerns and ensure that they are used in a responsible and ethical manner.

This incident sparked international outrage and raised questions about the accountability and oversight of PMCs.

The use of Blackwater in Iraq also highlights the ethical concerns surrounding the use of PMCs. The company was hired by the US government to provide security services, but their actions resulted in the loss of innocent lives. This raises questions about the ethical responsibility of PMCs and the need for stricter regulations and oversight.

#### 10.2c.2 G4S in the UK

Another case study that sheds light on the ethical and legal issues surrounding PMCs is the actions of G4S in the UK. In 2013, G4S was contracted by the UK government to provide security services for the London Olympics. However, the company was unable to fulfill its contract and had to subcontract the services to other companies. This raised concerns about the quality and reliability of PMCs and their impact on intervention efforts.

Furthermore, G4S has also faced criticism for its human rights abuses in its operations in the Middle East. This raises questions about the ethical responsibility of PMCs and the need for stricter regulations and oversight.

#### 10.2c.3 The Role of PMCs in the Syrian Civil War

The Syrian Civil War has seen the involvement of multiple PMCs, including Blackwater and Academi. These companies have been hired by various parties to provide security services and train local forces. However, their actions have been met with criticism and concerns about their impact on the conflict.

The use of PMCs in the Syrian Civil War also highlights the legal issues surrounding their involvement in intervention efforts. The legality of their actions is often unclear, and their presence can complicate the already complex situation in the country.

### Introduction

The media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion and understanding of great power military intervention. In this chapter, we will explore the complex relationship between the media and intervention, examining how the media influences public perception and how intervention is portrayed in the media. We will also discuss the role of the media in shaping public opinion and policy-making, and the ethical considerations surrounding media coverage of intervention.

The media has the power to shape public opinion and understanding of intervention through its coverage of conflicts and interventions. The media can influence how conflicts are perceived, the level of support for intervention, and the public's understanding of the reasons for intervention. This is especially true in the case of great power interventions, where the media can shape public opinion not only in the intervening country, but also in the intervened country and the international community.

One of the key factors in the media's influence on intervention is its ability to frame the narrative. The media can frame intervention as a necessary and justifiable action, or as an unjustified and aggressive act. This framing can greatly impact public opinion and support for intervention. Additionally, the media can also influence public opinion through its coverage of casualties and humanitarian issues, as well as through its portrayal of the intervening country and its intentions.

Furthermore, the media can also shape public opinion through its coverage of the aftermath of intervention. This includes reporting on the success or failure of intervention, as well as the impact of intervention on the intervened country and its people. The media can also influence public opinion through its coverage of the political and economic implications of intervention, both domestically and internationally.

In this chapter, we will also explore the ethical considerations surrounding media coverage of intervention. The media has a responsibility to accurately report on intervention, while also considering the potential impact of its coverage on public opinion and policy-making.

## Chapter 12: The Media and Intervention




### Subsection: 11.2a Media Bias

Media bias is a pervasive issue in the United States, with claims of bias being made by both liberal and conservative media critics. This bias can be seen in various forms, including commentary, editorial, and opinion pieces, which are more biased than factual news reporting. As the lines between commentary and journalism become increasingly blurred, concerns have been raised about the objectivity and credibility of mainstream media outlets.

#### Liberal Bias

Liberal bias in the media has been a topic of discussion for decades. Senator Barry Goldwater, a conservative, was the first Republican to allege liberal media bias during his 1964 presidential campaign. According to the "Encyclopædia Britannica", "conservative media critics often claim that U.S. media skews toward the political left".

A study conducted by Lars Willnat and David H. Weaver, professors of journalism at Indiana University, found that 38.8% of US journalists identify as "leaning left" (28.1% identify as Democrats), 12.9% identify as "leaning right" (7.1% as Republicans), and 43.8% as "middle of the road" (50.2% as independents). This study also noted a decrease in the fraction of Democratic journalists in 2013, down 8 percentage points since 2002.

#### Conservative Bias

While liberal bias is often the focus of media critiques, conservative bias has also been a topic of discussion. In recent years, there has been a rise in the use of the term "fake news" to discredit media outlets, particularly those with a liberal bias. This term has been used by both conservative and liberal media critics, highlighting the polarized nature of media bias.

#### Impact of Media Bias on Intervention

Media bias can have a significant impact on intervention efforts. Biased reporting can shape public opinion and influence policy decisions, particularly in the context of great power military intervention. For example, biased reporting on the 2003 invasion of Iraq may have influenced public opinion and policy decisions surrounding the intervention. Similarly, biased reporting on the 2011 intervention in Libya may have shaped public perception of the intervention and its outcomes.

In addition, media bias can also impact the credibility of intervention efforts. Biased reporting can undermine the credibility of intervention efforts, particularly if the media is perceived as having a bias towards one side. This can hinder the effectiveness of intervention efforts and make it more difficult to achieve desired outcomes.

#### Addressing Media Bias

Addressing media bias is crucial in promoting a fair and accurate portrayal of intervention efforts. Independent fact-checking and algorithms to assess bias have been developed to combat bias in the media. Additionally, efforts to increase media literacy and critical thinking skills among the public can help individuals evaluate the credibility of media sources and reports.

In conclusion, media bias is a complex and pervasive issue in the United States. It can have a significant impact on intervention efforts and must be addressed to promote a fair and accurate portrayal of intervention efforts. 





### Subsection: 11.2b Media and Propaganda

The media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion and understanding of intervention efforts by great powers. However, the media is not immune to the influence of propaganda, which can significantly impact its coverage of intervention. In this section, we will explore the relationship between the media and propaganda, and how it affects intervention efforts.

#### Propaganda and Media Coverage

Propaganda is a form of communication aimed at influencing the attitudes, beliefs, and actions of a specific group. It is often used by governments to promote their policies, ideologies, or agendas. In the context of intervention, propaganda can be used to justify military action, demonize the enemy, or rally support for the intervention.

The media, particularly television and social media, is a powerful tool for disseminating propaganda. Visual images, such as videos and photographs, can be particularly effective in shaping public opinion. For example, during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the US government released a video purporting to show Iraqi prisoners being abused by US soldiers. This video was widely circulated in the media and contributed to public outrage and support for the invasion.

#### Media Critiques and Challenges

The use of propaganda in media coverage of intervention has been a topic of concern for media critics. Some argue that the media's reliance on government sources and its tendency to frame intervention efforts in terms of national security and patriotism can lead to biased and one-sided coverage. This can be particularly problematic in the context of intervention, where the media's role in shaping public opinion can have significant implications for the success or failure of intervention efforts.

To address these concerns, some media outlets have implemented guidelines for reporting on intervention. For example, the BBC has a set of editorial guidelines for covering conflict, which emphasize the need for impartiality and accuracy. These guidelines remind journalists of their responsibility to provide a balanced and accurate account of intervention efforts, and to avoid being influenced by government propaganda.

#### The Role of Social Media

The rise of social media has added a new dimension to the media's role in intervention. Social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, allow for the rapid dissemination of information and can shape public opinion in real-time. This can be particularly problematic in the context of intervention, where misinformation and propaganda can spread quickly and influence public perception of intervention efforts.

To address this challenge, some media outlets have implemented fact-checking initiatives to verify information before it is disseminated on social media. These initiatives aim to combat the spread of misinformation and propaganda, and to ensure that the public is informed accurately about intervention efforts.

In conclusion, the media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion and understanding of intervention efforts. However, its coverage can be influenced by propaganda, which can have significant implications for intervention efforts. It is therefore essential for media outlets to maintain their editorial standards and guidelines to ensure that the public is informed accurately about intervention efforts.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the complex relationship between the media and intervention by great powers. We have seen how the media can both influence and be influenced by intervention efforts, and how it can shape public opinion and understanding of these events. We have also discussed the role of the media in shaping the narrative of intervention, and how this can impact the success or failure of these efforts.

The media plays a crucial role in intervention by great powers. It is a powerful tool for disseminating information and shaping public opinion. However, it is also a double-edged sword, as it can be used to manipulate public perception and justify intervention efforts. The media's role in intervention is not static, but rather evolves over time, reflecting changes in technology, society, and politics.

As we have seen, the media can both facilitate and hinder intervention efforts. It can provide valuable information and insights, but it can also distort reality and create obstacles to successful intervention. The media's role in intervention is complex and multifaceted, and it requires careful analysis and understanding.

## Chapter: Chapter 13: The Future of Intervention

### Introduction

The future of intervention is a topic of great interest and importance in the field of international relations. As we delve into the thirteenth chapter of this book, "The Future of Intervention," we will explore the potential trajectories of intervention in the coming years. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the future of intervention, drawing from a wide range of sources and perspectives.

Intervention, as a concept, has been a subject of intense debate and discussion. It is a tool used by powerful nations to influence the affairs of weaker ones, often with the intention of promoting their own interests. However, the effectiveness and ethicality of intervention have been questioned, leading to a need for a deeper understanding of its future.

In this chapter, we will explore the potential future of intervention, considering the impact of technological advancements, changes in global power dynamics, and evolving international norms. We will also delve into the potential implications of these changes for both intervening nations and the nations upon which intervention is exercised.

While we cannot predict the future with certainty, this chapter aims to provide a thought-provoking exploration of the potential future of intervention. It is our hope that this exploration will contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of intervention in international relations and its potential impact on the global stage.

As we navigate through this chapter, we will be guided by the principles of objectivity, rigor, and a commitment to providing a comprehensive analysis. We invite you to join us on this journey into the future of intervention.




#### 12.1b Peacebuilding

Peacebuilding is a critical aspect of post-intervention reconstruction. It involves the process of creating a stable and peaceful environment after a conflict or intervention. This process is often complex and challenging, requiring a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of conflict and promotes reconciliation and healing.

The primary goal of peacebuilding is to prevent the recurrence of conflict and to create a stable and peaceful environment for all members of the society. This is achieved through a variety of means, including the promotion of democracy, human rights, and good governance, as well as the provision of economic and social support to the affected communities.

One of the key challenges in peacebuilding is the categorization of approaches. As mentioned in the related context, there are three primary approaches to peacebuilding: negative peace, positive peace, and justpeace. Each of these approaches corresponds to a different type of violence and has its own set of challenges and opportunities.

Negative peace, which focuses on reducing direct violence, is often the first step in peacebuilding. This approach aims to create a stable and peaceful environment by addressing the immediate causes of conflict. However, it is not without its challenges. For instance, the reduction of direct violence may not necessarily lead to the resolution of the underlying issues that give rise to the conflict. Moreover, the reduction of direct violence may not be sustainable if the root causes of conflict are not addressed.

Positive peace, which focuses on addressing the indirect causes of conflict, is often seen as a more comprehensive approach to peacebuilding. This approach aims to create a stable and peaceful environment by addressing the structural and institutional factors that contribute to conflict. However, this approach also has its challenges. For instance, it requires a deep understanding of the social, economic, and political dynamics of the society, which can be difficult to achieve in post-intervention scenarios.

Justpeace, which focuses on addressing all three types of violence (direct, structural, and cultural), is often seen as the most comprehensive approach to peacebuilding. This approach aims to create a stable and peaceful environment by addressing the root causes of conflict, promoting reconciliation and healing, and establishing a just and inclusive society. However, this approach also has its challenges. For instance, it requires a long-term commitment and a comprehensive approach that addresses all aspects of the conflict.

In conclusion, peacebuilding is a critical aspect of post-intervention reconstruction. It involves a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of conflict and promotes reconciliation and healing. However, it also presents a number of challenges, including the categorization of approaches and the need for a long-term commitment.

The primary goal of stabilization is to create a stable and secure environment for all members of the society. This is achieved through a variety of means, including the provision of security, the promotion of economic and social stability, and the establishment of democratic institutions and processes.

One of the key challenges in stabilization is the categorization of approaches. As mentioned in the related context, there are three primary approaches to stabilization: direct stabilization, indirect stabilization, and comprehensive stabilization. Each of these approaches corresponds to a different type of intervention and has its own set of challenges and opportunities.

Direct stabilization, which involves direct military intervention, is often seen as a short-term solution to stabilization. This approach aims to create a stable and secure environment by directly addressing the immediate causes of instability. However, it is not without its challenges. For instance, direct military intervention may not necessarily lead to the resolution of the underlying issues that give rise to the instability. Moreover, it may not be feasible or desirable in all situations, particularly in cases where the root causes of instability are complex and multifaceted.

Indirect stabilization, which involves indirect support for local forces, is often seen as a more long-term solution to stabilization. This approach aims to create a stable and secure environment by supporting and empowering local forces that can address the root causes of instability. However, this approach also has its challenges. For instance, it requires a deep understanding of the local context and dynamics, as well as a careful selection and support of the local forces.

Comprehensive stabilization, which involves a combination of direct and indirect stabilization, is often seen as the most effective approach to stabilization. This approach aims to create a stable and secure environment by addressing both the immediate and long-term causes of instability. It involves a comprehensive approach that includes direct military intervention, indirect support for local forces, and efforts to address the root causes of instability. However, this approach also has its challenges. For instance, it requires a significant commitment of resources and a long-term commitment to the stabilization process.

In conclusion, stabilization is a critical aspect of post-intervention reconstruction. It requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of instability and promotes long-term stability. The choice of stabilization approach should be based on a careful assessment of the local context and dynamics, as well as the specific goals and objectives of the intervention.

#### 12.1c Case Studies

In this section, we will examine some case studies that illustrate the challenges and opportunities of post-intervention reconstruction. These case studies will provide a more concrete understanding of the theoretical concepts discussed in the previous sections.

##### Case Study 1: The United States Intervention in Iraq

The United States intervention in Iraq, which began in 2003, provides a compelling case study of post-intervention reconstruction. The intervention was aimed at removing the regime of Saddam Hussein, who was believed to possess weapons of mass destruction. However, these weapons were never found, and the intervention led to a protracted conflict and occupation.

The post-intervention reconstruction efforts in Iraq were marked by numerous challenges. The country was deeply divided along ethnic and sectarian lines, and the intervention exacerbated these divisions. The reconstruction efforts were also hindered by corruption, lack of local capacity, and security concerns. Despite these challenges, some progress was made in rebuilding the country's infrastructure and institutions.

The intervention in Iraq also highlighted the importance of peacebuilding in post-intervention reconstruction. The intervention did not address the root causes of conflict, leading to a recurrence of violence and instability. The intervention also failed to promote reconciliation and healing, further exacerbating the country's divisions.

The European Union's intervention in Kosovo, which began in 1999, provides another interesting case study of post-intervention reconstruction. The intervention was aimed at protecting the ethnic Albanian population from violence by Serbian forces.

The post-intervention reconstruction efforts in Kosovo were marked by a more positive approach to peacebuilding. The intervention focused on addressing the indirect causes of conflict, such as the underlying ethnic tensions and lack of good governance. The reconstruction efforts also emphasized the promotion of democracy, human rights, and economic development.

The intervention in Kosovo also highlighted the importance of international cooperation in post-intervention reconstruction. The European Union, along with other international organizations, played a crucial role in providing economic and social support to the country.

In conclusion, these case studies illustrate the complexities and challenges of post-intervention reconstruction. They highlight the importance of a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of conflict and promotes reconciliation and healing. They also underscore the importance of international cooperation and a long-term commitment to peacebuilding.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the aftermath of intervention by great powers is a complex and multifaceted issue. The intervention itself, whether it be military or diplomatic, is often a result of a series of events and decisions that have led to a state of conflict or instability. The aftermath of such intervention is not merely a period of calm after the storm, but rather a time of reconstruction, rebuilding, and reconciliation. 

The process of post-intervention reconstruction is fraught with challenges and opportunities. It requires a deep understanding of the local context, a commitment to long-term stability, and a willingness to address the root causes of conflict. It also necessitates a comprehensive approach that includes diplomatic, economic, and social measures. 

Moreover, the aftermath of intervention is not just about the immediate post-intervention period. It extends to the long-term effects on the stability of the region, the reputation of the intervening power, and the lessons learned for future interventions.

## Chapter: Chapter 13: Future of Intervention

### Introduction

The future of intervention by great powers is a topic of immense importance and complexity. As we delve into this chapter, we will explore the potential trajectories of intervention in the coming years, considering the evolving global political landscape, technological advancements, and shifts in international relations. 

Intervention by great powers has been a defining feature of international relations since time immemorial. It has been used as a tool to exert influence, protect national interests, and maintain global stability. However, the nature and effectiveness of intervention have been subject to significant changes over time. 

In this chapter, we will examine the potential future of intervention, considering the current trends and developments in the international arena. We will explore how intervention might evolve in response to emerging global challenges, such as climate change, cyber threats, and the rise of new powers. 

We will also discuss the potential implications of these changes for global stability and security. Will intervention continue to be a dominant force in international relations? Or will it give way to new forms of influence and control? These are some of the questions we will seek to answer in this chapter.

As we navigate through this complex terrain, we will draw on a wealth of historical and contemporary examples, as well as insights from leading scholars and policymakers. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the future of intervention, equipping readers with the knowledge and tools to navigate this critical aspect of international relations.




#### 12.2a Defining Success

Defining success after military intervention is a complex and multifaceted task. It is not merely about achieving the initial objectives of the intervention, but also about the long-term stability and development of the affected region. As we have seen in the previous sections, the aftermath of intervention is often marked by a series of challenges and opportunities. Therefore, evaluating the success of intervention requires a comprehensive understanding of these complexities.

In the context of business and leadership, Malcolm Gladwell's book "Outliers: The Story of Success" suggests that the notion of the self-made man is a myth. Success, according to Gladwell, is often due to one's circumstances, rather than inborn talent. This perspective can be applied to the evaluation of intervention success. Just as entrepreneurs like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos have been successful due to their circumstances, so too can interventions be deemed successful if they are able to leverage the right circumstances to achieve their objectives.

However, it is important to note that success is a relative term. As Andrew Likierman, former Dean of London Business School, argues, success needs to be measured against stated objectives and against the achievements of relevant peers. In the context of intervention, this means that success should be evaluated not only in terms of whether the intervention has achieved its objectives, but also in comparison with other interventions in similar contexts.

Moreover, Likierman puts forward four propositions regarding company success and its measurement. These propositions can be applied to the evaluation of intervention success. For instance, the first proposition, which states that success comes from a combination of good strategy, good execution, and a bit of luck, can be interpreted to mean that successful intervention requires a well-planned strategy, effective execution, and a bit of good fortune.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into these propositions and explore how they can be applied to evaluate the success of intervention.

#### 12.2b Measuring Success

Measuring the success of intervention is a critical step in evaluating its effectiveness. This process involves quantifying the extent to which the intervention has achieved its objectives. However, as we have seen in the previous sections, the aftermath of intervention is often marked by a series of complexities and challenges. Therefore, measuring success requires a comprehensive understanding of these complexities.

In the context of business and leadership, Andrew Likierman, former Dean of London Business School, argues that success needs to be measured against stated objectives and against the achievements of relevant peers. This perspective can be applied to the evaluation of intervention success. Just as companies are evaluated based on their performance relative to their competitors, interventions can be evaluated based on their performance relative to other interventions in similar contexts.

Moreover, Likierman puts forward four propositions regarding company success and its measurement. These propositions can be applied to the evaluation of intervention success. For instance, the first proposition, which states that success comes from a combination of good strategy, good execution, and a bit of luck, can be interpreted to mean that successful intervention requires a well-planned strategy, effective execution, and a bit of good fortune.

However, it is important to note that measuring success is not a straightforward task. As Gladwell suggests in his book "Outliers: The Story of Success", the notion of the self-made man is a myth. Success is often due to one's circumstances, rather than inborn talent. This perspective can be applied to the evaluation of intervention success. Just as entrepreneurs like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos have been successful due to their circumstances, so too can interventions be deemed successful if they are able to leverage the right circumstances to achieve their objectives.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into these propositions and explore how they can be applied to measure the success of intervention.

#### 12.2c Case Studies

In this section, we will delve into specific case studies to further illustrate the concepts of evaluating intervention success and measuring success. These case studies will provide concrete examples of how the principles and propositions discussed in the previous sections have been applied in real-world interventions.

##### Case Study 1: The United States Intervention in Iraq

The United States intervention in Iraq, which began in 2003, provides a compelling case study of intervention success. The intervention was aimed at removing the regime of Saddam Hussein, who was believed to possess weapons of mass destruction. The intervention was successful in achieving this objective, as Saddam Hussein was overthrown and his regime was replaced by a democratic government.

However, the intervention was not without its challenges. The post-intervention period was marked by a series of complexities, including sectarian violence, political instability, and economic challenges. Despite these challenges, the intervention can be considered successful, as it achieved its primary objective and led to the establishment of a democratic government in Iraq.

##### Case Study 2: The European Union Intervention in Kosovo

The European Union intervention in Kosovo, which began in 1999, provides another interesting case study of intervention success. The intervention was aimed at protecting the ethnic Albanian population from violence by Serbian forces. The intervention was successful in achieving this objective, as it led to a significant reduction in violence and the establishment of a stable and democratic government in Kosovo.

However, the intervention was not without its challenges. The post-intervention period was marked by a series of complexities, including economic challenges and political instability. Despite these challenges, the intervention can be considered successful, as it achieved its primary objective and led to the establishment of a stable and democratic government in Kosovo.

These case studies illustrate the principles and propositions discussed in the previous sections. They show that intervention success is not just about achieving the primary objective, but also about managing the complexities and challenges that arise in the post-intervention period. They also show that intervention success is relative, and needs to be measured against the achievements of relevant peers.




#### 12.2b Measuring Success

Measuring the success of intervention is a critical step in evaluating its effectiveness. This process involves assessing the extent to which the intervention has achieved its objectives and contributed to the long-term stability and development of the affected region. 

One way to measure success is through the lens of the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI). CMMI is a process improvement approach that helps organizations to improve their performance. It provides a set of best practices that can be used to guide the development and maintenance of products and services. The model is composed of five levels, each of which represents a level of maturity in the organization's processes. 

At Level 1, the organization is characterized by ad hoc processes and a focus on individual performance. At this level, success can be measured by the organization's ability to meet its immediate needs and goals. However, this level does not provide a solid foundation for long-term success. 

At Level 2, the organization begins to establish a more defined process, but there is still a focus on individual performance. Success at this level can be measured by the organization's ability to meet its goals and objectives, as well as its ability to adapt to changes in the environment. 

At Level 3, the organization begins to implement a more structured process and a focus on performance measurement. Success at this level can be measured by the organization's ability to consistently meet its goals and objectives, as well as its ability to continuously improve its processes. 

At Level 4, the organization begins to implement a more disciplined process and a focus on process improvement. Success at this level can be measured by the organization's ability to consistently meet its goals and objectives, as well as its ability to continuously improve its processes and performance. 

At Level 5, the organization is characterized by a focus on innovation and performance optimization. Success at this level can be measured by the organization's ability to consistently meet its goals and objectives, as well as its ability to continuously improve its processes and performance, and its ability to innovate and optimize its operations.

By measuring the organization's performance against these levels, we can gain a clear understanding of its maturity and success. This can be particularly useful in evaluating the success of intervention, as it provides a framework for assessing the organization's ability to achieve its objectives and contribute to long-term stability and development.

In the next section, we will explore other methods for measuring success, including the use of self-efficacy scales and the concept of technological self-efficacy.

#### 12.2c Case Studies

In this section, we will delve into specific case studies that illustrate the application of the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) in evaluating the success of intervention. These case studies will provide a practical perspective on how the model can be used to assess the effectiveness of intervention strategies.

In conclusion, the aftermath of intervention by great powers is a complex and multifaceted issue. It involves a myriad of factors, including the political, economic, and social dynamics of the intervening power and the intervened upon power. The intervention can have both positive and negative effects, depending on the circumstances and the manner in which it is carried out. 

The aftermath of intervention can lead to a range of outcomes, from stability and peace to instability and conflict. It can also result in significant changes in the political, economic, and social landscape of the intervened upon power. 

Understanding the aftermath of intervention is crucial for policymakers, military strategists, and scholars. It provides valuable insights into the potential outcomes of intervention and the factors that can influence these outcomes. 

However, it is important to note that the aftermath of intervention is not a static or predictable phenomenon. It is influenced by a multitude of factors and can change rapidly in response to various developments. Therefore, any analysis of the aftermath of intervention must be nuanced and take into account the dynamic nature of the intervened upon power and the intervening power.

## Chapter: Chapter 13: The Future of Intervention

### Introduction

As we delve into the thirteenth chapter of "Great Power Military Intervention: A Comprehensive Study", we find ourselves at a critical juncture. The future of intervention, a topic that has been the subject of much debate and speculation, is our focus. The future of intervention is not just a theoretical concept, but a reality that will shape the course of global politics and security in the years to come.

The future of intervention is not a fixed entity, but a dynamic and complex landscape that is influenced by a myriad of factors. These factors include technological advancements, geopolitical shifts, and changes in international law and norms. As we explore the future of intervention, we will examine how these factors will shape the way great powers intervene in the affairs of other nations.

In this chapter, we will not make predictions about the future. Instead, we will provide a comprehensive analysis of the current trends and developments that could potentially shape the future of intervention. We will also discuss the potential implications of these developments for global security and stability.

As we navigate through this chapter, we will also explore the ethical and moral implications of future intervention. The use of military force, even by great powers, is a contentious issue. As we look ahead, we will consider how the future of intervention could impact human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.

In conclusion, the future of intervention is a topic that is of paramount importance to the study of international relations. As we continue to grapple with the complexities of global politics, it is crucial that we understand the potential trajectories of intervention. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the future of intervention, a topic that will continue to shape the course of global affairs for years to come.




#### 12.2c Case Studies

In this section, we will examine several case studies that illustrate the application of the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) in evaluating the success of intervention efforts. These case studies will provide a practical perspective on the concepts discussed in the previous sections.

##### Case Study 1: Intervention in Iraq

The intervention in Iraq, which began in 2003, provides a compelling case study of the application of CMMI in evaluating the success of intervention efforts. The intervention was aimed at removing the regime of Saddam Hussein, who was believed to possess weapons of mass destruction. The intervention was carried out by a coalition of great powers, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia.

At the outset of the intervention, the coalition was operating at Level 1 of the CMMI model. The intervention was characterized by ad hoc processes and a focus on individual performance. The coalition's ability to meet its immediate needs and goals, such as the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime, was its primary focus. However, the intervention did not provide a solid foundation for long-term success, as evidenced by the ongoing political and social instability in Iraq.

As the intervention progressed, the coalition began to implement more defined processes and a focus on performance measurement at Level 2 of the CMMI model. This was evident in the coalition's efforts to stabilize the country and establish a democratic government. However, the coalition's ability to adapt to changes in the environment, such as the rise of insurgent groups, was limited.

By the end of the intervention, the coalition had implemented a more structured process and a focus on process improvement at Level 3 of the CMMI model. This was evident in the coalition's efforts to train and equip the Iraqi security forces and transfer responsibility for security to them. However, the coalition's ability to consistently meet its goals and objectives, such as establishing a stable and secure Iraq, was limited.

##### Case Study 2: Intervention in Libya

The intervention in Libya, which began in 2011, provides another compelling case study of the application of CMMI in evaluating the success of intervention efforts. The intervention was aimed at protecting civilians from violence by the regime of Muammar Gaddafi. The intervention was carried out by a coalition of great powers, including the United States, France, and the United Kingdom.

At the outset of the intervention, the coalition was operating at Level 1 of the CMMI model. The intervention was characterized by ad hoc processes and a focus on individual performance. The coalition's ability to meet its immediate needs and goals, such as protecting civilians from violence, was its primary focus. However, the intervention did not provide a solid foundation for long-term success, as evidenced by the ongoing political and social instability in Libya.

As the intervention progressed, the coalition began to implement more defined processes and a focus on performance measurement at Level 2 of the CMMI model. This was evident in the coalition's efforts to protect civilians and support the opposition forces. However, the coalition's ability to adapt to changes in the environment, such as the rise of armed militias, was limited.

By the end of the intervention, the coalition had implemented a more structured process and a focus on process improvement at Level 3 of the CMMI model. This was evident in the coalition's efforts to train and equip the Libyan National Army and support the transition to a democratic government. However, the coalition's ability to consistently meet its goals and objectives, such as establishing a stable and secure Libya, was limited.

These case studies illustrate the challenges and limitations of intervention efforts, and the importance of a systematic approach to evaluating their success. They also highlight the need for a long-term commitment to process improvement and continuous learning in intervention efforts.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the aftermath of intervention by great powers. We have explored the various factors that influence the outcome of such interventions, and the implications of these outcomes for both the intervening power and the target country. We have also examined the role of international law and norms in shaping the aftermath of intervention, and the challenges of enforcing these norms in practice.

The chapter has highlighted the importance of careful planning and execution in intervention operations. It has shown that the success of an intervention is not solely determined by the military capabilities of the intervening power, but also by its understanding of the local context, its ability to build partnerships and alliances, and its commitment to long-term stability and development.

Moreover, the chapter has underscored the need for a comprehensive approach to intervention, one that goes beyond military operations to encompass diplomatic, economic, and humanitarian efforts. It has emphasized the importance of a coordinated and integrated approach, one that takes into account the interdependence of different aspects of intervention and their potential impacts on the target country and the international community.

In conclusion, the aftermath of intervention is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires careful analysis and planning. It is a critical aspect of great power military intervention, one that can significantly influence the success or failure of such interventions and their long-term implications.

## Chapter: Chapter 13: Future of Intervention

### Introduction

As we delve into the thirteenth chapter of "Great Power Military Intervention: A Comprehensive Study", we find ourselves at a pivotal point in our exploration of intervention by great powers. The future of intervention is a topic of immense importance and complexity, and it is one that requires a careful and comprehensive analysis. 

In this chapter, we will be examining the future of intervention, exploring the potential trends and developments that may shape the way great powers intervene in the affairs of other nations. We will be looking at the potential implications of these developments for both the intervening powers and the nations they intervene in. 

We will also be discussing the role of international law and norms in shaping the future of intervention. As we have seen throughout this book, international law and norms play a crucial role in determining the legitimacy and effectiveness of interventions. As these laws and norms continue to evolve, so too will the future of intervention.

Finally, we will be considering the ethical implications of future interventions. As we move forward, it is important to consider the moral and ethical considerations that will guide the actions of great powers in their interventions. 

This chapter will not provide definitive answers or predictions about the future of intervention. Instead, it will offer a comprehensive analysis of the potential trends and developments that may shape the future of intervention, providing a foundation for further discussion and analysis. 

As we navigate through this chapter, we will be guided by the principles of objectivity, rigor, and a commitment to providing a comprehensive and balanced analysis. We hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for those interested in understanding the future of intervention by great powers.




### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the aftermath of intervention by great powers. We have seen that the consequences of intervention can be both positive and negative, and that the long-term effects are often difficult to predict. While intervention can bring about positive changes, such as the removal of a dictator or the establishment of democracy, it can also have negative consequences, such as the destabilization of a region or the creation of a power vacuum.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is the importance of careful planning and consideration before engaging in intervention. Great powers must carefully assess the potential risks and consequences of intervention, and must have a clear understanding of the goals and objectives of their intervention. This requires a thorough understanding of the local context and dynamics, as well as a realistic assessment of the potential outcomes.

Another important aspect to consider is the role of international law and norms in regulating intervention. While intervention can be a powerful tool for great powers, it must be used responsibly and in accordance with international law and norms. This includes obtaining proper authorization from the United Nations and respecting the sovereignty of other nations.

In conclusion, intervention by great powers is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration and planning. While it can bring about positive changes, it also carries significant risks and consequences. It is crucial for great powers to approach intervention with caution and to prioritize the well-being of the affected population.

### Subsection: 13.1b Climate Change and Intervention

Climate change is a global phenomenon that has far-reaching implications for the future of intervention by great powers. As the Earth's climate continues to change, it will have a significant impact on the environment, ecosystems, and human societies. This will in turn affect the way great powers intervene in conflicts and crises around the world.

One of the most significant impacts of climate change on intervention is the increased frequency and severity of natural disasters. As temperatures rise, extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts are expected to become more frequent and intense. These disasters can have devastating consequences for vulnerable populations and can exacerbate existing conflicts and crises. In the future, great powers may be forced to intervene in these situations to provide humanitarian aid and prevent further escalation of conflicts.

Climate change also has the potential to alter the geopolitical landscape, as countries compete for resources and struggle to adapt to the changing climate. This could lead to increased tensions and conflicts, particularly in regions that are already facing resource scarcity and environmental degradation. Great powers may be forced to intervene in these conflicts to maintain stability and protect their own interests.

Furthermore, climate change is expected to have a significant impact on ecosystems and biodiversity. As species struggle to adapt to changing temperatures and habitats, there is a risk of extinction and loss of biodiversity. This could have implications for intervention efforts, as great powers may be forced to intervene in conflicts over resources and territories that are affected by these changes.

In addition to these direct impacts, climate change is also expected to have indirect effects on intervention. For example, as countries work towards reducing their carbon emissions and transitioning to renewable energy sources, there may be a shift in the global economy and trade patterns. This could have implications for the way great powers intervene in conflicts and crises, as they may need to adapt to new economic and political dynamics.

Overall, climate change is expected to have a profound impact on the future of intervention by great powers. As the effects of climate change become more apparent, it is crucial for policymakers and military strategists to consider the potential implications and develop strategies to address these challenges. By understanding the potential impacts of climate change on intervention, we can better prepare for the future and work towards a more sustainable and peaceful world.





### Subsection: 13.1c Global Power Shifts

As we look towards the future of intervention, it is important to consider the potential shifts in global power dynamics. In the coming decades, we can expect to see significant changes in the distribution of power among nations, particularly in Eurasia.

One of the main drivers of these shifts will be the rise of new powers. As predicted by political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, the 21st century will be shaped by a clash of civilizations, with the primary fault line being between the Western and Islamic worlds[^1^]. This clash will be driven by the increasing influence of Turkey, which will expand its sphere of influence into the Arab world and north into Russia and other former Soviet countries. This expansion will be supported by the United States, much as it did during the time of the Ottoman Empire.

Meanwhile, Japan will also emerge as a major power, expanding its economic influence to regions of coastal China, the Russian Far East, and many Pacific Islands. This will be accompanied by a shift in Japan's foreign policy, becoming more geopolitically aggressive and beginning a major military buildup. By the end of the decade, Japan will possess substantial military strength capable of regionally projecting power across East Asia.

Finally, Poland will continue to lead its military alliance, the "Polish Bloc," and will become a major power much like the time of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Now possessing substantial military strength, Poland will expand its economic influence into what was formerly European Russia, and will begin to compete with Turkey for influence in the important economic region of the Volga River Valley.

These shifts in global power dynamics will have significant implications for intervention efforts. As new powers emerge and existing powers shift their strategies, the landscape of intervention will change. Great powers will need to adapt to these shifts and develop new strategies to maintain stability and protect their interests.

### Subsection: 13.2a Intervention vs. Non-Intervention

The debate over intervention versus non-intervention is a complex and ongoing discussion in the realm of international relations. Intervention, in its broadest sense, refers to the involvement of one state in the affairs of another state. This can take many forms, from economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure to military intervention. Non-intervention, on the other hand, is the principle that states should not interfere in the internal affairs of other states.

The principle of non-intervention is deeply rooted in international law and is enshrined in various international treaties and declarations, such as the United Nations Charter[^2^]. However, the principle is not absolute and can be overridden in certain circumstances, such as when a state is facing a threat to its national security.

The debate over intervention versus non-intervention is often framed in terms of the balance between sovereignty and human rights. Sovereignty, the principle that a state has the right to govern itself without external interference, is often seen as a justification for non-intervention. However, the principle of sovereignty can also be used to justify human rights abuses and other forms of internal repression.

On the other hand, human rights, the rights and freedoms that all individuals are entitled to, are often seen as a justification for intervention. The principle of human rights can be used to justify intervention when a state is committing gross human rights violations, such as genocide or ethnic cleansing.

The debate over intervention versus non-intervention is further complicated by the fact that both principles can be used to justify intervention. For example, a state might intervene in another state's affairs on the grounds of protecting human rights, while the intervening state might argue that it is acting in accordance with its sovereign right to protect its citizens.

In the future, the debate over intervention versus non-intervention is likely to continue, with both principles playing a role in shaping international relations. As new challenges and threats emerge, such as the rise of non-state actors and the increasing interconnectedness of the world, the debate will need to adapt and evolve.

[^2^]: United Nations Charter, Article 2(7).




### Subsection: 13.2b Human Rights vs. National Interests

The debate over human rights versus national interests is a critical aspect of the broader discussion on intervention. This debate is often framed in terms of the balance between the rights of individuals and the interests of states. 

Human rights, as defined by the United Nations, are the basic rights and freedoms that all individuals are entitled to, regardless of their race, gender, religion, or any other characteristic[^3^]. These rights are often seen as absolute and non-negotiable, and any violation of these rights is considered a serious breach of international law.

On the other hand, national interests are the concerns and objectives that a state deems important for its own security, economy, and social well-being. These interests are often seen as relative and subject to change, and any action taken in pursuit of these interests is considered a legitimate exercise of state sovereignty.

The tension between human rights and national interests is particularly acute in the context of intervention. Intervention, by definition, involves the involvement of one state in the affairs of another state. This involvement can be motivated by a variety of factors, including human rights concerns, economic interests, or strategic considerations.

When human rights concerns are the primary motivation for intervention, the intervention is often justified on the grounds that the state is committing gross human rights violations, such as genocide or ethnic cleansing. However, even in these cases, the intervention is not always uncontroversial. Some argue that intervention in the name of human rights can be a form of neo-colonialism, where Western powers impose their own values and norms on non-Western societies[^4^].

When economic interests are the primary motivation for intervention, the intervention is often justified on the grounds that the state is engaging in unfair trade practices, or that the state's economic policies pose a threat to the economic well-being of the intervening state. However, this type of intervention can also be criticized as a form of economic imperialism, where Western powers use their economic power to exploit non-Western societies[^5^].

When strategic considerations are the primary motivation for intervention, the intervention is often justified on the grounds that the state poses a threat to regional or global stability. However, this type of intervention can also be criticized as a form of power politics, where Western powers use their military might to protect their own strategic interests[^6^].

In conclusion, the debate over human rights versus national interests is a complex and ongoing discussion in the realm of intervention. It is a debate that requires careful consideration of the principles of international law, the values of human rights, and the interests of states.

### Subsection: 13.2c Future of Intervention

As we look towards the future, it is clear that the debate over intervention will continue to be a critical aspect of international relations. The future of intervention will be shaped by a variety of factors, including technological advancements, changes in global power dynamics, and evolving norms and values.

#### Technological Advancements

Technological advancements, particularly in the field of military technology, will have a significant impact on the future of intervention. Advancements in surveillance technology, for example, could allow for more accurate and timely information about human rights abuses and other potential justifications for intervention[^6^]. On the other hand, advancements in military technology could also make interventions more effective and less costly, potentially leading to an increase in the frequency of interventions[^7^].

#### Changes in Global Power Dynamics

Changes in global power dynamics will also shape the future of intervention. As the United States continues to face challenges to its global dominance, other powers, such as China and Russia, may become more assertive in their use of intervention. This could lead to a shift in the balance of power in international interventions, with these powers potentially playing a larger role in interventions[^8^].

#### Evolving Norms and Values

Evolving norms and values will also play a role in shaping the future of intervention. As societies become more interconnected and as the concept of human rights continues to evolve, there may be an increased expectation for intervention in cases of human rights abuses. This could lead to an increase in the number of interventions, particularly in cases where human rights are concerned[^9^].

In conclusion, the future of intervention is likely to be shaped by a complex interplay of technological advancements, changes in global power dynamics, and evolving norms and values. As we move forward, it will be crucial to continue studying and debating these issues to ensure that interventions are used in a responsible and ethical manner.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the future of intervention by great powers. We have seen that intervention, while often controversial, has been a part of international relations since time immemorial. The future of intervention, however, is not set in stone. It is shaped by a variety of factors, including technological advancements, changes in global power dynamics, and evolving norms and values.

Technological advancements, particularly in the field of military technology, will continue to play a significant role in the future of intervention. Advancements in surveillance technology, for example, could allow for more accurate and timely information about human rights abuses and other potential justifications for intervention[^10^]. On the other hand, advancements in military technology could also make interventions more effective and less costly, potentially leading to an increase in the frequency of interventions[^11^].

Changes in global power dynamics will also shape the future of intervention. As the United States continues to face challenges to its global dominance, other powers, such as China and Russia, may become more assertive in their use of intervention. This could lead to a shift in the balance of power in international interventions, with these powers potentially playing a larger role in interventions[^12^].

Evolving norms and values will also play a role in shaping the future of intervention. As societies become more interconnected and as the concept of human rights continues to evolve, there may be an increased expectation for intervention in cases of human rights abuses. This could lead to an increase in the number of interventions, particularly in cases where human rights are concerned[^13^].

In conclusion, the future of intervention is likely to be shaped by a complex interplay of technological advancements, changes in global power dynamics, and evolving norms and values. As we move forward, it is crucial to continue studying and understanding these factors to better predict and navigate the future of intervention.

### Subsection: 13.2c Unilateral vs. Multilateral Intervention

The debate over unilateral versus multilateral intervention is another critical aspect of the broader discussion on intervention. This debate is often framed in terms of the balance between the power of individual states and the power of international organizations.

Unilateral intervention refers to the action of a single state without the support or approval of any international organization or other states. This type of intervention is often seen as a direct exercise of state power, and it can be motivated by a variety of factors, including national interests, human rights concerns, or strategic considerations[^5^].

Multilateral intervention, on the other hand, refers to the action of multiple states or international organizations acting together. This type of intervention is often seen as a more collective and cooperative approach to addressing international issues. It can be motivated by a variety of factors, including shared concerns over human rights, economic interests, or strategic considerations[^6^].

The tension between unilateral and multilateral intervention is particularly acute in the context of intervention. Intervention, by definition, involves the involvement of one state in the affairs of another state. This involvement can be motivated by a variety of factors, including human rights concerns, economic interests, or strategic considerations.

When unilateral intervention is the primary motivation for intervention, the intervention is often justified on the grounds that the state is committing gross human rights violations, such as genocide or ethnic cleansing. However, even in these cases, the intervention is not always uncontroversial. Some argue that unilateral intervention can be a form of neo-colonialism, where Western powers impose their own values and norms on non-Western societies[^7^].

When multilateral intervention is the primary motivation for intervention, the intervention is often justified on the grounds that the state is engaging in behavior that threatens international peace and security. However, even in these cases, the intervention is not always uncontroversial. Some argue that multilateral intervention can be a form of power politics, where powerful states use international organizations to advance their own interests[^8^].

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the future of intervention by great powers. We have discussed the potential challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, and how intervention may continue to shape global politics. As we have seen, intervention has been a contentious issue throughout history, and it is likely to remain so in the future.

One of the key challenges for intervention in the future will be the increasing use of technology and cyber warfare. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that great powers will use it to their advantage in intervention efforts. This could lead to new forms of intervention, such as cyber interventions, and raise questions about the ethical boundaries of intervention.

Another challenge will be the rise of non-state actors and their involvement in conflicts. Non-state actors, such as terrorist groups, have already played a significant role in shaping global politics, and their influence is likely to continue to grow in the future. This could pose challenges for intervention efforts, as non-state actors may not adhere to traditional rules and norms of intervention.

However, there are also opportunities for intervention in the future. The increasing interconnectedness of the world means that conflicts and crises can have a global impact, making intervention more necessary than ever. Additionally, advancements in technology and communication could also make intervention efforts more efficient and effective.

In conclusion, the future of intervention by great powers is uncertain, but it is clear that intervention will continue to play a significant role in global politics. As we continue to navigate the complexities of intervention, it is important to consider the potential consequences and ethical implications of our actions.

### Subsection: 14.1a Historical Context

The intervention in Syria by great powers is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires a thorough understanding of the historical context. The roots of the conflict can be traced back to the early 20th century, when the Ottoman Empire, which had controlled the region for centuries, began to decline. This led to a power vacuum that was filled by various European powers, including France, Britain, and Russia, who had long been involved in the region for strategic and economic reasons.

The First World War further complicated the situation, as it led to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the creation of new states in the Middle East, including Syria. The Syrian Arab Kingdom, led by King Faisal, was one of these states, but it was short-lived and eventually fell to French control. This marked the beginning of a long period of French and British control over Syria, which lasted until the 1940s.

During this time, Syria was caught in the midst of the Cold War, with the Soviet Union and the United States vying for influence in the region. This led to a series of coups and political instability, which ultimately resulted in the rise of the Ba'ath Party and the establishment of a socialist government in 1963. The Ba'ath Party, which was influenced by Arab nationalism and socialist ideology, sought to unify the Arab world and promote economic development.

However, the Ba'ath Party's rule was marked by repression and human rights abuses, leading to widespread dissatisfaction among the Syrian population. This dissatisfaction was further exacerbated by the country's poor economic performance and the effects of the 1973 oil crisis. In 1970, Hafez al-Assad, a member of the Ba'ath Party, seized power in a coup and established a dictatorship that lasted until his death in 2000.

The Assad regime was characterized by a strong emphasis on Arab nationalism and a close relationship with the Soviet Union. However, in the 1980s, Syria began to shift its foreign policy towards the West, particularly the United States, in an effort to improve its economic situation. This shift was also driven by Syria's desire to regain control of the Golan Heights, which had been occupied by Israel since the 1967 Six-Day War.

In 1991, Syria participated in the Gulf War alongside the United States and other coalition forces, further strengthening its relationship with the West. However, tensions between Syria and Israel continued to escalate, leading to a series of conflicts, including the 1996 Qana massacre and the 2000 Camp David summit.

The Assad regime's relationship with the West began to deteriorate in the early 2000s, particularly after the United States accused Syria of involvement in the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. This led to increased pressure from the international community, including the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, to end Syria's occupation of Lebanon and improve its human rights record.

In 2005, the Assad regime withdrew its troops from Lebanon, but its relationship with the West continued to deteriorate. This was largely due to Syria's support for Hezbollah and Hamas, which were viewed as terrorist organizations by the United States and other Western powers. In 2006, the United States imposed economic sanctions on Syria, further isolating the country.

The Assad regime's relationship with the West reached a low point in 2007, when the United States and other Western powers accused Syria of pursuing a nuclear weapons program. This led to increased pressure from the international community, including the United Nations, to end Syria's nuclear program.

In 2008, Syria agreed to end its nuclear program and cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). However, tensions between Syria and the West continued to escalate, particularly over Syria's support for Hezbollah and Hamas. In 2011, the Arab Spring reached Syria, leading to widespread protests and unrest.

The Assad regime's response to the protests was brutal, resulting in the deaths of thousands of civilians. This led to international condemnation and calls for Assad to step down. In response, Assad's forces launched a brutal crackdown on the protesters, leading to the Syrian Civil War.

The intervention in Syria by great powers, including the United States, France, and Russia, has been a complex and multifaceted issue. The historical context of Syria's relationship with the West, as well as its internal political dynamics, have played a significant role in shaping the intervention efforts. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the various factors that have influenced the intervention in Syria, including the role of international law, humanitarian concerns, and regional dynamics.





### Subsection: 14.1b The Syrian Civil War

The Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, has been a complex and devastating conflict that has had significant implications for the region and the world. The war has been characterized by multiple actors and interventions, making it a challenging case study for understanding great power military intervention.

The conflict began in March 2011 as a series of protests against the Assad regime, inspired by the Arab Spring. These protests quickly turned violent, and the Syrian Civil War was underway. The conflict has been marked by a complex web of alliances and conflicts, with multiple actors involved.

The Syrian Opposition, a group of anti-Assad forces, has been a key player in the conflict. The Opposition is composed of a variety of groups, including rebel forces, Islamist groups, and Kurdish militias. The Opposition has been fighting against the Assad regime, seeking to overthrow the regime and establish a new government.

The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has also been a significant actor in the conflict. ISIL is a terrorist organization that has taken advantage of the chaos of the civil war to expand its territory and establish a caliphate. ISIL has been responsible for numerous atrocities, including the use of chemical weapons against civilians.

The Russian Federation has also been involved in the conflict, supporting the Assad regime with military and political support. Russia's involvement has been a key factor in the ongoing conflict, as it has provided the Assad regime with crucial support and has been a major obstacle to any potential resolution of the conflict.

The Syrian Civil War has been a complex and devastating conflict, with numerous actors and interventions. The conflict has had significant implications for the region and the world, and understanding it is crucial for understanding great power military intervention. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the various aspects of the conflict, examining the roles of different actors and the impact of their interventions.




### Section: 14.1 Background:

The Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, has been a complex and devastating conflict that has had significant implications for the region and the world. The war has been characterized by multiple actors and interventions, making it a challenging case study for understanding great power military intervention.

#### 14.1a Historical Context

The roots of the Syrian Civil War can be traced back to the Arab Spring of 2011, a series of protests and uprisings that swept across the Middle East and North Africa. In Syria, these protests were initially directed against the authoritarian regime of President Bashar al-Assad, who had been in power since 2000. The protests quickly escalated into a full-blown civil war, with various armed groups taking up arms against the Assad regime.

The conflict has been marked by a complex web of alliances and conflicts, with multiple actors involved. The Syrian Opposition, a group of anti-Assad forces, has been a key player in the conflict. The Opposition is composed of a variety of groups, including rebel forces, Islamist groups, and Kurdish militias. The Opposition has been fighting against the Assad regime, seeking to overthrow the regime and establish a new government.

The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has also been a significant actor in the conflict.

Russia's involvement has been a key factor in the ongoing conflict, as it has provided the Assad regime with crucial support and has been a major obstacle to any potential resolution of the conflict.

The Syrian Civil War has been a complex and devastating conflict, with numerous actors and interventions. The conflict has had significant implications for the region and the world, and understanding it is crucial for understanding great power military intervention. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the various aspects of the conflict, including the role of international actors and the impact of the conflict on the Syrian people.

#### 14.1b International Response

The Syrian Civil War has been a major international concern, with numerous countries and organizations involved in the conflict. The international response to the conflict has been complex and multifaceted, with different actors taking different approaches to addressing the crisis.

One of the key international actors involved in the conflict has been the United Nations. The UN has been actively involved in the conflict, providing humanitarian aid and attempting to facilitate a political solution to the conflict. The UN has also been working to address the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria, with the UN World Health Organization (WHO) reporting that over 50% of Syria's health facilities have been destroyed or damaged during the conflict.

In addition to the UN, various countries have also been involved in the conflict. The United States, for example, has been providing military and financial support to the Syrian Opposition, with the goal of overthrowing the Assad regime. The US has also been conducting airstrikes against ISIL targets in Syria.

Russia, on the other hand, has been supporting the Assad regime with military and political support. This support has been a major factor in the ongoing conflict, as it has provided the Assad regime with crucial support and has been a major obstacle to any potential resolution of the conflict.

The European Union has also been involved in the conflict, providing humanitarian aid and imposing economic sanctions on the Assad regime. The EU has also been working to address the ongoing refugee crisis caused by the conflict, with millions of Syrians fleeing the country and seeking refuge in neighboring countries and Europe.

The international response to the Syrian Civil War has been complex and multifaceted, with different actors taking different approaches to addressing the conflict. However, it is clear that the ongoing conflict has had significant implications for the region and the world, and a coordinated and comprehensive international response is needed to address the crisis.

#### 14.1c International Law and Intervention

The Syrian Civil War has raised significant questions about international law and intervention. The conflict has been marked by numerous human rights violations, including the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime and ISIL, as well as reports of war crimes and crimes against humanity. These violations have raised questions about the responsibility of international actors to intervene and protect civilians.

One of the key legal frameworks governing intervention is the United Nations Charter, which sets out the principles and guidelines for international relations. The Charter allows for intervention in cases of self-defense or with the consent of the state being intervened in. However, in the case of Syria, there has been no clear justification for intervention under these provisions.

The Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine has also been invoked in the context of intervention in Syria. R2P allows for intervention when a state is unable or unwilling to protect its citizens from mass atrocities. However, the application of R2P in Syria has been controversial, with some arguing that it was used as a justification for intervention without proper consideration of all available options.

The international response to the Syrian Civil War has also raised questions about the effectiveness of international law and intervention. Despite numerous calls for intervention, particularly in response to the use of chemical weapons, there has been limited action from international actors. This has raised questions about the willingness and ability of international actors to enforce international law and protect civilians in situations of conflict.

In conclusion, the Syrian Civil War has highlighted the complex and often contentious nature of international law and intervention. The ongoing conflict has raised important questions about the responsibility of international actors to intervene and protect civilians, as well as the effectiveness of international law in addressing situations of conflict. As the conflict continues, it is crucial for international actors to carefully consider the legal and ethical implications of their actions and work towards a comprehensive and coordinated response that upholds international law and protects civilians.

### Conclusion

The case study of intervention in Syria has provided a comprehensive understanding of the complexities and challenges of great power military intervention. The Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, has been a major conflict that has involved multiple actors and interventions. The involvement of great powers, such as the United States, Russia, and Iran, has added another layer of complexity to the conflict.

The intervention in Syria has highlighted the importance of careful planning and consideration of the potential consequences before engaging in military intervention. It has also shown the need for effective communication and coordination among the intervening powers.

In addition to the actors involved, the strategies and tactics used by the great powers have also played a significant role in the intervention in Syria. The US has primarily used a combination of air and ground support for the Syrian Opposition, as well as diplomatic efforts to push for a political solution to the conflict. Russia, on the other hand, has relied heavily on its air power to support the Assad regime and has also used its diplomatic influence to protect the regime from international condemnation. Turkey has also used a combination of air and ground support for the Syrian Opposition, as well as diplomatic efforts to push for a safe zone in Syria to protect its borders and its Kurdish population.

The strategies and tactics used by these great powers have had varying levels of success. The US has been able to provide some support to the Syrian Opposition, but its efforts have been hindered by the complexity of the conflict and the involvement of other actors. Russia's support for the Assad regime has been crucial in maintaining the regime's power, but it has also faced criticism for its involvement in the conflict. Turkey's efforts have been successful in protecting its borders and its Kurdish population, but its involvement has also been met with criticism for its support of rebel forces.

In conclusion, the intervention in Syria by great powers has been a complex and multifaceted issue. The involvement of various actors and the use of different strategies and tactics have all played a role in the ongoing conflict. As the conflict continues, it is important to analyze and understand the actions of these great powers and their impact on the conflict in Syria.

### Subsection: 15.1a Historical Context

The intervention in Afghanistan by great powers is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires a deep understanding of the historical context. The country has a long history of intervention by various powers, dating back to the 19th century when the British and Russian empires vied for control of the region. This historical context has shaped the country's political landscape and its relationship with the international community.

#### The Soviet-Afghan War

The Soviet-Afghan War, which lasted from 1979 to 1989, was a pivotal moment in Afghanistan's history. The Soviet Union, seeking to maintain its influence in the region, intervened in the country to support the communist government. The war was marked by intense fighting and significant human and economic costs. The Soviet intervention ultimately led to the collapse of the communist government and the rise of the Taliban, a fundamentalist Islamic group that took control of the country in 1996.

The Soviet-Afghan War had a profound impact on the country and its relationship with the international community. The war was a major factor in the Soviet Union's eventual collapse, and it also led to the United States and other Western powers providing support to the Afghan mujahideen, who were fighting against the Soviet occupation. This support, while initially successful in driving the Soviets out of Afghanistan, ultimately led to the rise of extremist groups and the destabilization of the country.

#### The United States Intervention

The United States, along with other Western powers, intervened in Afghanistan in the 1980s to support the mujahideen in their fight against the Soviet occupation. This intervention was part of the larger Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States provided military and financial support to the mujahideen, with the goal of weakening the Soviet Union and advancing its own interests in the region.

The United States intervention in Afghanistan has been a subject of much debate and criticism. While it initially achieved its goal of driving the Soviets out of Afghanistan, it also led to unintended consequences, including the rise of extremist groups and the destabilization of the country. The intervention also raised ethical concerns, as the United States supported a group that included members of extremist organizations, such as al-Qaeda.

#### The Taliban Regime

The Taliban, a fundamentalist Islamic group, took control of Afghanistan in 1996. The group was initially supported by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and it imposed a strict interpretation of Islamic law on the country. The Taliban's rule was marked by human rights abuses and the suppression of women's rights. The group also provided a safe haven for al-Qaeda, which carried out the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States.

The Taliban regime was a major factor in the United States' decision to intervene in Afghanistan again in 2001. The United States, along with other Western powers, intervened in the country to overthrow the Taliban regime and dismantle al-Qaeda. This intervention has been ongoing, with the United States and NATO forces still deployed in the country.

#### The Current Situation

Today, Afghanistan continues to face significant challenges, including ongoing violence and instability. The country is also facing a humanitarian crisis, with millions of people in need of aid. The United States and other Western powers have been involved in efforts to stabilize the country and support its reconstruction, but these efforts have been met with challenges and criticism.

The intervention in Afghanistan by great powers is a complex and ongoing issue that requires a deep understanding of the historical context. The country's history of intervention by various powers has shaped its political landscape and its relationship with the international community. As the United States and other Western powers continue to be involved in Afghanistan, it is crucial to understand the historical context and the lessons learned from past interventions.





### Subsection: 15.1b The Afghan Conflict

The Afghan conflict, also known as the War in Afghanistan, has been ongoing since the Soviet-Afghan War in the 1980s. The conflict has been marked by various interventions by great powers, including the United States, Soviet Union, and neighboring countries such as Pakistan and Iran. The conflict has had a significant impact on the country and its people, leading to widespread instability and humanitarian crises.

#### The Rise of the Taliban

The Taliban, a fundamentalist Islamic group, rose to power in Afghanistan in the 1990s. The group was formed in the 1980s by Pakistani intelligence agencies as a way to combat the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. However, after the Soviets withdrew in 1989, the Taliban turned its attention to the internal power struggle in Afghanistan. The group took control of the country in 1996, imposing a strict interpretation of Islamic law and restricting the rights of women and minorities.

The Taliban's rise to power was a result of the power vacuum created by the withdrawal of Soviet forces and the ongoing civil war in Afghanistan. The group's control of the country was also supported by neighboring Pakistan, which saw the Taliban as a bulwark against the influence of Iran and India in Afghanistan.

#### The United States Intervention

The United States, along with other Western powers, intervened in Afghanistan in the 1980s to support the mujahideen in their fight against the Soviet occupation. However, after the Soviets withdrew in 1989, the United States continued to provide support to the mujahideen in their fight against the Taliban. This support was part of the United States' efforts to contain the Taliban and prevent the group from gaining control of Afghanistan.

The United States' intervention in Afghanistan has been a topic of debate among scholars and policymakers. Some argue that the intervention was necessary to prevent the Taliban from gaining control of the country and spreading its extremist ideology. Others argue that the intervention ultimately led to the destabilization of the country and the rise of extremist groups, including Al Qaeda.

#### The War in Afghanistan

The War in Afghanistan, which began in 2001, was a direct response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The United States, along with its allies, intervened in Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban regime, which was harboring Al Qaeda and its leader, Osama bin Laden. The war has been marked by ongoing conflict and instability, with the Taliban regaining control of large parts of the country in recent years.

The war in Afghanistan has been a complex and costly intervention for the United States and its allies. While the initial goal of overthrowing the Taliban regime was achieved, the ongoing conflict and instability in the country have raised questions about the effectiveness of the intervention. The war has also had a significant impact on the Afghan people, leading to widespread humanitarian crises and displacement.

### Conclusion

The Afghan conflict, which has been ongoing for decades, has been shaped by various interventions by great powers. The Soviet-Afghan War, the United States intervention in the 1980s, and the ongoing War in Afghanistan have all had a significant impact on the country and its people. The conflict has also raised important questions about the effectiveness and consequences of great power interventions in internal conflicts. As the conflict continues, it is crucial to understand the historical context and the various factors that have contributed to the ongoing instability in Afghanistan.





### Subsection: 15.1c International Response

The intervention in Afghanistan has been a complex and multifaceted issue, with various international actors playing a role in the conflict. The international response to the intervention has been shaped by a combination of political, economic, and humanitarian concerns.

#### The Role of the United Nations

The United Nations has been a key player in the international response to the intervention in Afghanistan. The organization has been involved in various peacekeeping missions in the country, with the most recent being the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). The mission, which began in 2002, has been tasked with providing technical assistance to the Afghan government and monitoring human rights abuses.

The United Nations has also been involved in providing humanitarian aid to the people of Afghanistan. The organization has been working to address the country's food insecurity, which has been exacerbated by the ongoing conflict. In 2018, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) provided food assistance to over 1.2 million people in Afghanistan.

#### The Role of the European Union

The European Union has also been a significant player in the international response to the intervention in Afghanistan. The organization has been providing financial and technical assistance to the country, with a focus on promoting stability and good governance.

In 2017, the European Union launched the EU-Afghanistan Joint Declaration, which outlines the EU's support for Afghanistan's peace and reconciliation efforts. The declaration includes a commitment to provide financial support for the country's security and defense sector, as well as support for the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces.

#### The Role of the United States

The United States has been a key actor in the intervention in Afghanistan, both in terms of its military presence and its economic and political influence. The country has been a major recipient of U.S. aid, with over $143 billion in assistance provided since 2001.

However, the U.S. intervention has also been a topic of controversy, with some arguing that it has been ineffective and has led to the country's ongoing instability. In 2019, the U.S. announced its plans to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, marking a significant shift in its approach to the conflict.

#### The Role of Other International Actors

Other international actors, such as Russia, China, and India, have also been involved in the intervention in Afghanistan. These countries have been providing economic and military assistance to the country, with a focus on promoting their own interests.

Russia, for example, has been providing military assistance to the Afghan government, with a focus on training and equipping the Afghan National Army. China, on the other hand, has been investing in infrastructure projects in the country, with a focus on developing its economic ties with Afghanistan.

#### The Role of International Organizations

International organizations, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, have also been involved in the international response to the intervention in Afghanistan. These organizations have been providing financial assistance to the country, with a focus on promoting economic stability and development.

In 2017, the World Bank approved a $1 billion loan for Afghanistan, with the aim of supporting the country's economic growth and reducing poverty.

## Chapter: Great Power Military Intervention: A Comprehensive Study

### Introduction

In today's globalized world, military intervention by great powers has become a common occurrence. Whether it is in the form of direct military intervention or indirect support for rebel groups, great powers have been involved in conflicts around the world. One such example is the intervention in Iraq, which has been a topic of great interest and debate among scholars and policymakers. In this chapter, we will delve into a case study of intervention in Iraq, examining the various factors that led to the intervention and its consequences.

The intervention in Iraq, also known as the Iraq War, began in 2003 and lasted until 2011. It was a result of the United States' belief that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, which later turned out to be false. The intervention was a joint effort by the United States, the United Kingdom, and other coalition forces, with the primary goal of overthrowing the regime of Saddam Hussein. The intervention was met with widespread criticism and controversy, both domestically and internationally.

In this chapter, we will explore the various aspects of the intervention in Iraq, including the reasons for intervention, the military strategies and tactics used, and the aftermath of the intervention. We will also examine the role of international organizations and other great powers in the intervention, as well as the impact of the intervention on the region and the world. By studying this case, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the complexities and consequences of great power military intervention.

### Section: 16.1 Background:

The intervention in Libya by great powers is a complex and multifaceted topic that requires a comprehensive study to fully understand its implications. This section will provide a historical context for the intervention, examining the events leading up to the intervention and the factors that influenced the decision of great powers to intervene.

#### 16.1a Historical Context

The intervention in Libya is rooted in the country's history of colonialism and its subsequent political and social dynamics. Libya was colonized by various European powers, including Italy and France, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This period of colonization had a profound impact on the country's political and social landscape, leading to the establishment of authoritarian regimes and the suppression of civil liberties.

The intervention in Libya can be traced back to the 2011 Arab Spring, a series of pro-democracy protests and uprisings that swept across the Middle East and North Africa. In Libya, these protests were sparked by the death of a street vendor who was set on fire by a police officer. The protests quickly escalated, leading to a full-scale rebellion against the regime of Muammar Gaddafi, who had been in power for 42 years.

The intervention in Libya was part of a larger international response to the Arab Spring. The United States, France, and the United Kingdom, among other great powers, were involved in the intervention, with the United States providing air support and France and the United Kingdom leading a military intervention on the ground. The intervention was aimed at protecting civilians and supporting the rebel forces in their fight against Gaddafi's regime.

The intervention in Libya also had significant implications for the region and the international community. It led to the establishment of a transitional government in Libya and the eventual downfall of Gaddafi's regime. However, the intervention also resulted in a prolonged conflict and a humanitarian crisis, with thousands of civilians losing their lives and millions displaced.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the various aspects of the intervention in Libya, examining the reasons behind it, the methods used, and the outcomes that followed. We will also draw comparisons with other interventions by great powers and discuss the challenges faced during the intervention and the strategies employed to overcome them. This comprehensive study will provide valuable insights into the dynamics of intervention by great powers and its impact on the affected countries and the international community.





### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have examined the case study of intervention in Libya by great powers. We have seen how the intervention was a complex and multifaceted operation, involving various actors and interests. The intervention was a result of a combination of factors, including the Arab Spring, the United States' desire to protect its interests in the region, and the international community's responsibility to protect civilians.

The intervention in Libya has had significant implications for the region and the world. It has led to the downfall of the Gaddafi regime and the establishment of a new government. However, it has also resulted in ongoing political instability and violence in Libya. The intervention has also raised important questions about the role of great powers in international conflicts and the effectiveness of military intervention as a tool for resolving them.

As we conclude this chapter, it is important to note that the case of Libya is just one example of great power intervention. There are many other cases throughout history that have shaped the world as we know it today. By studying these cases, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities and consequences of great power intervention.

It will discuss the principles of humanitarian intervention and the role of international law in guiding such interventions. The chapter will also explore the challenges and controversies surrounding the intervention, including the role of NATO and the United States, the effectiveness of the intervention, and the long-term implications of the intervention for the region and the international community.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the intervention in Kosovo, shedding light on the complexities and challenges of great power military intervention. It is hoped that this analysis will contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of great powers in international conflicts and the ethical and legal considerations surrounding such interventions.




### Subsection: 17.1a Historical Context

The intervention in Kosovo is a complex issue that cannot be fully understood without examining the historical context of the region. The roots of the conflict can be traced back to the 19th and early 20th centuries, when the Ottoman Empire was in decline and the Balkans were embroiled in a power struggle between various ethnic groups and empires.

The Ottoman Empire, which had controlled the region for centuries, was facing increasing pressure from European powers and its own internal divisions. In the late 19th century, the empire began to lose its grip on the Balkans, leading to a power vacuum that was filled by various ethnic groups vying for control. The Serbs, who had been under Ottoman rule for centuries, saw an opportunity to expand their territory and influence.

In the early 20th century, the First Balkan War broke out, pitting the Serbs, Greeks, and Bulgarians against the Ottomans. The Serbs, with the support of Russia, were able to expand their territory significantly, at the expense of the Ottomans. However, this expansion was not without controversy, as the Serbs were accused of ethnic cleansing and genocide against the Albanian population in Kosovo.

The First Balkan War also saw the emergence of the Young Turks, a group of reformist Ottoman officers who overthrew the sultan and established a constitutional monarchy. The Young Turks attempted to modernize the empire and assert its power in the region, but their efforts were met with resistance from various ethnic groups, including the Serbs.

The Second Balkan War, which broke out in 1913, was a result of the power struggle between the Serbs and the Young Turks. The Serbs, with the support of Russia, were able to expand their territory even further, but this expansion was met with resistance from the Albanians and Bulgarians. The war ended with the Treaty of Bucharest, which confirmed the Serbs' expansion into Kosovo and other regions.

The intervention in Kosovo can be seen as a continuation of this power struggle, with the Serbs attempting to maintain their control over the region and the Albanians fighting for their independence. The intervention also had significant implications for the rest of the Balkans, as it sparked fears of ethnic conflict and instability in the region.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the historical context of the intervention, examining the events leading up to the intervention and the international response to the conflict.





### Subsection: 17.1b The Kosovo Conflict

The Kosovo conflict, also known as the Kosovo War, was a major armed conflict that took place in the late 1990s in the Balkans. It was a result of long-standing ethnic tensions between the Albanian and Serbian populations in Kosovo, a region that had a complex history of ethnic and political divisions.

The conflict began in 1998, when the Albanian population in Kosovo, who were predominantly Muslim, began protesting against the Serbian government's policies of discrimination and oppression. The Serbian government, led by President Slobodan Milošević, responded with a crackdown on the Albanian population, leading to increased violence and ethnic cleansing.

The conflict quickly escalated, with both sides committing human rights violations and atrocities. The Serbian forces, with the support of the Yugoslav Army, carried out a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Albanian population, resulting in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people. The Albanian forces, on the other hand, carried out attacks on Serbian civilians and infrastructure.

The conflict also had international implications, with neighboring countries and global powers becoming involved in the conflict. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) intervened in the conflict, bombing Serbian forces and providing support to the Albanian forces. This intervention was controversial, with some arguing that it was necessary to protect the Albanian population and others arguing that it was an unjustified violation of Serbian sovereignty.

The conflict ended in 1999 with the Kumanovo Agreement, which resulted in Kosovo being placed under the governmental control of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). The agreement also provided for the withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo and the establishment of an international peacekeeping force.

The Kosovo conflict was a significant event in the history of the Balkans and had long-lasting effects on the region. It highlighted the complex ethnic and political divisions in the Balkans and the need for a peaceful resolution of conflicts. It also raised questions about the role of international intervention in conflicts and the use of force in international relations. 





### Subsection: 17.1c International Response

The Kosovo conflict was a major international crisis that required a coordinated response from the global community. The United Nations Security Council, in particular, played a crucial role in addressing the conflict and finding a resolution.

#### United Nations Security Council Resolution 1170

In response to the escalating conflict in Kosovo, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1170 on September 23, 1998. This resolution was a direct result of the report presented by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, which detailed the sources of conflict in Africa and recommended ways to address them.

The resolution welcomed the report and emphasized the need for a comprehensive response to the challenges facing Africa. It also established a working group consisting of all members of the Security Council to review the recommendations and consider ways of implementing them. The resolution also highlighted the importance of close cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in conflict prevention.

#### International Response to the Kosovo Conflict

The Kosovo conflict also received international attention, with various countries and organizations offering assistance to the affected population. Japan, in particular, was heavily involved in the response to the conflict. The country specifically requested teams from Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, and the United States to assist in the relief efforts. Additionally, Japan activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, allowing for the sharing of satellite imagery with rescue and aid organizations.

The international response to the Kosovo conflict was a significant demonstration of global cooperation and support for those affected by the conflict. It also highlighted the importance of international organizations, such as the United Nations, in addressing and resolving global conflicts.

#### The Role of International Law in the Kosovo Conflict

The Kosovo conflict also raised important questions about the role of international law in addressing conflicts and protecting human rights. The conflict was marked by human rights violations and atrocities committed by both sides, highlighting the need for a strong international legal framework to prevent and address such conflicts.

The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was established to investigate and prosecute war crimes committed during the conflict. This was a significant step in holding those responsible for the violence accountable and promoting accountability for human rights violations.

In conclusion, the international response to the Kosovo conflict was a complex and multifaceted one, involving various organizations and countries. It highlighted the importance of global cooperation and the role of international law in addressing and resolving conflicts. The lessons learned from this response can inform future interventions and help prevent similar conflicts from occurring in the future.

### Subsection: 18.1b The Iraq War

The Iraq War, also known as the Second Gulf War, was a major international conflict that took place in Iraq from 2003 to 2011. It was a result of the United States' intervention in Iraq, which was driven by the belief that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and had ties to the terrorist group Al-Qaeda.

#### The Invasion of Iraq

On March 19, 2003, the United States, along with its allies, invaded Iraq. The invasion was led by the United States, with the support of the United Kingdom, Australia, and Poland. The invasion was based on the belief that Iraq possessed WMDs and posed a threat to regional and global security. However, it was later revealed that this belief was based on false intelligence reports.

The invasion was met with widespread international condemnation, with many countries and organizations, including the United Nations, opposing the use of military force. Despite this, the United States and its allies proceeded with the invasion, citing the need to eliminate Iraq's WMDs and promote democracy in the region.

#### The Occupation of Iraq

Following the invasion, the United States and its allies established a military occupation of Iraq. The occupation was initially led by the United States, with the support of the United Kingdom and other coalition forces. The main goal of the occupation was to establish a stable and democratic government in Iraq.

However, the occupation faced numerous challenges, including widespread violence and insurgencies. The insurgencies were led by various groups, including Sunni and Shia militias, as well as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISIS). The violence and insurgencies resulted in the deaths of thousands of civilians and coalition forces, as well as the displacement of millions of people.

#### The Withdrawal of U.S. Forces

In 2011, the United States announced its withdrawal of forces from Iraq. The withdrawal was part of a larger strategy to shift focus to the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan. However, the withdrawal was met with concerns about the stability of Iraq and the potential for a power vacuum.

Despite the withdrawal, the United States maintains a military presence in Iraq, with a small number of troops stationed in the country for training and advisory purposes. The future of U.S. involvement in Iraq remains uncertain, as the country continues to face political and social challenges.

#### The Impact of the Iraq War

The Iraq War has had a significant impact on the region and beyond. The invasion and occupation have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, as well as the displacement of millions. The war has also had economic consequences, with the cost of the invasion and occupation estimated to be over $2 trillion.

Furthermore, the war has had a lasting impact on the United States' reputation and standing in the international community. The use of military force without the support of the international community has been heavily criticized, and the war has raised questions about the effectiveness and consequences of great power military intervention.

In conclusion, the Iraq War is a complex and controversial case study that has had a significant impact on the region and beyond. It serves as a cautionary tale about the use of military force and the importance of international support and legitimacy in such interventions. 





### Subsection: 18.1c International Response

The intervention in Iraq was met with a mixed response from the international community. While some countries and organizations supported the United States' actions, many others opposed it. This section will explore the international response to the intervention in Iraq, including the actions of various countries and organizations.

#### Support for the Intervention

The United States and its allies, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and Poland, were the main supporters of the intervention in Iraq. These countries believed that Iraq possessed WMDs and posed a threat to regional and global security. They also believed that the intervention was necessary to promote democracy in the region.

The United States, in particular, argued that the intervention was necessary to protect its national security interests. The country had strong economic and political ties with Iraq, and the presence of WMDs in the country posed a direct threat to the United States and its allies.

#### Opposition to the Intervention

Many countries and organizations opposed the intervention in Iraq. The United Nations, for example, opposed the use of military force and called for diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue. The organization also expressed concerns about the potential humanitarian consequences of the intervention.

France, Germany, and Russia were also among the main opponents of the intervention. These countries argued that the United States and its allies had not provided enough evidence to justify the use of military force. They also expressed concerns about the potential instability and violence that the intervention could cause in the region.

#### International Efforts to Resolve the Conflict

Despite the opposition, some countries and organizations did make efforts to resolve the conflict. The United Nations, for example, established a special commission to investigate the presence of WMDs in Iraq. The commission, known as UNMOVIC, conducted several inspections in Iraq but was unable to find any evidence of WMDs.

The European Union also played a role in the conflict by imposing economic sanctions on Iraq. These sanctions were aimed at pressuring the Iraqi government to disarm and cooperate with the United Nations.

#### The International Community's Role in the Occupation

The international community also played a role in the occupation of Iraq. The United States and its allies, with the support of the United Nations, established a multinational force to assist in the occupation. This force, known as the Coalition Provisional Authority, was responsible for providing security and aid to the Iraqi people.

However, the international community's involvement in the occupation was not without controversy. Some countries, such as France and Germany, opposed the occupation and refused to contribute troops or resources. Others, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, provided significant support but faced criticism for their involvement.

#### The Withdrawal of U.S. Forces

In 2011, the United States announced its withdrawal of forces from Iraq. This decision was made in consultation with the Iraqi government and was seen as a significant step towards ending the occupation.

The international community, particularly the United Nations, welcomed the withdrawal as a step towards stability and normalcy in the region. However, the withdrawal also raised concerns about the future of Iraq and the potential for further instability and violence.

### Conclusion

The intervention in Iraq was a complex and controversial issue that sparked a mixed response from the international community. While some countries and organizations supported the United States' actions, many others opposed it.

# Great Power Military Intervention: A Comprehensive Study

## Chapter 19: Case Study - Intervention in Somalia




### Section: 19.1 Background

The intervention in Somalia by great powers is a complex and controversial topic that has been studied extensively in the field of international relations. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive study of this intervention, examining the various factors that led to it, the actions taken by the intervening powers, and the outcomes of the intervention.

### Subsection: 19.1a Historical Context

The intervention in Somalia by great powers is a prime example of the use of military force by great powers to address conflicts and crises in other countries. It is a case that has been studied extensively due to its complexity and the significant impact it had on the region and the international community. The intervention was carried out by a coalition of great powers, including the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, in response to a humanitarian crisis and ongoing civil war in Somalia.

The historical context of the intervention in Somalia is crucial to understanding the events that led to it. The country has a long history of conflict and instability, with a series of coups and civil wars since gaining independence from Britain in 1960. In 1991, a coup led by warlords overthrew the dictatorship of Siad Barre, plunging the country into a civil war that lasted until 2006. The conflict resulted in a humanitarian crisis, with millions of people facing food insecurity and disease.

The intervention in Somalia was a response to this humanitarian crisis, as well as the ongoing civil war and the threat of terrorism. The United States, in particular, saw Somalia as a potential base for terrorists, and feared that the country could become a safe haven for al-Qaeda. This led to the deployment of US troops in 1992, as part of a UN peacekeeping mission.

The intervention was also driven by the desire of the great powers to protect their economic interests in the region. Somalia is home to valuable natural resources, including oil and natural gas, and the great powers saw an opportunity to secure these resources through military intervention. This was a major factor in the decision to intervene, despite the ongoing humanitarian crisis and the lack of a clear exit strategy.

### Subsection: 19.1b International Response

The intervention in Somalia was met with a mixed response from the international community. Some countries, such as the United States and France, saw it as a necessary step to address the humanitarian crisis and protect their economic interests. However, other countries, including neighboring Kenya and Ethiopia, were hesitant to intervene due to concerns over the stability of the region.

The United Nations also played a role in the intervention, deploying peacekeeping forces to help stabilize the country. However, the UN's efforts were hindered by the ongoing civil war and the presence of warlords and terrorist groups. The UN also faced criticism for its slow response to the humanitarian crisis and its inability to effectively address the root causes of the conflict.

### Subsection: 19.1c Lessons Learned

The intervention in Somalia has been widely studied and analyzed, and has provided valuable lessons for future interventions. One of the key lessons learned is the importance of a clear and well-defined exit strategy. The intervention in Somalia was initially seen as a short-term humanitarian mission, but it quickly became a long-term military operation without a clear end goal. This led to a prolonged and costly intervention, with limited success in addressing the underlying issues in the country.

Another lesson learned is the need for a strong and coordinated international response. The intervention in Somalia was hindered by a lack of coordination between the intervening powers and the UN, as well as the reluctance of some countries to intervene. This resulted in a fragmented and ineffective response, which ultimately prolonged the conflict and humanitarian crisis.

The intervention in Somalia also highlighted the importance of understanding the local context and dynamics before intervening. The great powers entered Somalia with a limited understanding of the country's history, culture, and power dynamics, which hindered their ability to effectively address the conflict. This underscores the need for thorough research and analysis before intervening in a country.

In conclusion, the intervention in Somalia is a complex and controversial case that has provided valuable lessons for future interventions. It highlights the need for a clear exit strategy, strong international coordination, and a deep understanding of the local context before intervening. As great powers continue to intervene in conflicts around the world, it is crucial to learn from past interventions and apply these lessons to future interventions.

### Subsection: 19.1b The Somali Conflict

The Somali conflict, also known as the Somali Civil War, has been ongoing since 1991 and has been a major factor in the intervention by great powers. The conflict is complex and multifaceted, with various ethnic and political groups vying for power and control. The conflict has also been exacerbated by external factors, such as the involvement of neighboring countries and international powers.

The conflict began in 1991 when the dictatorship of Siad Barre was overthrown in a coup led by warlords. This led to a power vacuum and a subsequent civil war, with various ethnic and political groups fighting for control. The conflict has resulted in a humanitarian crisis, with millions of people facing food insecurity and disease.

The intervention by great powers, particularly the United States, was driven by a combination of humanitarian concerns and the threat of terrorism. The US saw Somalia as a potential base for terrorists, and feared that the country could become a safe haven for al-Qaeda. This led to the deployment of US troops in 1992, as part of a UN peacekeeping mission.

The intervention has been controversial, with some arguing that it was necessary to address the humanitarian crisis and prevent the spread of terrorism, while others argue that it was an invasion and a violation of Somalia's sovereignty. The intervention has also been criticized for its lack of success and the ongoing conflict in the country.

The intervention has also had a significant impact on the region, with neighboring countries and international powers becoming involved in the conflict. This has further complicated the situation and prolonged the conflict. The intervention has also raised questions about the role of great powers in intervening in conflicts and the effectiveness of their actions.

In conclusion, the Somali conflict is a complex and ongoing issue that has been a major factor in the intervention by great powers. The intervention has been controversial and has had a significant impact on the region and the international community. Further research and analysis are needed to fully understand the implications of this intervention and its impact on the country and the region.





### Subsection: 19.1c International Response

The intervention in Somalia has been a major international effort, with various countries and organizations providing aid and assistance. The international response has been driven by a combination of humanitarian concerns and the threat of terrorism, similar to the reasons behind the intervention by great powers.

One of the key international organizations involved in the response is the United Nations. The UN has been providing humanitarian aid and assistance to the people of Somalia, as well as coordinating efforts with other international organizations. The UN has also been working to address the root causes of the conflict, such as poverty, lack of access to education, and political instability.

The European Union has also been a major player in the international response. The EU has provided financial and material support to Somalia, as well as sending search-and-rescue teams and disaster relief experts. The EU has also been working to address the ongoing crisis in Somalia through diplomatic efforts and support for peacekeeping operations.

In addition to these organizations, several countries have also been involved in the international response. Australia, China, India, New Zealand, and South Korea have all sent search-and-rescue teams and disaster relief experts to Somalia. The United States has been a major contributor to the international response, providing both humanitarian aid and military support.

The international response has been a collaborative effort, with each country and organization bringing their own unique skills and resources to the table. This has allowed for a more comprehensive and effective response to the crisis in Somalia.

However, the international response has also faced challenges and criticisms. Some have raised concerns about the effectiveness of the aid and assistance provided, as well as the potential for unintended consequences. Others have criticized the lack of a coordinated and long-term plan for addressing the root causes of the conflict.

Despite these challenges, the international response has been crucial in providing aid and assistance to the people of Somalia. It has also served as a model for future interventions, demonstrating the importance of collaboration and coordination in addressing complex and multifaceted conflicts.

We have delved into the historical context, motivations, and consequences of such interventions, and have also examined the role of international law and humanitarian considerations. Through our comprehensive study, we have come to understand that great power military intervention is a multifaceted issue that requires careful analysis and consideration.

We have seen that great power military intervention can be a powerful tool for addressing global conflicts and promoting stability. However, it can also be a source of instability and human suffering if not carefully executed. The responsibility of great powers to intervene in the affairs of other nations is a complex and delicate balance that requires careful consideration of the potential consequences.

As we conclude this chapter, it is important to remember that great power military intervention is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Each intervention must be carefully evaluated and executed, taking into account the unique circumstances and potential consequences. It is our hope that this comprehensive study has provided readers with a deeper understanding of this complex issue and will serve as a valuable resource for future research and discussion.

## Chapter: Chapter 21: Future of Great Power Military Intervention

### Introduction

As we delve into the final chapter of our comprehensive study on great power military intervention, it is important to reflect on the journey we have undertaken. Throughout this book, we have explored the historical context, motivations, and consequences of military intervention by major global powers. We have examined the role of international law, humanitarian concerns, and strategic interests in shaping these interventions. We have also discussed the impact of these interventions on both the intervening country and the intervened country, as well as the broader implications for global stability and security.

In this chapter, we will look towards the future and consider the potential trajectory of great power military intervention. As we have seen, military intervention has been a constant throughout history, and it is likely to remain a key tool in the arsenal of major global powers. However, the nature and scope of these interventions may continue to evolve in response to changing global dynamics and technological advancements.

We will also explore the potential challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for great power military intervention. As we have discussed, these interventions can have significant consequences, both positive and negative. It is crucial for policymakers and scholars to continue studying and analyzing these interventions in order to better understand their impact and inform future decisions.

In this chapter, we will not make any predictions or offer definitive answers. Instead, we will provide a platform for further discussion and exploration of the future of great power military intervention. We hope that this chapter will serve as a starting point for continued research and dialogue on this important topic.

### Conclusion
In this comprehensive study, we have explored the complex and often controversial topic of great power military intervention. We have examined the historical context, motivations, and consequences of such interventions, and have also delved into the various factors that influence the decision-making process of great powers. Through our analysis, we have gained a deeper understanding of the complexities and challenges of military intervention, and have also identified some key lessons and insights that can inform future interventions.

One of the key takeaways from this study is the importance of understanding the local context and dynamics when considering military intervention. As we have seen, interventions that fail to take into account the unique cultural, political, and social factors of a particular region are often doomed to fail. This highlights the need for thorough research and analysis before any intervention is undertaken.

Another important lesson is the need for clear and achievable objectives when intervening militarily. Without a well-defined and realistic goal, interventions can quickly become unmanageable and counterproductive. It is crucial for great powers to have a clear understanding of their objectives and to communicate them effectively to all stakeholders involved.

Furthermore, we have also seen the importance of international cooperation and coordination in military interventions. As we have seen, interventions that are carried out without the support or cooperation of other major powers can be difficult and costly. It is therefore essential for great powers to work together and coordinate their efforts when intervening militarily.

In conclusion, great power military intervention is a complex and multifaceted topic that requires careful consideration and analysis. By understanding the historical context, motivations, and consequences of such interventions, and by learning from past mistakes, we can improve the effectiveness and success of future interventions.
