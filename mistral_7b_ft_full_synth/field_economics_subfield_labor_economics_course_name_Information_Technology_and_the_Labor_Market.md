## Chapter 1: Setting the Stage - Incomes, Occupations and Wages




### Section 1.1 Two Early Views of Computersâ€™ Impacts

In the early days of computing, there were two dominant views on the impact of computers on the labor market. These views were technological determinism and technological constructivism.

#### Technological Determinism

Technological determinism is a theory that suggests that technology is the primary driving force behind social and cultural change. This theory was popular in the early days of computing, as it aligned with the belief that computers would revolutionize the way we live and work. Technological determinism assumes that the complex process of historical change is caused solely by technology. For example, the belief that social media makes people depressed is a manifestation of technological determinism.

However, this theory has been heavily criticized for its reductionistic and mechanistic approaches. Critics argue that it reduces the complex process of historical change to a simple cause-and-effect relationship, and that it assumes that technology causes change in a predictable and universal way. This is problematic, as it ignores the role of human agency and the complex interactions between technology and society.

#### Technological Constructivism

On the other hand, technological constructivism is a theory that emphasizes the role of human agency in shaping technology. This theory suggests that technology is not a separate entity with its own intentions and needs, but rather a tool created and used by humans. Technological constructivism recognizes the potential for technology to have a significant impact on the labor market, but also acknowledges the role of human decision-making and social factors in shaping this impact.

One of the key criticisms of technological constructivism is its reifying approach. This theory views abstractions and inanimate objects as if they were sentient beings with intentions and needs. For example, the belief that my phone is mad at me is a manifestation of this approach. This can lead to a distorted understanding of technology and its impact on society.

### Subsection 1.1a Technological Determinism

Technological determinism has been a dominant theory in the field of information technology and the labor market. It has been used to explain the rapid changes in the labor market, particularly in the IT industry. However, as the labor market continues to evolve, it is important to critically examine the assumptions and implications of this theory.

One of the key implications of technological determinism is the belief in technological autonomy. This is the idea that technology is self-generating, rather than invented, implemented, or regulated by human beings. This belief has been challenged by modern theorists of technology and society, who argue that technology is not autonomous, but rather shaped by human values, beliefs, and intentions.

Another implication of technological determinism is the concept of technological imperative. This is the assumption that because we have developed a technology, we must inherently use it, whether people prefer to or not. This can lead to the overuse and misuse of technology, as well as the perpetuation of harmful practices and beliefs.

In conclusion, while technological determinism has been a dominant theory in the field of information technology and the labor market, it is important to critically examine its assumptions and implications. By understanding the complex interactions between technology and society, we can better navigate the ever-changing landscape of the labor market and the role of information technology within it.

### Subsection 1.1b Social Construction of Technology

The social construction of technology is a concept that has gained significant attention in recent years. It is a perspective that challenges the traditional view of technology as a neutral and objective entity, and instead emphasizes the role of social and cultural factors in shaping technology. This perspective aligns with the technological constructivism view discussed in the previous section.

#### The Social Construction of Technology

The social construction of technology is based on the idea that technology is not a separate entity with its own intentions and needs, but rather a tool created and used by humans. This means that technology is not a fixed and universal entity, but rather a product of specific social and cultural contexts. In other words, technology is not a cause of social and cultural change, but rather a reflection of these changes.

This perspective recognizes the potential for technology to have a significant impact on the labor market, but also acknowledges the role of human agency and social factors in shaping this impact. For example, the introduction of new technologies can lead to changes in the labor market, but these changes are not inevitable or universal. They are shaped by social and cultural factors, such as the values and beliefs of society, the power dynamics between different social groups, and the ways in which technology is integrated into existing social and cultural structures.

#### Criticisms of the Social Construction of Technology

Despite its potential insights, the social construction of technology has been subject to various criticisms. One of the main criticisms is its reifying approach, which views abstractions and inanimate objects as if they were sentient beings with intentions and needs. This can lead to a neglect of the material aspects of technology and its potential for objective effects.

Another criticism is its potential to downplay the role of technology in shaping social and cultural change. While the social construction of technology emphasizes the role of social and cultural factors, it can also lead to a neglect of the potential for technology to have its own agency and to shape social and cultural change in significant ways.

#### Conclusion

The social construction of technology provides a valuable perspective on the relationship between technology and society. It emphasizes the role of social and cultural factors in shaping technology, and recognizes the potential for technology to have a significant impact on the labor market. However, it is important to balance this perspective with a recognition of the material aspects of technology and its potential for objective effects.

### Subsection: 2.1a Definition of Expert Systems

Expert systems are a type of knowledge-based system that uses a set of rules and heuristics to make decisions or solve problems. They are designed to mimic the decision-making process of an expert in a particular field, hence the name. Expert systems are often used in situations where the decision-making process is complex and requires a deep understanding of the domain.

The goal of expert systems is to make the critical information required for the system to work explicit rather than implicit. In a traditional computer program, the logic is embedded in code that can typically only be reviewed by an IT specialist. With an expert system, the goal was to specify the rules in a format that was intuitive and easily understood, reviewed, and even edited by domain experts rather than IT experts. This explicit knowledge representation was a significant advantage of expert systems, leading to rapid development and ease of maintenance.

Ease of maintenance is the most obvious benefit of expert systems. This was achieved in two ways. First, by removing the need to write conventional code, many of the normal problems that can be caused by even small changes to a system could be avoided with expert systems. Essentially, the logical flow of the program (at least at the highest level) was simply a given for the system, simply invoke the inference engine. This also was a reason for the second benefit: rapid prototyping. With an expert system shell it was possible to enter a few rules and have a prototype developed in days rather than the months or year typically associated with complex IT projects.

However, the claim that expert system shells removed the need for trained programmers and that experts could develop systems themselves was seldom if ever true. While the rules for an expert system were more comprehensible than typical computer code, they still had a formal syntax where a misplaced comma or other character could cause havoc as with any other computer language. Also, as expert systems moved from prototypes in the lab to deployment in the business world, issues of integration and maintenance became far more critical. Inevitably demands to integrate with, and take advantage of, large legacy databases and systems arose. To accomplish this, integration required the same skills as any other type of system.

In conclusion, expert systems are a powerful tool in the field of information technology, offering advantages such as rapid development and ease of maintenance. However, they also require a deep understanding of the domain and the skills to integrate with existing systems. As such, they are best used in situations where the decision-making process is complex and requires a deep understanding of the domain.





### Subsection: 2.1b Applications of Expert Systems

Expert systems have been applied in a wide range of fields, from medicine to finance, due to their ability to mimic the decision-making process of an expert. In this section, we will explore some of the key applications of expert systems.

#### Medical Diagnosis

One of the most well-known applications of expert systems is in the field of medical diagnosis. Expert systems can be used to assist doctors in making accurate diagnoses by applying a set of rules and heuristics based on medical knowledge. For example, an expert system could be used to help diagnose a patient's symptoms and suggest a course of treatment. This can be particularly useful in situations where a doctor needs to make a quick diagnosis, such as in an emergency room.

#### Financial Analysis

Expert systems have also been used in the field of finance, particularly in portfolio management and risk assessment. By applying a set of rules and heuristics based on financial data and market trends, expert systems can help investors make informed decisions about their portfolios. This can be particularly useful for large investment firms where there is a need to process large amounts of data quickly.

#### Robotics and Automation

Another important application of expert systems is in the field of robotics and automation. Expert systems can be used to control robots and automate processes by applying a set of rules and heuristics based on the task at hand. This can be particularly useful in industries where there is a need for precise and repetitive tasks, such as manufacturing.

### Subsection: 2.1c Impact on Labor Market

The introduction of information technology (IT) and expert systems has had a significant impact on the labor market. As mentioned in the previous section, IT has replaced many tasks that were previously done by human laborers, while also making some workers much more productive. This has led to changes in the demand for different types of skills and has also affected the overall employment landscape.

#### Skill-Biased Technical Change

One of the most significant impacts of IT on the labor market is the phenomenon of skill-biased technical change. This refers to the process by which technology improves wages for educated workers. As IT becomes more integrated into various industries, the demand for workers with specialized skills and knowledge in this area increases. This has led to a growing gap between the wages of highly educated workers and those with lower levels of education.

#### Organizational Complementarities

Another important aspect of the impact of IT on the labor market is the concept of organizational complementarities. This refers to the idea that IT only increases productivity when it is accompanied by changes in organizational structure and processes. For example, a study by Garicano and Heation (2010) found that IT increased the productivity of police departments only when they increased training and expanded support personnel. This highlights the importance of not only investing in IT, but also in the necessary organizational changes to fully realize its potential.

#### Offshoring and Local Labor Markets

The introduction of IT has also led to changes in the geographic and contractual organization of production. With the ability to communicate and collaborate across different locations, many jobs have been offshored, leading to a potential reduction in local employment. However, a recent study found that the potential for manufacturing sector jobs to be offshored did not significantly impact wages in the US. This may be due to the fact that many jobs are still not easily replaceable by computers, and the overall demand for labor remains high.

#### Online Labor Market Platforms

The rise of online labor market platforms, such as Odesk and Amazon Mechanical Turk, has also had an impact on the labor market. These platforms allow for the outsourcing of tasks to workers around the world, further blurring the lines between traditional employment and freelance work. This has led to a growing gig economy, where workers are able to offer their services on a project-by-project basis. This has also created new job opportunities, particularly for those with specialized skills in IT and other fields.

In conclusion, the introduction of IT has had a profound impact on the labor market. While it has led to the replacement of some jobs, it has also created new opportunities and changed the demand for different types of skills. As technology continues to advance, it is important for workers to continuously update their skills and for organizations to invest in both IT and the necessary organizational changes to fully realize its potential.

### Subsection: 4.1c IT and Productivity Paradox

The productivity paradox is a concept that has been widely discussed in the context of information technology (IT) and its impact on productivity. It refers to the apparent contradiction between the observed productivity gains from IT investments and the lack of corresponding increases in output. This paradox has been a subject of debate among economists and researchers, with various hypotheses proposed to explain it.

#### The Lags Due to Learning and Adjustment Hypothesis

The "lags due to learning and adjustment" (lags) hypothesis is one of the most widely accepted explanations for the productivity paradox. This hypothesis suggests that the benefits of IT investments materialize well after the investment takes place. This is because it takes time for organizations to learn how to use IT effectively and adjust their processes accordingly. Surveys of executives and econometric studies have indicated that it might take between two and five years for IT investments to have any impact on organizations that made IT investments.

The lags in IT benefits might also slow down IT investments, as observations of short-term marginal costs and benefits of IT investments might seem irrational. Furthermore, IT investments might require complementary capital investments to be made to be fully productive. Subsequent observations of productivity increases in 2000s may be due to lag effects of IT investments in the 1970s-1990s period.

#### The Redistribution and Dissipation of Profits Hypotheses

The redistribution and dissipation of profits hypotheses rely on the idea that firms might make IT investments that are productive for the firm by capturing more wealth available in their industry, but do not create more wealth in that industry. Some examples of these types of IT investments might be market research, marketing and advertisement investments. These investments help firms compete away market share from firms with less of these IT investments, while they do not improve the total output of the industry as a whole.

#### The Mismanagement of IT Hypotheses

The mismanagement of IT hypotheses suggests that IT investments are really not productive at a firm level, but that decision makers are making the investments nevertheless. These hypotheses suggest that firm level decision-makers make IT investments regardless of the cost and productivity benefits of the investments because of the difficulty in quantifying IT productivity gains.

#### The IT Unproductivity Hypothesis

The IT unproductivity hypothesis is a more recent addition to the list of hypotheses explaining the productivity paradox. This hypothesis suggests that IT investments, despite their potential benefits, can actually lead to a decrease in productivity. This is because IT investments can create a sense of false productivity, where tasks are completed more quickly but with lower quality. This can lead to a decrease in overall productivity, as the time spent correcting errors and redoing tasks can outweigh the time saved by using IT.

In conclusion, the productivity paradox is a complex issue that requires further research and analysis. While the lags due to learning and adjustment hypothesis is currently the most widely accepted explanation, other hypotheses such as the redistribution and dissipation of profits hypotheses, the mismanagement of IT hypotheses, and the IT unproductivity hypothesis also provide valuable insights into the relationship between IT and productivity.
