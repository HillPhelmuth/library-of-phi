### Subsection 1.1a Definition of Calm Technology

Calm technology, also known as calm design, is a type of information technology that aims to create a harmonious and non-intrusive interaction between the user and the technology. It is designed to occur in the user's periphery, rather than constantly demanding their attention. This allows information to smoothly shift to the user's attention when needed, but otherwise remains calmly in the user's periphery.

The concept of calm technology is closely tied to the principles of ubiquitous computing, where computers are seamlessly integrated into everyday life. By minimizing the perceptible invasiveness of computers, calm technology allows for a more natural and unobtrusive interaction between the user and technology.

## Principles

For a technology to be considered calm, it must adhere to three core principles:

1. Awareness: The technology should be aware of the user's context and needs, and adapt accordingly.
2. Adaptability: The technology should be able to adjust its behavior based on the user's preferences and needs.
3. Personalization: The technology should be tailored to the individual user, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.

## History

The term "calm technology" was first published in the article "Designing Calm Technology" by Mark Weiser and John Seely Brown in 1995. It was developed among researchers at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, along with the concept of ubiquitous computing.

Weiser introduced the concept of calm technology by using the example of LiveWire or "Dangling String". This is a string connected to a mounted small electric motor in the ceiling, which is connected to a nearby Ethernet cable. As information flows through the cable, the motor runs faster, causing the string to dangle or whirl depending on the amount of network traffic. This provides a visualization of network traffic without being obtrusive.

## Implementation and Examples

Video conferences are an example of calm technology, as they allow for the conveyance of information such as gestures and facial expressions, which would not be possible in a telephone conference. This provides a more natural and human-like interaction between participants.

Smart homes are another example of calm technology, as they are designed to be aware of the user's presence and adapt accordingly. For example, lights and music can be adjusted based on the user's preferences and schedule.

In conclusion, calm technology is a crucial aspect of pervasive human centric computing. By adhering to the principles of awareness, adaptability, and personalization, technology can be designed to seamlessly integrate into our daily lives without disrupting our natural interactions.

### Section 2.2 Introduction to Python:

Python is a high-level, interpreted, and dynamically typed programming language that has gained popularity in recent years due to its simplicity and versatility. It is widely used in various fields, including web development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence. In this section, we will provide an overview of Python and its key features.

#### 2.2a Python Basics

Python is an object-oriented programming language, meaning that everything in Python is an object, including classes, functions, numbers, and modules. This allows for a more modular and organized approach to programming. Python also supports most object-oriented programming techniques, including polymorphism, not only within a class hierarchy but also by duck typing. This means that any object can be used for any type, and it will work so long as it has the proper methods and attributes.

In version 2.2 of Python, "new-style" classes were introduced. With new-style classes, objects and types were unified, allowing the subclassing of types. This also allowed for the definition of entirely new types, complete with custom behavior for infix operators. This allows for many radical things to be done syntactically within Python. A new method resolution order for multiple inheritance was also adopted with Python 2.3. It is also possible to run custom code while accessing or setting attributes, though the details of those techniques have evolved between Python versions.

One of the key features of Python is its support for the "with" statement, which handles resources. This allows users to work with the Context Manager protocol, which is used to manage resources such as files, databases, and network connections. The "with" statement ensures that resources are properly closed and released, even if an exception is raised during the execution of the block.

### Section: 3.1 Introduction to Bluetooth Programming:

Bluetooth programming is a crucial aspect of pervasive human centric computing, as it allows for the creation of wireless connections between devices. In this section, we will explore the basics of Bluetooth programming, including its architecture, protocols, and security.

#### 3.1a Basics of Bluetooth Programming

Bluetooth programming involves creating applications that can communicate with other devices using the Bluetooth protocol. This is achieved through the use of Bluetooth libraries, which provide a set of functions and APIs for developers to use in their applications.

The architecture of Bluetooth programming is based on the Bluetooth protocol stack, which consists of five layers: the physical layer, the link layer, the host controller interface, the baseband layer, and the application layer. The physical layer is responsible for transmitting and receiving data over the air, while the link layer handles the establishment and management of connections between devices. The host controller interface is responsible for communicating with the Bluetooth controller, while the baseband layer handles the processing of data. Finally, the application layer is where developers can create their own applications and services.

One of the key protocols used in Bluetooth programming is the Simple Function Point (SFP) method. This method is used to measure the complexity of a Bluetooth application and is based on the principles of the International Function Point Users Group (IFPUG). The SFP method takes into account the number of functions, data entities, and user inputs in an application to determine its complexity. This information is then used to estimate the size and effort required for developing the application.

Another important aspect of Bluetooth programming is security. Bluetooth devices are vulnerable to various security threats, such as eavesdropping, jamming, and unauthorized access. To address these threats, the Bluetooth protocol includes security features such as authentication, encryption, and key management. These features are essential for ensuring the privacy and security of data transmitted over Bluetooth connections.

In addition to the Bluetooth protocol, there are also various libraries and frameworks available for Bluetooth programming. These include the BlueCode+ protocol stack, which is chipset and operating system independent and supports all layers of the Bluetooth protocol. It also offers control of profiles and stack functions, as well as direct access to lower level functions. Another popular library is Apache Mynewt NimBLE, which is a full-featured, open source Bluetooth Low Energy 4.2 and 5.0 protocol stack written in C for embedded systems. It supports all layers of the Bluetooth protocol and is designed to work with various microcontroller architectures.

In the next section, we will explore the process of creating a Bluetooth application, including the steps involved and the necessary tools and libraries. We will also discuss the different types of Bluetooth devices and their capabilities, as well as the various profiles and services that can be used in Bluetooth applications.

#### 3.1a Basics of Bluetooth Programming

Bluetooth programming involves creating applications that can communicate with other devices using the Bluetooth protocol. This is achieved through the use of Bluetooth libraries, which provide a set of functions and APIs for developers to use in their applications.

The architecture of Bluetooth programming is based on the Bluetooth protocol stack, which consists of five layers: the physical layer, the link layer, the host controller interface, the baseband layer, and the application layer. The physical layer is responsible for transmitting and receiving data over the air, while the link layer handles the establishment and management of connections between devices. The host controller interface is responsible for communicating with the Bluetooth controller, while the baseband layer handles the processing of data. Finally, the application layer is where developers can create their own applications and services.

One of the key protocols used in Bluetooth programming is the Simple Function Point (SFP) method. This method is used to measure the complexity of a Bluetooth application and is based on the principles of the International Function Point Users Group (IFPUG). The SFP method takes into account the number of functions, data entities, and user inputs in an application to determine its complexity. This information is then used to estimate the size and effort required for developing the application.

Another important aspect of Bluetooth programming is security. Bluetooth devices are vulnerable to various security threats, such as eavesdropping, jamming, and unauthorized access. To address these threats, Bluetooth programming often involves implementing security measures, such as encryption and authentication, to protect sensitive data.

### Libraries and frameworks

The interface to a software library is one type of API. The API describes and prescribes the "expected behavior" (a specification) while the library is an "actual implementation" of this set of rules.

A single API can have multiple implementations (or none, being abstract) in the form of different libraries that share the same programming interface.

The separation of the API from its implementation can allow programs written in one language to use a library written in another. For example, because Scala and Java compile to compatible bytecode, Scala developers can take advantage of any Java API.

API use can vary depending on the type of programming language involved.
An API for a procedural language such as Lua could consist primarily of basic routines to execute code, manipulate data or handle errors while an API for an object-oriented language, such as Java, would provide a specification of classes and its class methods. <anchor|Hyrums>Hyrum's law states that "With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the contract: all observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody." Meanwhile, several studies show that most applications that use an API tend to use a small part of the API.

Language bindings are also APIs. By mapping the features and capabilities of one language to an interface implemented in another language, a language binding allows a library or service written in one language to be used when developing in another language.

Tools such as SWIG and F2PY, a Fortran-to-Python interface, are examples of language bindings. These tools allow for the use of Fortran code in Python programs, providing access to a wide range of scientific computing libraries and tools.

The upgrade also added the ability to show the current battery percentage on the status bar, more consistent behavior for the home key, allows the removal of icons from the home screen's dock, allows the Home key to serve as the deprecated "Menu" key in certain apps by long-pressing (in lieu of displaying it on a black bar on-screen), allows Google Now to be accessed by swiping up from the home button, and adds support for displaying widgets on the lock screen (however, unlike stock Android, only one widget can be placed on the lock screen at a time).

In North America, Android 4.2.2 was only available as the pre-loaded software on Verizon Wireless' HTC One, since HTC considered 4.2 to be relatively minor on smartphones. Instead, North American models were to be upgraded directly to Android 4.3, which was scheduled for a release in late-September 2013. HTC had previously released the Android 4.3 upgrade for the Google Play edition in early August 2013. On 25 September 2013, HTC began rolling out the upgrade, starting with unlocked models. Alongside the internal changes introduced by Android 4.3, the update adds the ability to use custom soundtracks on Highlights videos, and also corrects low-light camera issues.
