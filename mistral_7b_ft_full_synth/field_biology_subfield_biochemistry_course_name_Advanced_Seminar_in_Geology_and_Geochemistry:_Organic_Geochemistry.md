### Introduction

Welcome to Chapter 2 of "Comprehensive Guide to Organic Geochemistry". In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of acetogenic lipids and their fossil counterparts. Acetogenic lipids, also known as isoprenoid hydrocarbons, are a class of organic compounds that play a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They are produced by certain microorganisms and are a major component of the lipid fraction of many biological membranes.

The study of acetogenic lipids and their fossil counterparts is a rapidly evolving field in organic geochemistry. It has significant implications for our understanding of the Earth's history, as these compounds can provide valuable insights into past environmental conditions and the evolution of life on our planet.

In this chapter, we will explore the biosynthesis of acetogenic lipids, their distribution in various biological systems, and their role in the formation of fossil fuels. We will also discuss the analytical techniques used to study these compounds and their applications in environmental and forensic investigations.

We hope that this chapter will serve as a comprehensive guide to acetogenic lipids and their fossil counterparts, providing you with a solid foundation in this exciting and rapidly evolving field. So, let's embark on this journey together and discover the wonders of acetogenic lipids and their fossil counterparts.




### Subsection: 2.1 Chain-length, Branching Systematics and Isotopic Compositions - Indicators of Biological Sources

#### 2.1a Chain-length and Branching Systematics

The chain-length and branching systematics of acetogenic lipids and their fossil counterparts provide valuable insights into their biological sources. The chain-length of these lipids is typically even-numbered, reflecting the biosynthetic pathway where two carbon atoms are added at each step. This is in contrast to odd-numbered chain-lengths, which are more commonly found in petroleum hydrocarbons and are thought to originate from thermal cracking of larger molecules.

The branching systematics of acetogenic lipids can also be informative. For instance, the presence of isoprenoid hydrocarbons with five carbon atoms (C5) is a characteristic feature of archaea. These C5 isoprenoids are typically found in the form of biphytane, a compound that is exclusive to archaea except for halophilic Archaea. The abundance ratio of biphytane to phytane can be used to distinguish between different groups of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) from marine sediments, with higher abundance in ANME-1 than -2.

#### 2.1b Isotopic Compositions

The isotopic compositions of acetogenic lipids and their fossil counterparts can also provide valuable insights into their biological sources. Isotopic compositions are typically measured using mass spectrometry, which can determine the relative abundance of different isotopes of the same element.

For instance, the δ<sup>13</sup>C values of acetogenic lipids can be used to infer the carbon source used by the organisms that produced them. Methanotrophs, for instance, utilize isotopically light carbon sources, resulting in very negative carbon isotope values. This can be contrasted with the δ<sup>13</sup>C values of biphytanic diacids and GDGT-derived biphytane from the same sediments, which can provide insights into the sources of these compounds.

In a study by Ventura et al. (2006), solvent-extractable hydrocarbons with GC-MS were measured from metasedimentary rocks sampled from the Tisdale and Porcupine Assemblage (2,707 to 2685 Ma) near Timmins, ON, Canada. The authors were able to conclude that the compounds were not of post-Archaean origin due to the reduced adsorptive capacity and restricted porosity of the sediments. This study provides a clear example of how isotopic compositions can be used to infer the age of acetogenic lipids and their fossil counterparts.

In conclusion, the chain-length, branching systematics, and isotopic compositions of acetogenic lipids and their fossil counterparts provide valuable insights into their biological sources. These properties can be used in conjunction with other analytical techniques to provide a comprehensive understanding of the biogeochemical processes that have shaped our planet over billions of years.

#### 2.1c Isotopic Compositions - Indicators of Environmental Conditions

The isotopic compositions of acetogenic lipids and their fossil counterparts can also serve as indicators of environmental conditions. The δ<sup>13</sup>C values of these lipids can provide insights into the carbon sources available in the environment, as well as the metabolic pathways of the organisms that produced them.

For instance, the δ<sup>13</sup>C values of acetogenic lipids can be used to infer the carbon source used by the organisms that produced them. Methanotrophs, for instance, utilize isotopically light carbon sources, resulting in very negative carbon isotope values. This can be contrasted with the δ<sup>13</sup>C values of biphytanic diacids and GDGT-derived biphytane from the same sediments, which can provide insights into the sources of these compounds.

The δ<sup>18</sup>O values of acetogenic lipids can also provide insights into the environmental conditions. For instance, the δ<sup>18</sup>O values of biphytane have been used to infer the temperature of the environment in which the organisms that produced them lived. This is because the δ<sup>18</sup>O values of biphytane are sensitive to temperature, with higher temperatures resulting in more positive δ<sup>18</sup>O values.

In a study by Ventura et al. (2006), the δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O values of biphytane and other acetogenic lipids were measured from metasedimentary rocks sampled from the Tisdale and Porcupine Assemblage (2,707 to 2685 Ma) near Timmins, ON, Canada. The authors found that the δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O values of biphytane were similar to those of other acetogenic lipids, suggesting that biphytane was produced by the same organisms. This study provides a clear example of how the isotopic compositions of acetogenic lipids can be used to infer the environmental conditions in which they were produced.

In conclusion, the isotopic compositions of acetogenic lipids and their fossil counterparts provide valuable insights into the biological sources and environmental conditions of these compounds. These insights can be used to reconstruct the past environments and the organisms that inhabited them.

#### 2.1d Applications of Chain-length, Branching Systematics and Isotopic Compositions

For instance, the presence of isoprenoid hydrocarbons with five carbon atoms (C5) is a characteristic feature of archaea. These C5 isoprenoids are typically found in the form of biphytane, a compound that is exclusive to archaea except for halophilic Archaea. The abundance ratio of biphytane to phytane can be used to distinguish between different groups of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) from marine sediments, with higher abundance in ANME-1 than -2.

Methanotrophs, for instance, utilize isotopically light carbon sources, resulting in very negative carbon isotope values. This can be contrasted with the δ<sup>13</sup>C values of biphytanic diacids and GDGT-derived biphytane from the same sediments, which can provide insights into the sources of these compounds.

The isotopic compositions of acetogenic lipids can also be used to reconstruct past environments. For instance, the δ<sup>18</sup>O values of biphytane have been used to infer the temperature of the environment in which the organisms that produced them lived. This is because the δ<sup>18</sup>O values of biphytane are sensitive to temperature, with higher temperatures resulting in more positive δ<sup>18</sup>O values.

Finally, the chain-length, branching systematics, and isotopic compositions of acetogenic lipids can be used to understand biogeochemical processes. For instance, the abundance ratio of biphytane to phytane can be used to understand the metabolic pathways of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME). Similarly, the δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O values of biphytane can be used to understand the carbon and oxygen isotope fractionations during the biosynthesis of biphytane.

In conclusion, the chain-length, branching systematics, and isotopic compositions of acetogenic lipids and their fossil counterparts provide a powerful tool for the study of organic geochemistry. These tools can be used to identify biological sources, reconstruct past environments, and understand biogeochemical processes.

Another important biomarker of ANME is the isotopic composition of acetogenic lipids. The δ<sup>13</sup>C values of these lipids can be used to infer the carbon source used by the organisms that produced them. Methanotrophs, for instance, utilize isotopically light carbon sources, resulting in very negative carbon isotope values. This can be contrasted with the δ<sup>13</sup>C values of biphytanic diacids and GDGT-derived biphytane from the same sediments, which can provide insights into the sources of these compounds.

(2006), used advanced analytical techniques such as mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to identify and characterize specific lipid molecules.

The results of this study provided valuable insights into the metabolic pathways of ANME. For instance, the δ<sup>13</sup>C values of the acetogenic lipids were found to be very negative, indicating the utilization of isotopically light carbon sources. This was contrasted with the δ<sup>13</sup>C values of biphytanic diacids and GDGT-derived biphytane, which provided insights into the sources of these compounds.

Furthermore, the δ<sup>18</sup>O values of biphytane were used to infer the temperature of the environment in which the organisms that produced them lived. This is because the δ<sup>18</sup>O values of biphytane are sensitive to temperature, with higher temperatures resulting in more positive δ<sup>18</sup>O values.

This case study, along with others, has greatly advanced our understanding of ANME and their role in the global carbon cycle. It has also highlighted the importance of advanced analytical techniques in the study of these organisms.

### Subsection: 2.2 Algeanans: Functional Roles and Geological Patterns of Occurrence

#### 2.2a Functional Roles of Algeanans

Algeanans, a group of acetogenic lipids, play a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nutrients in marine and terrestrial environments. They are produced by a diverse group of microorganisms, including archaea, bacteria, and some eukaryotes. The functional roles of algeanans are primarily related to their ability to serve as structural components of cell membranes, energy storage molecules, and signaling molecules.

Algeanans are a major component of the lipid fraction of microbial biomass. They are particularly abundant in anoxic environments, where they can account for up to 80% of the total lipid extract. This high abundance is due to their role as structural components of cell membranes. Algeanans are also involved in energy storage, particularly in the form of triacylglycerols (TAGs). These lipids serve as a reserve of energy and carbon, which can be mobilized when conditions are favorable for growth.

In addition to their structural and energy storage roles, algeanans also play a crucial role in signaling. For instance, the presence of isoprenoid hydrocarbons, such as biphytane, can be used to distinguish between different groups of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) from marine sediments. The abundance ratio of biphytane to phytane can be used to distinguish between ANME-1 and ANME-2, with higher abundance in ANME-1.

The functional roles of algeanans are closely tied to their geological patterns of occurrence. Algeanans are typically found in anoxic environments, where they can serve as indicators of anoxia. They are also associated with hydrocarbon seeps, where they can serve as a source of hydrocarbons. The geological patterns of occurrence of algeanans can provide valuable insights into the history of the Earth's oceans and atmosphere.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the geological patterns of occurrence of algeanans, focusing on their distribution in different geological settings and their implications for the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nutrients.

#### 2.2b Geological Patterns of Occurrence of Algeanans

The geological patterns of occurrence of algeanans are largely influenced by the environmental conditions in which they are produced. As mentioned earlier, algeanans are primarily found in anoxic environments, where they can serve as indicators of anoxia. This is because the production of algeanans is closely tied to the metabolic processes of anaerobic microorganisms, which are unable to thrive in the presence of oxygen.

In the Santos Basin, for instance, algeanans have been found in the Camburi Group (Albian-Cenomanian, lower post-salt sequence) and the Frade Group (Turonian-Maastrichtian, middle post-salt sequence). These formations are characterized by their anoxic conditions, which are reflected in the high abundance of algeanans.

The Camburi Group, which includes the Florianópolis, Guarujá, and Itanhaém formations, is particularly rich in algeanans. The Florianópolis Formation, for instance, consists of reddish, fine to coarse-grained sandstones with a clay matrix, reddish micaceous shales and siltstones. These clastic units are thought to represent alluvial environments distributed along the western Brazilian basin margin, along the Santos Hinge Line. The alluvial environments were gradational towards the east, with the shallow marine carbonates of the Guarujá Formation, and further to the open basin with the siltstones of the Itanhaém Formation. The Guarujá Formation, in particular, is known for its high abundance of algeanans, which is likely a reflection of the anoxic conditions prevailing in this formation.

Similarly, the Frade Group, which includes the Santos, Itajaí-Açu, and Juréia formations, is also rich in algeanans. The Santos Formation, for instance, is known for its high abundance of algeanans, which is likely a reflection of the anoxic conditions prevailing in this formation.

In addition to their abundance in anoxic environments, algeanans are also associated with hydrocarbon seeps. This is because they can serve as a source of hydrocarbons, particularly in the form of triacylglycerols (TAGs). The association of algeanans with hydrocarbon seeps can provide valuable insights into the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nutrients in these environments.

In conclusion, the geological patterns of occurrence of algeanans are largely influenced by the environmental conditions in which they are produced. Their high abundance in anoxic environments and their association with hydrocarbon seeps make them valuable indicators of anoxia and hydrocarbon seeps.

### Subsection: 3.3 Structure vs. Physiology

In the previous section, we explored the structural diversity of isoprenoid lipids and their sources in archaeal and non-archaeal organisms. However, it is important to note that the structure of these lipids is not solely determined by their source. In fact, the structure of isoprenoid lipids can vary greatly even within the same organism, depending on the specific physiological needs of the organism.

#### 3.3a Structural Variations in Isoprenoid Lipids

Isoprenoid lipids can vary in structure due to a variety of factors, including the type of organism, the specific physiological needs of the organism, and the environmental conditions in which the organism lives. For example, archaeal organisms, which are extremophiles, often have unique lipid structures that allow them to survive in extreme environments.

One example of this is the archaeal species Halobacterium salinarum, which lives in extremely saline environments. This organism has a high affinity for bromide ions, and as a result, its lipids contain a high proportion of brominated isoprenoid lipids. These lipids are essential for the survival of H. salinarum in its extreme environment.

In addition to environmental factors, the physiological needs of an organism can also influence the structure of isoprenoid lipids. For example, in mammals, the structure of isoprenoid lipids can vary depending on the specific tissue or cell type. In the brain, for example, cholesterol is the dominant isoprenoid lipid, while in other tissues, other types of isoprenoid lipids may be more prevalent.

Furthermore, the structure of isoprenoid lipids can also vary depending on the specific physiological processes occurring within an organism. For example, during pregnancy, the structure of isoprenoid lipids in the maternal and fetal tissues can change to support the development and growth of the fetus.

Overall, the structure of isoprenoid lipids is not solely determined by their source, but rather by a complex interplay of environmental, physiological, and developmental factors. Understanding these variations is crucial for understanding the role of isoprenoid lipids in various biological processes.

### Subsection: 5.1a Formation by Bacteria and Eukaryotes

Steroids are essential for the functioning of all living organisms, and their biosynthesis is a complex process that involves a series of enzymatic reactions. In this section, we will explore the biosynthesis of steroids in bacteria and eukaryotes, focusing on the unique aspects of each.

#### 5.1a.1 Bacterial Steroid Biosynthesis

Bacteria are prokaryotes, meaning they lack a nucleus and other organelles found in eukaryotic cells. Despite this, they are capable of synthesizing steroids, albeit through a different pathway than eukaryotes. The biosynthesis of steroids in bacteria begins with the condensation of two molecules of acetyl-CoA to form acetoacetyl-CoA, a reaction catalyzed by acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase. This is followed by the reduction of acetoacetyl-CoA to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA), a reaction catalyzed by HMG-CoA synthase.

The next step in bacterial steroid biosynthesis is the cleavage of HMG-CoA to form mevalonate, a reaction catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase. Mevalonate is then phosphorylated to form mevalonate-5-phosphate, which is then decarboxylated to form isopentenyl pyrophosphate. This is followed by the formation of farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, which are then used to form squalene.

The final step in bacterial steroid biosynthesis is the cyclization of squalene to form lanosterol, a reaction catalyzed by squalene cyclase. Lanosterol is then modified to form various steroids, including cholesterol, which is the precursor for all other steroids in bacteria.

#### 5.1a.2 Eukaryotic Steroid Biosynthesis

In contrast to bacteria, eukaryotes have a more complex pathway for steroid biosynthesis. The biosynthesis of steroids in eukaryotes begins with the condensation of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to form acetoacetyl-CoA, a reaction catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase. This is followed by the reduction of acetoacetyl-CoA to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA), a reaction catalyzed by HMG-CoA synthase.

The next step in eukaryotic steroid biosynthesis is the cleavage of HMG-CoA to form mevalonate, a reaction catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase. Mevalonate is then phosphorylated to form mevalonate-5-phosphate, which is then decarboxylated to form isopentenyl pyrophosphate. This is followed by the formation of farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, which are then used to form squalene.

However, unlike in bacteria, the cyclization of squalene to form lanosterol is not catalyzed by squalene cyclase in eukaryotes. Instead, squalene is first converted to 2,3-oxidosqualene, which is then cyclized to form lanosterol by lanosterol synthase. Lanosterol is then modified to form various steroids, including cholesterol, which is the precursor for all other steroids in eukaryotes.

#### 5.1a.3 Comparison of Bacterial and Eukaryotic Steroid Biosynthesis

Despite the differences in the pathways, both bacteria and eukaryotes rely on the same enzymes for the initial steps of steroid biosynthesis. This includes acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, HMG-CoA synthase, and HMG-CoA reductase. However, the final steps of steroid biosynthesis differ significantly between the two groups.

In bacteria, the cyclization of squalene to form lanosterol is catalyzed by squalene cyclase, while in eukaryotes, this step is catalyzed by lanosterol synthase. Additionally, the modification of lanosterol to form various steroids differs between bacteria and eukaryotes. In bacteria, lanosterol is modified to form cholesterol, while in eukaryotes, lanosterol is modified to form various other steroids, including ergosterol and cholesterol.

Overall, the biosynthesis of steroids in bacteria and eukaryotes is a complex process that involves a series of enzymatic reactions. Despite the differences in the pathways, both groups rely on the same enzymes for the initial steps of steroid biosynthesis, highlighting the importance of these enzymes in the production of steroids. 





### Subsection: 5.1b Role of Oxygen

Oxygen plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of steroids in both bacteria and eukaryotes. In bacteria, oxygen is required for the final step of steroid biosynthesis, the cyclization of squalene to form lanosterol. This reaction is catalyzed by squalene cyclase, an enzyme that is sensitive to oxygen levels. In the absence of oxygen, the enzyme is unable to function, leading to a decrease in steroid production.

In eukaryotes, oxygen is also essential for steroid biosynthesis, but its role is more complex. Oxygen is required for the production of cholesterol, the precursor for all other steroids in eukaryotes. Cholesterol is synthesized from acetyl-CoA through a series of reactions that involve the use of molecular oxygen. Specifically, the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is responsible for the reduction of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, requires molecular oxygen as a cofactor. In the absence of oxygen, this enzyme is unable to function, leading to a decrease in cholesterol production.

Furthermore, oxygen is also required for the oxidation of cholesterol to form various steroids. For example, the oxidation of cholesterol to form bile acids involves the use of molecular oxygen. This oxidation step is catalyzed by the enzyme cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase, which is also sensitive to oxygen levels. In the absence of oxygen, this enzyme is unable to function, leading to a decrease in bile acid production.

In summary, oxygen plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of steroids in both bacteria and eukaryotes. Its presence is required for the final step of steroid biosynthesis in bacteria and for the production and oxidation of cholesterol in eukaryotes. The sensitivity of key enzymes to oxygen levels highlights the importance of oxygen in the regulation of steroid biosynthesis.

Departmental seminars are held within a specific department and cover a wide range of topics. Research seminars, on the other hand, focus on a specific research topic and are often presented by experts in the field. Special seminars are held on specific occasions, such as conferences or workshops, and cover a specific topic in depth.

#### 5.1c.3 The Role of Seminars in Steroid Research

#### 6.1b Bacteria and Eukaryotes

Bacteria and eukaryotes are two major groups of organisms that play a crucial role in the production of biogenic organic matter. In this section, we will explore the unique characteristics and contributions of these organisms to the Earth's carbon cycle.

##### Bacteria

Bacteria are single-celled microorganisms that lack a nucleus and other organelles. They are ubiquitous in the environment and play a vital role in the cycling of carbon and other elements. Bacteria are known for their ability to produce a diverse range of organic compounds, including mono-, sesqui-, di-, and triterpenoids.

Mono- and sesqui-terpenoids are isoprenoids that are produced by bacteria. Isoprenoids are a class of organic compounds that are derived from the five-carbon isoprene unit. Mono- and sesqui-terpenoids are essential for the growth and survival of bacteria, and they are also known for their diverse biological activities. For example, the sesquiterpenoid amrinone has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, while the monoterpenoid (+)-CPCA has been found to have antimicrobial activity.

Di- and triterpenoids are also produced by bacteria, although they are less common than mono- and sesqui-terpenoids. These compounds are known for their diverse biological activities, including their role in the regulation of gene expression and their ability to inhibit the growth of other microorganisms.

The production of terpenoids by bacteria is influenced by various factors, including the availability of nutrients and the presence of other microorganisms. For example, the production of terpenoids by bacteria can be enhanced by the presence of other bacteria that produce essential nutrients or by the absence of competing microorganisms.

##### Eukaryotes

Eukaryotes are organisms that have a nucleus and other organelles. They include a diverse range of organisms, from single-celled protists to complex multicellular organisms. Eukaryotes play a crucial role in the production of biogenic organic matter, particularly in the oceans.

One of the most significant contributions of eukaryotes to the Earth's carbon cycle is their role in the production of marine snow. Marine snow is a term used to describe the aggregation of organic and inorganic particles in the ocean. These particles are primarily produced by eukaryotic organisms, such as diatoms and other phytoplankton.

Marine snow plays a crucial role in the carbon cycle by transporting carbon-rich particles from the surface of the ocean to the deep sea. This process helps to sequester carbon from the atmosphere and store it in the ocean. Additionally, marine snow provides a habitat for a diverse range of organisms, including bacteria, which play a vital role in the cycling of carbon and other elements.

In conclusion, bacteria and eukaryotes are two major groups of organisms that play a crucial role in the production of biogenic organic matter. Their unique characteristics and contributions to the Earth's carbon cycle make them essential components of the organic geochemical cycle. In the next section, we will explore the role of other organisms, such as archaea and protists, in the production of biogenic organic matter.





#### 6.1c Bacteriohopanepolyols

Bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs) are a class of organic compounds that are produced by bacteria. They are a type of isoprenoid, similar to terpenoids, but with a unique structure that sets them apart from other isoprenoids.

These terpenoids are produced by certain types of plankton, and their presence or absence can indicate the health and activity of these organisms.

For instance, the accumulation phase of the plankton cycle is marked by an increase in the production of diterpenoids and triterpenoids. This increase is indicative of the growth and reproduction of plankton, which is a key factor in the accumulation phase.

On the other hand, the climax transition phase is characterized by a decrease in the production of these terpenoids. This decrease is often associated with a shift in the plankton community, as certain types of plankton decline and others rise in abundance.

Finally, the depletion phase is marked by a further decrease in the production of terpenoids, which is often associated with the depletion of nutrients in the water column.

In conclusion, plant-derived terpenoids, specifically diterpenoids and triterpenoids, are powerful tools for studying changes in the North Atlantic plankton community over time. Their presence or absence can provide valuable insights into the health and activity of the plankton community, and their production patterns can help track the progression of the plankton cycle.

#### 7.1b Diterpenoids and Triterpenoids in Plants

Plants are a rich source of terpenoids, and diterpenoids and triterpenoids are among the most abundant. These compounds are produced by the mevalonate pathway, a key metabolic pathway in plants that is responsible for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, including terpenoids.

Diterpenoids and triterpenoids are typically produced by the cyclization of two and three isoprene units, respectively. The cyclization process results in the formation of a variety of compounds, each with its own unique structure and properties.

For instance, diterpenoids can be cyclized to form a variety of compounds, including phytol, a compound that is found in chlorophyll and is essential for photosynthesis. Triterpenoids, on the other hand, can be cyclized to form a variety of compounds, including steroids, which are essential for cell membrane structure and function.

The production of diterpenoids and triterpenoids is influenced by a variety of factors, including environmental conditions and the presence of certain enzymes. For instance, the enzyme squalene synthase is essential for the production of triterpenoids, and its activity can be influenced by factors such as temperature and nutrient availability.

In addition to their role in plant metabolism, diterpenoids and triterpenoids also play a crucial role in plant defense. These compounds can act as phytoalexins, compounds that are produced in response to injury or infection and can help protect the plant from pathogens.

In conclusion, diterpenoids and triterpenoids are important components of the plant kingdom. They play a crucial role in plant metabolism, defense, and communication, and their study is essential for understanding the complex interactions between plants and their environment.

### Section: 7.1b Seminar on Triterpenoids

#### 7.1b(i) Introduction to Triterpenoids

Triterpenoids are a class of terpenes that are composed of six isoprene units with the molecular formula C<sub>30</sub>H<sub>48</sub>. They are found in a wide range of natural sources, including plants, animals, and fungi. Triterpenoids are particularly important in organic geochemistry due to their diverse structures and functions.

Triterpenoids exist in a great variety of structures. Nearly 200 different skeletons have been identified. These skeletons may be broadly divided according to the number of rings present. In general, pentacyclic structures (5 rings) tend to dominate.

Squalene is a key example of a triterpene. It is biosynthesized through the head-to-head condensation of two farnesyl pyrophosphate units. This coupling converts a pair of C15 components into a C30 product. Squalene serves as precursor for the formation of many triterpenoids, including bacterial hopanoids and eukaryotic sterols.

#### 7.1b(ii) Triterpenoids as Biomarkers

Triterpenoids, like diterpenoids, play a crucial role in the NAAMES study as biomarkers for tracking changes in the plankton community over time. They are produced by certain types of plankton, and their presence or absence can indicate the health and activity of these organisms.

For instance, the accumulation phase of the plankton cycle is marked by an increase in the production of triterpenoids. This increase is indicative of the growth and reproduction of plankton, which is a key factor in the accumulation phase.

On the other hand, the climax transition phase is characterized by a decrease in the production of these triterpenoids. This decrease is often associated with a shift in the plankton community, as certain types of plankton decline and others rise in abundance.

Finally, the depletion phase is marked by a further decrease in triterpenoid production, indicating a decline in plankton activity.

#### 7.1b(iii) Triterpenoid Saponins

Triterpenoid saponins are a specific type of triterpenoid that belong to the saponin group of compounds. They are produced by plants as part of their self-defense mechanism. Important sub-classes of triterpenoid saponins include ginsenosides and eleutherosides.

Ginsenosides, for instance, are a group of triterpenoid saponins found in the root of the plant Panax ginseng. They have been extensively studied for their potential health benefits, including their ability to lower blood sugar and cholesterol levels.

Eleutherosides, on the other hand, are a group of triterpenoid saponins found in the root of the plant Eleutherococcus senticosus. They have been shown to have adaptogenic properties, meaning they can help the body adapt to stress and fatigue.

In conclusion, triterpenoids, like diterpenoids, are a crucial part of organic geochemistry. Their diverse structures and functions make them valuable biomarkers for tracking changes in the plankton community over time. Their presence or absence can provide valuable insights into the health and activity of these organisms.

#### 7.1b(iv) Triterpenoid Synthesis

The synthesis of triterpenoids is a complex process that involves multiple steps and enzymes. The first step in the synthesis of triterpenoids is the condensation of two farnesyl pyrophosphate units. This condensation is catalyzed by the enzyme squalene synthase, which converts two C15 components into a C30 product, squalene.

Squalene is then converted into various triterpenoids through a series of oxidation and reduction reactions. These reactions are catalyzed by a variety of enzymes, including oxidosqualene cyclase, lanosterol synthase, and cycloartenol synthase.

The final step in the synthesis of triterpenoids is the conversion of the intermediate product into the desired triterpenoid. This step is often specific to the type of triterpenoid being synthesized and is catalyzed by a variety of enzymes, including sterol 4-alpha-carboxylase, sterol 4-alpha-monooxygenase, and sterol 24-alpha-hydroxylase.

The synthesis of triterpenoids is a highly regulated process that is essential for the survival of the organism. Any disruption in this process can have significant impacts on the organism's health and development.

#### 7.1b(v) Triterpenoid Structures

Triterpenoids exist in a great variety of structures. Nearly 200 different skeletons have been identified. These skeletons may be broadly divided according to the number of rings present. In general, pentacyclic structures (5 rings) tend to dominate.

The structures of triterpenoids are highly diverse and complex. They can be linear, branched, or cyclic, and can contain a variety of functional groups, including hydroxyl, carboxyl, and methyl groups. The structure of a triterpenoid can provide valuable information about its origin and function.

For example, the presence of a hydroxyl group at a specific position in a triterpenoid can indicate that it is derived from a plant source. On the other hand, the presence of a methyl group at the same position can suggest a bacterial origin.

The structure of a triterpenoid can also provide insights into its biological activity. For instance, triterpenoids with a pentacyclic structure have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties.

In conclusion, the study of triterpenoid structures is a crucial aspect of organic geochemistry. It allows us to understand the origin, function, and biological activity of these important compounds.

### Subsection: 8.1a Seminar on the Permian-Triassic Boundary Extinction

#### 8.1a.1 Introduction to the Permian-Triassic Boundary Extinction

The Permian-Triassic boundary extinction event, also known as the Great Dying, was the most severe mass extinction event in the history of life on Earth. It occurred approximately 252 million years ago, marking the end of the Permian Period and the beginning of the Triassic Period. This event resulted in the loss of up to 95% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial species, including many of the dominant life forms of the time.

The causes of this extinction event are still a subject of ongoing research, but it is believed that a combination of factors, including volcanic activity, ocean acidification, and changes in sea level, contributed to the loss of biodiversity. The Selli Event, a spike in marine productivity, is also believed to have played a role in the extinction event.

#### 8.1a.2 Pigment-Derived Biomarkers and the Permian-Triassic Boundary Extinction

Pigment-derived biomarkers, particularly porphyrins and carotenoids, have been instrumental in studying the Permian-Triassic boundary extinction event. These biomarkers are preserved in sedimentary rocks and can provide insights into the types of organisms that were present during the event.

Porphyrins, which are the building blocks of chlorophyll and other pigments, have been used to study the changes in marine productivity during the Selli Event. The increase in marine productivity during this event, as indicated by the spike in porphyrin levels, is believed to have been driven by an increase in iron availability, likely due to an increase in sulphate flux from volcanism.

Carotenoids, on the other hand, have been used to study the effects of ocean acidification on marine organisms. The decrease in pH of seawater during the Permian-Triassic boundary extinction event is believed to have affected the solubility of carbonate minerals, leading to ocean acidification. This change in pH is believed to have had a significant impact on the growth and survival of marine organisms, particularly those that rely on calcium carbonate for shell formation.

#### 8.1a.3 Future Directions in the Study of the Permian-Triassic Boundary Extinction

Despite significant progress in understanding the Permian-Triassic boundary extinction event, many questions remain unanswered. Future research is needed to further investigate the role of pigment-derived biomarkers in this event, as well as to explore other potential factors that may have contributed to the extinction.

Advancements in analytical techniques, such as mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance, will also be crucial in furthering our understanding of this event. These techniques allow for the identification and quantification of specific pigment-derived biomarkers, providing more detailed insights into the types of organisms that were present during the event.

In conclusion, the study of pigment-derived biomarkers has been instrumental in our understanding of the Permian-Triassic boundary extinction event. As we continue to unravel the complexities of this event, these biomarkers will undoubtedly play a crucial role in our efforts to understand the causes and impacts of this catastrophic event.




### Subsection: 8.1b Diagenesis and Catagenesis

#### 8.1b.1 Diagenesis

Diagenesis is a process that occurs after the deposition of sediments and before the formation of rock. It involves the alteration of sediments through physical, chemical, and biological processes. The primary goal of diagenesis is to stabilize the sediments and convert them into solid rock. This process is crucial in the formation of sedimentary rocks, including banded iron formations (BIFs).

The diagenesis of BIFs is a complex process that involves the conversion of iron hydroxide and silica gels to solid rock. The oxidation of ferrous to ferric iron likely caused the iron to precipitate out as a ferric hydroxide gel. Similarly, the silica component of the banded iron formations likely precipitated as a hydrous silica gel. The conversion of these gels to banded iron formation is an example of diagenesis.

The diagenesis of BIFs is also influenced by the Great Oxidation Event, which occurred approximately 2.4 billion years ago. This event led to an increase in the concentration of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere, which in turn increased the oxidation of iron in the sediments. This oxidation of iron is believed to have played a significant role in the formation of BIFs.

#### 8.1b.2 Catagenesis

Catagenesis is a process that occurs after the diagenesis of sediments and before the formation of metamorphic rocks. It involves the alteration of sediments through high-temperature and high-pressure processes. The primary goal of catagenesis is to convert sediments into metamorphic rocks.

The catagenesis of BIFs is a complex process that involves the alteration of iron-rich minerals under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. This process can lead to the formation of new minerals, such as magnetite, which is a common mineral found in BIFs. The catagenesis of BIFs is also influenced by the composition of the original sediments, as well as the temperature and pressure conditions experienced during metamorphism.

In conclusion, the diagenesis and catagenesis of BIFs are crucial processes in the formation of these unique iron-rich sedimentary rocks. These processes are influenced by a variety of factors, including the Great Oxidation Event and the composition of the original sediments. Understanding these processes is essential for studying the evolution of the Earth's oceans and atmosphere.

### Subsection: 8.1c Organic Matter Preservation

#### 8.1c.1 Organic Matter Preservation in Sediments

The preservation of organic matter in sediments is a crucial aspect of organic geochemistry. It involves the protection of organic compounds from degradation and alteration by physical, chemical, and biological processes. The preservation of organic matter is essential for the study of past environments and the reconstruction of paleoenvironments.

The preservation of organic matter in sediments is influenced by several factors, including the type of sediment, the redox conditions, and the presence of biomarkers. Sediments with high organic matter content, such as black shales, are more likely to preserve organic matter due to their high hydrogen index and low oxygen index. The redox conditions of the sediment also play a significant role in organic matter preservation. Anaerobic conditions, where oxygen is limited, are more conducive to the preservation of organic matter.

Biomarkers, which are specific organic compounds that are produced by living organisms, can also play a crucial role in the preservation of organic matter. These biomarkers can provide valuable information about the type of organisms that were present in the sediment and the environmental conditions they experienced. For example, the presence of certain biomarkers, such as hopanoids, can indicate the presence of bacteria in the sediment.

#### 8.1c.2 Organic Matter Preservation in Sedimentary Rocks

The preservation of organic matter in sedimentary rocks is a complex process that involves the conversion of sediments into solid rock. This process, known as diagenesis, can alter the composition of organic matter and affect its preservation. However, certain types of sedimentary rocks, such as black shales and limestones, are more likely to preserve organic matter due to their high organic matter content and low diagenetic alteration.

The preservation of organic matter in sedimentary rocks is also influenced by the type of organic matter present. For example, lipids, which are a type of organic matter, are more likely to be preserved in sedimentary rocks than proteins. This is because lipids are more resistant to degradation and alteration by physical, chemical, and biological processes.

#### 8.1c.3 Organic Matter Preservation in Fossil Fuels

The preservation of organic matter in fossil fuels, such as petroleum and natural gas, is a crucial aspect of organic geochemistry. These fuels are primarily composed of hydrocarbons, which are organic compounds that contain hydrogen and carbon. The preservation of organic matter in fossil fuels is influenced by several factors, including the type of sediment, the redox conditions, and the presence of biomarkers.

The preservation of organic matter in fossil fuels is essential for the production of energy and the study of past environments. However, the extraction and use of fossil fuels can also have significant environmental impacts, including the release of greenhouse gases and the alteration of sedimentary rocks. Therefore, it is crucial to understand and manage the preservation of organic matter in sediments and sedimentary rocks to ensure a sustainable future.

### Subsection: 8.1d Kerogen Formation

Kerogen, a complex mixture of organic compounds, is a major component of sedimentary rocks. It is formed during the process of sedimentary diagenesis, which is the transformation of sediments into solid rock. The formation of kerogen is a crucial step in the preservation of organic matter in sediments.

#### 8.1d.1 Kerogen Formation from Organic Matter

Kerogen is primarily formed from the degradation of living matter, such as lacustrine and marine algae and plankton, and terrestrial higher-order plants. During diagenesis, large biopolymers from these organisms, such as proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, decompose partially or completely. This breakdown process can be viewed as the reverse of photosynthesis.

The resulting units from this breakdown process can then polycondense to form geopolymers. These geopolymers are large molecules with diverse chemical compositions and large molecular weights. The smallest units are the fulvic acids, the medium units are the humic acids, and the largest units are the humins. This polymerization usually happens alongside the formation and/or sedimentation of one or more mineral components, resulting in a sedimentary rock like oil shale.

#### 8.1d.2 Kerogen Formation and Thermal Maturity

The formation of kerogen is closely linked to the concept of thermal maturity. As sediments are buried deeper and subjected to higher temperatures and pressures, the kerogen undergoes changes in its composition. These changes include the loss of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and their associated functional groups, and subsequent isomerization and aromatization.

Aromatization allows for molecular stacking in sheets, which in turn drives changes in physical characteristics of kerogen, such as increasing molecular density, "vitrinite reflectance", and spore coloration (yellow to orange to brown to black with increasing depth/thermal maturity). These changes are indicative of the thermal maturity state of kerogen.

#### 8.1d.3 Kerogen Formation and Organic Matter Preservation

The formation of kerogen plays a crucial role in the preservation of organic matter in sediments. As kerogen is formed, it protects the original organic matter from further degradation and alteration by physical, chemical, and biological processes. This protection is essential for the study of past environments and the reconstruction of paleoenvironments.

In addition, the composition of kerogen can provide valuable information about the type of organisms that were present in the sediment and the environmental conditions they experienced. For example, the presence of certain biomarkers, such as hopanoids, can indicate the presence of bacteria in the sediment.

In conclusion, the formation of kerogen is a complex process that is closely linked to the preservation of organic matter in sediments. It is a crucial aspect of organic geochemistry and plays a significant role in our understanding of past environments.

### Introduction

Petroleum is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons that is widely used in various industries, including transportation, manufacturing, and energy production. It is a non-renewable resource, meaning that it is formed over long periods of time and cannot be replenished at the same rate at which it is consumed. In this chapter, we will explore the formation, occurrence, and characterization of petroleum, providing a comprehensive guide to understanding this essential resource.

Petroleum is formed from the remains of ancient marine organisms, such as plankton, algae, and other microscopic organisms. These organisms, known as hydrocarbon producers, contain hydrocarbons in their tissues, which are released into the water column when they die. Over time, these hydrocarbons are buried under sediment and undergo a series of chemical and physical changes, resulting in the formation of petroleum.

The occurrence of petroleum is closely tied to its formation. The majority of petroleum is found in sedimentary rocks, specifically in the sedimentary basins of the world. These basins are areas where sediment has accumulated over millions of years, creating thick layers of rock that can contain large quantities of petroleum. The type and amount of petroleum found in these basins can vary greatly, depending on the type of sediment, the geological processes that have acted upon it, and the presence of hydrocarbon producers.

Characterizing petroleum is a complex process that involves analyzing its chemical and physical properties. This includes determining the type and amount of hydrocarbons present, as well as the presence of other compounds such as sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen. This information is crucial for understanding the origin and quality of petroleum, as well as for predicting its behavior during extraction and refining processes.

In this chapter, we will delve into the details of petroleum formation, occurrence, and characterization, providing a comprehensive guide to understanding this essential resource. We will explore the various factors that influence petroleum formation, the different types of petroleum that exist, and the methods used to analyze and characterize it. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a deeper understanding of petroleum and its role in our society.




### Subsection: 9.1a Seminar on Neoproterozoic Glaciations

The Neoproterozoic era, spanning from approximately 1 billion to 100 million years ago, was a time of significant glaciations that shaped the Earth's landscape and influenced the formation of petroleum. These glaciations, which occurred in the late Neoproterozoic, were driven by a combination of factors including changes in sea level, tectonic activity, and atmospheric conditions.

#### 9.1a.1 The Marinoan Glaciation

The Marinoan glaciation, also known as the Sturtian glaciation, was the most significant of the late Neoproterozoic glaciations. It occurred approximately 600 million years ago and lasted for about 10 million years. The Marinoan glaciation was characterized by the formation of thick ice sheets that covered much of the Earth's surface, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere.

The Marinoan glaciation was preceded by a period of intense volcanic activity, known as the Marinoan volcanic event, which lasted for about 100,000 years. This event was marked by the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, which contributed to a drop in the Earth's temperature and the formation of acid rain. The volcanic activity also led to a rise in sea level, which further contributed to the onset of the Marinoan glaciation.

#### 9.1a.2 The Sturtian Glaciation

The Sturtian glaciation, also known as the Sturtian snowball event, was another significant glaciation that occurred during the late Neoproterozoic. It lasted for about 10 million years, from approximately 710 to 690 million years ago. The Sturtian glaciation was characterized by the formation of thick ice sheets that covered much of the Earth's surface, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere.

The Sturtian glaciation was preceded by a period of intense volcanic activity, known as the Sturtian volcanic event, which lasted for about 100,000 years. This event was marked by the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, which contributed to a drop in the Earth's temperature and the formation of acid rain. The volcanic activity also led to a rise in sea level, which further contributed to the onset of the Sturtian glaciation.

#### 9.1a.3 The Kaigas "Glaciation" or "Cooling Event"

The Kaigas "glaciation" or "cooling event" is a less well-defined event that occurred during the late Neoproterozoic, approximately 580 million years ago. It is characterized by a drop in the Earth's temperature and the formation of ice sheets, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere. However, the exact timing and extent of this event are still under debate among scientists.

Some scientists do not recognize the Kaigas event as a true glaciation, as it was probably not as intense as the Marinoan or Sturtian glaciations. Others believe that it may reflect poorly dated strata of Sturtian association, while others suspect that it may indeed be a third ice age. Regardless, the Kaigas event was certainly less significant than the Marinoan or Sturtian glaciations, and probably did not cover the entire Earth's surface.

#### 9.1a.4 The Impact of Neoproterozoic Glaciations on Petroleum Formation

The Neoproterozoic glaciations had a significant impact on the formation of petroleum. The intense volcanic activity and drop in temperature that preceded these glaciations led to a rise in sea level, which in turn contributed to the formation of thick sedimentary layers that are rich in hydrocarbons. These layers, known as source rocks, are the primary source of petroleum.

Furthermore, the glaciations themselves also played a role in the formation of petroleum. The movement of ice sheets across the Earth's surface led to the erosion and redistribution of sediment, which further contributed to the formation of source rocks. Additionally, the drop in temperature during these glaciations led to a decrease in biological activity, which resulted in a decrease in the production of hydrocarbons. This decrease in hydrocarbon production, combined with the increase in sedimentary layers, led to an increase in the concentration of hydrocarbons in these layers, making them even more valuable as source rocks.

In conclusion, the Neoproterozoic glaciations played a crucial role in the formation of petroleum. Their impact on sea level, volcanic activity, and biological activity all contributed to the formation of source rocks and the concentration of hydrocarbons, making them a key factor in the petroleum industry.

### Introduction

Welcome to Chapter 10 of the "Comprehensive Guide to Organic Geochemistry". In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of atmospheric oxygen evolution, paleo-ocean chemistry, and biomarkers. These topics are crucial in understanding the history of our planet and the role of organic compounds in shaping it.

Atmospheric oxygen evolution is a key process that has shaped the Earth's atmosphere and biosphere. It is the process by which oxygen, a vital component of life, is introduced into the atmosphere. This process is closely tied to the evolution of life on Earth, as oxygen is a byproduct of photosynthesis, a process that is primarily carried out by photosynthetic organisms. Understanding the mechanisms and timing of atmospheric oxygen evolution is crucial for understanding the history of life on Earth.

Paleo-ocean chemistry, on the other hand, is the study of the chemical composition of the oceans in the past. The oceans are a vast reservoir of organic compounds, and studying their chemical composition can provide valuable insights into the history of life on Earth. By analyzing the chemical composition of ancient seawater, we can reconstruct the environmental conditions of the past and understand how they have changed over time.

Finally, biomarkers are organic compounds that are produced by living organisms and can be used as indicators of the presence of certain organisms or environmental conditions. Biomarkers play a crucial role in organic geochemistry, as they provide a direct link between the chemical composition of a sample and the organisms that produced it. By studying biomarkers, we can gain a better understanding of the diversity of life in the past and how it has changed over time.

In this chapter, we will explore these topics in depth, providing a comprehensive guide to atmospheric oxygen evolution, paleo-ocean chemistry, and biomarkers. We will discuss the mechanisms and timing of atmospheric oxygen evolution, the techniques used to study paleo-ocean chemistry, and the role of biomarkers in organic geochemistry. By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of these topics and their importance in the field of organic geochemistry. So, let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of atmospheric oxygen evolution, paleo-ocean chemistry, and biomarkers.




### Subsection: 10.1a Basics of Atmospheric Oxygen Evolution and Paleo-ocean Chemistry

#### 10.1a.1 Atmospheric Oxygen Evolution

The evolution of atmospheric oxygen is a complex process that has been shaped by various factors, including the evolution of life on Earth. The earliest evidence of oxygen in the atmosphere dates back to around 2.4 billion years ago, when it was present at levels of less than 0.1% (O'Leary et al., 2007). However, the exact timing and mechanisms of oxygen's introduction into the atmosphere are still a subject of debate among scientists.

One of the key processes that has contributed to the evolution of atmospheric oxygen is photosynthesis. Photosynthetic organisms, such as cyanobacteria, produce oxygen as a byproduct of their metabolism. As these organisms evolved and became more abundant, they began to significantly increase the levels of oxygen in the atmosphere.

Another important factor in the evolution of atmospheric oxygen is the Selli Event, a large-scale volcanic event that occurred around 2.01 billion years ago. This event was characterized by the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere, which led to a spike in marine productivity and an increase in iron availability (Kendall et al., 2009). The subsequent increase in hydrogen sulphide production, driven by increased sulphate flux from volcanism, also led to an increase in phosphorus availability in the water column, enabling the development of anoxia (Kendall et al., 2009).

The Selli Event also led to a drop in the pH of seawater, as much of the excess carbon dioxide was absorbed by the ocean and dissolved as carbonic acid. This caused a severe reduction in ocean carbonate-saturation, marking the beginning of ocean acidification (Kendall et al., 2009). The negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) that occurred during the Selli Event is a key indicator of this ocean acidification event.

#### 10.1a.2 Paleo-ocean Chemistry

The chemistry of the ancient oceans has been a subject of intense study by geochemists. The study of paleo-ocean chemistry involves the analysis of chemical compounds preserved in ancient sediments and rocks, which can provide valuable insights into the chemical composition of the oceans in the past.

One of the key aspects of paleo-ocean chemistry is the study of the carbon cycle. The carbon cycle is a complex process that involves the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere, land, and the oceans. The Selli Event, with its large-scale release of carbon dioxide, had a significant impact on the carbon cycle. The excess carbon dioxide was absorbed by the ocean, leading to an increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in seawater. This increase in carbon dioxide levels, in turn, led to a decrease in the pH of seawater, as the excess carbon dioxide was dissolved as carbonic acid.

The Selli Event also led to an increase in hydrogen sulphide production, which increased phosphorus availability in the water column. This increase in phosphorus availability, coupled with the increase in iron availability, led to a spike in marine productivity. However, the subsequent development of anoxia, driven by the increase in hydrogen sulphide production, also led to a decrease in the burial of carbonate minerals on the seafloor. This decrease in carbonate burial further contributed to the ocean acidification process.

In conclusion, the Selli Event, with its large-scale volcanic release of carbon dioxide, had a profound impact on the evolution of atmospheric oxygen and the chemistry of the ancient oceans. The subsequent increase in marine productivity, followed by the development of anoxia, led to a complex interplay of chemical processes that have shaped the Earth's atmosphere and oceans over billions of years.

#### 10.1a.3 Biomarkers

Biomarkers are organic compounds that are produced by living organisms and can be used as indicators of the presence of certain organisms or environmental conditions. In the context of paleo-ocean chemistry, biomarkers can provide valuable insights into the types of organisms that were present in the ancient oceans and the environmental conditions they experienced.

One of the key types of biomarkers that have been studied in the context of the Selli Event is the nannoconid. Nannoconids are a group of single-celled protists that are known for their production of calcium carbonate scales. These scales are highly resistant to degradation and can be preserved in the sedimentary record for long periods of time. The Selli Event led to a decline in the abundance of nannoconids, likely as a consequence of ocean acidification (Kendall et al., 2009).

Another important type of biomarker that has been studied in the context of the Selli Event is the strontium isotope. Strontium isotopes can provide information about the composition of the seawater in which they were deposited. The Selli Event led to a spike in strontium isotope ratios, which can be interpreted as an increase in silicate weathering (Kendall et al., 2009). This increase in silicate weathering may have helped to buffer the warming effects of large igneous province volcanism and helped to cool the Earth back to its pre-OAE1a state.

In conclusion, the study of biomarkers, along with the study of paleo-ocean chemistry and atmospheric oxygen evolution, provides a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay of biological, chemical, and physical processes that have shaped the Earth's oceans over billions of years.

 11.1: Hydrocarbons: Structure and Properties

Hydrocarbons are organic compounds that consist of hydrogen and carbon atoms. They are the primary component of fossil fuels, such as petroleum and natural gas, and play a crucial role in the Earth's energy production. In this section, we will explore the basics of hydrocarbons, including their definition, classification, and nomenclature.

#### 11.1a: Basics of Hydrocarbons

Hydrocarbons are organic compounds that contain only hydrogen and carbon atoms. They are the simplest form of organic matter and are essential for life on Earth. Hydrocarbons are classified based on their structure, which can be aliphatic or aromatic.

Aliphatic hydrocarbons have a linear or branched structure, with single or double bonds between carbon atoms. They are further classified based on the number of carbon atoms in their structure, with the most common types being methane, ethane, propane, and butane. Aliphatic hydrocarbons are commonly found in natural gas and are used as a fuel source.

Aromatic hydrocarbons have a ring structure with alternating single and double bonds between carbon atoms. They are further classified based on the number of carbon atoms in their ring, with the most common types being benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene. Aromatic hydrocarbons are commonly found in petroleum and are used in the production of various products, such as plastics and pharmaceuticals.

The nomenclature of hydrocarbons follows a specific set of rules, with the simplest hydrocarbon being methane (CH4). The number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon is indicated by the prefix, with methane being a methane, ethane being an ethane, and so on. The suffix -ane is used for single-bonded hydrocarbons, while -ene and -yne are used for double- and triple-bonded hydrocarbons, respectively. For example, ethylene (C2H4) is a double-bonded hydrocarbon, while acetylene (C2H2) is a triple-bonded hydrocarbon.

The properties of hydrocarbons vary depending on their structure. Aliphatic hydrocarbons have lower boiling points and are more soluble in solvents compared to aromatic hydrocarbons. Aromatic hydrocarbons have higher boiling points and are less soluble in solvents. This is due to the presence of delocalized pi electrons in aromatic hydrocarbons, which stabilize their structure and increase their boiling points.

In the next section, we will explore the various methods used for the analysis and identification of hydrocarbons, such as spectroscopy and chromatography. We will also discuss the role of hydrocarbons in the Earth's energy production and their distribution in the Earth's crust.

They are the primary component of fossil fuels, such as petroleum and natural gas, and play a crucial role in the Earth's energy production. In this section, we will explore the basics of hydrocarbons, including their definition, classification, and nomenclature.

#### 11.1a: Basics of Hydrocarbons

Hydrocarbons are organic compounds that contain only hydrogen and carbon atoms. They are classified based on their structure, which can be aliphatic or aromatic. Aliphatic hydrocarbons have a linear or branched structure, with single or double bonds between carbon atoms. They are further classified based on the number of carbon atoms in their structure, with the most common types being methane, ethane, propane, and butane. Aliphatic hydrocarbons are commonly found in natural gas and are used as a fuel source.

Aromatic hydrocarbons have a ring structure with alternating single and double bonds between carbon atoms. They are further classified based on the number of carbon atoms in their ring, with the most common types being benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene. Aromatic hydrocarbons are commonly found in petroleum and are used in the production of various products, such as plastics and pharmaceuticals.

The nomenclature of hydrocarbons follows a specific set of rules, with the simplest hydrocarbon being methane (CH4). The number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon is indicated by the prefix, with methane being a methane, ethane being an ethane, and so on. The suffix -ane is used for single-bonded hydrocarbons, while -ene and -yne are used for double- and triple-bonded hydrocarbons, respectively. For example, ethylene (C2H4) is a double-bonded hydrocarbon, while acetylene (C2H2) is a triple-bonded hydrocarbon.

The properties of hydrocarbons vary depending on their structure. Aliphatic hydrocarbons have lower boiling points and are more soluble in solvents compared to aromatic hydrocarbons. Aromatic hydrocarbons have higher boiling points and are less soluble in solvents. This is due to the presence of delocalized pi electrons in aromatic hydrocarbons, which stabilize their structure and increase their boiling points.

### Subsection: 11.1b Hydrocarbon Analysis

Hydrocarbon analysis is a crucial aspect of organic geochemistry. It involves the identification and quantification of hydrocarbons in various samples, such as petroleum, natural gas, and sediments. This analysis is essential for understanding the origin and evolution of hydrocarbons, as well as their potential impact on the environment.

There are several methods for analyzing hydrocarbons, including spectroscopy, chromatography, and mass spectrometry. Spectroscopy is used to identify the functional groups present in a hydrocarbon, while chromatography is used to separate and quantify different types of hydrocarbons. Mass spectrometry is used to determine the exact molecular structure of a hydrocarbon.

One of the most commonly used methods for hydrocarbon analysis is gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). This technique involves the separation of hydrocarbons using a gas chromatograph and then identifying and quantifying them using a mass spectrometer. GC-MS is particularly useful for analyzing complex mixtures of hydrocarbons, such as those found in petroleum.

Another important aspect of hydrocarbon analysis is the use of biomarkers. Biomarkers are specific compounds that are produced by living organisms and can be used as indicators of the presence of hydrocarbons.

### Subsection: 12.1a Organic Matter Type and Quantity

#### 12.1a Organic Matter Type and Quantity

The type and quantity of organic matter in a source rock are crucial factors in petroleum exploration. The type of organic matter refers to the composition of the organic compounds present, which can be broadly classified into three types: Type I, Type II, and Type III. The quantity of organic matter, on the other hand, refers to the amount of organic carbon present in the rock.

Type I organic matter is typically found in marine sediments and is rich in aliphatic hydrocarbons. It is derived from the remains of marine organisms, such as plankton and algae. Type I organic matter is highly reactive and can undergo rapid transformation into petroleum under the right conditions.

Type II organic matter, on the other hand, is found in both marine and terrestrial sediments. It is derived from the remains of terrestrial plants and animals, and is rich in aromatic hydrocarbons. Type II organic matter is less reactive than Type I, but can still undergo transformation into petroleum under the right conditions.

Type III organic matter is found in terrestrial sediments and is derived from the remains of terrestrial plants. It is rich in both aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, and is less reactive than Type I and Type II. However, it can still undergo transformation into petroleum under the right conditions.

The quantity of organic matter in a source rock is determined by the amount of organic carbon present. This can be measured using various techniques, such as the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) method. The TOC method involves measuring the amount of carbon dioxide released when the rock is heated in the presence of a strong acid. The more carbon dioxide released, the higher the amount of organic carbon present.

The type and quantity of organic matter in a source rock can provide valuable insights into the potential for petroleum formation. For example, rocks with high quantities of Type I organic matter are more likely to contain significant amounts of petroleum, as Type I organic matter is highly reactive and can undergo rapid transformation into petroleum. Similarly, rocks with high quantities of Type II and Type III organic matter may also contain significant amounts of petroleum, although the transformation process may be slower.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the process of source rock evaluation, discussing the various techniques and methodologies used to assess the potential of a source rock for petroleum formation.




#### 12.1b Thermal Maturity and Hydrocarbon Generation Potential

Thermal maturity is a crucial concept in organic geochemistry, particularly in the context of petroleum exploration. It refers to the degree to which a source rock has been heated and transformed by high temperatures and pressures. This process is known as thermal maturation, and it plays a significant role in the generation of hydrocarbons.

The thermal maturity of a source rock can be determined by analyzing the composition of its organic matter. As a source rock undergoes thermal maturation, the organic matter within it undergoes a series of chemical reactions. These reactions can be tracked by measuring the abundance of certain chemical compounds, known as biomarkers, which are unique to different stages of thermal maturation.

One of the key factors that influence the thermal maturity of a source rock is its depth. As a rock is buried deeper and deeper, it is subjected to increasingly high temperatures and pressures. This can lead to the generation of hydrocarbons, which are the building blocks of petroleum.

The potential for hydrocarbon generation in a source rock is known as its hydrocarbon generation potential. This potential is influenced by a variety of factors, including the type and quantity of organic matter present, the depth of the rock, and the geothermal gradient of the region.

The geothermal gradient, or the rate at which temperature increases with depth, is a particularly important factor in determining the hydrocarbon generation potential of a source rock. A high geothermal gradient can lead to rapid thermal maturation and hydrocarbon generation, while a low geothermal gradient can result in slower maturation and less potential for hydrocarbon generation.

In addition to the geothermal gradient, the composition of the source rock can also influence its hydrocarbon generation potential. As mentioned earlier, Type I and Type II organic matter are more reactive and can undergo rapid transformation into petroleum under the right conditions. Type III organic matter, on the other hand, is less reactive and can take longer to transform into petroleum.

The quantity of organic matter present in a source rock can also impact its hydrocarbon generation potential. A higher quantity of organic matter can increase the potential for hydrocarbon generation, as there is more organic matter to be transformed into petroleum.

In conclusion, the thermal maturity and hydrocarbon generation potential of a source rock are crucial factors in petroleum exploration. By understanding these concepts and how they interact with other factors, geologists can make informed decisions about where to drill for petroleum and how to optimize the extraction process.

#### 12.1c Case Studies of Source Rock Evaluation

In this section, we will explore some case studies that demonstrate the application of organic geochemistry in petroleum exploration. These case studies will provide a practical understanding of how the concepts discussed in the previous sections are applied in real-world scenarios.

##### Case Study 1: The Barnett Shale

The Barnett Shale, located in the Fort Worth Basin, is a well-known example of a source rock that is currently undergoing hydrocarbon generation. The Barnett Shale is thermally mature for hydrocarbon generation over most of its area, and it is currently in the oil-generation window along the north and west parts of the province, and in the gas window on the east half of the Barnett-Paleozoic TPS (Thermally Pure Section).

The Barnett source rock is presently expelling high-quality oil, which was episodic and began at low (Ro = 0.6%) thermal maturity. Thirty-two oils from Wise and Jack Counties were analyzed to determine the characteristics of the generating source rock. The API gravity of the oils ranges from 35° to 62° and sulfur contents are low (<0.2%), which is characteristic of high thermal maturity oils. Biomarkers from GCMS analyses show oils were sourced from marine shale, based on sterane distribution and the presence of diasteranes. Carbon isotopic analyses of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbon fractions support hydrocarbon generation from a single-source unit.

The British Thermal Unit (BTU) content of Barnett gas is directly proportional to Ro levels, as reported by Jarvie (2001). This relationship further supports the role of thermal maturity in hydrocarbon generation.

##### Case Study 2: The Eagle Ford Shale

The Eagle Ford Shale, located in the Gulf Coast Basin, is another example of a source rock that is currently undergoing hydrocarbon generation. The Eagle Ford Shale is thermally mature for hydrocarbon generation over most of its area, and it is currently in the oil-generation window along the north and west parts of the province, and in the gas window on the east half of the Barnett-Paleozoic TPS (Thermally Pure Section).

The Eagle Ford source rock is presently expelling high-quality oil, which was episodic and began at low (Ro = 0.6%) thermal maturity. Thirty-two oils from Wise and Jack Counties were analyzed to determine the characteristics of the generating source rock. The API gravity of the oils ranges from 35° to 62° and sulfur contents are low (<0.2%), which is characteristic of high thermal maturity oils. Biomarkers from GCMS analyses show oils were sourced from marine shale, based on sterane distribution and the presence of diasteranes. Carbon isotopic analyses of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbon fractions support hydrocarbon generation from a single-source unit.

The British Thermal Unit (BTU) content of Eagle Ford gas is directly proportional to Ro levels, as reported by Jarvie (2001). This relationship further supports the role of thermal maturity in hydrocarbon generation.

These case studies demonstrate the importance of understanding the thermal maturity and hydrocarbon generation potential of source rocks in petroleum exploration. By studying the composition and maturity of source rocks, geologists can predict the type and quantity of hydrocarbons that can be generated, and make informed decisions about where to drill for petroleum.




#### 12.1c Geochemical Correlation of Crude Oils and Source Rocks

The geochemical correlation of crude oils and source rocks is a crucial aspect of organic geochemistry in petroleum exploration. This correlation allows us to understand the origin of crude oils and their potential source rocks, which can aid in the identification of new hydrocarbon reserves.

The geochemical correlation of crude oils and source rocks involves the analysis of the chemical composition of both the crude oil and the source rock. This analysis can be performed using a variety of techniques, including gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

One of the key factors that influence the geochemical correlation of crude oils and source rocks is the type of organic matter present in the source rock. As mentioned earlier, Type I and Type II organic matter are more reactive and can undergo rapid thermal maturation, leading to the generation of hydrocarbons. The presence of these types of organic matter in a source rock can indicate a high potential for hydrocarbon generation, and thus a potential source of crude oil.

Another important factor in the geochemical correlation of crude oils and source rocks is the geothermal gradient. As discussed in the previous section, a high geothermal gradient can lead to rapid thermal maturation and hydrocarbon generation. This can be indicative of a potential source rock for crude oil.

In addition to these factors, the geochemical correlation of crude oils and source rocks can also be influenced by the presence of specific biomarkers. These biomarkers, which are unique to different types of organic matter, can provide valuable information about the origin and potential of a source rock.

For example, the presence of specific biomarkers, such as steranes and terpanes, can indicate the presence of Type I and Type II organic matter, respectively. The abundance and distribution of these biomarkers can provide insights into the thermal maturity and hydrocarbon generation potential of a source rock.

In conclusion, the geochemical correlation of crude oils and source rocks is a complex but crucial aspect of organic geochemistry in petroleum exploration. By analyzing the chemical composition of both the crude oil and the source rock, we can gain valuable insights into the origin and potential of a source rock, aiding in the identification of new hydrocarbon reserves.

## Chapter 13: Organic Geochemistry in Paleoclimatology:




### Section: 13.1 Organic Proxies for Paleoclimate Reconstruction:

#### 13.1b Leaf Wax Biomarkers and Precipitation

Leaf wax biomarkers, also known as hydrocarbons, are another important organic proxy for paleoclimate reconstruction. These molecules are produced by plants and are found in the cuticle, a protective layer on the surface of leaves. The composition of leaf wax biomarkers can provide valuable information about past climate conditions, particularly precipitation patterns.

The production of leaf wax biomarkers is influenced by several factors, including temperature, precipitation, and the type of vegetation present. For example, in arid regions, where precipitation is scarce, plants tend to produce more wax to reduce water loss. This results in a higher concentration of wax in the soil, which can be detected through organic geochemical analysis.

In addition to their role in water conservation, leaf wax biomarkers can also provide insights into past precipitation patterns. The composition of these molecules can vary depending on the type of precipitation, whether it is rain or snow. This is due to the different hydrogen isotope compositions of these two types of precipitation.

Rainwater, which is the primary source of hydrogen for leaf wax biomarkers, has a more depleted hydrogen isotope composition compared to snow. This is because rainwater is enriched in heavy hydrogen isotopes, while snow is not. As a result, leaf wax biomarkers produced in regions with high rainfall tend to have a more depleted hydrogen isotope composition.

On the other hand, snow, which is more common in colder regions, has a more enriched hydrogen isotope composition. This is because snow is formed from water vapor in the atmosphere, which has a more enriched hydrogen isotope composition compared to rainwater. As a result, leaf wax biomarkers produced in regions with high snowfall tend to have a more enriched hydrogen isotope composition.

By analyzing the hydrogen isotope composition of leaf wax biomarkers, scientists can reconstruct past precipitation patterns and understand how they have changed over time. This information can then be used to better understand the impacts of climate change on precipitation patterns and water resources.

In conclusion, leaf wax biomarkers are a valuable tool for paleoclimatology, providing insights into past precipitation patterns and water conservation strategies of plants. By studying these molecules, scientists can gain a better understanding of how climate has changed over time and the potential impacts of future climate change.

### Subsection: 14.1b Organic Geochemistry of Black Shales and Ocean Anoxic Events

Black shales are a type of sedimentary rock that is characterized by their high organic matter content and dark color. They are formed in anoxic environments, where the lack of oxygen prevents the decomposition of organic matter. Black shales are important in organic geochemistry as they provide a unique record of past environments and can be used to study the effects of ocean anoxic events.

Ocean anoxic events (OAEs) are periods of intense marine productivity and anoxia that have occurred throughout Earth's history. These events are often associated with large-scale volcanic activity, such as the Selli Event and the Amadeus Event. During these events, the release of carbon dioxide from volcanism caused a drop in the pH of seawater and a decrease in carbonate-saturation, leading to ocean acidification.

The effects of OAEs on marine productivity are complex and not fully understood. While some studies have shown an increase in marine productivity during OAEs, others have found evidence of a decline. This discrepancy may be due to the use of different proxies and the difficulty in accurately reconstructing past environments.

One of the most well-studied OAEs is the Selli Event, which occurred approximately 120 million years ago during the Cretaceous period. This event was characterized by a negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE), indicating an increase in marine productivity. This increase was likely driven by an increase in iron availability, which was caused by the release of hydrogen sulphide from volcanic activity. The increase in hydrogen sulphide also led to an increase in phosphorus availability, enabling the development of anoxia.

The Selli Event also saw a spike in silicate weathering, as indicated by a positive lithium isotope excursion. This weathering may have helped to buffer the warming effects of volcanic activity and cool the Earth back to its pre-OAE1a state.

Black shales are also important in organic geochemistry as they provide a record of past environments. The high organic matter content of black shales allows for the preservation of organic compounds, which can be used to reconstruct past environments. For example, the analysis of stable isotopes in black shales can provide information about the types of organisms that were present in the water column during the event.

In conclusion, the study of black shales and ocean anoxic events is crucial in understanding the role of organic geochemistry in biogeochemical cycles. These events provide a unique record of past environments and can help us better understand the complex interactions between organic matter and the Earth's systems. 





### Subsection: 14.1c Organic Geochemistry of Peatlands and Carbon Sequestration

Peatlands, also known as bogs or mires, are wetlands that are characterized by the accumulation of organic matter. They are important ecosystems that play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle. Peatlands cover only 3% of the Earth's land surface, but they store more than 30% of the world's soil organic carbon. This makes them one of the largest carbon reservoirs on Earth.

The formation of peatlands is closely linked to the presence of permafrost. As mentioned in the previous section, permafrost soils are important carbon pools, storing between 25 and 50% of the soil organic carbon. In the Northern Hemisphere, the permafrost region is overlapped by the peatland region, and the two together cover approximately 10% of the Earth's land surface. This overlap is significant, as it highlights the important role that peatlands play in carbon sequestration.

Carbon sequestration is the process of capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Peatlands are effective carbon sequestration sites due to their unique characteristics. The anoxic conditions in peatlands prevent the decomposition of organic matter, allowing it to accumulate over long periods of time. This accumulation of organic matter is what makes peatlands such important carbon reservoirs.

The amount of carbon stored in peatlands is estimated to be around 1,460–1,600 Pg. This is more than double the amount of carbon currently in the atmosphere. The uppermost horizon (0–30 cm) of the soil column in peatlands contains approximately 200 Pg of organic carbon, while the 0–100 cm horizon contains an estimated 500 Pg of organic carbon. The 0–300 cm horizon contains the largest amount of organic carbon, with an estimated 1,000 Pg.

The role of peatlands in the global carbon cycle is crucial. However, these ecosystems are facing threats such as drainage and burning, which can lead to the release of carbon into the atmosphere. Therefore, it is essential to protect and restore peatlands to maintain their role in carbon sequestration.

In conclusion, peatlands are important ecosystems that play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle. Their unique characteristics make them effective carbon sequestration sites, and their protection is crucial for maintaining the balance of carbon in the atmosphere.

### Section: 17.1 Microbial Lipid Biomarkers:

#### 17.1a Lipid Biomarkers for Bacteria and Archaea

Lipid biomarkers play a crucial role in the study of microbial ecology. They are molecules that are unique to specific microorganisms and can be used as indicators of the presence and activity of these organisms in a sample. In this section, we will focus on the lipid biomarkers for bacteria and archaea, which are two of the most diverse and abundant microorganisms in the environment.

#### 17.1a.1 Bacterial Lipid Biomarkers

Bacteria are a diverse group of microorganisms that play a crucial role in the environment. They are involved in a wide range of processes, including nutrient cycling, disease, and the production of useful compounds. Bacterial lipid biomarkers are molecules that are unique to bacteria and can be used to identify and study these organisms.

One of the most commonly used bacterial lipid biomarkers is the phospholipid-derived fatty acid (PLFA). PLFAs are essential components of bacterial cellular membranes and can be used to estimate the total biomass of bacteria in a sample. They can also be used to observe broad changes in the community composition of bacteria.

The analysis of PLFAs involves saponifying the phospholipids of an unknown sample, which releases the fatty acids contained in their diglyceride tail. The composition of the resulting PLFA can then be compared to the PLFA of known organisms to determine the identity of the sample organism. This technique can be combined with other techniques, such as stable isotope probing, to determine which microbes are metabolically active in a sample.

However, it is important to note that care must be taken when assigning PLFAs to specific bacterial classes. Phospholipids can occur in many biological classes, such as in plant roots, fungi, and soil bacteria, so over-assigning PLFA biomarkers to the wrong class can lead to incorrect conclusions. Despite this, the fatty acid side chains between differing life forms can be quite unique, and the presence of certain fatty acids can provide valuable insights into the identity and activity of bacteria in a sample.

#### 17.1a.2 Archaeal Lipid Biomarkers

Archaea are another diverse group of microorganisms that are found in a wide range of environments. They are often overlooked due to their close genetic relationship with bacteria, but they play a crucial role in the environment, particularly in extreme environments such as hot springs and salt lakes.

Archaeal lipid biomarkers are molecules that are unique to archaea and can be used to identify and study these organisms. One of the most commonly used archaeal lipid biomarkers is the archaeol, a glycerol ether lipid that is found in the cellular membranes of most archaea. Archaeols can be used to estimate the total biomass of archaea in a sample and to observe broad changes in the community composition of archaea.

The analysis of archaeols involves saponifying the lipids of an unknown sample, which releases the archaeol. The composition of the resulting archaeol can then be compared to the archaeol of known organisms to determine the identity of the sample organism. This technique can also be combined with other techniques, such as stable isotope probing, to determine which microbes are metabolically active in a sample.

However, similar to PLFAs, care must be taken when assigning archaeols to specific archaeal classes. Archaeols can occur in many biological classes, such as in bacteria and eukaryotes, so over-assigning archaeols to the wrong class can lead to incorrect conclusions. Despite this, the presence of certain archaeols can provide valuable insights into the identity and activity of archaea in a sample.

In the next section, we will explore the role of lipid biomarkers in the study of microbial interactions and their impact on the environment.

#### 17.1b Lipid Biomarkers for Eukaryotes

Eukaryotes are a diverse group of microorganisms that include fungi, protists, and some bacteria. They are characterized by their complex cell structure, which includes a nucleus and other organelles. Eukaryotic lipid biomarkers are molecules that are unique to eukaryotes and can be used to identify and study these organisms.

One of the most commonly used eukaryotic lipid biomarkers is the sterol. Sterols are a group of lipids that are found in the cellular membranes of most eukaryotes. They play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the cell membrane and can be used to estimate the total biomass of eukaryotes in a sample.

The analysis of sterols involves saponifying the lipids of an unknown sample, which releases the sterol. The composition of the resulting sterol can then be compared to the sterol of known organisms to determine the identity of the sample organism. This technique can also be combined with other techniques, such as stable isotope probing, to determine which microbes are metabolically active in a sample.

However, it is important to note that care must be taken when assigning sterols to specific eukaryotic classes. Sterols can occur in many biological classes, such as in bacteria and archaea, so over-assigning sterols to the wrong class can lead to incorrect conclusions. Despite this, the presence of certain sterols can provide valuable insights into the identity and activity of eukaryotes in a sample.

Another important eukaryotic lipid biomarker is the glycolipid. Glycolipids are a group of lipids that are found in the cellular membranes of many eukaryotes. They can be used to estimate the total biomass of eukaryotes in a sample and to observe broad changes in the community composition of eukaryotes.

The analysis of glycolipids involves saponifying the lipids of an unknown sample, which releases the glycolipid. The composition of the resulting glycolipid can then be compared to the glycolipid of known organisms to determine the identity of the sample organism. This technique can also be combined with other techniques, such as stable isotope probing, to determine which microbes are metabolically active in a sample.

However, similar to sterols, care must be taken when assigning glycolipids to specific eukaryotic classes. Glycolipids can occur in many biological classes, such as in bacteria and archaea, so over-assigning glycolipids to the wrong class can lead to incorrect conclusions. Despite this, the presence of certain glycolipids can provide valuable insights into the identity and activity of eukaryotes in a sample.

#### 17.1c Lipid Biomarkers for Viruses

Viruses are a diverse group of microorganisms that are not considered to be living organisms due to their inability to replicate independently. They are obligate intracellular parasites that require a host cell to replicate. Viral lipid biomarkers are molecules that are unique to viruses and can be used to identify and study these organisms.

One of the most commonly used viral lipid biomarkers is the lipid A. Lipid A is a lipid molecule found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and some viruses. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the viral membrane and can be used to estimate the total biomass of viruses in a sample.

The analysis of lipid A involves saponifying the lipids of an unknown sample, which releases the lipid A. The composition of the resulting lipid A can then be compared to the lipid A of known organisms to determine the identity of the sample organism. This technique can also be combined with other techniques, such as stable isotope probing, to determine which microbes are metabolically active in a sample.

However, it is important to note that care must be taken when assigning lipid A to specific viral classes. Lipid A can occur in many biological classes, such as in bacteria and archaea, so over-assigning lipid A to the wrong class can lead to incorrect conclusions. Despite this, the presence of certain lipid A molecules can provide valuable insights into the identity and activity of viruses in a sample.

Another important viral lipid biomarker is the sphingolipid. Sphingolipids are a group of lipids that are found in the cellular membranes of many viruses. They can be used to estimate the total biomass of viruses in a sample and to observe broad changes in the community composition of viruses.

The analysis of sphingolipids involves saponifying the lipids of an unknown sample, which releases the sphingolipid. The composition of the resulting sphingolipid can then be compared to the sphingolipid of known organisms to determine the identity of the sample organism. This technique can also be combined with other techniques, such as stable isotope probing, to determine which microbes are metabolically active in a sample.

However, similar to lipid A, care must be taken when assigning sphingolipids to specific viral classes. Sphingolipids can occur in many biological classes, such as in bacteria and archaea, so over-assigning sphingolipids to the wrong class can lead to incorrect conclusions. Despite this, the presence of certain sphingolipids can provide valuable insights into the identity and activity of viruses in a sample.

### Introduction

Organic geochemistry plays a crucial role in the field of sedimentology, providing valuable insights into the origin, evolution, and distribution of sediments. This chapter will delve into the various aspects of organic geochemistry in sedimentology, exploring its applications, techniques, and interpretations.

The study of organic geochemistry in sedimentology involves the analysis of organic matter, both fossil and recent, in sedimentary rocks. This analysis can provide information about the environment in which the sediments were deposited, the organisms that inhabited these environments, and the processes that shaped the sediments.

The chapter will begin by discussing the basics of organic geochemistry, including the types of organic compounds that can be analyzed and the techniques used for their analysis. It will then move on to more advanced topics, such as the interpretation of organic geochemical data and the use of organic geochemistry in sedimentary reconstruction.

Throughout the chapter, we will emphasize the importance of organic geochemistry in sedimentology and its potential for enhancing our understanding of the Earth's history. We will also highlight the current research trends and future directions in this exciting field.

It will equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to apply organic geochemical techniques in your own research and to interpret the results of these techniques.

So, let's embark on this journey into the world of organic geochemistry in sedimentology, exploring its mysteries and uncovering its secrets.




#### 18.1a Organic Facies and Depositional Environment

Organic facies and depositional environment are fundamental concepts in sedimentology and organic geochemistry. They provide a framework for understanding the origin and evolution of sediments, and for interpreting the fossil record.

##### Organic Facies

Organic facies refer to the different types of sedimentary rocks that are characterized by their organic content. These facies are typically named based on their dominant organic component, such as carbonaceous facies, siliceous facies, or sulphidic facies. 

Carbonaceous facies, for instance, are sedimentary rocks that contain a significant amount of organic carbon. These rocks are often black in color and are rich in hydrocarbons. They are typically found in environments where organic matter is abundant, such as in coastal lagoons, swamps, and deep marine environments.

Siliceous facies, on the other hand, are sedimentary rocks that contain a high proportion of silica. These rocks are typically white or light gray in color and are often associated with the remains of siliceous organisms, such as diatoms and radiolarians. They are typically found in environments where siliceous organisms are abundant, such as in the open ocean.

Sulphidic facies are sedimentary rocks that contain a high proportion of sulphide minerals. These rocks are typically black in color and are often associated with hydrogen sulphide gas. They are typically found in environments where sulphate-reducing bacteria are active, such as in anoxic marine environments and in sediments beneath hydrocarbon seeps.

##### Depositional Environment

The depositional environment refers to the physical and chemical conditions under which sediments are deposited. This environment is influenced by a variety of factors, including the type of organisms present, the availability of nutrients, the presence of oxygen, and the overall climate.

In the Aoufous Formation, for example, the depositional environment was characterized by a coastal lagoon or a paralic sebkha. This environment was rich in organic matter, as evidenced by the presence of vertebrate fossils, gastropods, and crustaceans in the claystone facies. The presence of these organisms suggests a warm, humid climate, with abundant freshwater inputs.

The gypsum layers, on the other hand, suggest long periods of dryness connected to evaporation of salty waters. This suggests a more arid environment, perhaps with occasional freshwater inputs.

The Huab Formation, on the other hand, was deposited in a glacial environment, as evidenced by the presence of tillite. This suggests a much colder climate, with extensive glaciation.

Understanding the depositional environment is crucial for interpreting the fossil record and for reconstructing the history of the Earth's climate. It also provides valuable insights into the processes that shape sediments, and into the role of organic matter in these processes.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the role of organic matter in sedimentary rocks, exploring its composition, distribution, and the processes that control its preservation.

#### 18.1b Organic Matter Preservation and Diagenesis

The preservation of organic matter in sediments is a complex process that involves a series of physical, chemical, and biological processes. These processes can alter the composition of the organic matter, and can even lead to its complete destruction. Understanding these processes is crucial for interpreting the fossil record and for reconstructing the history of the Earth's climate.

##### Organic Matter Preservation

Organic matter can be preserved in sediments in several ways. One common way is through burial. When sediments are deposited, they can bury organic matter, preventing it from being decomposed by bacteria and other organisms. The deeper the burial, the less likely it is that the organic matter will be decomposed. This is because the conditions become more anoxic (lacking in oxygen) and colder with depth, which inhibits the activity of decomposers.

Another way that organic matter can be preserved is through mineralization. Mineralization occurs when certain elements in the organic matter, such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, are replaced by minerals. This can occur through a process called diagenesis, which involves the alteration of sediments after they have been deposited. Mineralization can help to stabilize the organic matter and prevent its decomposition.

##### Diagenesis

Diagenesis is a key process in the preservation of organic matter. It involves the alteration of sediments after they have been deposited, and can occur over geological timescales. Diagenesis can involve several processes, including compaction, cementation, and mineral replacement.

Compaction occurs when sediments are buried deeper and deeper, and the pressure and temperature increase. This can lead to the removal of pore water and the compression of the sediments. This process can help to preserve organic matter by reducing the amount of oxygen available for decomposition.

Cementation occurs when minerals, such as calcite or silica, precipitate from pore fluids and bind the sediments together. This can help to stabilize organic matter and prevent its decomposition.

Mineral replacement, as mentioned earlier, can occur when certain elements in the organic matter are replaced by minerals. This can help to stabilize the organic matter and prevent its decomposition.

##### Organic Matter Preservation in the Aoufous Formation

In the Aoufous Formation, the preservation of organic matter was facilitated by the depositional environment. The coastal lagoon or paralic sebkha environment was rich in organic matter, as evidenced by the presence of vertebrate fossils, gastropods, and crustaceans. The presence of these organisms suggests a warm, humid climate, with abundant freshwater inputs.

The gypsum layers, on the other hand, suggest long periods of dryness connected to evaporation of salty waters. This suggests a more arid environment, perhaps with occasional freshwater inputs. The preservation of organic matter in these layers is likely due to the rapid burial of sediments, which prevented decomposition.

##### Organic Matter Preservation in the Huab Formation

In the Huab Formation, the preservation of organic matter was facilitated by the glacial environment. The presence of tillite suggests extensive glaciation, which would have led to the burial of sediments and the preservation of organic matter. However, the presence of sulphate-reducing bacteria in these sediments suggests that some organic matter was decomposed. This suggests that the conditions were not quite anoxic enough to prevent all decomposition.

In conclusion, the preservation of organic matter in sediments is a complex process that involves a series of physical, chemical, and biological processes. Understanding these processes is crucial for interpreting the fossil record and for reconstructing the history of the Earth's climate.

#### 18.1c Organic Matter Composition and Hydrocarbon Generation

The composition of organic matter in sediments is a critical factor in understanding the potential for hydrocarbon generation. Hydrocarbons, which include oil and natural gas, are the most important energy resources on Earth. They are derived from the decomposition of organic matter, a process known as organic matter decomposition.

##### Organic Matter Composition

The composition of organic matter in sediments is determined by the type of organisms that lived and died in the water column or on the seafloor. These organisms can be microscopic plankton, larger marine organisms, or even terrestrial plants and animals. The composition of their tissues can vary widely, depending on their diet, metabolism, and the environmental conditions in which they lived.

For example, marine organisms that eat other organisms (carnivores) tend to have a higher proportion of protein in their tissues, while organisms that eat plants (herbivores) tend to have a higher proportion of carbohydrates. Organisms that make their own food (autotrophs) tend to have a higher proportion of lipids.

##### Hydrocarbon Generation

Hydrocarbon generation is a complex process that involves several stages. The first stage is the decomposition of organic matter, which can occur through several pathways. One common pathway is through the action of bacteria and other microorganisms, which break down the organic matter into simpler compounds.

The next stage is the conversion of these simpler compounds into hydrocarbons. This process, known as catagenesis, involves the rearrangement of chemical bonds and the removal of oxygen and other elements. The exact mechanisms of catagenesis are still not fully understood, but it is believed to involve the action of catalytic minerals, such as clay minerals and metal sulfides.

The final stage is the migration of the hydrocarbons from the source rock to a reservoir rock. This can occur through several mechanisms, including diffusion, advection, and fracture flow. The success of this migration depends on the properties of the source and reservoir rocks, as well as the physical and chemical conditions in the surrounding environment.

##### Hydrocarbon Generation in the Aoufous Formation

In the Aoufous Formation, the potential for hydrocarbon generation is high due to the richness of organic matter and the presence of catalytic minerals. The variegated claystones and gypsum layers, in particular, are promising source rocks. The presence of vertebrate fossils and other organic remains suggests a high potential for hydrocarbon generation.

However, the exact potential for hydrocarbon generation in the Aoufous Formation is still not fully understood. Further research is needed to determine the exact composition of the organic matter, the extent of catagenesis, and the properties of the source and reservoir rocks.

In conclusion, understanding the composition of organic matter and the processes of hydrocarbon generation is crucial for the exploration and development of hydrocarbon resources. It is a complex field that involves a wide range of disciplines, including sedimentology, geochemistry, and petrology.

#### 18.1c Organic Geochemistry of Coal

Coal is a sedimentary rock that is primarily composed of organic matter. It is a significant source of energy and has been used for centuries as a fuel. The study of coal from an organic geochemical perspective is crucial for understanding its formation, evolution, and potential as a source of energy.

##### Formation of Coal

Coal is formed from the remains of terrestrial plants, primarily trees and shrubs, that have been buried in sedimentary environments. The process of coalification is a form of diagenesis, where the organic matter undergoes a series of changes due to increasing temperature and pressure. The process begins with the deposition of plant remains in swamps or other low-lying areas. As these remains are buried, they are subjected to increasing pressure and temperature, which leads to the formation of peat.

##### Coalification

Coalification is the process by which peat is transformed into coal. This process is driven by increasing temperature and pressure, which cause the organic matter to undergo a series of changes. The first stage of coalification is the formation of lignite, a brownish-black coal with a high moisture content. As the coalification process continues, the coal becomes darker and harder, eventually forming bituminous coal and anthracite.

The coalification process is accompanied by changes in the organic matter. The original plant remains are replaced by a mixture of hydrocarbons, including aliphatic and aromatic compounds. The hydrocarbons are formed through a process known as catagenesis, which involves the rearrangement of the original organic compounds.

##### Organic Geochemistry of Coal

The study of coal from an organic geochemical perspective involves the analysis of the hydrocarbons present in the coal. This can be done through various techniques, including gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These techniques allow us to identify the types of hydrocarbons present in the coal and to determine their origin.

The hydrocarbons in coal can provide valuable information about the conditions under which the coal was formed. For instance, the presence of certain types of hydrocarbons can indicate the temperature and pressure conditions during coalification. Furthermore, the hydrocarbons can also provide insights into the original plant remains from which the coal was formed.

In conclusion, the study of coal from an organic geochemical perspective is crucial for understanding its formation, evolution, and potential as a source of energy. It allows us to reconstruct the conditions under which the coal was formed and to identify the original plant remains from which it was derived.

### Subsection: 19.1a Organic Carbon Cycle in the Ocean

The ocean is a significant reservoir of organic carbon, containing an estimated 38,000 gigatons of carbon. The organic carbon cycle in the ocean is a complex process that involves the production, transport, and burial of organic matter. This cycle plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate and is influenced by various factors, including marine productivity, ocean currents, and sedimentation rates.

#### Marine Productivity

Marine productivity, or the rate at which marine organisms produce biomass, is a key factor in the organic carbon cycle. The Selli Event, a period of intense volcanic activity approximately 120 million years ago, provides a unique case study of the impact of marine productivity on the organic carbon cycle. The increased iron availability caused by the volcanic activity led to a spike in marine productivity, which was likely driven by an increase in phosphorus availability. This increase in productivity resulted in the deposition of black shales rich in organic matter, which are incapable of being decomposed on the seafloor due to anoxic conditions.

#### Ocean Currents and Sedimentation Rates

Ocean currents and sedimentation rates also play a significant role in the organic carbon cycle. The large-scale volcanic release of carbon dioxide during the Selli Event caused a drop in the pH of seawater, leading to ocean acidification. This acidification reduced the carbonate-saturation of seawater, which can impact the transport and burial of organic matter. Additionally, the increased sulphate flux from volcanism caused an increase in hydrogen sulphide production, which in turn increased phosphorus availability in the water column by inhibiting its burial on the seafloor. This increase in phosphorus availability may have led to an increase in marine productivity, further influencing the organic carbon cycle.

#### Silicate Weathering

Silicate weathering, the process by which silicate minerals are broken down by chemical or biological means, also plays a role in the organic carbon cycle. The Selli Event saw an increase in silicate weathering, as indicated by δ7Li measurements. This increase in weathering may have helped to cool the Earth back to its pre-OAE1a state, demonstrating the complex interplay between the organic and inorganic carbon cycles.

In conclusion, the organic carbon cycle in the ocean is a complex process influenced by various factors. The Selli Event provides a case study of how these factors can interact to influence the organic carbon cycle, highlighting the importance of studying this cycle in understanding the Earth's climate system.




### Subsection: 19.1b Organic Geochemistry of Marine Sediments

Marine sediments play a crucial role in the organic carbon cycle. They are the final resting place for organic matter that has been produced in the ocean, and their composition can provide valuable insights into the organic carbon cycle.

#### Organic Matter in Marine Sediments

Marine sediments can contain a variety of organic matter, including terrestrial and marine plant remains, animal remains, and microbial remains. These organic materials can be preserved in anoxic conditions, where they are protected from decomposition by oxygen. The composition of this organic matter can vary significantly depending on the source and the conditions under which it was deposited.

#### Black Shales

One type of marine sediment that is particularly rich in organic matter is black shale. Black shales are fine-grained sediments that are typically black in color due to the high concentration of organic matter they contain. They are often associated with periods of intense marine productivity, such as the Selli Event.

The deposition of black shales is influenced by a variety of factors, including sedimentation rates, ocean currents, and the availability of nutrients. For example, during the Selli Event, the increased iron availability caused by volcanic activity led to a spike in marine productivity, which resulted in the deposition of black shales rich in organic matter.

#### Organic Geochemistry of Black Shales

The organic geochemistry of black shales can provide valuable insights into the organic carbon cycle. For example, the composition of the organic matter in black shales can reveal the types of organisms that were producing it, as well as the conditions under which it was deposited.

In addition, the presence of specific biomarkers in black shales can provide information about the metabolic pathways that were active in the organisms that produced the organic matter. For example, the presence of isoprenoid hydrocarbons can indicate the presence of photosynthetic organisms, while the presence of hopanoids can indicate the presence of bacteria.

#### Organic Geochemistry of Marine Sediments in Oceanography

The study of organic geochemistry in marine sediments is a crucial aspect of oceanography. It allows us to reconstruct past ocean conditions, understand the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems, and predict future changes in the ocean.

For example, the study of black shales can provide insights into past periods of intense marine productivity, such as the Selli Event. This can help us understand how changes in ocean conditions, such as changes in iron availability or ocean acidification, can impact marine productivity.

Furthermore, the study of organic geochemistry in marine sediments can also provide insights into the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems. For example, the increase in ocean acidification caused by the large-scale volcanic release of carbon dioxide during the Selli Event can provide insights into the potential impacts of future increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide on ocean chemistry.

In conclusion, the study of organic geochemistry in marine sediments is a crucial aspect of oceanography. It allows us to understand the complex interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere, and provides valuable insights into past, present, and future changes in the ocean.




### Subsection: 19.1c Organic Tracers for Ocean Currents and Productivity

Organic tracers play a crucial role in understanding ocean currents and productivity. These tracers can provide insights into the movement of water masses, the distribution of nutrients, and the productivity of marine ecosystems.

#### Organic Tracers for Ocean Currents

Organic tracers can be used to trace the movement of water masses in the ocean. These tracers can be either conservative or non-conservative. Conservative tracers, such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), are not affected by physical or biological processes and can provide a reliable record of ocean currents. Non-conservative tracers, such as chlorophyll, can be affected by biological processes and may not accurately reflect the movement of water masses.

The use of organic tracers for ocean currents is particularly important in the context of climate change. As the climate changes, the distribution of ocean currents is likely to change, which could have significant impacts on marine ecosystems and the global carbon cycle. By using organic tracers, scientists can monitor these changes and better understand their implications.

#### Organic Tracers for Productivity

Organic tracers can also be used to assess the productivity of marine ecosystems. For example, the presence of chlorophyll, a pigment found in phytoplankton, can indicate the level of primary productivity in the ocean. Similarly, the presence of certain biomarkers can provide information about the types of organisms that are producing organic matter and the metabolic pathways that are active in these organisms.

The use of organic tracers for productivity is particularly important in the context of the Selli Event. This event, which occurred approximately 120 million years ago, was characterized by a spike in marine productivity. By studying the organic tracers associated with this event, scientists can gain insights into the factors that drove this increase in productivity.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, organic tracers play a crucial role in understanding ocean currents and productivity. These tracers can provide valuable insights into the movement of water masses, the distribution of nutrients, and the productivity of marine ecosystems. As our understanding of these tracers continues to improve, we will be better equipped to monitor and understand the changes occurring in our oceans.
