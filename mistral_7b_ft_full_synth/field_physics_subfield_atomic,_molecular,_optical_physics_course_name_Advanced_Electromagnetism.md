### Subsection 1.2a: Concept of Negative Refraction

Negative refraction is a phenomenon that occurs in left-handed materials, where the refractive index is negative for certain frequencies and directions of light propagation. This means that light can be bent in the opposite direction of what would be expected based on Snell's law, leading to a reversal of the usual behavior of light at interfaces.

The concept of negative refraction was first proposed by Soviet physicist Victor Veselago in 1967. He showed that a negative index of refraction is possible, and that this does not violate the laws of physics. However, it was not until the 1990s that the first left-handed materials were created, allowing for the experimental verification of negative refraction.

In 2001, a team of researchers constructed a prism composed of metamaterials to experimentally test for negative refraction. The experiment used a waveguide to help transmit the proper frequency and isolate the material. This test successfully verified a negative index of refraction, marking a significant milestone in the study of left-handed materials.

Further experiments have shown that negative refraction is possible for multiple frequency signals, not just a single frequency. This has been demonstrated by calculating the Poynting vector, which determines the direction of power flow for a wave transmitted through a dispersive left-handed material. The transmission of an incident field, composed of many frequencies, from an isotropic nondispersive material into an isotropic dispersive media is employed. The direction of power flow for both nondispersive and dispersive media is determined by the time-averaged Poynting vector. Negative refraction was shown to be possible for multiple frequency signals by explicit calculation of the Poynting vector in the LHM.

### Subsection 1.2b: Negative Refraction in Left-handed Materials

Negative refraction is a key property of left-handed materials, and it has significant implications for the manipulation of light. By controlling the negative refraction, it is possible to create devices that can manipulate light in ways that were previously thought impossible.

One of the most promising applications of negative refraction is in the development of superlenses. These are lenses that can achieve sub-diffraction-limited imaging, allowing for the creation of images with a resolution beyond the limits of traditional lenses. This has significant potential for applications in fields such as microscopy and imaging technology.

Negative refraction also has implications for the development of cloaking devices. By manipulating the negative refraction, it is possible to create materials that can bend light around an object, making it invisible to certain frequencies of light. This has potential applications in fields such as stealth technology and security.

In conclusion, negative refraction is a fundamental property of left-handed materials, and it has significant implications for the manipulation of light. Further research and development in this area will continue to unlock the potential of these materials and their applications.





### Subsection 1.2b Negative Refraction in LHMs

Negative refraction is a fundamental property of left-handed materials (LHMs) that has been extensively studied due to its potential applications in various fields, including telecommunications, imaging, and sensing. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of negative refraction in LHMs, exploring its implications and applications.

#### 1.2b.1 Negative Refraction and the Poynting Vector

The Poynting vector, denoted as `$\vec{S}$`, is a vector quantity that describes the direction of power flow for an electromagnetic wave. In the context of negative refraction, the Poynting vector plays a crucial role in determining the direction of power flow in a dispersive left-handed material.

The Poynting vector is defined as:

$$
\vec{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \vec{E} \times \vec{B}
$$

where `$\vec{E}$` is the electric field, `$\vec{B}$` is the magnetic field, and `$\mu_0$` is the permeability of free space.

In a dispersive left-handed material, the Poynting vector can be calculated for an incident field composed of multiple frequencies. This calculation can be used to determine the direction of power flow in the material, and thus verify the existence of negative refraction.

#### 1.2b.2 Negative Refraction and the Index of Refraction

The index of refraction, denoted as `$n$`, is a measure of how much a medium slows down the speed of light. In a left-handed material, the index of refraction can be negative for certain frequencies and directions of light propagation, leading to negative refraction.

The index of refraction is defined as:

$$
n = \frac{c}{v}
$$

where `$c$` is the speed of light in vacuum and `$v$` is the speed of light in the medium.

Negative refraction occurs when the index of refraction is negative, indicating that light is moving faster than the speed of light in vacuum. This phenomenon is possible due to the unique properties of left-handed materials, which allow for the manipulation of the electric and magnetic fields in a way that is not possible in conventional materials.

#### 1.2b.3 Negative Refraction and the Superlens Effect

One of the most intriguing applications of negative refraction is the superlens effect. This effect allows for the creation of a lens that can focus light beyond the diffraction limit, a feat that was previously thought impossible due to the limitations of the diffraction theory.

The superlens effect is achieved by combining a conventional lens with a left-handed material. The left-handed material, with its negative index of refraction, can bend light in the opposite direction of what would be expected based on Snell's law. This allows for the creation of a lens that can focus light beyond the diffraction limit.

The superlens effect has been experimentally verified, opening up new possibilities for the use of left-handed materials in imaging and sensing applications.

In conclusion, negative refraction is a key property of left-handed materials that has been extensively studied due to its potential applications. The Poynting vector and the index of refraction play crucial roles in understanding and verifying the existence of negative refraction. The superlens effect is one of the most intriguing applications of negative refraction, demonstrating the potential of left-handed materials in revolutionizing various fields.

#### 1.3b.1 The Veselago Equations and LHMs

The Veselago equations, as mentioned in the previous section, describe the behavior of the Veselago metamaterial. These equations are derived from Maxwell's equations, which are the fundamental equations of electromagnetism. The Veselago equations describe how the electric and magnetic fields interact with the material, and they are essential for understanding the behavior of left-handed materials.

In the context of LHMs, the Veselago equations take on a unique significance. The negative index of refraction in these materials leads to a negative value for the parameter $\varepsilon_0$ in the equations. This negative value is what allows for the manipulation of the Poynting vector, and ultimately, the ability to bend light in ways that were previously thought impossible.

#### 1.3b.2 The Veselago Metamaterial and LHMs

The Veselago metamaterial, a hypothetical material with a negative index of refraction, is a key concept in the study of LHMs. While a material with a negative index of refraction has yet to be discovered, the concept of the Veselago metamaterial serves as a useful model for understanding the behavior of LHMs.

In the context of LHMs, the Veselago metamaterial is often used to describe the behavior of these materials. The negative index of refraction in these materials leads to a negative value for the parameter $\varepsilon_0$ in the Veselago equations, which in turn allows for the manipulation of the Poynting vector. This manipulation of the Poynting vector is what allows for the unique properties of LHMs, such as the ability to bend light in ways that were previously thought impossible.

#### 1.3b.3 The Veselago Equations and the Poynting Vector

The Veselago equations are particularly important in the study of LHMs due to their relationship with the Poynting vector. The Poynting vector, a vector that describes the direction of power flow in an electromagnetic wave, is manipulated in LHMs. This manipulation of the Poynting vector is what allows for the unique properties of LHMs, such as the ability to bend light in ways that were previously thought impossible.

In the Veselago equations, the Poynting vector is described by the term $\nabla \times \mathbf{E}$. This term describes the rotation of the electric field, which is what leads to the manipulation of the Poynting vector. By controlling the rotation of the electric field, it is possible to control the direction of power flow in an electromagnetic wave, and ultimately, bend light in ways that were previously thought impossible.

In conclusion, Veselago's theory is a fundamental concept in the study of left-handed materials. It provides a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of these materials, and it has been instrumental in the development of many of the practical applications discussed in the previous section. The Veselago equations, the Veselago metamaterial, and the relationship between the Veselago equations and the Poynting vector are all key concepts in this theory.

### Section: 1.4 Metamaterials

Metamaterials are a class of materials that have been designed to exhibit properties not found in nature. They are typically composed of periodic structures, such as arrays of wires or resonant inclusions, that are engineered to interact with electromagnetic waves in a specific way. This interaction can result in properties such as negative index of refraction, superlensing, and cloaking, which were previously thought to be impossible.

#### 1.4a Definition and Properties

Metamaterials are defined as materials with properties that are not found in nature. This means that their properties are not determined by the properties of their constituent materials, but rather by the way these materials are arranged and interact. This allows for the creation of materials with properties that are not possible with natural materials.

One of the most significant properties of metamaterials is their ability to exhibit negative index of refraction. This property was first predicted by John Pendry in 1996, and was later confirmed by the experimental demonstration of a negative index of refraction in a metamaterial by John Pendry and David Smith in 1998. The negative index of refraction allows for the manipulation of the Poynting vector and the bending of light, which has led to the development of superlenses and cloaking devices.

Another important property of metamaterials is their ability to exhibit superlensing. Superlenses are lenses that can focus light beyond the diffraction limit, allowing for imaging at resolutions that were previously thought impossible. This is made possible by the negative index of refraction in metamaterials, which allows for the manipulation of the Poynting vector and the bending of light.

Metamaterials also exhibit properties such as anisotropy and chirality. Anisotropy refers to the dependence of a material's properties on the direction of the applied field. Chirality refers to the handedness of a material, which can affect the polarization of light passing through it.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of metamaterials and their applications in more detail.

#### 1.4b Fabrication Techniques

The fabrication of metamaterials is a complex process that requires precise control over the arrangement and interaction of the constituent materials. There are several techniques that can be used to fabricate metamaterials, each with its own advantages and limitations.

##### 1.4b.1 Lithography

Lithography is a common technique used in the fabrication of metamaterials. It involves the use of a mask to pattern the material on a substrate. The mask is typically a photomask, which is created by exposing a photosensitive material to light through a patterned mask. The exposed areas are then developed, leaving behind a patterned photosensitive material. This pattern is then transferred to the substrate by a process called etching.

There are several types of lithography, including optical lithography, electron beam lithography, and X-ray lithography. Each of these techniques has its own advantages and limitations, and the choice of lithography technique depends on the specific requirements of the metamaterial being fabricated.

##### 1.4b.2 Electrodeposition

Electrodeposition is another common technique used in the fabrication of metamaterials. It involves the deposition of a thin layer of metal onto a substrate. This is typically done using an electroplating bath, which contains a solution of the metal to be deposited and an electrolyte. The substrate is made the cathode of an electric circuit, and the metal ions in the solution are reduced at the cathode, depositing a thin layer of metal onto the substrate.

Electrodeposition allows for the precise control of the thickness and composition of the deposited layer, making it a valuable technique in the fabrication of metamaterials.

##### 1.4b.3 3D Printing

3D printing is a relatively new technique that is being used to fabricate metamaterials. It involves the layer-by-layer construction of a three-dimensional object from a digital model. This is typically done using a computer-controlled machine that deposits material layer by layer, following the instructions in the digital model.

3D printing allows for the fabrication of complex three-dimensional structures with high precision, making it a promising technique for the fabrication of metamaterials.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of metamaterials and their applications in more detail.

#### 1.4b.1 Negative Index of Refraction

The negative index of refraction is a key property of both metamaterials and LHMs. It is a measure of how much a material can bend light, and is defined as the ratio of the electric field to the magnetic field in a material. In natural materials, this ratio is always positive, meaning that light is always bent in the same direction as the electric field. However, in metamaterials and LHMs, this ratio can be negative, allowing for the bending of light in the opposite direction to the electric field.

### Subsection: 1.5a Introduction to Split-ring Resonators

Split-ring resonators (SRRs) are a type of metamaterial that have been extensively studied for their unique properties and potential applications in electromagnetism. They are composed of a periodic array of split rings, with the rings being connected by a wire. This simple structure allows for the manipulation of electromagnetic waves in ways that were previously thought impossible.

The concept of SRRs was first introduced by John Pendry in 1996, who proposed that a periodic array of SRRs could produce a negative effective permittivity for certain frequency intervals. This idea was later expanded upon by Smith et al. in 2000, who successfully combined the SRRs with a periodic array of wires to create a left-handed material, which has negative values of ε and μ for a band of frequencies in the GHz range.

One of the key properties of SRRs is their ability to produce a negative index of refraction. This was first demonstrated by Pendry et al. in 1999, who used a three-dimensional array of intersecting thin wires to create negative values of ε. This concept was then applied to SRRs by Smith et al. in 2000, who were able to produce an effective negative μ by using a periodic array of copper SRRs.

The negative index of refraction in SRRs allows for the manipulation of electromagnetic waves in ways that were previously thought impossible. This has led to the development of superlenses, which can focus light beyond the diffraction limit, and cloaking devices, which can effectively hide objects from detection by electromagnetic waves.

LHMs are metamaterials that exhibit negative values of both permittivity and permeability, allowing for the manipulation of electromagnetic waves in ways that were previously thought impossible.

The concept of LHMs was first proposed by John Pendry in 1996, who suggested that a periodic array of SRRs could produce a negative effective permittivity for certain frequency intervals. This idea was later expanded upon by Smith et al. in 2000, who successfully combined the SRRs with a periodic array of wires to create a left-handed material, which has negative values of ε and μ for a band of frequencies in the GHz range.

One of the key properties of SRRs that makes them suitable for creating LHMs is their ability to produce a negative index of refraction. This was first demonstrated by Pendry et al. in 1999, who used a three-dimensional array of intersecting thin wires to create negative values of ε. This concept was then applied to SRRs by Smith et al. in 2000, who were able to produce an effective negative μ by using a periodic array of copper SRRs.

The negative index of refraction in SRRs allows for the manipulation of electromagnetic waves in ways that were previously thought impossible. This has led to the development of superlenses, which can focus light beyond the diffraction limit, and cloaking devices, which can effectively hide objects from detection by electromagnetic waves.

In addition to their applications in optics, SRRs have also been used for research in acoustic metamaterials. By manipulating the size and shape of the SRRs, researchers have been able to create materials with unique acoustic properties, such as negative effective mass density.

Overall, the combination of SRRs and LHMs has opened up new possibilities for manipulating electromagnetic waves and has the potential to revolutionize various fields, including telecommunications, imaging, and sensing. Further research and development in this area will continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with electromagnetic waves.

$$

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}
$$

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
$$

where $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field, $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field, $\rho$ is the charge density, $\mathbf{J}$ is the current density, and $\epsilon_0$ and $\mu_0$ are the permittivity and permeability of free space, respectively.

In left-handed materials, these equations take on a different form due to the negative refractive index. This results in a negative permittivity and permeability, leading to a modification of the equations. The modified equations are given by:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}
$$

$$

Superlensing is a technique that utilizes negative refraction to achieve sub-diffraction-limited imaging. This means that images can be formed with a resolution that is better than the diffraction limit of the lens. This has been demonstrated in various experiments and has potential applications in high-resolution imaging.

Cloaking is another application of negative refraction that has gained significant attention. It involves using negative refraction to manipulate the path of light, allowing for the creation of invisible objects or the hiding of objects from detection. This has been demonstrated in various experiments and has potential applications in stealth technology and security.

The negative permittivity and permeability in left-handed materials result in a negative refractive index, which leads to the phenomenon of negative refraction. This means that light can be bent in the opposite direction of its normal path, leading to a variety of interesting applications.

In left-handed materials, the wave equations can be solved using the method of separation of variables. This involves assuming a solution of the form:

$$
E(x,y,z,t) = X(x)Y(y)Z(z)T(t)
$$

Substituting this into the wave equations, we can obtain a set of ordinary differential equations for each variable. Solving these equations, we can obtain the propagation constants and the wave functions for each variable.

The propagation constants in left-handed materials are complex, unlike in a vacuum where they are real. This complex nature of the propagation constants leads to a phenomenon known as wave splitting, where a wave can split into two or more waves with different propagation constants. This can result in the formation of new types of waves, such as surface plasmons, which have unique properties and can be used for various applications.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of wave splitting in more detail and discuss its implications for wave propagation in left-handed materials.

#### 2.2b Wave Propagation in LHMs

In the previous section, we discussed the basics of wave propagation in left-handed materials. Now, we will delve deeper into the topic and explore the propagation of waves in these materials.

The propagation of waves in left-handed materials is governed by the wave equations, which we have already discussed. These equations are modified due to the negative refractive index, resulting in a negative permittivity and permeability. This leads to a complex propagation of waves, with the propagation constants being complex.

The complex propagation constants in left-handed materials result in a phenomenon known as wave splitting. This is where a wave can split into two or more waves with different propagation constants. This can lead to the formation of new types of waves, such as surface plasmons, which have unique properties and can be used for various applications.

The propagation of waves in left-handed materials can also be affected by the presence of interfaces. These interfaces can cause reflections and refractions of waves, leading to changes in the propagation of waves. The continuity conditions at these interfaces can be used to determine the constants A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H in the wave equations.

The field components in left-handed materials can be calculated using the wave equations. These components are given by:

$$
E_{y}=\frac{1}{j\omega \varepsilon }\frac{\mathrm{dL} }{\mathrm{d} z}\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}^{TM}-L\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}^{TE}=\frac{-k_{z}}{\omega \varepsilon }L\frac{\partial T }{\partial y}^{TM}-L\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}^{TE} \ \ \ \ \ \ (28)
$$

$$
L \ T^{TM}=\frac{k^{2}-k_{z}^{2}}{j\omega \varepsilon } L \ T^{TM} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (29)
$$

$$
H_{z}=\frac{k_{t}^{2}}{j\omega \mu } L \ T^{TE}=\frac{k^{2}-k_{z}^{2}}{j\omega \mu } L \ T^{TE} \ \ \ \ (32)
$$

Imposing the continuity conditions at each interface, we can determine the constants A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H in the wave equations. This allows us to fully understand the propagation of waves in left-handed materials.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of wave splitting in more detail and discuss its implications for wave propagation in left-handed materials.

#### 2.2c Wave Propagation Applications

One of the most promising applications of wave propagation in left-handed materials is in the field of cloaking. By manipulating the wave propagation in these materials, it is possible to create devices that can cloak objects from detection by electromagnetic waves. This is achieved by using the wave splitting phenomenon to create a wave that bypasses the object, effectively making it invisible to the electromagnetic wave.

Another application is in the field of plasmonic devices. Surface plasmons, which are formed when a wave propagates in a left-handed material, can be used to create devices with enhanced light-matter interactions. This can be useful in applications such as sensing and imaging.

The propagation of waves in left-handed materials can also be used in the design of metamaterials. These are materials with properties that are not found in nature, such as negative refractive index. By manipulating the wave propagation in left-handed materials, it is possible to create metamaterials with unique properties that can be used in a variety of applications.

In addition to these applications, the study of wave propagation in left-handed materials is also important for understanding the behavior of waves in other complex media.

### Section 2.2 Wave Propagation in LHMs

In the previous section, we explored the basics of wave propagation in left-handed materials. In this section, we will delve deeper into the topic and discuss the dispersion relations in these materials.

#### 2.2b Wave Propagation in LHMs

The dispersion relations in left-handed materials are a key aspect of understanding wave propagation in these materials. These relations describe the relationship between the frequency of a wave and its wavenumber, and they are crucial for predicting the behavior of waves in these materials.

The dispersion relations in left-handed materials are given by:

$$
\epsilon(\omega) = \epsilon_0 - \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2 + j\omega\gamma}
$$

$$
\mu(\omega) = \mu_0 - \frac{\omega_m^2}{\omega^2 + j\omega\gamma}
$$

where $\epsilon_0$ and $\mu_0$ are the permittivity and permeability of the vacuum, $\omega_p$ and $\omega_m$ are the plasma and magnetization frequencies, and $\gamma$ is the damping factor.

These relations show that the permittivity and permeability in left-handed materials are frequency-dependent, unlike in a vacuum where they are constant. This frequency dependence leads to a variety of interesting phenomena, such as negative refraction and wave splitting.

The dispersion relations can be used to derive the wave equations in left-handed materials. By substituting the expressions for $\epsilon(\omega)$ and $\mu(\omega)$ into the wave equations, we can obtain a set of coupled differential equations that describe the propagation of waves in these materials.

Solving these equations can be a challenging task, but it is crucial for understanding the behavior of waves in left-handed materials. The solutions to these equations can provide valuable insights into the properties of these materials, such as their effective refractive index and their bandwidth.

In the next section, we will explore some of the applications of left-handed materials, and how their unique properties can be harnessed for various applications.

#### 2.2c.1 Negative Refraction

One of the most intriguing properties of left-handed materials is their ability to exhibit negative refraction. This phenomenon occurs when the effective refractive index of a material is negative, leading to a reversal of the normal laws of refraction. This can be seen in the dispersion relations, where the permittivity and permeability can become negative at certain frequencies.

Negative refraction has been used in the design of superlenses, which can achieve sub-diffraction-limited imaging. These lenses have the potential to revolutionize imaging technology, allowing for the creation of images with a resolution beyond the limits of traditional lenses.

#### 2.2c.2 Wave Splitting

Another interesting property of left-handed materials is their ability to split waves into two separate waves. This occurs when the dispersion relations of the material cause the wave to split into two waves with different wavelengths. This phenomenon has been used in the design of wave splitters, which can separate a wave into two separate waves with different frequencies.

#### 2.2c.3 Sensing Applications

The frequency dependence of the permittivity and permeability in left-handed materials makes them ideal for sensing applications. By measuring the changes in these properties, it is possible to detect changes in the environment, such as temperature or pressure. This has led to the development of sensors for a variety of applications, including medical diagnostics and environmental monitoring.

### Subsection 2.3a Definitions and Differences

In the previous section, we discussed the practical applications of left-handed materials. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of group velocity and phase velocity, two important parameters that describe the behavior of waves in these materials.

#### 2.3a.1 Group Velocity

The group velocity of a wave is defined as the velocity at which the overall shape of the waves' amplitudes—known as the modulation or envelope of the wave—propagates through space. For a wave packet, this is the velocity at which the entire packet moves. The group velocity is given by the derivative of the dispersion relation with respect to the wave vector:

$$
v_g = \frac{d\omega}{dk}
$$

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency and $k$ is the wave vector.

In left-handed materials, the group velocity can be negative, leading to the phenomenon of negative refraction. This is due to the frequency dependence of the permittivity and permeability, which can cause the dispersion relation to cross the light line, resulting in a negative group velocity.

#### 2.3a.2 Phase Velocity

The phase velocity of a wave, on the other hand, is defined as the velocity at which the phase of the wave propagates through space. For a plane wave, this is the velocity at which the phase of the wave changes along the direction of propagation. The phase velocity is given by the ratio of the angular frequency to the wave vector:

$$
v_p = \frac{\omega}{k}
$$

In left-handed materials, the phase velocity can also be negative, leading to the phenomenon of negative refraction. However, unlike the group velocity, the phase velocity remains negative even when the dispersion relation is above the light line.

#### 2.3a.3 Differences between Group Velocity and Phase Velocity

While both group velocity and phase velocity describe the propagation of waves in left-handed materials, they do so in different ways. The group velocity describes the propagation of the wave packet, while the phase velocity describes the propagation of the phase of the wave. 

In addition, the group velocity and phase velocity can have different signs. As mentioned earlier, the group velocity can be negative, leading to negative refraction, while the phase velocity can also be negative but remains negative even when the dispersion relation is above the light line.

Understanding the differences between group velocity and phase velocity is crucial for understanding the behavior of waves in left-handed materials. In the next section, we will explore how these parameters can be manipulated to achieve desired outcomes in various applications.





#### 2.3b Group and Phase Velocity in LHMs

In the previous section, we discussed the definitions and differences between group velocity and phase velocity. Now, we will explore how these concepts apply to left-handed materials (LHMs).

#### 2.3b.1 Group Velocity in LHMs

In LHMs, the group velocity can be negative, leading to the phenomenon of negative refraction. This is due to the frequency dependence of the permittivity and permeability, which can cause the dispersion relation to cross the light line, resulting in a negative group velocity. This negative group velocity is a key factor in the unique properties of LHMs, such as their ability to guide electromagnetic waves along their interfaces.

The group velocity in LHMs can be calculated using the dispersion relation, which relates the angular frequency $\omega$ to the wave vector $k$. For LHMs, this dispersion relation can be written as:

$$
\omega = \sqrt{k^2c^2 - \frac{k^4}{k_c^2}}
$$

where $c$ is the speed of light and $k_c$ is the cut-off wave number. The group velocity $v_g$ is then given by the derivative of this dispersion relation with respect to the wave vector:

$$
v_g = \frac{d\omega}{dk} = \frac{kc^2 - \frac{k^3}{k_c^2}}{\sqrt{k^2c^2 - \frac{k^4}{k_c^2}}}
$$

For $k < k_c$, the group velocity is positive, indicating that the wave packet propagates in the positive direction. However, for $k > k_c$, the group velocity becomes negative, indicating that the wave packet propagates in the negative direction.

#### 2.3b.2 Phase Velocity in LHMs

Similar to the group velocity, the phase velocity in LHMs can also be negative. This is due to the fact that the phase velocity is given by the ratio of the angular frequency to the wave vector, which can become negative when the dispersion relation crosses the light line.

The phase velocity in LHMs can be calculated using the same dispersion relation as above. The phase velocity $v_p$ is given by the ratio of the angular frequency to the wave vector:

$$
v_p = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{\sqrt{k^2c^2 - \frac{k^4}{k_c^2}}}{k}
$$

For $k < k_c$, the phase velocity is positive, indicating that the phase of the wave propagates in the positive direction. However, for $k > k_c$, the phase velocity becomes negative, indicating that the phase of the wave propagates in the negative direction.

#### 2.3b.3 Implications of Negative Group and Phase Velocity

The negative group and phase velocity in LHMs have significant implications for the propagation of electromagnetic waves. These negative velocities allow for the phenomenon of negative refraction, where electromagnetic waves can be guided along the interface of two LHMs. This property has been exploited in the design of superlenses, which can focus light beyond the diffraction limit.

Furthermore, the negative group and phase velocity also lead to the phenomenon of superluminal phase velocity, where the phase velocity of the wave can exceed the speed of light. This does not violate the speed limit of causality, as the group velocity, which carries information, remains subluminal.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of these unique properties of LHMs in more detail.




#### 2.3c Implications and Applications

The unique properties of left-handed materials, such as their ability to guide electromagnetic waves along their interfaces, have significant implications for various applications. In this section, we will explore some of these implications and applications.

#### 2.3c.1 Negative Refraction

The phenomenon of negative refraction, where the group velocity of light is negative, is a key property of left-handed materials. This property has been harnessed in the development of superlenses, which can achieve sub-diffraction-limit imaging. These superlenses have the potential to revolutionize imaging technology, allowing for the visualization of structures that were previously thought to be beyond the limits of optical microscopy.

#### 2.3c.2 Cloaking Devices

The negative group velocity in left-handed materials also has implications for the development of cloaking devices. By manipulating the dispersion relation, it is possible to create a region of space where light appears to bend around an object, effectively cloaking it from view. This technology has the potential to revolutionize stealth technology, allowing for the development of invisible aircraft and ships.

#### 2.3c.3 Negative Index of Refraction

The negative group velocity and phase velocity in left-handed materials can also lead to a negative index of refraction. This means that light can be guided in both the positive and negative directions, leading to the development of new types of waveguides and optical fibers. These devices could potentially revolutionize telecommunications, allowing for the transmission of information at higher speeds and with greater security.

#### 2.3c.4 Challenges and Future Directions

Despite the potential of left-handed materials, there are still many challenges to overcome. For example, the development of superlenses and cloaking devices requires precise control over the dispersion relation, which is still a topic of ongoing research. Furthermore, the negative index of refraction is only achievable at certain frequencies, limiting its practical applications. However, ongoing research in this field is promising, and it is likely that these challenges will be overcome in the near future.

In conclusion, the unique properties of left-handed materials, such as their ability to guide electromagnetic waves along their interfaces, have significant implications for various applications. These applications, while still in their early stages, have the potential to revolutionize various fields, from imaging technology to telecommunications.

## Chapter: Chapter 3: Negative Refraction and Superlensing

### Introduction

In this chapter, we delve into the fascinating world of negative refraction and superlensing, two fundamental concepts in the field of electromagnetism. These concepts, while seemingly counterintuitive, have been experimentally verified and have opened up new possibilities in the field of optics and telecommunications.

Negative refraction, also known as the Pendry effect, is a phenomenon where light is bent in the opposite direction to what is expected according to the laws of optics. This effect is possible due to the properties of metamaterials, which are artificially engineered materials with unique electromagnetic properties not found in nature. The concept of negative refraction was first proposed by physicist John Pendry in 1996, and it has since been demonstrated in several experiments.

Superlensing, on the other hand, is a technique that allows for the imaging of objects with a resolution beyond the diffraction limit of conventional lenses. This is made possible by the use of metamaterials, which can manipulate the properties of light in ways that conventional materials cannot. Superlensing has the potential to revolutionize imaging technology, allowing for the creation of high-resolution images that were previously thought to be impossible.

Throughout this chapter, we will explore these concepts in detail, discussing their principles, applications, and the latest research in the field.

#### 2.4a Introduction to Anisotropy

Anisotropy is a fundamental concept in the study of left-handed materials (LHMs). It refers to the property of these materials where their physical properties, such as their dielectric and magnetic properties, vary depending on the direction in which they are measured. This is in contrast to isotropic materials, where these properties are the same in all directions.

The anisotropy of LHMs is a direct result of their unique dispersion relations. As we have seen in the previous sections, the dispersion relations of LHMs can be represented by a biaxial tensor, which describes how the phase velocity of light varies with direction. This tensor is characterized by three distinct principal stretches, $\lambda_i$, which represent the phase velocities in three orthogonal directions.

The anisotropy of LHMs can have significant implications for their behavior in electromagnetic fields. For example, the anisotropy of the dielectric and magnetic properties can lead to the phenomenon of negative refraction, where the group velocity of light is negative. This property has been harnessed in the development of superlenses and cloaking devices, as discussed in the previous section.

However, the anisotropy of LHMs also presents challenges for their practical application. For instance, the directional dependence of their properties can make it difficult to design and fabricate devices that rely on these materials. Furthermore, the anisotropy can also lead to the phenomenon of birefringence, where light splits into two beams with different phase velocities when passing through the material. This can cause significant distortion in images and signals, which can be a major limitation in applications such as imaging and telecommunications.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the anisotropy of LHMs, exploring its implications for their behavior in electromagnetic fields and discussing strategies for mitigating its challenges.

#### 2.4b Anisotropy in LHMs

The anisotropy of left-handed materials (LHMs) is a complex phenomenon that is deeply rooted in their unique dispersion relations. As we have seen, the dispersion relations of LHMs can be represented by a biaxial tensor, which describes how the phase velocity of light varies with direction. This tensor is characterized by three distinct principal stretches, $\lambda_i$, which represent the phase velocities in three orthogonal directions.

The anisotropy of LHMs is a direct result of these three distinct principal stretches. In isotropic materials, these stretches are all equal, leading to a uniform phase velocity in all directions. However, in anisotropic materials like LHMs, these stretches are different, leading to a directional dependence of the phase velocity. This directional dependence is what gives rise to the anisotropic properties of LHMs.

The anisotropy of LHMs can be further understood by considering the spectral decompositions of the deformation gradient tensor, $\mathbf{F}$, and the left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor, $\mathbf{B}$. These decompositions are given by

$$
\mathbf{F} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \lambda_i^2 \mathbf{N}_i \otimes \mathbf{N}_i \qquad \text{and} \qquad \mathbf{B} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \lambda_i^2 \mathbf{n}_i \otimes \mathbf{n}_i
$$

where $\mathbf{N}_i$ and $\mathbf{n}_i$ are the principal directions of the deformation gradient tensor and the left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor, respectively. These decompositions show that the anisotropy of LHMs is a result of the distinct principal stretches, $\lambda_i$, and the corresponding principal directions, $\mathbf{N}_i$ and $\mathbf{n}_i$.

The anisotropy of LHMs can have significant implications for their behavior in electromagnetic fields. For example, the anisotropy of the dielectric and magnetic properties can lead to the phenomenon of negative refraction, where the group velocity of light is negative. This property has been harnessed in the development of superlenses and cloaking devices, as discussed in the previous section.

However, the anisotropy of LHMs also presents challenges for their practical application. For instance, the directional dependence of their properties can make it difficult to design and fabricate devices that rely on these materials. Furthermore, the anisotropy can also lead to the phenomenon of birefringence, where light splits into two beams with different phase velocities when passing through the material. This can cause significant distortion in images and signals, which can be a major limitation in applications such as imaging and telecommunications.

In the next section, we will explore some strategies for mitigating these challenges and harnessing the anisotropic properties of LHMs for practical applications.

#### 2.4c Applications of Anisotropy

The anisotropy of left-handed materials (LHMs) has been exploited in a variety of applications, particularly in the field of electromagnetics. The unique properties of LHMs, such as their ability to guide electromagnetic waves along their interfaces, have led to the development of several advanced technologies.

One of the most significant applications of the anisotropy of LHMs is in the field of metamaterials. Metamaterials are artificially engineered materials that have properties not found in nature. They are typically composed of subwavelength structures that interact with electromagnetic waves in a way that is not possible with natural materials. The anisotropy of LHMs plays a crucial role in the design and operation of these materials.

For instance, the negative refraction property of LHMs, which allows for the bending of light around corners, is exploited in the design of superlenses. These lenses can achieve sub-diffraction-limit imaging, allowing for the visualization of structures that were previously thought to be beyond the limits of optical microscopy.

Another application of the anisotropy of LHMs is in the development of cloaking devices. These devices use the anisotropic properties of LHMs to bend light around an object, effectively making it invisible. This technology has the potential to revolutionize stealth technology, allowing for the development of invisible aircraft and ships.

The anisotropy of LHMs also plays a crucial role in the development of negative index of refraction materials. These materials have a negative index of refraction, which means that light can be guided in both the positive and negative directions. This property has been harnessed in the development of new types of waveguides and optical fibers, which could potentially revolutionize telecommunications.

Despite these promising applications, the anisotropy of LHMs also presents challenges for their practical use. The directional dependence of their properties can make it difficult to design and fabricate devices that rely on these materials. Furthermore, the anisotropy can also lead to the phenomenon of birefringence, where light splits into two beams with different phase velocities when passing through the material. This can cause significant distortion in images and signals, which can be a major limitation in applications such as imaging and telecommunications.

In conclusion, the anisotropy of LHMs is a complex phenomenon with significant implications for their behavior in electromagnetic fields. While it presents challenges for their practical use, it also opens up exciting possibilities for the development of advanced technologies.

## Chapter: Chapter 3: Negative Refraction

### Introduction

In the realm of electromagnetism, the concept of negative refraction has been a subject of intense research and debate. This chapter, "Negative Refraction," will delve into the intricacies of this phenomenon, exploring its implications and applications in the field of electromagnetics.

Negative refraction, a concept first proposed by John Pendry in 1996, is a phenomenon where an electromagnetic wave is refracted in a medium with a negative index of refraction. This is in contrast to the more common positive refraction, where the wave is bent towards the normal when passing from one medium to another. The negative refraction is a result of the wave's phase velocity being greater than the speed of light in the medium.

The chapter will explore the mathematical models that describe negative refraction, including the Pendry's original model and subsequent extensions. These models, expressed in terms of the electromagnetic wave's wavelength and frequency, provide a quantitative understanding of the phenomenon. For instance, the Pendry's model can be represented as:

$$
n = 1 - \frac{1}{\pi} \frac{k_0 a}{\sqrt{\epsilon_r}}
$$

where $n$ is the index of refraction, $k_0$ is the wave number of the wave in vacuum, $a$ is the size of the subwavelength structure, and $\epsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity of the medium.

Furthermore, the chapter will discuss the implications of negative refraction in various applications, such as superlenses and cloaking devices. These applications, while still in the early stages of development, hold great promise for the future of electromagnetics.

In conclusion, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of negative refraction, its mathematical description, and its potential applications. By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid grasp of this fascinating phenomenon and its implications for the field of electromagnetics.




#### 2.4b Anisotropy in LHMs

The anisotropy of left-handed materials (LHMs) is a complex phenomenon that is deeply rooted in their unique dispersion relations. As we have seen in the previous sections, the dispersion relations of LHMs can be represented by a biaxial tensor, which describes how the phase velocity of light varies with direction. This tensor is characterized by three distinct principal stretches, $\lambda_i$, which represent the phase velocities in three orthogonal directions.

The anisotropy of LHMs is a direct result of these distinct phase velocities. In isotropic materials, the phase velocity is the same in all directions. However, in LHMs, the phase velocity can vary significantly depending on the direction in which it is measured. This variation can lead to a range of interesting and complex behaviors, including negative refraction and birefringence.

Negative refraction is a phenomenon where the group velocity of light is negative. This is a direct result of the anisotropy of LHMs. The group velocity, $v_g$, is given by the derivative of the phase velocity with respect to frequency, $v_g = \frac{d\lambda}{df}$. In LHMs, the phase velocity can vary significantly with frequency, leading to a situation where the group velocity can be negative. This property has been harnessed in the development of superlenses and cloaking devices, which can manipulate the phase velocity of light to achieve effects such as super-resolution and invisibility.

Birefringence is another important consequence of the anisotropy of LHMs. When light passes through an anisotropic material, it splits into two beams with different phase velocities. This is because the material's dielectric and magnetic properties vary with direction. The two beams can have different polarizations, leading to a phenomenon known as double refraction. This can cause significant distortion in images and signals, which can be a major limitation in applications such as imaging and telecommunications.

Despite these challenges, the anisotropy of LHMs also presents exciting opportunities for the development of new technologies. For instance, the anisotropy can be exploited to create materials with unique optical properties, such as negative index of refraction. This could lead to the development of new types of lenses and imaging systems. Furthermore, the anisotropy can also be used to create materials with unique magnetic properties, which could have applications in fields such as data storage and information processing.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the anisotropy of LHMs, exploring its implications for their behavior in electromagnetic fields and discussing strategies for mitigating its challenges.

The anisotropy of left-handed materials (LHMs) has significant implications for their applications in various fields. The unique properties of LHMs, such as negative refraction and birefringence, can be harnessed to create materials with unique optical and magnetic properties.

##### Negative Index of Refraction

The negative refraction property of LHMs has been exploited to create materials with a negative index of refraction. This is a phenomenon where the material's refractive index is negative, leading to a range of interesting effects. For instance, a negative index of refraction can be used to create superlenses that can achieve sub-diffraction-limited imaging. This is because the negative index of refraction allows light to bend in the opposite direction to conventional materials, leading to a situation where light can be focused to a point smaller than the diffraction limit.

##### Cloaking Devices

The negative refraction property of LHMs has also been used to create cloaking devices. These devices can manipulate the phase velocity of light to make objects invisible. The cloaking device works by bending light around the object, effectively hiding it from view. This is possible because the negative refraction property of LHMs allows light to bend in the opposite direction to conventional materials.

##### Magnetic Applications

The anisotropy of LHMs can also be exploited to create materials with unique magnetic properties. For instance, the biaxial tensor that describes the dispersion relations of LHMs can be used to create materials with different magnetic properties in different directions. This could have applications in fields such as data storage and information processing.

##### Challenges and Future Directions

Despite these exciting applications, there are still many challenges associated with the use of LHMs. For instance, the anisotropy of LHMs can lead to significant distortion in images and signals, which can be a major limitation in applications such as imaging and telecommunications. Furthermore, the fabrication of LHMs is still a complex process, and there are many challenges associated with scaling up these materials for practical applications.

In the future, it is likely that further research will be needed to overcome these challenges. This could involve developing new fabrication techniques, as well as exploring new ways to exploit the anisotropy of LHMs. Despite these challenges, the potential of LHMs is immense, and it is likely that these materials will play a significant role in the future of electromagnetism.

## Chapter: Chapter 3: Negative Refraction and Superlenses

### Introduction

In the realm of electromagnetism, the concepts of negative refraction and superlenses are two of the most intriguing and groundbreaking developments. This chapter, "Negative Refraction and Superlenses," will delve into these concepts, providing a comprehensive understanding of their principles, applications, and implications.

Negative refraction, a phenomenon that was once thought to be impossible, was first theorized by physicist Victor Veselago in 1968. It is a property of certain materials, known as left-handed materials, where the refractive index is negative.

#### 2.5a Introduction to Birefringence

Birefringence is a fundamental property of left-handed materials (LHMs) that arises from their anisotropic nature. It is a measure of the difference in refractive indices for light polarized in different directions. In LHMs, birefringence can lead to a range of interesting phenomena, including negative refraction and the creation of superlenses and cloaking devices.

Birefringence in LHMs can be understood in terms of the dispersion relations that govern the interaction of light with these materials. The dispersion relations in LHMs are governed by the equations:

$$
\epsilon(\omega) = \epsilon_0 + \frac{\epsilon_1}{\omega^2 - \omega_0^2 + i\omega\gamma}
$$

and

$$
\mu(\omega) = \mu_0 + \frac{\mu_1}{\omega^2 - \omega_0^2 + i\omega\gamma}
$$

where $\epsilon(\omega)$ and $\mu(\omega)$ are the frequency-dependent permittivity and permeability of the LHM, respectively, $\epsilon_0$ and $\mu_0$ are the static permittivity and permeability, $\epsilon_1$ and $\mu_1$ are the oscillator strengths, $\omega_0$ is the resonance frequency, and $\gamma$ is the damping factor.

These equations show that the permittivity and permeability of LHMs are frequency-dependent and complex, reflecting the anisotropic nature of these materials. The birefringence arises from the difference in the real parts of the permittivity and permeability for light polarized in different directions.

In the next sections, we will delve deeper into the implications of birefringence in LHMs, exploring its role in negative refraction, superlenses, and cloaking devices. We will also discuss the practical applications of these phenomena, and how they are being used to push the boundaries of what is possible in optics and electromagnetism.

#### 2.5b Birefringence in LHMs

The birefringence in left-handed materials (LHMs) is a direct result of their anisotropic nature. As we have seen in the previous section, the permittivity and permeability of LHMs are frequency-dependent and complex, reflecting the anisotropic nature of these materials. This anisotropy leads to a difference in the refractive indices for light polarized in different directions, which is the essence of birefringence.

The birefringence in LHMs can be quantified by the birefringence parameter, denoted by $\Delta n$. This parameter is defined as the difference in the refractive indices for light polarized in two perpendicular directions. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
\Delta n = n_x - n_y
$$

where $n_x$ and $n_y$ are the refractive indices for light polarized in the x and y directions, respectively.

The birefringence parameter $\Delta n$ is a key factor in determining the optical properties of LHMs. For instance, it plays a crucial role in the phenomenon of negative refraction, where light is refracted in the opposite direction to its normal refraction. This phenomenon is possible due to the birefringence in LHMs, which allows for the manipulation of the phase velocity of light.

Furthermore, the birefringence in LHMs is also responsible for the creation of superlenses and cloaking devices. Superlenses, which can achieve super-resolution, rely on the birefringence to manipulate the phase velocity of light and achieve negative refraction. Similarly, cloaking devices, which make objects invisible by manipulating the phase velocity of light, also rely on the birefringence in LHMs.

In the next section, we will explore the practical applications of birefringence in LHMs, focusing on the creation of superlenses and cloaking devices. We will also discuss the challenges and future prospects of these applications.

#### 2.5c Applications of Birefringence

The birefringence in left-handed materials (LHMs) has a wide range of applications in the field of optics and electromagnetism. In this section, we will explore some of these applications, focusing on the creation of superlenses and cloaking devices.

##### Superlenses

Superlenses are a type of lens that can achieve super-resolution, i.e., they can focus light to a point smaller than the diffraction limit. This is possible due to the birefringence in LHMs, which allows for the manipulation of the phase velocity of light.

The principle behind superlenses is based on the phenomenon of negative refraction. As we have seen in the previous section, negative refraction is possible due to the birefringence in LHMs, which allows for the manipulation of the phase velocity of light. By manipulating the birefringence, it is possible to create a lens that can focus light to a point smaller than the diffraction limit.

The creation of superlenses has been demonstrated in several experiments. For instance, in 2000, John Pendry proposed the concept of a superlens in a paper titled "The negative-index metamaterial and its applications". This was followed by several experimental demonstrations, including a 2006 experiment by David Smith and his colleagues at the University of Rochester, which demonstrated a superlens made from a metamaterial with a negative effective index.

##### Cloaking Devices

Cloaking devices are another important application of birefringence in LHMs. These devices make objects invisible by manipulating the phase velocity of light.

The principle behind cloaking devices is based on the concept of transformation optics, which was first proposed by John Pendry in 1996. Transformation optics allows for the manipulation of the phase velocity of light by transforming the space in which the light propagates. By manipulating the birefringence in LHMs, it is possible to transform the space in such a way that light passing through an object is transformed into a different path, making the object invisible.

Cloaking devices have been demonstrated in several experiments. For instance, in 2006, David Smith and his colleagues at the University of Rochester demonstrated a cloaking device that made a metallic object invisible to microwave radiation.

#### 2.5b Birefringence in LHMs

The birefringence in left-handed materials (LHMs) is a direct result of their anisotropic nature. As we have seen in the previous section, the permittivity and permeability of LHMs are frequency-dependent and complex, reflecting the anisotropic nature of these materials. The birefringence arises from the difference in the real parts of the permittivity and permeability for light polarized in different directions.

The birefringence can be quantified using the Stokes parameters, which describe the polarization state of light. For purely monochromatic coherent radiation, the Stokes parameters satisfy the condition $Q^2 + U^2 + V^2 = I^2$, where $I$ is the total intensity of the beam. For the whole (non-coherent) beam radiation, the Stokes parameters are defined as averaged quantities, and the previous equation becomes $Q^2 + U^2 + V^2 = I^2/2$.

In LHMs, the birefringence can lead to a range of interesting phenomena, including negative refraction and the creation of superlenses and cloaking devices. These phenomena are a direct result of the anisotropic nature of LHMs and the birefringence that arises from it.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the implications of birefringence in LHMs, exploring its role in negative refraction, superlenses, and cloaking devices. We will also discuss the practical applications of these phenomena, and how they are being used to push the boundaries of what is possible in optics and electromagnetism.

##### Negative Refraction

One of the most significant applications of birefringence in LHMs is in the phenomenon of negative refraction. As we have seen in the previous sections, the birefringence in LHMs can lead to a negative value of the effective refractive index. This negative refraction can be used to create superlenses, which have the potential to overcome the diffraction limit of conventional lenses.

The negative refraction in LHMs can be understood in terms of the Stokes parameters. For light propagating in a LHM, the Stokes parameters can take on negative values, leading to a negative value of the effective refractive index. This negative refraction can be exploited to create superlenses that can focus light beyond the diffraction limit of conventional lenses.

##### Cloaking Devices

Another important application of birefringence in LHMs is in the development of cloaking devices. These devices use the birefringence of LHMs to manipulate the polarization state of light, allowing them to hide objects from detection by conventional optical systems.

The cloaking effect is achieved by manipulating the Stokes parameters of the light. By controlling the birefringence of the LHM, the Stokes parameters can be manipulated to make the object appear invisible to the observer. This is achieved by ensuring that the Stokes parameters of the light scattered by the object are the same as those of the incident light.

##### Other Applications

The birefringence in LHMs also has applications in other areas of optics and electromagnetism. For example, it is used in the design of polarizers and wave plates, which are essential components in many optical systems. The birefringence also plays a crucial role in the operation of lasers, where it is used to control the polarization state of the laser light.

In conclusion, the birefringence in LHMs has a wide range of applications in optics and electromagnetism. Its unique properties make it an essential material in the development of advanced optical devices and technologies.

## Chapter 3: Green’s Functions for Planarly Layered Media:

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of electromagnetism, including Maxwell's equations and the behavior of electromagnetic waves in various media. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the study of electromagnetism by introducing the concept of Green's functions. Green's functions, also known as propagators, are mathematical objects that describe the response of a system to a perturbation. In the context of electromagnetism, they are used to describe the propagation of electromagnetic waves in different media.

In this chapter, we will focus on Green's functions for planarly layered media. Planarly layered media are materials that have different properties in different directions. This can be due to the anisotropic nature of the material or the presence of interfaces between different materials. Green's functions for planarly layered media are particularly useful in understanding the behavior of electromagnetic waves in complex media, such as metamaterials and metasurfaces.

We will begin by discussing the basics of Green's functions and their properties. We will then move on to explore the Green's functions for planarly layered media, including their derivation and applications. We will also discuss the concept of boundary conditions and how they relate to Green's functions. Finally, we will provide some examples and exercises to help solidify the concepts learned in this chapter.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of Green's functions for planarly layered media and their importance in the study of electromagnetism. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the more advanced topics covered in later chapters. So let us begin our journey into the world of Green's functions and their applications in electromagnetism.




### Section 3.1 Dyadic Green's Functions:

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of electromagnetism, including Maxwell's equations and the behavior of electromagnetic waves in various media. In this section, we will delve deeper into the study of electromagnetism by introducing the concept of dyadic Green's functions.

#### 3.1a Introduction to Dyadic Green's Functions

Green's functions, also known as propagators, are mathematical objects that describe the response of a system to a perturbation. In the context of electromagnetism, they are used to describe the propagation of electromagnetic waves in different media. Dyadic Green's functions, in particular, are used to describe the propagation of electromagnetic waves in planarly layered media.

Dyadic Green's functions are defined as the solution to the following equation:

$$
\nabla \times \nabla \times \mathbf{\hat G}(\omega,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)^{2}\varepsilon(\mathbf{r}, \omega)\mathbf{\hat G}(\omega,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') + \mathbf{\hat 1}\delta(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'),
$$

where $\mathbf{\hat 1}$ is the identity matrix and $\varepsilon(\mathbf{r}, \omega)$ is the permittivity of the medium at a given point $\mathbf{r}$ and frequency $\omega$. The Green's function, denoted as $\mathbf{\hat G}(\omega,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}')$, is a 3x3 matrix and is called a dyadic.

The dyadic Green's function is particularly useful in planarly layered media, where the properties of the medium vary in different directions. This can be due to the anisotropic nature of the material or the presence of interfaces between different materials. By using dyadic Green's functions, we can accurately describe the propagation of electromagnetic waves in these complex media.

In the next section, we will explore the properties of dyadic Green's functions and their applications in planarly layered media. We will also discuss the concept of boundary conditions and how they relate to Green's functions. Finally, we will provide some examples and exercises to help solidify the concepts learned in this section.





#### 3.1b Dyadic Green's Functions in Planarly Layered Media

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of dyadic Green's functions and their importance in describing the propagation of electromagnetic waves in planarly layered media. In this section, we will delve deeper into the properties of dyadic Green's functions and their applications in these media.

#### 3.1b.1 Properties of Dyadic Green's Functions

Dyadic Green's functions have several important properties that make them useful in the study of electromagnetism. These properties include:

1. **Linearity:** The dyadic Green's function is linear, meaning that it satisfies the following properties:

    - **Superposition:** If $\mathbf{J}_1(\mathbf{r})$ and $\mathbf{J}_2(\mathbf{r})$ are sources, then the response is given by the sum of the individual responses:

$$
\mathbf{\hat G}(\omega,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') = \mathbf{\hat G}(\omega,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') + \mathbf{\hat G}(\omega,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}').
$$

    - **Homogeneity:** If $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r})$ is a source, then the response is proportional to the source:

$$
\mathbf{\hat G}(\omega,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') = k\mathbf{\hat G}(\omega,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}'),
$$

where $k$ is a constant.

2. **Causality:** The dyadic Green's function satisfies the causality condition, which states that the response at a point $\mathbf{r}'$ due to a source at $\mathbf{r}$ must be zero if $\mathbf{r}'$ is outside the causal cone of $\mathbf{r}$. This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\mathbf{\hat G}(\omega,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') = 0, \quad \text{if } |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'| > c/\omega.
$$

3. **Hermiticity:** The dyadic Green's function is Hermitian, meaning that it satisfies the following property:

$$
\mathbf{\hat G}(\omega,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') = \mathbf{\hat G}^*(\omega,\mathbf{r}',\mathbf{r}),
$$

where $\mathbf{\hat G}^*(\omega,\mathbf{r}',\mathbf{r})$ is the complex conjugate of $\mathbf{\hat G}(\omega,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}')$.

#### 3.1b.2 Applications of Dyadic Green's Functions

The properties of dyadic Green's functions make them useful in a variety of applications in electromagnetism. Some of these applications include:

1. **Electromagnetic Field Calculation:** Dyadic Green's functions can be used to calculate the electromagnetic field due to a source in a planarly layered medium. This is done by convolving the source with the dyadic Green's function of the medium.

2. **Scattering Problems:** Dyadic Green's functions are also used in scattering problems, where the goal is to determine the scattered field due to an object in a medium. This is done by convolving the Green's function of the medium with the boundary conditions of the object.

3. **Boundary Value Problems:** Dyadic Green's functions are used in solving boundary value problems in electromagnetism. These problems involve determining the field in a region due to sources outside the region, subject to certain boundary conditions.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of boundary conditions and how they relate to dyadic Green's functions.

#### 3.1c Dyadic Green's Functions in Time-Domain

In the previous sections, we have discussed the properties and applications of dyadic Green's functions in the frequency domain. However, it is also important to understand how these functions behave in the time domain. In this section, we will explore the time-domain representation of dyadic Green's functions and their significance in electromagnetism.

#### 3.1c.1 Time-Domain Representation of Dyadic Green's Functions

The time-domain representation of dyadic Green's functions is given by the inverse Fourier transform of the frequency-domain Green's functions. This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\mathbf{\hat G}(t,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\mathbf{\hat G}(\omega,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}')e^{-i\omega t}d\omega.
$$

Here, $\mathbf{\hat G}(t,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}')$ is the time-domain dyadic Green's function, and $\mathbf{\hat G}(\omega,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}')$ is the frequency-domain dyadic Green's function.

#### 3.1c.2 Significance of Time-Domain Dyadic Green's Functions

The time-domain dyadic Green's functions are particularly useful in the study of electromagnetism because they allow us to analyze the propagation of electromagnetic waves in time. This is particularly important in the study of transient phenomena, where the frequency-domain representation may not be sufficient.

Moreover, the time-domain dyadic Green's functions also allow us to analyze the causality of electromagnetic waves. As we have seen in the previous section, the dyadic Green's function satisfies the causality condition, which states that the response at a point $\mathbf{r}'$ due to a source at $\mathbf{r}$ must be zero if $\mathbf{r}'$ is outside the causal cone of $\mathbf{r}$. This condition is particularly important in the study of electromagnetic waves, as it ensures that the response at a point can only be influenced by the source at that point or earlier.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of boundary conditions and how they relate to dyadic Green's functions in the time domain.

2. **Scattering Problems:** The dyadic Green's function is also used in solving scattering problems. In these problems, we are interested in determining the scattered field due to an object placed in a medium. The dyadic Green's function allows us to calculate the scattered field in terms of the source field, which is often known or can be calculated.

3. **Numerical Methods:** The dyadic Green's function is used in the development of numerical methods for solving electromagnetic problems. These methods, such as the finite element method and the finite difference method, rely on the dyadic Green's function to discretize the problem and solve it numerically.

This representation is particularly useful in the analysis of electromagnetic fields, as it simplifies the problem and allows us to calculate the field at any point in space.

The plane wave expansion method is based on the Fourier series representation of the electromagnetic field.

#### 3.2b Plane Wave Expansions in Planarly Layered Media

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of plane wave expansions and their importance in the study of electromagnetic fields. In this section, we will delve deeper into the application of plane wave expansions in planarly layered media.

Planarly layered media are a common type of medium encountered in electromagnetics. They are characterized by their periodicity in one direction, which simplifies the analysis of electromagnetic fields in these media. The periodicity allows us to use the Bloch wave expansion, which is a powerful tool for solving Maxwell's equations in these media.

The Bloch wave expansion assumes a periodic volume, and allows us to express the fields, currents, and potentials as a sum of Bloch waves. These Bloch waves are characterized by their propagation constants, which are determined by the frequency of the wave. The Bloch wave expansion is particularly useful in the analysis of planarly layered media, as it allows us to express the fields in terms of a finite number of unknowns.

The Bloch wave expansion can be expressed as follows:

$$
\mathbf J(x,y,z) = \sum_{mnp} \mathbf J(\alpha_m,\beta_n, \gamma_p) e^{j(\alpha_m x + \beta_n y + \gamma_p z)}
$$

$$
\mathbf E(x,y,z) = \sum_{mnp} \mathbf E(\alpha_m,\beta_n, \gamma_p) e^{j(\alpha_m x + \beta_n y + \gamma_p z)}
$$

$$
\mathbf A(x,y,z) = \sum_{mnp} \mathbf A(\alpha_m,\beta_n, \gamma_p) e^{j(\alpha_m x + \beta_n y + \gamma_p z)}
$$

where $\mathbf J$, $\mathbf E$, and $\mathbf A$ are the current, electric field, and magnetic field respectively, and $\alpha_m$, $\beta_n$, and $\gamma_p$ are the propagation constants in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions respectively. These propagation constants are determined by the frequency of the wave, and are given by the equations:

$$
\alpha_m = k_0 \sin \theta_0 \cos \phi_0 + \frac{2m\pi}{l_x}
$$

$$
\beta_n = k_0 \sin \theta_0 \sin \phi_0 + \frac{2n\pi}{l_y}
$$

$$
\gamma_p = k_0 \cos \theta_0 + \frac{2p\pi}{l_z}
$$

where $k_0 = 2\pi/\lambda$ is the propagation constant in free space, $\theta_0$ and $\phi_0$ are the angles of propagation in spherical coordinates, and $l_x$, $l_y$, and $l_z$ are the dimensions of the unit cell in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions respectively.

The Bloch wave expansion allows us to express the fields in terms of a finite number of unknowns, which simplifies the analysis of electromagnetic fields in planarly layered media. However, it also leads to the appearance of spurious modes, which are solutions that are not physically meaningful. These spurious modes can complicate the analysis, and it is important to understand and account for them in the analysis of electromagnetic fields in planarly layered media.

#### 3.2c Applications of Plane Wave Expansions

Plane wave expansions have a wide range of applications in the field of electromagnetics. They are particularly useful in the analysis of planarly layered media, where the periodicity in one direction simplifies the analysis of electromagnetic fields.

One of the most common applications of plane wave expansions is in the design and analysis of frequency selective surfaces (FSS). These are periodic structures that are designed to selectively reflect or transmit electromagnetic waves based on their frequency. The design of these surfaces often involves the use of Bloch wave expansions, which allow us to express the fields in terms of a finite number of unknowns.

The Bloch wave expansion of the fields can be expressed as follows:

$$
\mathbf J(x,y,z) = \sum_{mnp} \mathbf J(\alpha_m,\beta_n, \gamma_p) e^{j(\alpha_m x + \beta_n y + \gamma_p z)}
$$

$$
\mathbf E(x,y,z) = \sum_{mnp} \mathbf E(\alpha_m,\beta_n, \gamma_p) e^{j(\alpha_m x + \beta_n y + \gamma_p z)}
$$

$$
\mathbf A(x,y,z) = \sum_{mnp} \mathbf A(\alpha_m,\beta_n, \gamma_p) e^{j(\alpha_m x + \beta_n y + \gamma_p z)}
$$

where $\mathbf J$, $\mathbf E$, and $\mathbf A$ are the current, electric field, and magnetic field respectively, and $\alpha_m$, $\beta_n$, and $\gamma_p$ are the propagation constants in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions respectively. These propagation constants are determined by the frequency of the wave, and are given by the equations:

$$
\alpha_m = k_0 \sin \theta_0 \cos \phi_0 + \frac{2m\pi}{l_x}
$$

$$
\beta_n = k_0 \sin \theta_0 \sin \phi_0 + \frac{2n\pi}{l_y}
$$

$$
\gamma_p = k_0 \cos \theta_0 + \frac{2p\pi}{l_z}
$$

where $k_0 = 2\pi/\lambda$ is the propagation constant in free space, $\theta_0$ and $\phi_0$ are the angles of propagation in spherical coordinates, and $l_x$, $l_y$, and $l_z$ are the dimensions of the unit cell in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions respectively.

##### Green's Functions

Another important application of plane wave expansions is in the calculation of Green's functions for planarly layered media. Green's functions are solutions to the electromagnetic field equations that describe the response of the field to a point source. They are particularly useful in the analysis of electromagnetic fields in complex media, as they allow us to calculate the field at any point in space.

The Green's function for a planarly layered medium can be calculated using the method of images, which involves placing an image source at the boundary of the medium. The Green's function for the image source can then be calculated using the method of images, and the total Green's function is given by the sum of the Green's functions for the image source and the real source.

The Green's function for a planarly layered medium can be expressed as follows:

$$
G(x,y,z) = G_0(x,y,z) + G_i(x,y,z)
$$

where $G_0(x,y,z)$ is the Green's function for the real source, and $G_i(x,y,z)$ is the Green's function for the image source. The Green's function for the real source can be calculated using the method of images, and the Green's function for the image source can be calculated using the method of images.

In this section, we will delve into the definitions and differences of reflection and transmission coefficients. These coefficients are fundamental to understanding the behavior of electromagnetic waves at the interfaces of planarly layered media.

##### Reflection Coefficient

The reflection coefficient, denoted as $r$, is a complex number that describes the ratio of the reflected wave to the incident wave at the interface of two media. It is a function of the incident angle, the properties of the media, and the boundary conditions at the interface. The reflection coefficient is typically expressed in terms of the electric and magnetic field components of the incident wave.

The reflection coefficient can be decomposed into two components: the specular reflection coefficient and the diffuse reflection coefficient. The specular reflection coefficient describes the reflection of the wave in the direction of the incident wave, while the diffuse reflection coefficient describes the scattering of the wave in other directions.

##### Transmission Coefficient

The transmission coefficient, denoted as $t$, is a complex number that describes the ratio of the transmitted wave to the incident wave at the interface of two media. It is a function of the incident angle, the properties of the media, and the boundary conditions at the interface.

The reflection coefficient $r$ can be calculated using the Green's function $G$ for the medium. The Green's function is a solution to the electromagnetic field equations that describes the field at a point due to a unit source at another point. The reflection coefficient is given by the ratio of the reflected field to the incident field, which can be expressed in terms of the Green's function as follows:

$$
r = \frac{E_{reflected}}{E_{incident}} = \frac{G(x,y,z)}{G(x,y,z)}
$$

where $E_{reflected}$ and $E_{incident}$ are the electric field components of the reflected and incident waves, respectively, and $G(x,y,z)$ is the Green's function for the medium.

##### Transmission Coefficient

The transmission coefficient $t$ can be calculated in a similar manner. The transmission coefficient is given by the ratio of the transmitted field to the incident field, which can be expressed in terms of the Green's function as follows:

$$
t = \frac{E_{transmitted}}{E_{incident}} = \frac{G(x,y,z)}{G(x,y,z)}
$$

where $E_{transmitted}$ is the electric field component of the transmitted wave.

##### Differences

As mentioned earlier, the reflection and transmission coefficients are closely related, but they are not the same.

##### Transmission Coefficient in Planarly Layered Media

In planarly layered media, the transmission coefficient can be expressed in terms of the electric and magnetic field components of the incident wave. The transmission coefficient is a function of the incident angle, the properties of the media, and the boundary conditions at the interface.

The transmission coefficient can be decomposed into two components: the specular transmission coefficient and the diffuse transmission coefficient. The specular transmission coefficient describes the transmission of the wave in the direction of the incident wave, while the diffuse transmission coefficient describes the scattering of the wave in other directions.

The transmission coefficient can be calculated using the Fresnel equations, which relate the electric and magnetic field components of the incident wave to the transmitted wave. The Fresnel equations are given by:

#### 3.3c Practical Applications

In this section, we will explore some practical applications of reflection and transmission coefficients in planarly layered media. These applications are crucial in understanding the behavior of electromagnetic waves in real-world scenarios.

##### Reflection and Transmission Coefficients in Optical Fibers

Optical fibers are a common example of planarly layered media. The core of the fiber, where light is transmitted, is surrounded by a cladding layer. The reflection and transmission coefficients play a crucial role in determining the propagation of light in the fiber.

The reflection coefficient at the interface between the core and the cladding determines the amount of light that is reflected back into the core. This can be controlled by adjusting the refractive index of the cladding. The transmission coefficient, on the other hand, determines the amount of light that is transmitted into the cladding. By controlling the transmission coefficient, we can control the amount of light that is lost in the cladding.

##### Reflection and Transmission Coefficients in Antennas

Antennas are another important application of reflection and transmission coefficients. In antenna design, we often encounter planarly layered media, such as dielectric materials, which are used to control the propagation of electromagnetic waves.

The reflection coefficient at the interface between the antenna and the dielectric material determines the amount of electromagnetic wave that is reflected back into the antenna. This can be controlled by adjusting the permittivity and permeability of the dielectric material. The transmission coefficient, on the other hand, determines the amount of electromagnetic wave that is transmitted into the dielectric material. By controlling the transmission coefficient, we can control the amount of power that is lost in the dielectric material.

##### Reflection and Transmission Coefficients in Optical Devices

Optical devices, such as lenses and mirrors, also rely on the principles of reflection and transmission coefficients. In these devices, the reflection and transmission coefficients are used to control the propagation of light.

For example, in a lens, the reflection coefficient at the interface between the lens and the air determines the amount of light that is reflected back into the lens. This can be controlled by adjusting the refractive index of the lens material. The transmission coefficient, on the other hand, determines the amount of light that is transmitted through the lens. By controlling the transmission coefficient, we can control the amount of light that is focused by the lens.

In a mirror, the reflection coefficient at the interface between the mirror and the air determines the amount of light that is reflected back into the air. This can be controlled by adjusting the refractive index of the mirror material. The transmission coefficient, on the other hand, determines the amount of light that is transmitted through the mirror. By controlling the transmission coefficient, we can control the amount of light that is reflected by the mirror.

In conclusion, the principles of reflection and transmission coefficients are fundamental to understanding the behavior of electromagnetic waves in planarly layered media. These principles have a wide range of practical applications, from optical fibers to antennas to optical devices. By understanding these principles, we can design and optimize these devices for various applications.




#### 3.4a Introduction to Scattering Matrices

In the previous sections, we have discussed the reflection and transmission coefficients, which are crucial in understanding the behavior of electromagnetic waves at the interface of two different media. However, in many practical applications, we encounter more complex media, such as planarly layered media, where the electromagnetic wave interacts with multiple interfaces. In such cases, the reflection and transmission coefficients are not sufficient to fully describe the behavior of the wave. This is where scattering matrices come into play.

Scattering matrices, also known as S-matrices, are a powerful tool in the study of electromagnetic waves. They provide a comprehensive description of the scattering of an electromagnetic wave by a medium, including both reflection and transmission. The S-matrix is a complex matrix that relates the input and output electromagnetic fields at the interface of a medium.

The S-matrix is defined as the ratio of the output field to the input field, both evaluated at the interface of the medium. Mathematically, it can be written as:

$$
S = \frac{E_{out}}{E_{in}}
$$

where $E_{out}$ is the output electromagnetic field and $E_{in}$ is the input electromagnetic field.

The S-matrix is a unitary matrix, meaning that it preserves the total power of the electromagnetic wave. This is a direct consequence of the conservation of energy.

In the context of planarly layered media, the S-matrix is a block diagonal matrix, with each block corresponding to a different interface. The S-matrix for a planarly layered medium can be written as:

$$
S = \begin{bmatrix}
S_1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & S_2 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & S_n
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $S_i$ is the S-matrix for the $i$-th interface.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the properties of scattering matrices and their applications in the study of electromagnetic waves in planarly layered media.

#### 3.4b Calculating Scattering Matrices

The calculation of scattering matrices is a crucial step in understanding the behavior of electromagnetic waves in complex media. The scattering matrix, or S-matrix, is a complex matrix that relates the input and output electromagnetic fields at the interface of a medium. In the case of planarly layered media, the S-matrix is a block diagonal matrix, with each block corresponding to a different interface.

The calculation of the S-matrix involves the use of Maxwell's equations, which describe the behavior of electromagnetic waves in a medium. These equations can be represented in matrix form, as shown in the previous section. The S-matrix can then be calculated by applying the matrix representation of Maxwell's equations to the input and output fields.

The S-matrix is a unitary matrix, meaning that it preserves the total power of the electromagnetic wave. This is a direct consequence of the conservation of energy. The unitarity of the S-matrix can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
S^\dagger S = I
$$

where $S^\dagger$ is the Hermitian conjugate of the S-matrix, and $I$ is the identity matrix.

In the context of planarly layered media, the S-matrix is a block diagonal matrix, with each block corresponding to a different interface. The S-matrix for a planarly layered medium can be written as:

$$
S = \begin{bmatrix}
S_1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & S_2 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & S_n
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $S_i$ is the S-matrix for the $i$-th interface.

The calculation of the S-matrix for each interface involves the use of the matrix representation of Maxwell's equations, as shown in the previous section. The S-matrix for each interface can be calculated by applying the matrix representation of Maxwell's equations to the input and output fields at the interface.

In the next section, we will discuss the properties of scattering matrices and their applications in the study of electromagnetic waves in planarly layered media.

#### 3.4c Applications of Scattering Matrices

Scattering matrices, or S-matrices, are a powerful tool in the study of electromagnetic waves in complex media. They provide a comprehensive description of the scattering of an electromagnetic wave by a medium, including both reflection and transmission. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of scattering matrices in the study of electromagnetic waves in planarly layered media.

One of the most important applications of scattering matrices is in the study of interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT). iSCAT is a technique used to study the scattering of light by a sample, providing information about the size, shape, and composition of the sample. The S-matrix plays a crucial role in this technique, as it describes the scattering of the light by the sample.

The S-matrix is also used in the study of Maxwell's equations. These equations describe the behavior of electromagnetic waves in a medium, and their matrix representation involves the use of the S-matrix. The S-matrix is used to relate the input and output electromagnetic fields at the interface of a medium, providing a comprehensive description of the behavior of electromagnetic waves in complex media.

In the context of planarly layered media, the S-matrix is a block diagonal matrix, with each block corresponding to a different interface. This property of the S-matrix is particularly useful in the study of electromagnetic waves in planarly layered media, as it allows for the analysis of each interface separately.

The S-matrix is also used in the study of the Dirac equation. The Dirac equation is a relativistic wave equation that describes the behavior of spin-1/2 particles, such as electrons. The S-matrix is used to describe the scattering of these particles by a potential, providing a powerful tool for the study of quantum mechanics.

In conclusion, scattering matrices are a powerful tool in the study of electromagnetic waves in complex media. They are used in a variety of applications, from the study of interferometric scattering microscopy to the analysis of the Dirac equation. Their ability to provide a comprehensive description of the scattering of electromagnetic waves makes them an essential tool in the study of electromagnetism.

## Chapter: Optical Resonators

### Introduction

Optical resonators, the focus of this chapter, are fundamental components in the field of electromagnetism. They are structures that confine and enhance electromagnetic fields, particularly light. The resonance of light within these structures can lead to a variety of interesting phenomena, such as the formation of standing waves and the enhancement of light intensity.

The study of optical resonators is crucial in many areas of modern technology, including telecommunications, laser technology, and optical computing. Understanding the principles of operation of these resonators can lead to the development of more efficient and effective devices.

In this chapter, we will delve into the principles of operation of optical resonators, their design, and their applications. We will explore the mathematical models that describe the behavior of light within these resonators, and how these models can be used to predict the performance of real-world devices.

We will also discuss the different types of optical resonators, including Fabry-Perot resonators, ring resonators, and photonic crystal resonators. Each of these types of resonators has its own unique properties and applications.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of the principles of operation of optical resonators, and be able to apply this knowledge to the design and analysis of optical devices.

#### 3.4b Scattering Matrices in Planarly Layered Media

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of scattering matrices and their role in describing the behavior of electromagnetic waves at the interface of a medium. In this section, we will delve deeper into the application of scattering matrices in planarly layered media.

Planarly layered media are a common occurrence in many practical applications, such as in the design of optical devices and antennas. These media consist of multiple layers of different materials, each with its own unique properties. The interaction of an electromagnetic wave with such a medium can be complex, involving multiple reflections and transmissions at each interface.

The scattering matrix provides a powerful tool for describing this interaction. As we have seen, the S-matrix for a planarly layered medium is a block diagonal matrix, with each block corresponding to a different interface. This allows us to break down the interaction into a series of independent interactions at each interface.

Let's consider a simple example of a two-layer medium. The S-matrix for this medium can be written as:

$$
S = \begin{bmatrix}
S_1 & 0 \\
0 & S_2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $S_1$ is the S-matrix for the first interface and $S_2$ is the S-matrix for the second interface. The total S-matrix for the medium is then given by the product of the individual S-matrices:

$$
S = S_1 \cdot S_2
$$

This product rule allows us to calculate the total S-matrix for a complex medium by breaking it down into a series of simpler interactions at each interface.

In the next section, we will explore the properties of scattering matrices in more detail, including their relationship with the reflection and transmission coefficients. We will also discuss how to calculate the S-matrix for more complex media, such as those with multiple layers or non-uniform properties.

#### 3.4c Applications of Scattering Matrices

Scattering matrices have a wide range of applications in the study of electromagnetic waves. In this section, we will explore some of these applications, focusing on their use in planarly layered media.

One of the most common applications of scattering matrices is in the design and analysis of optical devices. These devices often consist of multiple layers of different materials, each with its own unique properties. By using scattering matrices, we can accurately predict the behavior of light as it interacts with these layers, allowing us to design devices with desired properties.

For example, consider a simple optical device consisting of two layers of different materials. The S-matrix for this device can be calculated using the product rule:

$$
S = S_1 \cdot S_2
$$

where $S_1$ is the S-matrix for the first interface and $S_2$ is the S-matrix for the second interface. By manipulating these matrices, we can determine the overall behavior of the device, including the reflection and transmission coefficients at each interface.

Scattering matrices are also used in the study of antennas. Antennas often consist of multiple layers of different materials, each with its own unique properties. By using scattering matrices, we can accurately predict the radiation pattern of an antenna, which is crucial for its design and operation.

In addition to these practical applications, scattering matrices also have important theoretical implications. They provide a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of electromagnetic waves at the interface of a medium. By studying the properties of scattering matrices, we can gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles of electromagnetism.

In the next section, we will explore some of these theoretical implications in more detail, focusing on the relationship between scattering matrices and the Maxwell's equations. We will also discuss how to calculate the scattering matrix for more complex media, such as those with multiple layers or non-uniform properties.




#### 3.4c Practical Applications

Scattering matrices have a wide range of applications in the field of electromagnetism. They are particularly useful in the design and analysis of optical devices and antennas. In this section, we will explore some of these applications in more detail.

##### Antenna Design

One of the most common applications of scattering matrices is in the design of antennas. Antennas are devices that transmit or receive electromagnetic waves. The performance of an antenna is largely determined by its interaction with the surrounding medium. By using scattering matrices, we can accurately model this interaction and design antennas that perform optimally in a given medium.

For example, consider a simple dipole antenna. The scattering matrix for this antenna can be calculated using the formula:

$$
S = \begin{bmatrix}
S_1 & 0 \\
0 & S_2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $S_1$ is the S-matrix for the antenna and $S_2$ is the S-matrix for the surrounding medium. By manipulating this matrix, we can design the antenna to have specific properties, such as a desired radiation pattern or impedance.

##### Optical Devices

Scattering matrices are also used in the design of optical devices, such as lenses and mirrors. These devices interact with light in complex ways, and their performance can be accurately modeled using scattering matrices.

For example, consider a simple lens. The scattering matrix for this lens can be calculated using the formula:

$$
S = \begin{bmatrix}
S_1 & 0 \\
0 & S_2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $S_1$ is the S-matrix for the lens and $S_2$ is the S-matrix for the surrounding medium. By manipulating this matrix, we can design the lens to have specific properties, such as a desired focal length or aberration correction.

##### Other Applications

Scattering matrices have many other applications in electromagnetism. They are used in the design of waveguides, microwave circuits, and many other devices. They are also used in the analysis of electromagnetic phenomena, such as diffraction and interference.

In the next section, we will explore the properties of scattering matrices in more detail, including their relationship with the reflection and transmission coefficients. We will also discuss how to calculate the S-matrix for more complex media, such as those with multiple layers or non-uniform properties.

The behavior of surface plasmons in such a system is of particular interest due to its potential applications in various fields, such as plasmonic devices and antennas.

The behavior of surface plasmons in planarly layered media can be described using the concept of Green's functions. Green's functions are mathematical tools that allow us to calculate the response of a system to an external perturbation. In the case of surface plasmons, the Green's function can be used to calculate the response of the surface plasmon mode to an external electromagnetic field.

The Green's function for surface plasmons in planarly layered media can be written as:

$$
G(x,y) = \frac{1}{k^2 - k_s^2}e^{ik_s(x+y)}
$$

where $k$ is the wave vector of the external electromagnetic field, and $k_s$ is the wave vector of the surface plasmon mode. The Green's function represents the propagation of the surface plasmon mode in the planarly layered media.

The behavior of surface plasmons in planarly layered media can also be described using the concept of surface plasmon polaritons. Surface plasmon polaritons are collective oscillations of the surface plasmon mode and the external electromagnetic field. They can be described using the following equation:

$$
\omega = \omega_s + \omega_e
$$

where $\omega$ is the frequency of the surface plasmon polariton, $\omega_s$ is the frequency of the surface plasmon mode, and $\omega_e$ is the frequency of the external electromagnetic field.

In conclusion, the study of surface plasmons in planarly layered media is crucial in the field of electromagnetism. It allows us to understand the behavior of surface plasmons and their potential applications in various fields. The use of Green's functions and surface plasmon polaritons provides a mathematical framework for describing the behavior of surface plasmons in such systems.

### Section: 4.1 Scattering Cross-section:

The scattering cross-section is a fundamental concept in the study of scattering of electromagnetic waves. It is defined as the ratio of the scattered power to the incident power, and it provides a measure of the effectiveness of a scatterer in redistributing the incident power.

#### 4.1a Definition of Scattering Cross-section

The scattering cross-section, denoted by $\sigma$, is defined as:

$$
\sigma = \frac{P_{\text{scattered}}}{P_{\text{incident}}}
$$

where $P_{\text{scattered}}$ is the power scattered by the scatterer and $P_{\text{incident}}$ is the power incident on the scatterer. The scattering cross-section is a dimensionless quantity and is typically expressed in units of square meters (m^2).

The scattering cross-section is a crucial parameter in the study of scattering, as it provides a quantitative measure of the scattering process. It allows us to compare the scattering properties of different scatterers and to predict the behavior of scattered waves.

The scattering cross-section can be calculated using various methods, including the Born approximation and the Mie theory. The Born approximation is a perturbative method that assumes the scatterer is much smaller than the wavelength of the incident wave. The Mie theory, on the other hand, is a more general method that can handle scatterers of any size and shape.

The scattering cross-section is also related to the scattering matrix, which describes the transformation of the incident wave into the scattered wave. The scattering matrix is defined as:

$$
S = I + 2\pi i\sigma T
$$

where $I$ is the identity matrix, $i$ is the imaginary unit, $\sigma$ is the scattering cross-section, and $T$ is the transmission coefficient. The transmission coefficient describes the fraction of the incident power that is transmitted through the scatterer.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical formalism of scattering and explore the physical interpretation of the scattering cross-section.

#### 4.1b Calculation of Scattering Cross-section

The calculation of the scattering cross-section involves the integration of the scattering matrix over all solid angles. This integration is typically performed using numerical methods, such as the Gauss-Legendre quadrature. The scattering cross-section can be expressed as:

$$
\sigma = \int_0^\pi \int_0^{2\pi} |S|^2 \sin\theta d\theta d\phi
$$

where $\theta$ and $\phi$ are the spherical coordinates, and $|S|^2$ is the magnitude of the scattering matrix.

The scattering cross-section can also be calculated using the Mie theory, which provides a more general method for calculating the scattering properties of a scatterer. The Mie theory is based on the solution of the Maxwell's equations for a spherical scatterer, and it provides explicit expressions for the scattering cross-section and the scattering matrix.

The Mie theory is particularly useful for calculating the scattering cross-section of particles of arbitrary size and shape. It is also used to calculate the extinction cross-section, which is the fraction of the incident power that is absorbed or scattered by the particle. The extinction cross-section is defined as:

$$
\sigma_{\text{ext}} = \sigma_{\text{sc}} + \sigma_{\text{abs}}
$$

where $\sigma_{\text{sc}}$ is the scattering cross-section and $\sigma_{\text{abs}}$ is the absorption cross-section.

The scattering cross-section is a crucial parameter in the study of scattering, as it provides a quantitative measure of the scattering process. It allows us to compare the scattering properties of different scatterers and to predict the behavior of scattered waves. In the next section, we will explore the physical interpretation of the scattering cross-section and its role in the scattering process.

#### 4.1c Applications of Scattering Cross-section

The scattering cross-section is a fundamental concept in the study of scattering of electromagnetic waves. It is a crucial parameter in various applications, including radar systems, optical communication, and medical imaging.

In radar systems, the scattering cross-section is used to determine the size and shape of objects. The radar system emits a pulse of electromagnetic waves, and the reflected pulse is received by the system. The time delay and the intensity of the received pulse provide information about the distance and the size of the object. The scattering cross-section is used to calculate the intensity of the reflected pulse, which is proportional to the scattering cross-section.

In optical communication, the scattering cross-section is used to design optical fibers. The optical fibers are designed to guide light along their length with minimal loss. The scattering cross-section is used to calculate the loss of light due to scattering, which is one of the main sources of loss in optical fibers.

In medical imaging, the scattering cross-section is used to detect tumors. The scattering cross-section of a tumor is typically different from that of the surrounding tissue, and this difference can be used to detect the tumor. The scattering cross-section is used to calculate the intensity of the scattered light, which is used to create an image of the tumor.

The scattering cross-section is also used in the study of the interaction of light with matter. The scattering cross-section provides information about the scattering properties of the matter, which can be used to study the electronic and atomic structure of the matter.

In the next section, we will explore the physical interpretation of the scattering cross-section and its role in the scattering process.

$$

where $I$ is the identity matrix, $i$ is the imaginary unit, $\sigma$ is the scattering cross-section, and $T$ is the transmission coefficient. The transmission coefficient describes the fraction of the incident power that is transmitted through the scatterer.

In the context of electromagnetic waves, the scattering cross-section can be expressed in terms of the scattering matrix as:

$$
\sigma = \frac{1}{2\pi} \text{Tr}(S - I)
$$

where $\text{Tr}$ denotes the trace of a matrix. This equation provides a convenient way to calculate the scattering cross-section from the scattering matrix.

The scattering cross-section is also related to the scattering pattern of the electromagnetic wave. The scattering pattern is a plot of the scattered power as a function of the scattering angle, and it provides a visual representation of the scattering process. The scattering cross-section can be calculated from the scattering pattern by integrating the scattered power over all scattering angles.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical formalism of scattering and explore the physical interpretations of the scattering cross-section and the scattering matrix.

#### 4.1c Applications of Scattering Cross-section

The scattering cross-section is a fundamental concept in the study of scattering of electromagnetic waves. It is a crucial parameter in various applications, including radar systems, optical communication, and medical imaging.

##### Radar Systems

In radar systems, the scattering cross-section is used to determine the size and shape of objects. The radar system emits a pulse of electromagnetic waves and measures the time it takes for the pulse to return. The time delay and the Doppler shift of the returned pulse provide information about the distance and velocity of the object. The scattering cross-section of the object determines how much of the pulse is scattered back, which affects the strength of the returned pulse.

##### Optical Communication

In optical communication, the scattering cross-section is used to design optical fibers. The scattering cross-section of the fiber material determines how much of the light is scattered as it propagates through the fiber. Materials with a small scattering cross-section are preferred for optical fibers to minimize losses.

##### Medical Imaging

In medical imaging, the scattering cross-section is used to determine the properties of tissues. Different tissues have different scattering cross-sections, which can be used to identify them. For example, in ultrasound imaging, the scattering cross-section of tissues is used to create images of the internal structures of the body.

The scattering cross-section can also be used to study the scattering of light in biological tissues. The scattering cross-section of light in tissue is related to the size and shape of the scattering particles, which can provide information about the structure and function of the tissue.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical formalism of scattering and explore the physical interpretations of the scattering cross-section and the scattering matrix.

### Section: 4.2 Mie Scattering

Mie scattering is a fundamental phenomenon in electromagnetism that describes the scattering of electromagnetic waves by spherical particles. It is named after the German physicist Gustav Mie who first derived the equations for this type of scattering in 1908. Mie scattering is particularly important in the study of light scattering by small particles, such as dust, fog, and aerosols, and it plays a crucial role in many practical applications, including radar systems, remote sensing, and medical imaging.

#### 4.2a Introduction to Mie Scattering

Mie scattering occurs when an electromagnetic wave encounters a spherical particle. The particle can be any object with a radius $a$ and a refractive index $m = n_p/n_m$, where $n_p$ is the refractive index of the particle and $n_m$ is the refractive index of the medium. The scattering of the wave by the particle can be described by the Mie scattering equations, which relate the scattered field to the incident field and the properties of the particle and the medium.

The Mie scattering equations are derived from the Maxwell's equations, which describe the behavior of electromagnetic waves. The equations are complex and involve special functions, such as spherical Bessel functions and spherical Hankel functions. However, they can be simplified and solved numerically for practical applications.

The Mie scattering equations provide a complete description of the scattering process, including the scattering cross-section, the scattering matrix, and the scattering pattern. The scattering cross-section, denoted by $C_s$, is a measure of the amount of power scattered by the particle. It is given by the equation

$$
C_s = 4\pi a^2 \frac{m^2 - 1}{m^2 + 2} \left|\frac{m^2 - 1}{m^2 + 2}\right|^2 \left|\frac{J_l(ka)}{H_l^{(1)}(ka)}\right|^2
$$

where $J_l(ka)$ and $H_l^{(1)}(ka)$ are the spherical Bessel function and the spherical Hankel function of the first kind, respectively, $k = 2\pi n_m/\lambda$ is the wave number, and $l$ is the angular momentum quantum number.

The scattering matrix, denoted by $S$, is a complex matrix that relates the incident field to the scattered field. It is given by the equation

$$
S = \frac{m^2 - 1}{m^2 + 2} \left[\begin{matrix}
\frac{J_l(ka)}{H_l^{(1)}(ka)} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{J_l(ka)}{H_l^{(1)}(ka)}
\end{matrix}\right]
$$

The scattering pattern, denoted by $P(\theta, \phi)$, is a function of the scattering angle $\theta$ and the azimuthal angle $\phi$. It is given by the equation

$$
P(\theta, \phi) = \left|\frac{m^2 - 1}{m^2 + 2}\right|^2 \left|\frac{J_l(ka)}{H_l^{(1)}(ka)}\right|^2 P_l(\cos\theta)
$$

where $P_l(\cos\theta)$ is the Legendre polynomial of degree $l$.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the Mie scattering equations and explore their applications in various fields.

$$

where $J_l(ka)$ and $H_l^{(1)}(ka)$ are the spherical Bessel function and the spherical Hankel function of the first kind, respectively, $k = 2\pi n_m/\lambda$ is the wave number, and $l$ is the angular momentum quantum number.

0 & \frac{J_l(ka)}{H_l^{(1)}(ka)}
\end{matrix}\right]
$$

$$
P(\theta, \phi) = \left|\frac{m^2 - 1}{m^2 + 2}\right|^2 \left|\frac{J_l(ka)}{H_l^{(1)}(ka)}\right|^2 P_l(\cos\theta)
$$

where $P_l(\cos\theta)$ is the Legendre polynomial of degree $l$.

#### 4.2c Applications of Mie Scattering

Mie scattering has a wide range of applications in various fields, including optics, meteorology, and medical imaging. In this section, we will discuss some of these applications in detail.

##### Optical Coatings

Mie scattering plays a crucial role in the design and optimization of optical coatings. Optical coatings are thin layers of materials that are applied to the surface of optical components to modify their optical properties. The design of these coatings often involves the manipulation of Mie scattering to achieve desired optical effects.

For example, anti-reflective coatings are designed to minimize the reflection of light at the surface of an optical component. This is achieved by manipulating the Mie scattering of the coating material to scatter the incident light in a way that reduces the reflected light. The design of these coatings often involves the use of materials with specific refractive indices and thicknesses to achieve the desired scattering properties.

##### Meteorology

In meteorology, Mie scattering is used to study the scattering of sunlight by atmospheric particles, such as dust, fog, and aerosols. The study of Mie scattering in the atmosphere is crucial for understanding the optical properties of the atmosphere and for predicting weather conditions.

For example, the scattering of sunlight by atmospheric particles can be used to estimate the concentration of these particles in the atmosphere. This is achieved by measuring the amount of light that is scattered in different directions and comparing it with the amount of light that would be scattered by a known concentration of particles. This method, known as remote sensing, is used by meteorologists to monitor the concentration of atmospheric particles and to predict the visibility and the color of the sky.

##### Medical Imaging

In medical imaging, Mie scattering is used to study the scattering of light by biological tissues. This is achieved by illuminating the tissue with a light source and measuring the amount of light that is scattered in different directions. The scattered light provides information about the structure and composition of the tissue, which can be used for diagnosis and treatment.

For example, Mie scattering can be used to study the scattering of light by the retina, the layer of cells at the back of the eye that is responsible for detecting light. This can provide information about the health of the retina and can be used to diagnose conditions such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.

In conclusion, Mie scattering is a fundamental phenomenon in electromagnetism that has a wide range of applications. Its understanding is crucial for the design of optical coatings, the study of the atmosphere, and the diagnosis of medical conditions.

The scattering cross-section, denoted by $C_s$, is a measure of the amount of power scattered by the particle. It is given by the equation

$$
C_s = 4\pi a^2 \frac{m^2 - 1}{m^2 + 2} \left|\frac{m^2 - 1}{m^2 + 2}\right|^2 \left|\frac{J_l(ka)}{H_l^{(1)}(ka)}\right|^2
$$

where $J_l(ka)$ and $H_l^{(1)}(ka)$ are the spherical Bessel function and the spherical Hankel function of the first kind, respectively, $k = 2\pi n_m/\lambda$ is the wave number in the medium, $a$ is the radius of the particle, and $m = n_p/n_m$ is the refractive index ratio of the particle to the medium.

#### 4.2b.2 Scattering Pattern

The scattering pattern of Mie scattering is characterized by a forward scattering peak and a backward scattering peak. The forward scattering peak occurs when the scattered wave is in the same direction as the incident wave, and it is associated with the Rayleigh scattering regime for small particles. The backward scattering peak occurs when the scattered wave is in the opposite direction of the incident wave, and it is associated with the Mie scattering regime for large particles.

The scattering pattern can be visualized as a function of the scattering angle $\theta$, which is the angle between the incident wave and the scattered wave. The scattering cross-section $C_s(\theta)$ is plotted as a function of the scattering angle to obtain the scattering pattern. The scattering pattern provides valuable information about the size and refractive index of the particles, and it can be used to identify the type of particles in a sample.

#### 4.2b.3 Applications of Mie Scattering

Mie scattering has many practical applications in various fields. In radar systems, Mie scattering is used to detect and track small particles, such as raindrops and aerosols, in the atmosphere. In remote sensing, Mie scattering is used to measure the size and concentration of particles in the atmosphere, which is important for understanding climate change and air quality. In medical imaging, Mie scattering is used to visualize the structure of biological tissues, which is crucial for diagnosing diseases.

In conclusion, Mie scattering is a fundamental phenomenon in electromagnetism that describes the scattering of electromagnetic waves by spherical particles. It provides a complete description of the scattering process, including the scattering cross-section, the scattering matrix, and the scattering pattern. Its applications are vast and diverse, making it an essential topic for advanced study in electromagnetism.

### Rayleigh approximation (scattering)

Rayleigh scattering describes the elastic scattering of light by spheres that are much smaller than the wavelength of light. The intensity "I" of the scattered radiation is given by
where "I<sub>0</sub>" is the light intensity before the interaction with the particle, "R" is the distance between the particle and the observer, "θ" is the scattering angle, "λ" is the wavelength of light under consideration, "n" is the refractive index of the particle, and "d" is the diameter of the particle.

It can be seen from the above equation that Rayleigh scattering is strongly dependent upon the size of the particle and the wavelengths. The intensity of the Rayleigh scattered radiation increases rapidly as the ratio of particle size to wavelength increases. Furthermore, the intensity of Rayleigh scattered radiation is identical in the forward and reverse directions.

The Rayleigh scattering model breaks down when the particle size becomes larger than around 10% of the wavelength of the incident radiation. In the case of particles with dimensions greater than this, Mie's scattering model can be used to find the intensity of the scattered radiation. The intensity of Mie scattered radiation is given by the summation of an infinite series of terms rather than by a simple mathematical expression. It can be shown, however, that scattering in this range of particle sizes differs from Rayleigh scattering in several respects: it is roughly independent of wavelength and it is larger in the forward direction than in the reverse direction. The greater the particle size, the more of the light is scattered in the forward direction.

The blue colour of the sky results from Rayleigh scattering, as the size of the gas particles in the atmosphere is much smaller than the wavelength of visible light. Rayleigh scatterin

### Section: 4.3b Rayleigh Scattering in Electromagnetic Waves

Rayleigh scattering is a fundamental phenomenon in electromagnetics that describes the scattering of electromagnetic waves by small particles. It is named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first derived the mathematical expression for the scattering of light by small particles in 1871.

#### 4.3b.1 Rayleigh Scattering of Light

The Rayleigh scattering model is applicable when the particles are much smaller than the wavelength of the incident radiation. The intensity "I" of the scattered radiation is given by the equation:

$$
I = \frac{I_0 R^2}{R^2 + x^2} \left(\frac{\pi d^2}{\lambda}\right)^4 \frac{1 + \cos^2(\theta)}{2}
$$

where "I<sub>0</sub>" is the light intensity before the interaction with the particle, "R" is the distance between the particle and the observer, "x" is the distance from the particle to the point of observation, "d" is the diameter of the particle, "λ" is the wavelength of light under consideration, "n" is the refractive index of the particle, and "θ" is the scattering angle.

The intensity of the Rayleigh scattered radiation increases rapidly as the ratio of particle size to wavelength increases. Furthermore, the intensity of Rayleigh scattered radiation is identical in the forward and reverse directions.

#### 4.3b.2 Rayleigh Scattering of Electromagnetic Waves

The Rayleigh scattering model can be extended to electromagnetic waves. The scattering of electromagnetic waves by small particles is governed by the same principles as the scattering of light. However, the scattering of electromagnetic waves is more complex due to the vector nature of the electromagnetic field.

The scattering of electromagnetic waves by small particles can be described by the Rayleigh scattering model when the particles are much smaller than the wavelength of the incident radiation. The scattering cross-section, which is a measure of the amount of scattering, is given by the equation:

$$
\sigma = \frac{\pi d^2}{\lambda^4} \left(\frac{1 + \cos^2(\theta)}{2}\right)
$$

where "d" is the diameter of the particle, "λ" is the wavelength of the incident radiation, and "θ" is the scattering angle.

The Rayleigh scattering model breaks down when the particle size becomes larger than around 10% of the wavelength of the incident radiation. In the case of particles with dimensions greater than this, Mie's scattering model can be used to find the scattering cross-section.

#### 4.3b.3 Applications of Rayleigh Scattering

Rayleigh scattering has many applications in electromagnetics. It is responsible for the blue color of the sky, as the molecules in the atmosphere scatter the shorter wavelengths of sunlight more than the longer ones. It is also used in various optical instruments, such as lasers and optical fibers, to control the propagation of light.

In the next section, we will discuss the Mie scattering model, which describes the scattering of light by particles that are larger than the wavelength of the incident radiation.




#### 4.3c Practical Applications

The principles of Rayleigh scattering have numerous practical applications in various fields. These applications range from the design of optical instruments to the study of atmospheric phenomena.

##### 4.3c.1 Design of Optical Instruments

The principles of Rayleigh scattering are fundamental to the design of many optical instruments. For instance, the design of optical fibers, which are used in telecommunications, relies heavily on the principles of Rayleigh scattering. The small diameter of the fibers ensures that the light is scattered in a narrow cone, which minimizes the loss of light during transmission.

##### 4.3c.2 Study of Atmospheric Phenomena

The principles of Rayleigh scattering are also used in the study of atmospheric phenomena. For instance, the scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere is responsible for the blue color of the sky. The Rayleigh scattering model can be used to calculate the intensity of the scattered sunlight as a function of the scattering angle, which provides valuable insights into the structure of the atmosphere.

##### 4.3c.3 Medical Imaging

In medical imaging, the principles of Rayleigh scattering are used in techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT uses light to image the internal structures of the body. The principles of Rayleigh scattering are used to analyze the scattered light and create an image of the internal structures.

##### 4.3c.4 Particle Size Measurement

The principles of Rayleigh scattering can be used to measure the size of small particles. This is done by analyzing the intensity of the scattered light as a function of the scattering angle. The size of the particles can then be determined from the scattering pattern.

In conclusion, the principles of Rayleigh scattering have wide-ranging applications in various fields. Understanding these principles is therefore crucial for anyone studying advanced electromagnetism.




#### 4.4a Introduction to Scattering by Spheres

The scattering of electromagnetic waves by spheres is a fundamental phenomenon in electromagnetism. It is encountered in a wide range of applications, from the interaction of light with particles in the atmosphere to the design of optical devices. In this section, we will introduce the basic concepts and principles of scattering by spheres, focusing on the Mie scattering theory.

#### 4.4a.1 Mie Scattering Theory

The Mie scattering theory is a mathematical model that describes the scattering of electromagnetic waves by spheres. It is named after the German physicist Gustav Mie, who first developed the theory in 1908. The Mie scattering theory is based on the solution of Maxwell's equations for a sphere, and it provides a complete description of the scattering process for spheres of any size.

The Mie scattering theory is particularly useful for understanding the scattering of light by particles in the atmosphere. It allows us to calculate the scattering cross-section, which is a measure of the probability of scattering, as a function of the size and refractive index of the particles. This is crucial for understanding phenomena such as the blue color of the sky, which is due to the scattering of sunlight by particles in the atmosphere.

#### 4.4a.2 Dyadic Green's Function of a Sphere

The Dyadic Green's function of a sphere is a solution to the following equation:

$$
\nabla\times\nabla\times {\bf \hat G}(\omega,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)^{2}\varepsilon(\mathbf{r}, \omega){\bf \hat G}(\omega,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}')+ {\bf \hat 1}\delta(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'),
$$

where $\hat{\bf 1}$ is the identity matrix, and $\varepsilon(\mathbf{r}, \omega) = \varepsilon_{1} (\omega)$ for $r < a$, and $\varepsilon(\mathbf{r}, \omega) = \varepsilon$ for $r > a$. Since all fields are vectorial, the Green function is a 3 by 3 matrix and is called a dyadic.

The Green's function can be decomposed into vector spherical harmonics. This decomposition is particularly useful for understanding the scattering of electromagnetic waves by spheres. It allows us to express the Green's function in terms of a set of coefficients, which depend on the environment in which the points $\mathbf{r}$ and $\mathbf{r}'$ are located.

In the next sections, we will delve deeper into the theory of scattering by spheres, exploring the scattering process in more detail and discussing its applications in various fields.

#### 4.4b Scattering by Spheres of Different Sizes

The scattering of electromagnetic waves by spheres is a complex phenomenon that depends on the size of the spheres. The Mie scattering theory provides a mathematical framework for understanding this phenomenon. However, the theory is most accurate for spheres that are much smaller than the wavelength of the incident wave. For larger spheres, the theory becomes less accurate and other methods must be used.

#### 4.4b.1 Scattering by Small Spheres

For spheres that are much smaller than the wavelength of the incident wave, the Mie scattering theory is highly accurate. In this case, the scattering process can be approximated as a series of reflections and refractions at the surface of the sphere. The scattering cross-section is then given by the Mie scattering formula:

$$
\sigma(\theta) = \frac{2\pi}{k^2}\sum_{l=1}^{\infty}(2l+1)e^{i\delta_l}\frac{P_l(\cos\theta)}{P_l(0)}
$$

where $k$ is the wave number, $\theta$ is the scattering angle, $\delta_l$ is the phase shift for the $l$th spherical harmonic, and $P_l(\cos\theta)$ is the Legendre polynomial of degree $l$.

#### 4.4b.2 Scattering by Large Spheres

For spheres that are comparable in size to the wavelength of the incident wave, the Mie scattering theory becomes less accurate. In this case, the scattering process can no longer be approximated as a series of reflections and refractions. Instead, the scattering process involves the propagation of waves within the sphere, which can lead to a variety of complex scattering patterns.

One method for understanding the scattering by large spheres is the Born approximation, which is based on the assumption that the sphere is much less dense than the surrounding medium. This approximation allows us to express the scattering cross-section as a series of terms, each of which depends on the scattering cross-section of a smaller sphere. The Born approximation is particularly useful for understanding the scattering of light by particles in the atmosphere, where the particles are typically much less dense than the air.

#### 4.4b.3 Scattering by Spheres of Intermediate Size

For spheres that are intermediate in size, between the Mie regime and the Born regime, other methods must be used to understand the scattering process. These methods often involve numerical methods, such as the finite-difference time-domain method, which can solve Maxwell's equations for a sphere of any size.

In the next section, we will discuss the scattering of electromagnetic waves by spheres of intermediate size in more detail.

#### 4.4c Applications of Scattering by Spheres

The scattering of electromagnetic waves by spheres has a wide range of applications in various fields. In this section, we will discuss some of these applications, focusing on the scattering of light by particles in the atmosphere and the use of interferometric scattering microscopy.

#### 4.4c.1 Scattering of Light by Particles in the Atmosphere

The scattering of light by particles in the atmosphere is a fundamental phenomenon that plays a crucial role in our perception of the world. The color of the sky, for example, is determined by the scattering of sunlight by particles in the atmosphere. The Mie scattering theory, with its extensions for large spheres, provides a mathematical framework for understanding this phenomenon.

The scattering of light by particles in the atmosphere can be calculated using the Mie scattering formula, which gives the scattering cross-section as a function of the size and refractive index of the particles. This formula can be used to calculate the scattering of sunlight by particles in the atmosphere, and hence to calculate the color of the sky.

#### 4.4c.2 Interferometric Scattering Microscopy

Interferometric Scattering Microscopy (iSCAT) is a powerful tool for studying the scattering of light by small particles. This technique uses the interference of light waves to enhance the contrast of the scattered light, allowing for the detection of very small particles.

The scattering of light by particles can be calculated using the Mie scattering formula, which gives the scattering cross-section as a function of the size and refractive index of the particles. This formula can be used to calculate the scattering of light by particles, and hence to detect these particles using iSCAT.

#### 4.4c.3 Scattering by Spheres of Intermediate Size

For spheres that are intermediate in size, between the Mie regime and the Born regime, other methods must be used to understand the scattering process. These methods often involve numerical methods, such as the finite-difference time-domain method, which can solve Maxwell's equations for a sphere of any size.

The scattering of light by spheres of intermediate size can be calculated using these numerical methods, which provide a more accurate description of the scattering process than the Mie scattering formula. This is particularly important for applications where the accuracy of the scattering calculation is critical, such as in the design of optical devices.

In the next section, we will discuss the scattering of electromagnetic waves by spheres of intermediate size in more detail.

#### 4.4b Scattering by Spheres in Electromagnetic Waves

The scattering of electromagnetic waves by spheres is a fundamental phenomenon in electromagnetism. It is encountered in a wide range of applications, from the interaction of light with particles in the atmosphere to the design of optical devices. In this section, we will delve deeper into the scattering of electromagnetic waves by spheres, focusing on the Mie scattering theory and the Dyadic Green's function of a sphere.

#### 4.4b.1 Mie Scattering Theory

The Mie scattering theory is a mathematical model that describes the scattering of electromagnetic waves by spheres. It is named after the German physicist Gustav Mie, who first developed the theory in 1908. The Mie scattering theory is based on the solution of Maxwell's equations for a sphere, and it provides a complete description of the scattering process for spheres of any size.

The Mie scattering theory is particularly useful for understanding the scattering of light by particles in the atmosphere. It allows us to calculate the scattering cross-section, which is a measure of the probability of scattering, as a function of the size and refractive index of the particles. This is crucial for understanding phenomena such as the blue color of the sky, which is due to the scattering of sunlight by particles in the atmosphere.

#### 4.4b.2 Dyadic Green's Function of a Sphere

The Dyadic Green's function of a sphere is a solution to the following equation:

$$
\nabla\times\nabla\times {\bf \hat G}(\omega,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)^{2}\varepsilon(\mathbf{r}, \omega){\bf \hat G}(\omega,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}')+ {\bf \hat 1}\delta(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'),
$$

where $\hat{\bf 1}$ is the identity matrix, and $\varepsilon(\mathbf{r}, \omega) = \varepsilon_{1} (\omega)$ for $r < a$, and $\varepsilon(\mathbf{r}, \omega) = \varepsilon$ for $r > a$. Since all fields are vectorial, the Green function is a 3 by 3 matrix and is called a dyadic.

The Green's function can be decomposed into vector spherical harmonics (VSH) as follows:

$$
{\bf \hat G}(\omega,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \sum_{m=-l}^{l} {\bf Y}_{lm}(\mathbf{r}) {\bf Y}_{lm}^{*}(\mathbf{r}') r'^{l} j_{l}(kr') P_{lm}(\cos\theta',\phi'),
$$

where ${\bf Y}_{lm}(\mathbf{r})$ are the vector spherical harmonics, $j_{l}(kr')$ are the spherical Bessel functions, $P_{lm}(\cos\theta',\phi')$ are the associated Legendre polynomials, and $*$ denotes complex conjugation.

The VSH satisfy the following orthogonality relations:

$$
\int {\bf Y}_{lm} \cdot {\bf Y}_{l'm'} r^{2} dr d\Omega = \delta_{ll'} \delta_{mm'},
$$

$$
\int {\bf Y}_{lm} \cdot {\bf Y}_{l'm'} r'^{2} dr' d\Omega' = \delta_{ll'} \delta_{mm'},
$$

$$
\int {\bf Y}_{lm} \cdot {\bf Y}_{l'm'} r^{2} r'^{2} dr dr' d\Omega d\Omega' = \frac{4\pi}{2l+3} \delta_{ll'} \delta_{mm'},
$$

where $r$ and $r'$ are the distances from the origin, and $d\Omega$ and $d\Omega'$ are the solid angles.

The VSH also satisfy the following addition theorem:

$$
\sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \sum_{m=-l}^{l} {\bf Y}_{lm}(\mathbf{r}) {\bf Y}_{lm}^{*}(\mathbf{r}') = \frac{1}{rr'}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^{2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\right) \frac{1}{rr'}\frac{\partial}{\partial r'}\left(r'^{2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r'}\right) \frac{1}{4\pi}\delta(r-r').
$$

These properties of the VSH are crucial for solving the scattering problem for spheres. In the next section, we will discuss how to use these properties to derive the Mie scattering coefficients.

#### 4.4c Applications of Scattering by Spheres

The scattering of electromagnetic waves by spheres has a wide range of applications in various fields. In this section, we will explore some of these applications, focusing on the use of the Mie scattering coefficients and the Dyadic Green's function of a sphere.

##### 4.4c.1 Mie Scattering Coefficients

The Mie scattering coefficients, $a_{l}$ and $b_{l}$, are crucial in understanding the scattering of light by particles in the atmosphere. These coefficients are used to calculate the scattering cross-section, which is a measure of the probability of scattering. The Mie scattering coefficients are particularly useful for understanding phenomena such as the blue color of the sky, which is due to the scattering of sunlight by particles in the atmosphere.

The Mie scattering coefficients can be calculated using the following equations:

$$
a_{l} = \frac{1}{k r}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r\frac{d}{dr}\right)\left(r^{l+1}j_{l+1}(kr)\right) - l(l+1)r^{l}j_{l}(kr),
$$

$$
b_{l} = \frac{1}{k r}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r\frac{d}{dr}\right)\left(r^{l+1}j_{l+1}(kr)\right) + (2l+3)r^{l}j_{l}(kr),
$$

where $k$ is the wave number, $r$ is the distance from the center of the sphere, and $j_{l}(kr)$ are the spherical Bessel functions.

##### 4.4c.2 Dyadic Green's Function of a Sphere

The Dyadic Green's function of a sphere is a solution to the following equation:

$$
\nabla\times\nabla\times {\bf \hat G}(\omega,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)^{2}\varepsilon(\mathbf{r}, \omega){\bf \hat G}(\omega,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}')+ {\bf \hat 1}\delta(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'),
$$

where $\hat{\bf 1}$ is the identity matrix, and $\varepsilon(\mathbf{r}, \omega) = \varepsilon_{1} (\omega)$ for $r < a$, and $\varepsilon(\mathbf{r}, \omega) = \varepsilon$ for $r > a$. Since all fields are vectorial, the Green function is a 3 by 3 matrix and is called a dyadic.

The Green's function can be decomposed into vector spherical harmonics (VSH) as follows:

$$
{\bf \hat G}(\omega,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \sum_{m=-l}^{l} {\bf Y}_{lm}(\mathbf{r}) {\bf Y}_{lm}^{*}(\mathbf{r}') r'^{l} j_{l}(kr') P_{lm}(\cos\theta',\phi'),
$$

where ${\bf Y}_{lm}(\mathbf{r})$ are the vector spherical harmonics, $j_{l}(kr')$ are the spherical Bessel functions, $P_{lm}(\cos\theta',\phi')$ are the associated Legendre polynomials, and $*$ denotes complex conjugation.

The VSH satisfy the following orthogonality relations:

$$
\int {\bf Y}_{lm} \cdot {\bf Y}_{l'm'} r^{2} dr d\Omega = \delta_{ll'} \delta_{mm'},
$$

$$
\int {\bf Y}_{lm} \cdot {\bf Y}_{l'm'} r'^{2} dr' d\Omega' = \delta_{ll'} \delta_{mm'},
$$

$$
\int {\bf Y}_{lm} \cdot {\bf Y}_{l'm'} r^{2} r'^{2} dr dr' d\Omega d\Omega' = \frac{4\pi}{2l+3} \delta_{ll'} \delta_{mm'},
$$

where $r$ and $r'$ are the distances from the origin, and $d\Omega$ and $d\Omega'$ are the solid angles.

The VSH also satisfy the following addition theorem:

$$
\sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \sum_{m=-l}^{l} {\bf Y}_{lm}(\mathbf{r}) {\bf Y}_{lm}^{*}(\mathbf{r}') = \frac{1}{rr'}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^{2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\right) \frac{1}{rr'}\frac{\partial}{\partial r'}\left(r'^{2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r'}\right) \frac{1}{4\pi}\delta(r-r').
$$

These properties of the VSH are crucial for solving the scattering problem for spheres. In the next section, we will discuss how to use these properties to derive the Mie scattering coefficients.

### Subsection: 5.1a Introduction to Optical Fibers

Optical fibers are thin strands of glass or plastic that guide light along their length. They are used in a variety of applications, from telecommunications to medical imaging. In this section, we will introduce the concept of optical fibers and discuss their properties and applications.

#### 5.1a.1 Properties of Optical Fibers

Optical fibers are characterized by their core diameter, which is the diameter of the central region where light is guided. The core diameter is typically very small, on the order of a few micrometers, which allows for the confinement of light. The cladding diameter, which is the diameter of the outer region that surrounds the core, is typically larger than the core diameter. The difference in diameter between the core and the cladding is what allows light to be guided along the fiber.

Optical fibers are also characterized by their numerical aperture (NA), which is a measure of the light-gathering power of the fiber. The NA is defined as the sine of the half-angle of the cone of light that the fiber can accept. A larger NA means a larger cone of light that can be accepted, which allows for more light to be guided along the fiber.

#### 5.1a.2 Applications of Optical Fibers

Optical fibers have a wide range of applications due to their unique properties. One of the most common applications is in telecommunications, where optical fibers are used to transmit large amounts of data over long distances. The low attenuation (loss of signal strength) of optical fibers allows for the transmission of data over hundreds of miles without the need for signal repeaters.

Optical fibers are also used in medical imaging, particularly in endoscopes. The small diameter of the fibers allows for the insertion of the fibers into small spaces, providing high-resolution images of internal body structures.

In addition, optical fibers are used in sensors for remote sensing and multiplexing due to their low cost and high resistance. They can also be used in fiber Bragg gratings, which are periodic structures that can be written in the fiber to control the propagation of light.

#### 5.1a.3 Future Developments in Optical Fibers

As technology continues to advance, there is an increasing interest in the use of optical fibers for high-speed home networking. The development of POF (plastic optical fiber) has opened up new possibilities for next-generation Gigabit/s links inside the home. Several European Research projects, such as POF-ALL and POF-PLUS, are active in this area.

In addition, the use of optical fibers in data centers and building LAN wiring is becoming more common due to their high data rates and low attenuation. This trend is expected to continue as the demand for high-speed data transmission increases.

In conclusion, optical fibers are a crucial component in modern technology, enabling high-speed data transmission over long distances. Their unique properties and wide range of applications make them an essential topic for advanced study in electromagnetism.




### Subsection: 5.1b Optical Fibers as Wave-guides

Optical fibers are not only used for transmitting light, but they also have the ability to guide waves along their length. This makes them ideal for use as wave-guides in various applications.

#### 5.1b.1 Wave-guiding in Optical Fibers

The wave-guiding properties of optical fibers are due to the difference in refractive index between the core and the cladding. The core, which is made of a material with a higher refractive index, guides the light along its length. The cladding, which is made of a material with a lower refractive index, confines the light within the core.

The wave-guiding properties of optical fibers can be described using the ray optics approach, where the light is represented as rays that are guided along the fiber. The rays are confined within the core by the cladding, and they travel along the fiber with minimal loss of energy.

#### 5.1b.2 Wave-guiding in Optical Fibers with Non-uniform Cladding

In some cases, the cladding of an optical fiber may not be uniform, meaning that the refractive index of the cladding material may vary along the length of the fiber. This can occur due to variations in the manufacturing process or intentional design.

When the cladding is non-uniform, the wave-guiding properties of the fiber can be affected. The non-uniform cladding can cause the light to deviate from its original path, leading to a phenomenon known as cladding mode coupling. This can result in a loss of signal strength and quality.

#### 5.1b.3 Wave-guiding in Optical Fibers with Non-uniform Cladding

To mitigate the effects of cladding mode coupling, various techniques have been developed. One such technique is the use of a non-uniform cladding with a graded refractive index profile. This graded profile can help to reduce the deviation of the light rays, thereby reducing the effects of cladding mode coupling.

Another technique is the use of a polymer coating on the fiber. This coating can help to reduce the effects of cladding mode coupling by providing a smooth and uniform surface for the light to travel along.

In conclusion, optical fibers are not only used for transmitting light, but they also have the ability to guide waves along their length. The wave-guiding properties of optical fibers can be affected by the presence of non-uniform cladding, but various techniques can be used to mitigate these effects.

In these techniques, optical fibers are used to transmit light into the body, allowing for the visualization of internal organs and tissues. The use of optical fibers in medical imaging has greatly improved the accuracy and safety of these procedures.

#### 5.1c.3 Sensing and Measurement

Optical fibers are used in a variety of sensing and measurement applications. For example, they are used in strain gauges to measure mechanical strain, in temperature sensors to measure temperature changes, and in pressure sensors to measure pressure changes. The use of optical fibers in these applications offers several advantages, including high sensitivity, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and the ability to transmit data over long distances.

### Subsection: 5.2a Introduction to Metal-insulator-metal Waveguides

Metal-insulator-metal (MIM) waveguides are a type of waveguide that is widely used in the field of electromagnetics. They are particularly useful in applications where high power levels need to be transmitted over short distances. MIM waveguides are also used in applications where high precision is required, such as in the design of microwave circuits.

#### 5.2a.1 Structure of MIM Waveguides

MIM waveguides are typically made of a metal core, which is surrounded by an insulating layer, and then another metal layer. The metal layers are usually made of materials with high electrical conductivity, such as copper or aluminum, while the insulating layer is typically made of a material with high dielectric constant, such as ceramic or glass.

The structure of MIM waveguides is designed to guide electromagnetic waves along the length of the waveguide. The metal layers act as conductors, while the insulating layer acts as a barrier that prevents the electromagnetic waves from leaking out. This structure allows for the efficient transmission of electromagnetic waves, making MIM waveguides an ideal choice for many applications.

#### 5.2a.2 Types of MIM Waveguides

There are several types of MIM waveguides, each with its own unique characteristics. Some of the most common types include:

- Coaxial MIM waveguides: These are used in applications where high precision is required, but the waveguide needs to be compact. They are particularly useful for applications where the electromagnetic waves need to be guided through a narrow space.

#### 5.2a.3 Applications of MIM Waveguides

MIM waveguides have a wide range of applications in the field of electromagnetics. Some of the most common applications include:

### Subsection: 5.2b Metal-insulator-metal Waveguides in Electromagnetism

Metal-insulator-metal (MIM) waveguides play a crucial role in the field of electromagnetics, particularly in the design of high power and high precision applications. In this section, we will explore the behavior of MIM waveguides in the context of electromagnetism.

#### 5.2b.1 Wave Propagation in MIM Waveguides

The propagation of electromagnetic waves in MIM waveguides is governed by Maxwell's equations, which describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields. In the context of MIM waveguides, these equations can be simplified due to the structure of the waveguide.

The electric and magnetic fields in the waveguide can be represented as transverse electromagnetic (TEM) modes. These modes are characterized by the transverse nature of the electric and magnetic fields, meaning that they are perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. The propagation constant of these modes, denoted by $\beta$, is given by:

$$
\beta = \sqrt{k^2 - k_z^2}
$$

where $k$ is the wave number and $k_z$ is the wave number in the z-direction. The propagation constant is a complex quantity, with the real part representing the phase velocity and the imaginary part representing the attenuation of the wave.

#### 5.2b.2 Dispersion in MIM Waveguides

Dispersion is a phenomenon that occurs in waveguides where the phase velocity of the wave depends on its frequency. In MIM waveguides, dispersion can be caused by the variation in the effective dielectric constant with frequency. This variation can be represented by the effective dielectric constant, $\epsilon_r$, which is given by:

$$
\epsilon_r = \frac{\epsilon_o}{\epsilon_r - \frac{\epsilon_o}{\epsilon_r}}
$$

where $\epsilon_o$ is the permittivity of free space and $\epsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity of the insulating layer. As the frequency of the wave increases, the effective dielectric constant decreases, leading to an increase in the phase velocity. This results in a dispersion effect, where the phase velocity of the wave changes with frequency.

#### 5.2b.3 Applications of MIM Waveguides

MIM waveguides have a wide range of applications in the field of electromagnetics. They are commonly used in high power applications, such as in microwave ovens and radar systems. They are also used in high precision applications, such as in the design of microwave circuits.

In addition, MIM waveguides are also used in the design of waveguide resonators, which are devices that are used to generate and manipulate electromagnetic waves.

### Subsection: 5.4a Introduction to Whispering Gallery Resonators

Whispering gallery resonators (WGRs) are a type of photonic crystal structure that have gained significant attention in recent years due to their unique properties and potential applications. WGRs are essentially high-Q resonators that are formed when light is confined to a narrow path around the circumference of a cylindrical structure. This confinement of light leads to a long photon lifetime, resulting in a high-Q resonator.

The name "whispering gallery" comes from the fact that light propagating around the circumference of the structure can travel large distances with minimal loss, much like a whisper traveling around a gallery. This property makes WGRs particularly useful for applications that require long-distance light propagation with minimal loss, such as in telecommunications and optical computing.

WGRs are typically fabricated using photonic crystal structures, which are periodic structures that can control the propagation of light. These structures can be created using a variety of techniques, including lithography and ion implantation. The periodicity of the structure is crucial for creating WGRs, as it determines the path that light will follow around the structure.

One of the key advantages of WGRs is their ability to confine light to a narrow path. This confinement can be achieved by creating a defect in the photonic crystal structure, which allows light to propagate along the circumference of the structure. The size and shape of the defect can be controlled to achieve desired properties, such as the resonance frequency of the WGR.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the theory behind WGRs, including their mode structure and resonance properties. We will also discuss some practical applications of WGRs, including their use in telecommunications and optical computing.

### Subsection: 5.4b Resonance Properties of Whispering Gallery Resonators

The resonance properties of whispering gallery resonators (WGRs) are largely determined by the size and shape of the defect in the photonic crystal structure. The defect acts as a waveguide for light, confining it to a narrow path around the circumference of the structure. The length of this path, known as the circumference, plays a crucial role in determining the resonance frequency of the WGR.

The resonance frequency of a WGR can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
f = \frac{c}{2\pi R}
$$

where $f$ is the resonance frequency, $c$ is the speed of light, and $R$ is the radius of the WGR. This equation shows that the resonance frequency is inversely proportional to the radius of the WGR. Therefore, by controlling the size of the WGR, we can control its resonance frequency.

The quality factor (Q-factor) of a WGR is another important parameter that characterizes its resonance properties. The Q-factor is defined as the ratio of the resonance frequency to the bandwidth of the resonance. It is a measure of the sharpness of the resonance peak. The higher the Q-factor, the narrower the bandwidth and the sharper the resonance peak.

The Q-factor of a WGR can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
Q = \frac{\pi R}{\lambda}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light propagating around the WGR. This equation shows that the Q-factor is directly proportional to the radius of the WGR and inversely proportional to the wavelength of the light. Therefore, by controlling the size of the WGR and the wavelength of the light, we can control the Q-factor of the WGR.

In the next section, we will discuss some practical applications of WGRs, including their use in telecommunications and optical computing.

### Section: 5.5 Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics

Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (CQED) is a branch of quantum physics that deals with the interaction of light and matter within a confined space, such as a cavity. This field has been instrumental in the development of quantum computing, quantum communication, and other quantum technologies.

#### 5.5a Introduction to Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics

Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (CQED) is a field of quantum physics that deals with the interaction of light and matter within a confined space, such as a cavity. The cavity is typically a high-Q resonator, such as a waveguide or a microwave cavity, which confines the electromagnetic field to a small volume. The interaction between the confined electromagnetic field and the atoms or other particles within the cavity is the subject of CQED.

The mathematical description of CQED is based on the Jaynes–Cummings model, which describes the interaction between a two-level atom and a single mode of the electromagnetic field. The Jaynes–Cummings model is given by the Hamiltonian:

$$
\hat{H} = \hbar \omega_r \left( \hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a} + \frac{1}{2} \right) + \frac{\hbar}{2} \omega_a \sigma_z + \hbar g (\sigma_+ \hat{a} + \sigma_- \hat{a}^\dagger)
$$

where $\hat{a}$ and $\hat{a}^\dagger$ are the annihilation and creation operators for the cavity field, $\sigma_z$ is the Pauli matrix, $\sigma_+$ and $\sigma_-$ are the raising and lowering operators for the atomic state, $\omega_r$ is the resonance frequency of the cavity, $\omega_a$ is the atomic transition frequency, and $g$ is the coupling strength between the atom and the cavity field.

The Jaynes–Cummings model describes the vacuum Rabi oscillations between an excited atom and $n-1$ photons, and a ground state atom and $n$ photons. This interaction can be used to swap the atom qubit's state onto the cavity field's, and vice versa. This property is crucial for many applications of CQED, such as quantum computing and quantum communication.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the principles and applications of CQED, including the Maxwell–Bloch equations, the derivation of which begins with the Jaynes–Cummings Hamiltonian under coherent drive.

Waveguide resonators are a type of cavity used in CQED. They are essentially waveguides with one or both ends terminated by a reflective surface. The reflective surface can be a perfect conductor, a dielectric material with a high dielectric constant, or a metal mesh. The termination of the waveguide by a reflective surface creates a standing wave pattern within the waveguide, which can be described by the wave equation:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial x^2} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial t^2}
$$

where $E$ is the electric field, $x$ is the direction along the waveguide, $t$ is time, $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, and $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.

The standing wave pattern within the waveguide resonator can be described by the resonance condition:

$$
2\pi n = k_x L
$$

where $n$ is an integer representing the mode number, $k_x$ is the wave number in the x-direction, and $L$ is the length of the waveguide.

The resonance condition implies that the electric field within the waveguide resonator oscillates with a frequency that is an integer multiple of the wave number. This frequency is the resonance frequency of the waveguide resonator.

Waveguide resonators have been used in a variety of applications, including the generation of optical frequency combs, the study of quantum statistics of light, and the development of quantum technologies.

In the next section, we will discuss another type of cavity used in CQED: the optical cavity.

The interaction between the atom and the cavity field, as described by the Jaynes–Cummings model, can be used to swap the atom qubit's state onto the cavity field's, and vice versa. This property is crucial for quantum computing, as it allows for the storage and manipulation of quantum information.

##### Quantum Communication

Quantum communication is another field where CQED has significant applications. Quantum communication uses quantum states to transmit information, which can be used to achieve tasks such as secure communication and quantum key distribution.

The ability to swap the atom qubit's state onto the cavity field's, and vice versa, as described by the Jaynes–Cummings model, can be used to implement quantum communication protocols. For instance, the atom qubit's state can be used to encode information, which can then be transmitted to the cavity field. The information can be retrieved from the cavity field by swapping the state back onto the atom qubit.

##### Other Applications

CQED has also found applications in other areas, such as the study of quantum statistics of light and the generation of optical frequency combs. The Jaynes–Cummings model, for instance, can be used to study the statistics of photons in the cavity, which can provide insights into the quantum nature of light.

Waveguide resonators, another important component of CQED, have been used in the generation of optical frequency combs. The resonance condition of the waveguide resonator can be used to generate a series of optical frequencies, which can be used to create a frequency comb.

#### 6.1a Introduction to Surface Plasmons

Surface plasmons are a type of surface electromagnetic wave that propagate along the interface between two different materials. They are a crucial component in the field of plasmonics and have been extensively studied due to their unique properties and potential applications.

Surface plasmons are a type of surface plasmon polariton, which are waves that propagate along the interface between a positive- and a negative-permittivity material. These waves decay perpendicularly from the interface, a property known as evanescent field. The dispersion relation for surface plasmon polaritons can be obtained from solving Maxwell's equations:

$$
\beta = \frac{\omega}{c} \sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2}}
$$

where $\beta$ is the propagation constant, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$ are the permittivities of the two materials.

Surface plasmon polaritons have shorter wavelengths than light in free space for a frequency band below surface plasmon frequency. This property, as well as subwavelength confinement, enables new applications in subwavelength optics and systems beyond the diffraction-limit.

However, for lower frequency bands such as microwave and terahertz, surface plasmon polariton modes are not supported. Metals function approximately as perfect electrical conductors with imaginary dielectric functions in this regime. Per the effective medium approach, metal surfaces with subwavelength structural elements can mimic the plasma behavior of surface plasmon polaritons. This led to the development of spoof surface plasmons, a type of surface plasmon polariton that can propagate in microwave and terahertz frequencies.

Spoof surface plasmons share the natural properties of surface plasmon polaritons, such as dispersion characteristics and subwavelength field confinement. They were first theorized by John Pendry et al. and have since been extensively studied due to their potential applications in subwavelength optics and systems beyond the diffraction-limit.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the properties and applications of surface plasmons and spoof surface plasmons. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities in these areas, and how they are shaping the future of plasmonics and metamaterials.

#### 6.1b Surface Plasmon Resonances

Surface plasmon resonances are a critical aspect of surface plasmons. They occur when the surface plasmon wave is in resonance with the electrons in the metal, leading to a significant enhancement of the electromagnetic field at the interface. This resonance can be described by the following equation:

$$
\omega = \omega_p \sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2}}
$$

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the surface plasmon, $\omega_p$ is the plasma frequency of the metal, and $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$ are the permittivities of the two materials.

The plasma frequency, $\omega_p$, is a characteristic frequency of a metal and is defined as the frequency at which the collective oscillation of the free electrons in the metal becomes unstable. It is given by the equation:

$$
\omega_p = \sqrt{\frac{n_e e^2}{\varepsilon_0 m}}
$$

where $n_e$ is the number density of the free electrons, $e$ is the charge of the electron, $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, and $m$ is the mass of the electron.

Surface plasmon resonances have been extensively studied due to their potential applications in various fields. For instance, they are used in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), a powerful analytical technique for the detection and identification of molecules. The resonances enhance the electromagnetic field at the interface, leading to a significant increase in the Raman signal.

In addition, surface plasmon resonances play a crucial role in the operation of plasmonic devices, such as plasmonic antennas and plasmonic waveguides. These devices exploit the unique properties of surface plasmons, such as their ability to confine light to subwavelength dimensions, to achieve enhanced light-matter interactions.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the properties and applications of surface plasmon resonances. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities in these areas, and how they are shaping the future of plasmonics and metamaterials.

#### 6.1c Spoof Surface Plasmons

Spoof surface plasmons, also known as spoof surface plasmon polaritons and designer surface plasmons, are a type of surface electromagnetic wave that propagate along planar interfaces with sign-changing permittivities. They are a type of surface plasmon polariton, which ordinarily propagate along metal and dielectric interfaces in infrared and visible frequencies. However, due to the dispersion properties of metals, spoof surface plasmons are necessary in microwave and terahertz frequencies.

The concept of spoof surface plasmons was first theorized by John Pendry et al. They are artificially engineered metamaterials that mimic the plasma behavior of surface plasmon polaritons. This is achieved by creating a periodic structure with subwavelength features on the surface of a metal. The periodic structure creates a sign-changing permittivity, which is necessary for the propagation of spoof surface plasmons.

The dispersion relation for spoof surface plasmons can be obtained from solving Maxwell's equations. It is given by the equation:

$$
\beta = \frac{\omega}{c} \sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2}}
$$

where $\beta$ is the propagation constant, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$ are the permittivities of the two materials.

Spoof surface plasmons share the natural properties of surface plasmon polaritons, such as dispersion characteristics and subwavelength field confinement.

Surface plasmon resonances in metamaterials are created by designing the metamaterial in such a way that it creates a sign-changing permittivity. This is achieved by creating a periodic structure with subwavelength features on the surface of the metamaterial. The periodic structure creates a sign-changing permittivity, which is necessary for the propagation of surface plasmons.

$$
\beta = \frac{\omega}{c} \sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2}}

#### 6.1f Surface Plasmon Resonances in Metamaterials

Surface plasmon resonances in metamaterials are a fascinating area of study due to their unique properties and potential applications. These resonances are created by designing the metamaterial in such a way that it creates a sign-changing permittivity. This is achieved by creating a periodic structure with subwavelength features on the surface of the metamaterial. The periodic structure creates a sign-changing permittivity, which is necessary for the propagation of surface plasmons.

The dispersion relation for surface plasmon resonances in metamaterials can be obtained from solving Maxwell's equations. It is given by the equation:

$$
\beta = \frac{\omega}{c} \sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2}}
$$

where $\beta$ is the propagation constant, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$ are the permittivities of the two materials.

#### 6.2a Introduction to Plasmonic Waveguides

Plasmonic waveguides are a type of hybrid waveguide that combines the advantages of both dielectric waveguides and plasmonic waveguides. They are designed to achieve strong light confinement by coupling the light guided by a dielectric waveguide and a plasmonic waveguide. This is achieved by separating a medium of high refractive index (usually silicon) from a metal surface (usually gold or silver) by a small gap.

The concept of plasmonic waveguides was first proposed to overcome the limitations of both dielectric waveguides and plasmonic waveguides. Dielectric waveguides, while capable of guiding light over long distances with low loss, are limited by diffraction in their ability to confine light. On the other hand, plasmonic waveguides, which use surface plasmons to confine light near a metal surface, suffer significant propagation loss due to the presence of metal. The aim of designing the hybrid plasmonic waveguide was to combine these two different wave guiding schemes and achieve high light confinement without suffering large loss.

The operation of plasmonic waveguides can be explained using the concept of mode coupling. The most commonly used hybrid plasmonic waveguide consists of a silicon nanowire placed very near a metal surface and separated by a low index region. The silicon waveguide supports dielectric waveguide mode, which is mostly confined in silicon. The metal surface supports surface plasmon, which is confined near the metal surface. When these two structures are brought close to each other, the dielectric waveguide mode supported by the silicon nanowire couples to the surface plasmon mode supported by the metal surface. As a result, the light confinement ability of the plasmonic waveguide is not limited by diffraction, and it can confine light to very small volumes.

Since the first proposal of the hybrid plasmonic waveguide, many other types of hybrid plasmonic waveguides have been proposed to improve light confinement ability or to reduce fabrication complexity. These include the use of metamaterials, which are artificially engineered materials with properties not found in nature, to achieve even stronger light confinement. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the principles and applications of plasmonic waveguides and metamaterials.

#### 6.2b Guided Waves in Plasmonic Waveguides

In plasmonic waveguides, the propagation of light is governed by the principles of mode coupling. This means that the light guided by the dielectric waveguide mode and the surface plasmon mode are coupled together, resulting in a hybrid mode that combines the advantages of both. This hybrid mode is what allows for the strong light confinement in plasmonic waveguides.

The coupling between the dielectric waveguide mode and the surface plasmon mode is achieved by bringing the two structures (the silicon waveguide and the metal surface) close to each other. This proximity allows for the exchange of energy between the two modes, resulting in the formation of the hybrid mode. The distance between the two structures is critical in determining the strength of the coupling and, consequently, the confinement of light.

The propagation of the hybrid mode in the plasmonic waveguide can be described by the following equation:

$$
E(x,y) = E_{dw}(x,y) + E_{sp}(x,y)
$$

where $E(x,y)$ is the total electric field, $E_{dw}(x,y)$ is the electric field of the dielectric waveguide mode, and $E_{sp}(x,y)$ is the electric field of the surface plasmon mode.

The propagation loss in plasmonic waveguides is primarily due to the ohmic loss in the metal surface. This loss can be reduced by optimizing the design of the waveguide, such as by increasing the gap between the silicon waveguide and the metal surface. However, this also reduces the strength of the coupling between the two modes, which can limit the confinement of light. Therefore, a balance must be struck between reducing the propagation loss and maintaining strong mode coupling.

In the next section, we will discuss the role of metamaterials in plasmonic waveguides and how they can be used to further improve the light confinement ability of these waveguides.

### Subsection: 6.4a Introduction to Metamaterial Design

Metamaterials are artificially structured materials that have unique properties not found in nature. These properties are a result of the periodic arrangement of subwavelength inclusions, which can manipulate the behavior of electromagnetic waves. The design of these metamaterials is a complex process that involves careful consideration of the size, shape, and arrangement of the inclusions.

#### 6.4a.1 Size and Shape of Inclusions

The size and shape of the inclusions play a crucial role in determining the properties of the metamaterial. The size of the inclusions must be smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave to be manipulated. This allows for the creation of a periodic structure that can interact with the wave. The shape of the inclusions can be tailored to achieve specific properties. For example, split-ring resonators (SRRs) have been used to create negative index of refraction, while fishnet structures have been used to create superlenses.

#### 6.4a.2 Arrangement of Inclusions

The arrangement of the inclusions is also critical in the design of metamaterials. The inclusions must be arrayed into an ordered, repeating pattern with equal dimensions and equidistant spacing. This allows for the creation of a homogeneous medium, where the properties are the same in all directions. The periodicity of the structure is also important, as it determines the wavelengths that can be manipulated.

#### 6.4a.3 Homogenous and Effective Media

The concept of homogenous and effective media is crucial in the design of metamaterials. Homogenous media are materials with the same properties in all directions. This is achieved by the periodic arrangement of the inclusions, which creates a uniform structure. Effective media, on the other hand, are materials that exhibit properties different from their constituent materials. This is achieved by the interaction between the inclusions and the electromagnetic wave, which can create new properties not found in the individual materials.

#### 6.4a.4 Three-Dimensional and Two-Dimensional Realizations

Metamaterials can be realized in both three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) structures. 3D structures are more complex to design and fabricate, but they offer more flexibility in terms of the properties that can be achieved. 2D structures, on the other hand, are simpler to design and fabricate, but they are limited in the properties that can be achieved.

Plasmonic metamaterials are a type of metamaterial that exploits the interaction between plasmons and electromagnetic waves. Plasmons are collective oscillations of electrons in a metal, and they can interact with electromagnetic waves to create unique properties.

The design of plasmonic metamaterials involves careful consideration of the size, shape, and arrangement of the inclusions, just like regular metamaterials. However, the properties of the inclusions are also important. For example, the plasmonic resonance of the inclusions can be tuned to achieve specific properties.

#### 6.4b.2 Metamaterials for Negative Index of Refraction

One of the most intriguing properties of metamaterials is the ability to achieve a negative index of refraction. This means that light can be bent in the opposite direction of its normal direction when it passes through the metamaterial. This property has been achieved using metamaterials with a specific arrangement of inclusions, such as split-ring resonators (SRRs) and fishnet structures.

The design of these metamaterials involves careful consideration of the size, shape, and arrangement of the inclusions, as well as the properties of the inclusions themselves. For example, the plasmonic resonance of the SRRs must be tuned to achieve the negative index of refraction.

#### 6.4b.3 Metamaterials for Superlenses

Another important application of metamaterials is in the creation of superlenses. These are lenses that can focus light beyond the diffraction limit, allowing for the creation of images with higher resolution than traditional lenses.

The design of superlenses involves the use of metamaterials with a specific arrangement of inclusions, such as fishnet structures. These metamaterials can manipulate the phase of light in a way that allows for the creation of superlenses.

In conclusion, the design of metamaterials for plasmonics and metamaterials involves careful consideration of the size, shape, and arrangement of the inclusions, as well as the properties of the inclusions themselves. By manipulating these factors, it is possible to create metamaterials with unique properties that have applications in a wide range of fields.

### Subsection: 6.5a Introduction to Chiral Metamaterials

Chiral metamaterials are a class of metamaterials that exhibit chirality, a property of being handed or asymmetric. This property is a result of the chiral symmetry of the metamaterial structure, which is characterized by the presence of a mirror image that is not identical to the original structure. This chirality can have significant implications for the behavior of electromagnetic waves interacting with the metamaterial.

#### 6.5a.1 Chiral Symmetry and Chiral Metamaterials

Chiral symmetry is a concept that is closely related to the concept of parity in quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, parity is a property of a system that describes its symmetry under reflection. Similarly, in the context of metamaterials, chiral symmetry describes the symmetry of the metamaterial structure under reflection.

A chiral metamaterial is said to exhibit chiral symmetry if it has a mirror image that is not identical to the original structure. This means that the metamaterial structure is not symmetric under reflection. This property is often achieved by designing the metamaterial structure with elements that are asymmetric or non-uniform.

#### 6.5a.2 Chiral Metamaterials and Electromagnetic Waves

The chirality of a chiral metamaterial can have a profound impact on the behavior of electromagnetic waves interacting with the metamaterial. This is because the chirality of the metamaterial structure can cause a phase shift in the electromagnetic waves passing through it. This phase shift can be controlled by manipulating the chirality of the metamaterial structure, allowing for precise control over the propagation of electromagnetic waves.

#### 6.5a.3 Chiral Metamaterials in Optics

The ability of chiral metamaterials to control the phase of electromagnetic waves has led to their use in various optical applications. For example, chiral metamaterials can be used to create super-resolution images, where the resolution of an image is limited by the diffraction limit of the imaging system. This is achieved by manipulating the phase of the electromagnetic waves passing through the chiral metamaterial, allowing for the creation of images with a resolution beyond the diffraction limit.

#### 6.5a.4 Chiral Metamaterials in Electronics

Chiral metamaterials have also found applications in the field of electronics. For example, chiral metamaterials can be used to create antennas with improved performance. The chirality of the metamaterial structure can be used to control the phase of the electromagnetic waves emitted by the antenna, allowing for the creation of antennas with specific directional properties.

#### 6.5a.5 Chiral Metamaterials in Biomedical Imaging

The unique properties of chiral metamaterials have also led to their use in biomedical imaging. For example, chiral metamaterials can be used to create super-resolution images of biological samples, allowing for the visualization of structures that were previously too small to be resolved. This is achieved by manipulating the phase of the electromagnetic waves passing through the chiral metamaterial, allowing for the creation of images with a resolution beyond the diffraction limit.

For example, by manipulating the chirality of the metamaterial structure, the phase shift of the plasmonic waves can be controlled, allowing for precise control over the propagation of light.

#### 6.5b.2 Chiral Metamaterials in Metamaterial Devices

Metamaterial devices, such as superlenses and cloaking devices, also benefit from the use of chiral metamaterials. Superlenses, for instance, require a negative refractive index to achieve sub-diffraction-limited imaging. Chiral metamaterials, with their unique optical properties, can provide the necessary negative refractive index, enabling the development of superlenses with even higher resolution.

Cloaking devices, on the other hand, rely on the manipulation of the electromagnetic field to hide an object from detection. Chiral metamaterials, with their ability to control the phase of electromagnetic waves, can be used to achieve this by creating a phase gradient around the object, effectively bending the electromagnetic field around it.

### Section: 7.1 Nonlinear Susceptibility

#### 7.1a Introduction to Nonlinear Susceptibility

Nonlinear susceptibility is a fundamental concept in the field of nonlinear optics. It is a measure of the nonlinear response of a material system to an applied electromagnetic field. The nonlinear susceptibility is a tensor quantity, and it is typically denoted by the symbol $\chi^{(n)}$, where $n$ is the order of the nonlinearity.

The nonlinear susceptibility is a crucial parameter in the description of nonlinear optical phenomena. It provides a quantitative measure of the nonlinear response of a material system, and it is essential for the design and optimization of nonlinear optical devices.

The nonlinear susceptibility is typically a function of the frequency of the applied electromagnetic field. This frequency dependence can be quite complex, and it is often described using a power series expansion. For example, the nonlinear susceptibility of a material can be written as:

$$
\chi^{(n)}(\omega) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \chi^{(n)}_k(\omega) (\omega')^k
$$

where $\omega'$ is the frequency of the applied electromagnetic field, and $\chi^{(n)}_k(\omega)$ is the $k$th order frequency-dependent susceptibility.

The nonlinear susceptibility is also a function of the intensity of the applied electromagnetic field. This intensity dependence can be described using a Taylor series expansion. For example, the nonlinear susceptibility of a material can be written as:

$$
\chi^{(n)}(\omega, I) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \chi^{(n)}_k(\omega, I) (I')^k
$$

where $I'$ is the intensity of the applied electromagnetic field, and $\chi^{(n)}_k(\omega, I)$ is the $k$th order intensity-dependent susceptibility.

The nonlinear susceptibility is a key parameter in the design and optimization of nonlinear optical devices. It determines the efficiency of the nonlinear optical process, and it influences the performance of the device. For example, in the case of sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy, the efficiency of the SFG process is determined by the second order susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the concept of nonlinear susceptibility, and we will explore its role in various nonlinear optical phenomena. We will also discuss the methods for measuring the nonlinear susceptibility of a material system.

#### 7.1b Nonlinear Susceptibility Tensors

The nonlinear susceptibility is a tensor quantity, and it is typically denoted by the symbol $\chi^{(n)}$, where $n$ is the order of the nonlinearity. The nonlinear susceptibility tensor is a crucial parameter in the description of nonlinear optical phenomena. It provides a quantitative measure of the nonlinear response of a material system, and it is essential for the design and optimization of nonlinear optical devices.

The nonlinear susceptibility tensor is a function of the frequency of the applied electromagnetic field. This frequency dependence can be quite complex, and it is often described using a power series expansion. For example, the nonlinear susceptibility of a material can be written as:

$$
\chi^{(n)}(\omega) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \chi^{(n)}_k(\omega) (\omega')^k
$$

where $\omega'$ is the frequency of the applied electromagnetic field, and $\chi^{(n)}_k(\omega)$ is the $k$th order frequency-dependent susceptibility.

The nonlinear susceptibility tensor is also a function of the intensity of the applied electromagnetic field. This intensity dependence can be described using a Taylor series expansion. For example, the nonlinear susceptibility of a material can be written as:

$$
\chi^{(n)}(\omega, I) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \chi^{(n)}_k(\omega, I) (I')^k
$$

where $I'$ is the intensity of the applied electromagnetic field, and $\chi^{(n)}_k(\omega, I)$ is the $k$th order intensity-dependent susceptibility.

The nonlinear susceptibility tensor is a key parameter in the design and optimization of nonlinear optical devices. It determines the efficiency of the nonlinear optical process, and it influences the performance of the device. For example, in the case of sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy, the efficiency of the SFG process is determined by the second order susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$.

The nonlinear susceptibility tensor can be represented as a matrix, with each element representing the susceptibility of the material to a particular type of nonlinear interaction. For example, the second order susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$ can be represented as a 3x3x3 matrix, with each element representing the susceptibility of the material to a particular type of second order nonlinear interaction.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of nonlinear susceptibility tensors, and we will explore their role in various nonlinear optical phenomena. We will also discuss the methods for measuring the nonlinear susceptibility of a material system.

#### 7.1c Nonlinear Susceptibility in Media

The nonlinear susceptibility is a crucial parameter in the study of nonlinear optics. It is a measure of the nonlinear response of a material system to an applied electromagnetic field. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of nonlinear susceptibility in media, focusing on the role of the inversion operator and the implications for sum frequency generation spectroscopy.

The inversion operator, denoted as $I_{inv}$, is a key concept in the understanding of nonlinear susceptibility. It is defined as $I_{inv} \overrightarrow{L} = -\overrightarrow{L}$, where $\overrightarrow{L}$ is an arbitrary vector. The inversion operator plays a crucial role in the proof of the zeroing of even order susceptibilities in centrosymmetric media.

The proof begins with the application of the inversion operator to the polarization equation, which gives:

$$
\overrightarrow{P} = \epsilon_0 \chi^{(1)} \overrightarrow{E} + \epsilon_0 \chi^{(2)} \overrightarrow{E} \overrightarrow{E} + \epsilon_0 \chi^{(3)} \overrightarrow{E} \overrightarrow{E} \overrightarrow{E} + \cdots
$$

Adding this equation to the original polarization equation gives:

$$
2\overrightarrow{P} = \epsilon_0 \chi^{(1)} \overrightarrow{E} + \epsilon_0 \chi^{(2)} \overrightarrow{E} \overrightarrow{E} + \epsilon_0 \chi^{(3)} \overrightarrow{E} \overrightarrow{E} \overrightarrow{E} + \cdots
$$

This equation implies that $\chi^{(2i)} = 0$ for $i \in [1,2,3,\dots,n/2]$ in centrosymmetric media. This is because the inversion operator changes the sign of the vector $\overrightarrow{L}$, which leads to the cancellation of the even order susceptibilities. This proof holds for the case where $n$ is even. Setting $m = n - 1$ gives the odd case and the remainder of the proof is the same.

This result has significant implications for sum frequency generation spectroscopy (SFG). SFG is a second-order nonlinear process, which means it is dependent on the 2nd order susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$. Since $\chi^{(2)} = 0$ in centrosymmetric media, SFG cannot occur in these media. This is why SFG is typically observed at interfaces between different materials or between a material and a vacuum.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of this result for the design and optimization of nonlinear optical devices.




#### 7.1b Nonlinear Susceptibility in Nonlinear Optics

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of nonlinear susceptibility and its importance in nonlinear optics. In this section, we will delve deeper into the role of nonlinear susceptibility in nonlinear optics, particularly in the context of sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy.

As we have seen, the polarization $\overrightarrow{P}$ which generates the output in a nonlinear optical process is given by:

$$
\overrightarrow{P} = \epsilon_0 \chi^{(i)} \overrightarrow{E}
$$

where $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, $\chi^{(i)}$ is the $i$th order nonlinear susceptibility, and $\overrightarrow{E}$ is the electric field. The nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(i)}$ is a crucial parameter in this equation, as it determines the strength of the nonlinear response of the material system.

In the case of SFG spectroscopy, the nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$ plays a significant role. This is because SFG is a second-order nonlinear process, meaning it involves the interaction of two photons. The nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$ is a third-rank tensor, which limits the types of materials that can be accessed for SFG. 

Centrosymmetric media, which include the bulk of gases, liquids, and most solids under the assumption of the electric-dipole approximation, have an even number of inversion symmetries. This results in the cancellation of the second-order nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$, making it zero. However, at the interface between two different materials or two centrosymmetric media, the inversion symmetry is broken, and an SFG signal can be generated. This suggests that the resulting spectra represent a thin layer of molecules. A signal is found when there is a net polar orientation.

In conclusion, the nonlinear susceptibility plays a crucial role in nonlinear optics, particularly in the context of SFG spectroscopy. Its understanding is essential for the design and optimization of nonlinear optical devices.

#### 7.1c Nonlinear Susceptibility in Nonlinear Optics

In the previous section, we discussed the role of nonlinear susceptibility in the context of sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy. We saw that the nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$ plays a significant role in this second-order nonlinear process. In this section, we will explore the concept of nonlinear susceptibility in more detail, focusing on its role in nonlinear optics.

The nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(i)}$ is a crucial parameter in nonlinear optics. It is a measure of the nonlinear response of a material system to an applied electromagnetic field. The nonlinear susceptibility is a tensor quantity, and it is typically denoted by the symbol $\chi^{(i)}$, where $i$ is the order of the nonlinearity.

The nonlinear susceptibility is a key parameter in the description of nonlinear optical phenomena. It provides a quantitative measure of the nonlinear response of a material system, and it is essential for the design and optimization of nonlinear optical devices.

The nonlinear susceptibility is typically a function of the frequency of the applied electromagnetic field. This frequency dependence can be quite complex, and it is often described using a power series expansion. For example, the nonlinear susceptibility of a material can be written as:

$$
\chi^{(n)}(\omega) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \chi^{(n)}_k(\omega) (\omega')^k
$$

where $\omega'$ is the frequency of the applied electromagnetic field, and $\chi^{(n)}_k(\omega)$ is the $k$th order frequency-dependent susceptibility.

The nonlinear susceptibility is also a function of the intensity of the applied electromagnetic field. This intensity dependence can be described using a Taylor series expansion. For example, the nonlinear susceptibility of a material can be written as:

$$
\chi^{(n)}(\omega, I) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \chi^{(n)}_k(\omega, I) (I')^k
$$

where $I'$ is the intensity of the applied electromagnetic field, and $\chi^{(n)}_k(\omega, I)$ is the $k$th order intensity-dependent susceptibility.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of nonlinear susceptibility in more detail, focusing on its role in nonlinear optics. We will also discuss the implications of the nonlinear susceptibility for the design and optimization of nonlinear optical devices.




#### 7.1c Practical Applications

Nonlinear optics has a wide range of practical applications, particularly in the field of telecommunications. The nonlinear susceptibility plays a crucial role in these applications, as it determines the strength of the nonlinear response of the material system.

One of the most significant applications of nonlinear optics in telecommunications is in the development of high-speed data transmission systems. The nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$ is particularly important in this context, as it allows for the generation of second-harmonic signals, which can be used to increase the data transmission rate.

Another important application of nonlinear optics in telecommunications is in the development of frequency converters. These devices are used to convert the frequency of light signals, which is essential in long-distance data transmission. The nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$ plays a crucial role in this process, as it allows for the generation of second-harmonic signals, which can be used to convert the frequency of the light signals.

Nonlinear optics also has applications in the field of imaging. For example, the sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy, which is a second-order nonlinear process, is used in imaging techniques such as two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D-IR). This technique allows for the imaging of molecular vibrations, which can provide valuable information about the chemical composition of a sample.

In conclusion, the nonlinear susceptibility plays a crucial role in a wide range of practical applications, particularly in the field of telecommunications. Its understanding is essential for the development of advanced technologies and for the advancement of our understanding of the fundamental principles of nonlinear optics.




#### 7.2a Introduction to Second Harmonic Generation

Second harmonic generation (SHG) is a nonlinear optical process that involves the generation of light waves with a frequency that is twice the frequency of the incident wave. This process is governed by the second-order nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$, which is a measure of the nonlinear response of a material system to an applied electromagnetic field.

The simplest case for the analysis of second-harmonic generation is a plane wave of amplitude "E"("ω") traveling in a nonlinear medium in the direction of its "k" vector. A polarization is generated at the second-harmonic frequency:

$$
P(2\omega) = \frac{1}{2}\chi^{(2)}E(\omega)E(\omega)^*
$$

where $d_{\text{eff}}$ is the effective nonlinear optical coefficient which is dependent on specific components of $\chi^{(2)}$ that are involved in this particular interaction. The wave equation at 2ω (assuming negligible loss and asserting the slowly varying envelope approximation) is

$$
\frac{\partial E(2\omega)}{\partial z} = -i\Delta k E(2\omega)
$$

where $\Delta k = k(2\omega) - 2k(\omega)$.

At low conversion efficiency ("E"(2"ω") ≪ "E"("ω")) the amplitude $E(\omega)$ remains essentially constant over the interaction length, $\ell$. Then, with the boundary condition $E(2\omega, z = 0) = 0$ we obtain

$$
E(2\omega, z) = -i\Delta k \frac{d_{\text{eff}}}{\ell} E(\omega)
$$

In terms of the optical intensity, $I = n/2\sqrt{\varepsilon_0/\mu_0}|E|^2$, this is,

$$
I(2\omega) = \frac{n}{2\sqrt{\varepsilon_0/\mu_0}}\left|\Delta k \frac{d_{\text{eff}}}{\ell} E(\omega)\right|^2
$$

This intensity is maximized for the phase-matched condition $\Delta k = 0$. If the process is not phase matched, the driving polarization at $\omega$ goes in and out of phase with generated wave $E(2\omega)$ and conversion oscillates as $\sin(\Delta k\ell/2)$. The coherence length is defined as $\ell_c = \frac{\pi}{\Delta k}$. It does not pay to use a nonlinear crystal much longer than the coherence length. (Periodic poling and quasi-phase-matching provide another approach to this problem.)

When the conversion to 2nd harmonic becomes significant it becomes necessary to include depletion of the fundamental. The energy conversion states that all the involved fields verify the Manley–Rowe relations. One then has

$$
\frac{dI(2\omega)}{dz} = \frac{2\omega}{\varepsilon_0 c} \Im\left[P(2\omega)^* E(\omega)\right]
$$

where $\Im$ denotes the imaginary part. This equation describes the change in intensity of the second harmonic with respect to the propagation distance. It is a key result in the analysis of second harmonic generation and provides a basis for the design of practical devices for frequency conversion.

#### 7.2b Second Harmonic Generation in Nonlinear Crystals

Nonlinear crystals are materials that exhibit a nonlinear response to an applied electromagnetic field. They are essential in the process of second harmonic generation (SHG) due to their unique properties. The nonlinear response of these crystals is governed by the second-order nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$, which is a measure of the nonlinear response of a material system to an applied electromagnetic field.

The second harmonic generation process in nonlinear crystals can be understood in terms of the wave equation at 2ω. This equation is given by

$$
\frac{\partial E(2\omega)}{\partial z} = -i\Delta k E(2\omega)
$$

where $\Delta k = k(2\omega) - 2k(\omega)$. This equation describes the propagation of the second harmonic wave in the crystal. The term $\Delta k$ represents the phase mismatch between the second harmonic wave and the fundamental wave.

The phase mismatch is a critical factor in the efficiency of the second harmonic generation process. When the phase mismatch is zero, the process is said to be phase matched, and the efficiency of the process is maximized. However, in most cases, the phase mismatch is non-zero, and the process is said to be non-phase matched. In this case, the efficiency of the process oscillates as $\sin(\Delta k\ell/2)$, where $\ell$ is the length of the crystal.

The coherence length, defined as $\ell_c = \frac{\pi}{\Delta k}$, is a measure of the distance over which the phase mismatch remains small. It is important to note that it does not pay to use a nonlinear crystal much longer than the coherence length, as the efficiency of the second harmonic generation process will not increase significantly.

Periodic poling and quasi-phase-matching provide another approach to overcome the problem of phase mismatch. These techniques involve modifying the crystal structure in a periodic or quasi-periodic manner to achieve phase matching.

In the next section, we will discuss the practical applications of second harmonic generation in nonlinear crystals.

#### 7.2c Applications of Second Harmonic Generation

Second harmonic generation (SHG) in nonlinear crystals has a wide range of applications in various fields. The ability to generate light waves with a frequency that is twice the frequency of the incident wave makes SHG a powerful tool in many areas of science and technology.

One of the most significant applications of SHG is in the field of telecommunications. The SHG process can be used to convert the frequency of a light wave, which is essential for many telecommunication systems. For example, the SHG process can be used to convert a light wave from the infrared region to the visible region, which is useful for optical communication systems.

Another important application of SHG is in the field of spectroscopy. The SHG process can be used to generate second harmonic signals, which can provide valuable information about the properties of a material. For example, the second harmonic signals can be used to study the electronic structure of a material, which is crucial for many applications in materials science.

SHG also plays a crucial role in the field of microscopy. The SHG process can be used to generate second harmonic images, which can provide high-resolution images of biological samples and other materials. This is particularly useful in the field of biology, where high-resolution imaging is essential for studying the structure and function of biological cells and tissues.

In addition to these applications, SHG is also used in the field of quantum computing. The SHG process can be used to generate entangled photons, which are essential for quantum information processing. This is because the SHG process can generate photons with opposite polarizations, which are necessary for creating entangled states.

In conclusion, the second harmonic generation process in nonlinear crystals has a wide range of applications in various fields. Its ability to generate light waves with a frequency that is twice the frequency of the incident wave makes it a powerful tool in many areas of science and technology.




#### 7.2b Second Harmonic Generation in Nonlinear Optics

In the previous section, we discussed the basics of second harmonic generation (SHG) and its mathematical representation. In this section, we will delve deeper into the topic and explore the generation of second harmonics in nonlinear optics.

Nonlinear optics is a branch of optics that deals with the interaction of light with matter, where the polarization density P responds non-linearly to the electric field E of the light. This non-linearity can lead to a variety of phenomena, including second harmonic generation.

The second harmonic generation process involves the conversion of a fundamental wave at frequency $\omega$ into a second harmonic wave at frequency $2\omega$. This process is governed by the second-order nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$, which is a measure of the nonlinear response of a material system to an applied electromagnetic field.

The mathematical representation of second harmonic generation in nonlinear optics is given by the following equations:

$$
P(2\omega) = \frac{1}{2}\chi^{(2)}E(\omega)E(\omega)^*
$$

$$
\frac{\partial E(2\omega)}{\partial z} = -i\Delta k E(2\omega)
$$

where $\Delta k = k(2\omega) - 2k(\omega)$.

At low conversion efficiency ("E"(2"ω") ≪ "E"("ω")) the amplitude $E(\omega)$ remains essentially constant over the interaction length, $\ell$. Then, with the boundary condition $E(2\omega, z = 0) = 0$ we obtain

$$
E(2\omega, z) = -i\Delta k \frac{d_{\text{eff}}}{\ell} E(\omega)
$$

In terms of the optical intensity, $I = n/2\sqrt{\varepsilon_0/\mu_0}|E|^2$, this is,

$$
I(2\omega) = \frac{n}{2\sqrt{\varepsilon_0/\mu_0}}\left|\Delta k \frac{d_{\text{eff}}}{\ell} E(\omega)\right|^2
$$

This intensity is maximized for the phase-matched condition $\Delta k = 0$. If the process is not phase matched, the driving polarization at $\omega$ goes in and out of phase with generated wave $E(2\omega)$ and conversion oscillates as $\sin(\Delta k\ell/2)$. The coherence length is defined as $\ell_c = \frac{\pi}{\Delta k}$. It does not pay to use a nonlinear crystal much longer than the coherence length.

In the next section, we will discuss the practical applications of second harmonic generation in nonlinear optics.

#### 7.2c Applications of Second Harmonic Generation

Second harmonic generation (SHG) has a wide range of applications in nonlinear optics. It is a powerful tool for studying the properties of nonlinear materials and for generating coherent light sources. In this section, we will explore some of these applications.

##### Coherent Light Sources

One of the most significant applications of SHG is in the generation of coherent light sources. The second harmonic wave generated in a nonlinear crystal is coherent with the fundamental wave, meaning that it has the same phase and frequency. This property makes SHG an ideal method for generating coherent light sources.

For example, in the field of laser physics, SHG is used to generate ultra-short pulses with durations in the femtosecond range. These pulses are essential for many applications, including high-speed data transmission and precision machining.

##### Nonlinear Material Studies

SHG is also a powerful tool for studying the properties of nonlinear materials. The second-order nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$ is a measure of the nonlinear response of a material system to an applied electromagnetic field. By studying the SHG signal, we can gain insights into the nonlinear properties of a material.

For instance, the phase-matching condition $\Delta k = 0$ can be used to determine the birefringence of a material. Birefringence is a measure of the difference in the refractive indices of a material for light polarized along different axes.

##### Optical Parametric Oscillation

Another important application of SHG is in the field of optical parametric oscillation. In this process, a nonlinear crystal is pumped by a strong beam at frequency $\omega_p$. The crystal then generates a signal beam at frequency $\omega_s$ and an idler beam at frequency $\omega_i$, such that $\omega_p = \omega_s + \omega_i$.

The SHG process plays a crucial role in this process. The signal and idler beams are generated by the second harmonic generation of the pump beam. The phase-matching condition $\Delta k = 0$ ensures that the signal and idler beams are in phase, leading to efficient generation of these beams.

In conclusion, second harmonic generation is a versatile and powerful tool in the field of nonlinear optics. Its applications range from the generation of coherent light sources to the study of nonlinear materials and the operation of optical parametric oscillators.




#### 7.2c Practical Applications

Second harmonic generation (SHG) has a wide range of practical applications in various fields, including telecommunications, imaging, and sensing. In this section, we will explore some of these applications in more detail.

##### Telecommunications

In telecommunications, SHG is used in the generation of coherent light sources. The second harmonic generation process can be used to double the frequency of a laser source, providing a means to generate light at higher frequencies. This is particularly useful in optical communication systems, where high-speed data transmission requires light sources with high frequencies.

##### Imaging

SHG is also used in imaging techniques, particularly in the field of microscopy. By using SHG, it is possible to generate images with high resolution and contrast, which can be particularly useful in the study of biological samples. The nonlinear nature of SHG allows for the generation of images with high contrast, making it a powerful tool for imaging in various fields.

##### Sensing

SHG is used in sensing applications, particularly in the detection of surface defects and thin films. The nonlinear nature of SHG allows for the detection of small changes in the refractive index of a material, which can be used to detect surface defects or changes in the thickness of a thin film. This makes SHG a powerful tool in the quality control of thin film deposition processes.

##### Nonlinear Crystals

#### 7.3a Introduction to Optical Parametric Oscillators

Optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) are a type of nonlinear optical device that generate light through a process known as parametric amplification. This process involves the interaction of three waves - a pump wave, a signal wave, and an idler wave - in a nonlinear optical medium. The OPO is a key component in many advanced optical systems, including quantum random number generators and sources of squeezed light.

#### 7.3b Parametric Amplification

Parametric amplification is a nonlinear process that involves the interaction of three waves in a nonlinear medium. The pump wave, which is typically a high-power wave, interacts with the signal wave and the idler wave in the medium. This interaction leads to the generation of new waves, with frequencies that are different from those of the original waves. The process can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\omega_p &= \omega_s + \omega_i \\
\omega_p &= 2\omega_s \\
\end{align*}
$$

where $\omega_p$ is the frequency of the pump wave, $\omega_s$ is the frequency of the signal wave, and $\omega_i$ is the frequency of the idler wave.

#### 7.3c Degenerate and Non-Degenerate OPOs

There are two types of OPOs: degenerate and non-degenerate. In a degenerate OPO, the signal and idler waves have the same frequency, while in a non-degenerate OPO, they have different frequencies. The choice between these two types depends on the specific requirements of the optical system.

#### 7.3d Applications of OPOs

OPOs have a wide range of applications in advanced optical systems. They are used as sources of squeezed light, which is light with a very low level of quantum noise. This is particularly useful in quantum information processing and quantum communication. OPOs are also used in quantum random number generation, where they provide a source of truly random numbers.

#### 7.3e Four-Wave Mixing

Four-wave mixing (FWM) is a nonlinear process that involves the interaction of four waves in a nonlinear medium. It is a key process in the operation of OPOs. FWM finds applications in optical phase conjugation, parametric amplification, supercontinuum generation, Vacuum Ultraviolet light generation, and in microresonator based frequency comb generation.

#### 7.3f Parametric Amplifiers and Oscillators

Parametric amplifiers and oscillators based on four-wave mixing use the third order nonlinearity, as opposed to most typical parametric oscillators which use the second-order nonlinearity. This makes them particularly useful in applications where high gain and bandwidth are required.

#### 7.3g Quantum Optical Applications

In the quantum optical regime, FWM has shown promise in the generation of single photons, correlated photon pairs, squeezed light, and entangled photons. These applications are at the forefront of quantum information processing and quantum communication.

#### 7.3h Conclusion

In conclusion, optical parametric oscillators are a key component in many advanced optical systems. They provide a means to generate light with unique properties, such as squeezed light and entangled photons, which are essential for quantum information processing and quantum communication. The underlying process of parametric amplification, which involves the interaction of three waves in a nonlinear medium, is a fundamental aspect of OPO operation.

OPOs are also used in the generation of supercontinuum light, which is light that spans a wide range of frequencies. This is achieved through the process of four-wave mixing (FWM), which is a nonlinear process that involves the interaction of four waves in a nonlinear medium. FWM finds applications in optical phase conjugation, parametric amplification, supercontinuum generation, Vacuum Ultraviolet light generation, and in microresonator based frequency comb generation.

#### 7.3b.2 Principles of OPO Operation

The operation of an OPO is based on the principles of parametric amplification. This is a nonlinear process that involves the interaction of three waves in a nonlinear medium. The pump wave, which is typically a high-power wave, interacts with the signal wave and the idler wave in the medium. This interaction leads to the generation of new waves, with frequencies that are different from those of the original waves.

The OPO consists essentially of an optical resonator and a nonlinear optical crystal. The optical resonator serves to resonate at least one of signal and idler waves. In the nonlinear optical crystal, the pump, signal and idler waves overlap. The interaction between these three waves leads to amplitude gain for signal and idler waves (parametric amplification) and a corresponding deamplification of the pump wave. The gain allows the resonating wave(s) (signal or idler or both) to oscillate in the resonator, compensating the loss that the resonating wave(s) experience(s) at each round-trip. This loss includes the loss due to outcoupling by one of the resonator mirrors, which provides the desired output wave. Since the (relative) loss is independent of the pump power, but the gain is dependent on pump power, at low pump power there is insufficient gain to support oscillation. Oscillation occurs only when the pump power exceeds a threshold. Above the threshold, the OPO operates in a regime of self-sustained oscillation, where the pump power is no longer required to maintain oscillation.

#### 7.3b.3 Degenerate and Non-Degenerate OPOs

There are two types of OPOs: degenerate and non-degenerate. In a degenerate OPO, the signal and idler waves have the same frequency, while in a non-degenerate OPO, they have different frequencies. The choice between these two types depends on the specific requirements of the optical system.

In a degenerate OPO, the signal and idler waves are in phase with each other, leading to constructive interference and a higher gain. This results in a more efficient generation of light. However, the frequency of the generated light is fixed, which can limit the applications of the OPO.

In a non-degenerate OPO, the signal and idler waves have different frequencies, leading to a wider range of possible frequencies for the generated light. This makes non-degenerate OPOs more versatile, but the gain is lower due to the phase mismatch between the signal and idler waves.

#### 7.3b.4 Conclusion

In conclusion, optical parametric oscillators play a crucial role in the field of nonlinear optics. They provide a means to generate light with frequencies that are difficult to access with traditional light sources, and their versatility makes them useful in a wide range of applications. The principles behind their operation, including parametric amplification and four-wave mixing, are fundamental to understanding the behavior of light in nonlinear media.




#### 7.3c Practical Applications

In quantum information processing, squeezed light is used to perform quantum operations on quantum systems. These operations are crucial for tasks such as quantum key distribution, quantum teleportation, and quantum cryptography. OPOs provide a reliable and efficient source of squeezed light for these applications.

In quantum communication, OPOs are used to generate entangled photons, which are pairs of photons that are correlated in such a way that any measurement on one photon immediately determines the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. This property is used in quantum key distribution, where the entangled photons are used to generate a secret key that can be used for secure communication.

#### 7.3c.2 Vacuum Ultraviolet Light Generation

OPOs are also used in the generation of Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV) light. VUV light is light with a wavelength shorter than 100 nanometers, which is a region of the electromagnetic spectrum that is difficult to access with traditional light sources.

The generation of VUV light with OPOs is achieved through the process of four-wave mixing (FWM), which is a nonlinear process that involves the interaction of four waves in a nonlinear medium. This process allows for the generation of VUV light with high efficiency, making OPOs a valuable tool in applications that require VUV light, such as surface cleaning and sterilization.

#### 7.3c.3 Other Applications

Apart from the above-mentioned applications, OPOs also find use in other areas such as microresonator based frequency comb generation, optical phase conjugation, and parametric amplification. These applications take advantage of the unique properties of OPOs, such as their ability to generate light with different frequencies and their high efficiency.

In conclusion, OPOs are a versatile tool in the field of nonlinear optics, with a wide range of practical applications.

## Chapter: Chapter 8: Nonlinear Dynamics

### Introduction

In the realm of electromagnetism, the study of nonlinear dynamics is a fascinating and complex field. This chapter, Chapter 8: Nonlinear Dynamics, delves into the intricacies of this subject, providing a comprehensive understanding of the principles and applications of nonlinear dynamics in electromagnetism.

Nonlinear dynamics is a branch of mathematics that deals with systems whose behavior is not directly proportional to their inputs. In the context of electromagnetism, this nonlinearity can manifest in various ways, such as in the interaction of electromagnetic fields with matter, the behavior of electromagnetic waves in different media, and the response of electromagnetic systems to external stimuli.

The study of nonlinear dynamics is crucial in many areas of electromagnetism. For instance, it is essential in the design and analysis of electromagnetic devices and systems, such as antennas, waveguides, and resonators. It also plays a significant role in the understanding of electromagnetic phenomena, such as the generation and propagation of electromagnetic waves, the interaction of light with matter, and the behavior of electromagnetic fields in complex media.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental concepts of nonlinear dynamics, including nonlinear systems, stability, bifurcations, and chaos. We will also discuss the application of these concepts in various areas of electromagnetism. The mathematical expressions and equations in this chapter will be formatted using the TeX and LaTeX style syntax, rendered using the MathJax library. For example, inline math will be written as `$y_j(n)$` and equations as `$$\Delta w = ...$$`.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of nonlinear dynamics and its role in electromagnetism. You should be able to apply these concepts to analyze and design electromagnetic systems, and to understand and predict the behavior of electromagnetic phenomena.




#### 7.4a Introduction to Four-wave Mixing

Four-wave mixing (FWM) is a nonlinear optical process that involves the interaction of four waves in a nonlinear medium. This process is a key component in many advanced optical systems, including optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) and Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV) light generation.

In FWM, four waves with different frequencies and wave vectors interact in a nonlinear medium. The process can be described by the following equations:

$$
\Delta w = ...
$$

where $\Delta w$ is the change in the wave vector, and $k$ is the wave vector. The process of FWM can be understood in terms of the multiple-prism dispersion theory, which provides explicit second-order equations directly applicable to the design of prismatic pulse compressors.

The FWM process can be used to generate VUV light with high efficiency. This is achieved by choosing conditions such that the frequencies of the four waves satisfy the phase-matching condition, which determines which of the generated waves is the dominant. By choosing conditions such that $\omega = \omega_1 + \omega_2 - \omega_3$ and $k = k_1 + k_2 - k_3$, this gives a polarization field:

$$
P = \chi^{(3)}E_1E_2E_3^*
$$

This is the generating field for the phase-conjugate beam, $E_4$. Its direction is given by $k_4 = k_1 + k_2 - k_3$.

FWM finds applications in optical phase conjugation, parametric amplification, supercontinuum generation, Vacuum Ultraviolet light generation, and in microresonator based frequency comb generation. Parametric amplifiers and oscillators based on four-wave mixing use the third order nonlinearity, as opposed to most typical parametric oscillators which use the second-order nonlinearity.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the principles and applications of FWM, exploring its role in quantum information processing, quantum communication, and VUV light generation.

#### 7.4b Nonlinear Susceptibility and Nonlinear Polarization

The nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as $\chi^{(n)}$, is a key parameter in the study of nonlinear optics. It describes the relationship between the induced polarization and the electric field in a medium. In the context of four-wave mixing, the nonlinear susceptibility plays a crucial role in the generation of VUV light.

The nonlinear polarization, $P$, is given by the equation:

$$
P = \chi^{(n)}E
$$

where $E$ is the electric field. The nonlinear susceptibility, $\chi^{(n)}$, is a tensor of rank $n$, and it describes the response of the medium to the $n$th order of the electric field. In the case of four-wave mixing, we are interested in the third order nonlinearity, which is described by the tensor $\chi^{(3)}$.

The nonlinear susceptibility is a complex quantity, and it can be decomposed into real and imaginary parts:

$$
\chi^{(n)} = \chi^{(n)}_r + j\chi^{(n)}_i
$$

The real part, $\chi^{(n)}_r$, describes the energy absorption and dispersion in the medium, while the imaginary part, $\chi^{(n)}_i$, describes the energy gain and phase change.

In the context of four-wave mixing, the nonlinear susceptibility plays a crucial role in the generation of VUV light. The process of four-wave mixing involves the interaction of four waves with different frequencies and wave vectors in a nonlinear medium. The nonlinear susceptibility determines the efficiency of this process, and it is responsible for the generation of VUV light with high efficiency.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the principles and applications of four-wave mixing, exploring its role in quantum information processing, quantum communication, and VUV light generation.

#### 7.4c Phase Matching and Group Velocity Dispersion

Phase matching is a critical concept in the study of nonlinear optics, particularly in the context of four-wave mixing. It refers to the condition where the phase of the generated wave matches the phase of the pump wave. This condition is necessary for efficient energy transfer and for the generation of a stable beam.

The phase matching condition can be expressed as:

$$
\Delta k = k_1 + k_2 - k_3 - k_4 = 0
$$

where $k_1$, $k_2$, $k_3$, and $k_4$ are the wave vectors of the four waves involved in the mixing process. This condition ensures that the four waves are in phase at the nonlinear medium, leading to efficient energy transfer.

However, achieving perfect phase matching is often challenging due to the dispersion of the medium. Dispersion refers to the dependence of the refractive index on the wavelength of the light. In a dispersive medium, the phase velocity of light depends on its wavelength, leading to a mismatch in the phase of the waves.

Group velocity dispersion (GVD) is a measure of the dispersion of a medium. It is defined as the change in the group velocity of light with respect to wavelength. The GVD can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
GVD = \frac{d^2n}{d\lambda^2}
$$

where $n$ is the refractive index and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light. A positive GVD indicates that the group velocity increases with increasing wavelength, while a negative GVD indicates the opposite.

In the context of four-wave mixing, the GVD plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency of the process. A medium with a large GVD can cause significant phase mismatch, leading to a reduction in the efficiency of the mixing process. Therefore, understanding and controlling the GVD is essential for optimizing the four-wave mixing process.

In the next section, we will explore some of the techniques used to achieve phase matching in four-wave mixing, including the use of birefringent crystals and quasi-phase matching.

#### 7.4d Quasi-phase Matching and Nonlinear Crystals

Quasi-phase matching (QPM) is a technique used to overcome the limitations of phase matching in nonlinear optics. It allows for efficient nonlinear interactions to occur even when the phase matching condition is not perfectly met. This is achieved by periodically modulating the nonlinear coefficient of the medium, thereby creating a periodic variation in the phase mismatch.

The QPM technique can be understood in terms of the Fourier series expansion of the nonlinear coefficient. The nonlinear coefficient, $\chi^{(n)}$, can be expressed as:

$$
\chi^{(n)} = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} \chi^{(n)}_m e^{jm\Delta kz}
$$

where $\chi^{(n)}_m$ are the Fourier coefficients, $\Delta k$ is the phase mismatch, and $z$ is the propagation direction. The QPM technique involves modulating the nonlinear coefficient with a periodic function, such that the Fourier coefficients $\chi^{(n)}_m$ are non-zero only for certain values of $m$. This results in a periodic variation in the phase mismatch, which can be used to achieve quasi-phase matching.

The QPM technique has been successfully applied in a variety of nonlinear optics applications, including four-wave mixing, second harmonic generation, and parametric amplification. It has also been used in the design of nonlinear crystals for these applications.

Nonlinear crystals are materials that exhibit nonlinear optical behavior, such as second-order and third-order nonlinearities. These crystals are used in a variety of applications, including frequency conversion, parametric amplification, and four-wave mixing. The choice of crystal depends on the specific requirements of the application, including the wavelength of the light, the power level, and the desired efficiency.

Some common types of nonlinear crystals include lithium niobate (LiNbO3), potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP), and beta-barium borate (BBO). These crystals have different nonlinear coefficients and dispersion properties, which make them suitable for different applications.

In the next section, we will explore some of the specific applications of four-wave mixing, including optical parametric oscillation and Vacuum Ultraviolet light generation.

## Chapter: Chapter 8: Nonlinear Wave Equations

### Introduction

In the realm of electromagnetism, the study of nonlinear wave equations is a fascinating and complex field. This chapter, Chapter 8: Nonlinear Wave Equations, delves into the intricacies of these equations, providing a comprehensive understanding of their principles and applications.

Nonlinear wave equations are mathematical representations of the propagation of waves in nonlinear media. Unlike linear wave equations, which describe the behavior of waves in linear media, nonlinear wave equations account for the nonlinear nature of many physical systems. This nonlinearity can lead to a rich variety of phenomena, including solitons, chaos, and pattern formation, which are not found in linear systems.

The chapter begins by introducing the basic concepts of nonlinear wave equations, including the nonlinear Schrödinger equation and the nonlinear wave equation in Maxwell's electrodynamics.

In telecommunications, FWM is used in the generation of Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV) light. VUV light is used in various applications, including the sterilization of medical equipment and the detection of certain gases. The generation of VUV light using FWM is achieved by choosing conditions such that the frequencies of the four waves satisfy the phase-matching condition. This allows for the efficient generation of VUV light with high power.

FWM is also used in the generation of supercontinuum light, which is a broad spectrum of light that spans the entire visible spectrum. This is achieved by passing a high-intensity pulse of light through a nonlinear medium, where the FWM process can generate a wide range of frequencies. This is particularly useful in telecommunications, where supercontinuum light can be used for wavelength division multiplexing, allowing for the transmission of multiple signals simultaneously.

Entangled photons are pairs of photons that are correlated in such a way that the state of one photon cannot be described without considering the state of the other photon. This property makes entangled photons useful for quantum communication and cryptography.

The generation of entangled photons using FWM is achieved by passing two photons of different frequencies through a nonlinear medium. The FWM process can then generate a third photon that is entangled with the two original photons. This process can be repeated to generate a larger number of entangled photons.

##### Material Processing

In material processing, FWM is used in the generation of high-intensity pulses of light. These pulses can be used for various applications, including the ablation of materials and the generation of plasmas. The high intensity of the pulses is achieved by focusing the light into a very small spot, which can be achieved using the phase-matching condition in FWM.

#### 7.5a Introduction to Kerr Effect

The Kerr effect, named after the British physicist John Kerr, is a nonlinear optical phenomenon that describes the change in the polarization of light as it passes through a nonlinear medium. This effect is particularly important in the field of nonlinear optics due to its ability to generate second-harmonic light, which is light with a frequency that is twice that of the incident light.

The Kerr effect is a third-order nonlinear process, meaning that the polarization of the output light is dependent on the cube of the electric field of the incident light. This is in contrast to the second-order nonlinear processes such as the Faraday effect and the Cotton-Mouton effect, which are dependent on the square of the electric field.

The Kerr effect can be described mathematically by the following equation:

$$
P = \epsilon_0 \chi^{(3)} E^3
$$

where $P$ is the polarization, $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, $\chi^{(3)}$ is the third-order electric susceptibility, and $E$ is the electric field.

The Kerr effect is particularly useful in the generation of second-harmonic light, which is achieved by passing light through a nonlinear medium with a high third-order electric susceptibility. The Kerr effect can also be used to generate other higher-order harmonics, such as third-harmonic light, by passing light through a medium with a high fifth-order electric susceptibility.

The third-order electric susceptibility, $\chi^{(3)}$, is a measure of the nonlinearity of a material, and it is typically measured in units of meters per joule per cubic meter.

This chapter will provide a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts of quantum optics, including the wave-particle duality of light, the quantum nature of light, and the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement.

The chapter will begin by exploring the wave-particle duality of light, a concept that has been central to the development of quantum mechanics. This duality, which states that light can behave as both a wave and a particle, is fundamental to our understanding of quantum optics. We will delve into the historical development of this concept, from the early experiments of Thomas Young and Augustin-Jean Fresnel to the modern quantum mechanical interpretation of light.

Next, we will explore the quantum nature of light, which is a key concept in quantum optics. This includes the concept of photons, the quantum particles of light, and their unique properties. We will also discuss the quantum mechanical description of light, including the Schrödinger equation for light and the concept of quantum states.

Quantum superposition is the principle that a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously, while quantum entanglement is the phenomenon where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be described without considering the state of the other particles, even if they are separated by large distances.

Finally, we will discuss some of the applications of quantum optics, including quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum sensing. These applications are at the forefront of modern technology and have the potential to revolutionize many areas of science and technology.

This chapter aims to provide a solid foundation in the principles of quantum optics, preparing the reader for more advanced topics in this exciting field. We will strive to present these concepts in a clear and accessible manner, with a focus on physical intuition and real-world applications.




### Subsection: 8.1a Introduction to Coherent States

Coherent states are a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, particularly in the field of quantum optics. They are a special type of quantum state that describes a system in which all the particles are in the same state, or are coherent with each other. This concept is closely related to the classical concept of a coherent signal, where all the particles of the signal are in phase with each other.

In the context of quantum optics, coherent states are often used to describe the state of a laser beam. In a laser, the atoms are excited to a higher energy level and then stimulated to emit light. The emitted light is in a coherent state, meaning that all the photons are in the same state and are coherent with each other. This is what gives lasers their unique properties, such as the ability to produce a highly coherent beam of light.

The mathematical description of coherent states is based on the concept of a coherent state basis. This is a set of states that are used to represent any state in the Hilbert space. The coherent state basis is defined as follows:

$$
|z\rangle = e^{-|z|^2/2}e^{z a^\dagger}|0\rangle
$$

where $z$ is a complex number, $a^\dagger$ is the creation operator, and $|0\rangle$ is the vacuum state. The coherent state basis is a complete orthonormal basis, meaning that any state in the Hilbert space can be represented as a linear combination of the coherent states.

The coherent state basis has several important properties. For example, it is a Gaussian basis, meaning that the states are concentrated around the point $z=0$ and become more spread out as $|z|$ increases. This property is similar to the Gaussian distribution in classical statistics.

Another important property of the coherent state basis is that it is overcomplete. This means that there are more coherent states than there are states in the Hilbert space. This is a consequence of the fact that the coherent states are not orthogonal to each other. However, this overcompleteness can be useful in certain applications, such as in the construction of resolution of the identity.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the properties of coherent states and explore some of their applications in quantum optics.




### Subsection: 8.1b Coherent States in Quantum Optics

In quantum optics, coherent states play a crucial role in the description of light. They are used to describe the state of a laser beam, as well as the state of light in various quantum optical systems. In this section, we will explore the properties of coherent states in quantum optics and their applications.

#### 8.1b.1 Coherent States and Laser Beams

As mentioned earlier, coherent states are used to describe the state of a laser beam. In a laser, the atoms are excited to a higher energy level and then stimulated to emit light. The emitted light is in a coherent state, meaning that all the photons are in the same state and are coherent with each other. This is what gives lasers their unique properties, such as the ability to produce a highly coherent beam of light.

The mathematical description of a laser beam in terms of coherent states is given by the Schrödinger equation:

$$
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi(t)\rangle = \hat{H}|\psi(t)\rangle
$$

where $|\psi(t)\rangle$ is the state vector of the laser beam, $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, and $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant. The Hamiltonian operator describes the energy of the laser beam and is given by:

$$
\hat{H} = \frac{\hat{p}^2}{2m} + V(x)
$$

where $\hat{p}$ is the momentum operator, $m$ is the mass of the photons, and $V(x)$ is the potential energy of the laser beam.

#### 8.1b.2 Coherent States and Quantum Optical Systems

In addition to their use in describing laser beams, coherent states are also used in various quantum optical systems. These systems include quantum wells, quantum wires, and quantum dots. In these systems, the coherent states are used to describe the state of the confined light, which is often in a coherent state due to the confinement of the system.

The use of coherent states in these systems allows for a more intuitive understanding of the behavior of light. For example, in a quantum well, the confined light can be described as a coherent state, which allows for a better understanding of the behavior of the light in the well. This is particularly useful in the design and analysis of quantum optical devices.

#### 8.1b.3 Coherent States and Quantum Information

Coherent states also play a crucial role in quantum information theory. In quantum information theory, coherent states are used to describe the state of quantum bits, or qubits. These qubits are the fundamental units of quantum information, and their state can be described using coherent states.

The use of coherent states in quantum information theory allows for a more intuitive understanding of the behavior of qubits. For example, the state of a qubit can be represented as a coherent state, which allows for a better understanding of the behavior of the qubit. This is particularly useful in the design and analysis of quantum information systems.

In conclusion, coherent states are a fundamental concept in quantum optics, with applications ranging from laser beams to quantum information theory. Their use allows for a more intuitive understanding of the behavior of light and quantum systems, making them an essential tool in the field of quantum optics.

### Subsection: 8.2a Introduction to Squeezed States

In the previous section, we explored the concept of coherent states and their practical applications. In this section, we will delve into another important concept in quantum optics - squeezed states. Squeezed states are a type of quantum state that exhibit reduced quantum noise in one of the two conjugate variables, while maintaining a certain level of uncertainty in the other. This property makes squeezed states particularly useful in precision measurements and quantum information processing.

#### 8.2a.1 Definition of Squeezed States

Squeezed states are a type of quantum state that exhibit reduced quantum noise in one of the two conjugate variables, while maintaining a certain level of uncertainty in the other. This property is achieved by applying a squeezing operator to a coherent state. The squeezing operator is defined as:

$$
S(z) = \exp\left(\frac{1}{2}(z^* a^2 - z a^{\dagger 2})\right)
$$

where $z$ is a complex number, $a$ is the annihilation operator, and $a^{\dagger}$ is the creation operator. The squeezing operator acts on the coherent state $| \alpha \rangle$ to produce the squeezed state $| \alpha, r \rangle$, where $r$ is the squeezing parameter. The squeezed state is defined as:

$$
| \alpha, r \rangle = S(z) | \alpha \rangle
$$

The squeezing parameter $r$ is related to the squeezing operator $S(z)$ as:

$$
r = \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( \frac{1 + |z|^2}{1 - |z|^2} \right)
$$

The squeezed state $| \alpha, r \rangle$ is a superposition of coherent states, each with a different amplitude and phase. The amplitude and phase of each coherent state in the superposition are determined by the squeezing parameter $r$ and the complex number $z$.

#### 8.2a.2 Properties of Squeezed States

Squeezed states exhibit reduced quantum noise in one of the two conjugate variables, while maintaining a certain level of uncertainty in the other. This property is known as the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, which states that it is impossible to simultaneously measure the position and momentum of a particle with infinite precision. In the case of squeezed states, the uncertainty in one variable is reduced at the expense of increasing the uncertainty in the other.

The reduced quantum noise in squeezed states is particularly useful in precision measurements. By measuring the conjugate variable with reduced noise, we can achieve a higher precision in the measurement. This property is exploited in various applications, such as quantum metrology and quantum information processing.

#### 8.2a.3 Squeezed States in Quantum Information Processing

In quantum optics, squeezed states play a crucial role in various applications such as quantum information processing, quantum cryptography, and precision measurements. The generation of squeezed states is typically achieved through nonlinear processes, such as parametric down-conversion or four-wave mixing.

#### 8.2b.1 Generation of Squeezed States

The generation of squeezed states involves the use of a nonlinear crystal, where a strong pump beam interacts with a weak signal beam. The nonlinear crystal acts as a nonlinear medium, where the pump beam and the signal beam interact to produce two new beams, known as the idler beam and the conjugate beam. The idler beam and the conjugate beam are entangled, meaning that their quantum states are correlated. This entanglement is what leads to the squeezing of the signal beam.

The generation of squeezed states can be described mathematically as follows. Let $a_s$, $a_i$, and $a_c$ be the annihilation operators for the signal beam, the idler beam, and the conjugate beam, respectively. The total Hamiltonian for the system can be written as:

$$
H = \hbar \omega_p a_p^\dagger a_p + \hbar \omega_s a_s^\dagger a_s + \hbar \omega_i a_i^\dagger a_i + \hbar \omega_c a_c^\dagger a_c + \hbar \chi (a_s^\dagger a_i^\dagger a_p a_c + a_s a_i a_p^\dagger a_c^\dagger)
$$

where $\omega_p$, $\omega_s$, $\omega_i$, and $\omega_c$ are the frequencies of the pump beam, the signal beam, the idler beam, and the conjugate beam, respectively, and $\chi$ is the coupling strength between the beams.

#### 8.2b.2 Squeezed States in Quantum Information Processing

Squeezed states are particularly useful in quantum information processing, where they can be used to perform precision measurements and to create entangled states. In quantum cryptography, squeezed states can be used to generate secure communication channels, as they allow for the detection of eavesdropping.

This is achieved by measuring the conjugate variable of the squeezed state, which exhibits reduced quantum noise. This property is known as the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, which states that it is impossible to measure two conjugate variables with arbitrary precision simultaneously.

In conclusion, squeezed states play a crucial role in quantum optics, with applications ranging from quantum information processing to precision measurements. Their generation and manipulation require a deep understanding of quantum mechanics and nonlinear processes, making them a fascinating topic for advanced study in electromagnetism.




#### 8.2c Practical Applications

#### 8.3a Introduction to Entangled States

Entangled states are a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, and they play a crucial role in quantum information processing and communication. In this section, we will introduce the concept of entangled states and discuss their properties and applications.

#### 8.3a.1 Definition of Entangled States

An entangled state is a quantum state that cannot be written as a product of individual states. In other words, the state of a system of entangled particles cannot be described by the state of each particle individually. This is in stark contrast to classical systems, where the state of a system can always be described by the state of each individual component.

Mathematically, an entangled state can be represented as a superposition of product states. For example, consider two particles A and B in a state $|\psi\rangle = \sum_{x}\sqrt{p(x)}|x_{A}\rangle|x_{B}\rangle$, where the coefficients $p(x)$ form a probability distribution and thus are positive valued and sum to unity. The tensor product of this state is then $|\psi\rangle^{\otimes m} = \sum_{x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{m}}\sqrt{p(x_{1}) p(x_{2}) \dots p(x_{m})}|x_{1A} x_{2A} \dots x_{mA}\rangle | x_{1B} x_{2B} \dots x_{mB}\rangle$.

#### 8.3a.2 Properties of Entangled States

Entangled states have several unique properties that make them useful in quantum information processing and communication. One of these properties is non-locality, which means that the state of one particle cannot be determined without measuring the other particle, even if they are separated by large distances. This property is a direct consequence of the non-commutative nature of quantum mechanics.

Another important property of entangled states is their resistance to decoherence. Decoherence is a phenomenon in quantum mechanics where a system loses its quantum properties when interacting with its environment. Entangled states, however, are less susceptible to decoherence due to their non-local nature. This makes them ideal for long-distance communication and information processing.

#### 8.3a.3 Applications of Entangled States

Entangled states have a wide range of applications in quantum information processing and communication. One of the most well-known applications is quantum key distribution (QKD), which uses the non-local nature of entangled states to securely distribute cryptographic keys. QKD is resistant to eavesdropping, as any attempt to intercept the key will disturb the entangled state and be detected by the sender and receiver.

Entangled states also play a crucial role in quantum teleportation, where the state of one particle can be transferred to another particle without physically moving the particle itself. This is made possible by exploiting the non-local nature of entangled states.

In addition, entangled states are used in quantum computing, where they allow for the creation of quantum gates and the manipulation of quantum information. They are also used in quantum metrology, where they enable precise measurements of physical quantities.

In conclusion, entangled states are a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics with a wide range of applications. Their unique properties make them essential for the development of quantum technologies and the advancement of our understanding of quantum mechanics. In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of entanglement distillation and its applications in quantum information processing.

In quantum optics, entangled states are often generated by the interaction of light with matter. For example, the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process, where a single photon is split into two entangled photons, is a common method of generating entangled states. The entangled state generated in this process can be represented as $|\psi\rangle = \sum_{x}\sqrt{p(x)}|x_{A}\rangle|x_{B}\rangle$, where the coefficients $p(x)$ form a probability distribution and thus are positive valued and sum to unity.

#### 8.3b.2 Applications of Entangled States in Quantum Optics

Entangled states have several applications in quantum optics. One of the most well-known applications is in quantum cryptography, where entangled states are used to securely transmit information. The non-locality property of entangled states ensures that any attempt to intercept the transmitted information will be detected.

Entangled states are also used in quantum teleportation, a process where the state of a quantum system can be transferred from one location to another without physically moving the system itself. This is achieved by exploiting the non-locality property of entangled states.

In addition, entangled states are used in quantum key distribution, a method of generating and distributing cryptographic keys. The security of this method relies on the principles of quantum mechanics, including the no-cloning theorem and the uncertainty principle.

#### 8.3b.3 Challenges and Future Directions

Despite the many applications of entangled states in quantum optics, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the scalability of these applications. While entangled states can be generated and manipulated at the single-photon level, scaling up to larger systems is still a major challenge.

Developing methods to protect entangled states from noise and decoherence is an active area of research.

In the future, it is expected that advancements in quantum technology will lead to the development of more efficient and robust methods for generating and manipulating entangled states. This will open up new possibilities for applications in quantum information processing and communication.

The entanglement of the state allows for the encoding of information in a way that is not possible with classical systems. For example, the no-cloning theorem, which states that it is impossible to create an exact copy of an unknown quantum state, ensures the security of quantum information.

#### 8.3c.2 Applications of Entangled States in Quantum Information

It leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process and transmit information in ways that are fundamentally different from classical systems. This chapter will delve into the fascinating world of quantum information, exploring its principles, applications, and the challenges it presents.

Quantum information is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, which describe the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level. These principles include superposition, entanglement, and quantum teleportation, which are fundamental to the operation of quantum information systems. Superposition allows quantum systems to exist in multiple states simultaneously, while entanglement enables the creation of highly secure communication channels. Quantum teleportation, a process by which the state of a quantum system can be transmitted from one location to another without physically moving the system itself, is another key principle of quantum information.

In this chapter, we will explore these principles in detail, discussing their implications for the design and operation of quantum information systems. We will also examine the applications of quantum information, including quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum sensing. These applications have the potential to revolutionize various fields, from computing and communication to sensing and metrology.

However, quantum information also presents significant challenges. The fragility of quantum states, for instance, makes it difficult to transmit quantum information over long distances. Furthermore, the principles of quantum information are often counterintuitive, making it challenging to design and implement quantum information systems.

Despite these challenges, the field of quantum information is advancing rapidly, with significant progress in recent years. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to quantum information, equipping readers with the knowledge and tools to understand and contribute to this exciting field.




#### 8.4a Introduction to Quantum Interferometry

Quantum interferometry is a branch of quantum optics that deals with the interference of quantum states. It is a direct application of the principles of quantum mechanics, particularly the concept of superposition, and has led to significant advancements in fields such as quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing.

Quantum interferometry is based on the principle of quantum interference, which is a direct consequence of the wave-like nature of quantum particles. Just as waves can interfere constructively or destructively, quantum states can also interfere, leading to phenomena such as quantum superposition and entanglement.

The mathematical description of quantum interference is given by the Schrödinger equation, which describes the evolution of a quantum system over time. For a quantum mechanical object, the wavefunction solution of the Schrödinger equation is given by $\Psi (x, t)$. The probability of observing the object at position $x$ is then given by $P(x) = |\Psi (x, t)|^2 = \Psi^* (x, t) \Psi (x, t)$, where * indicates complex conjugation.

Quantum interference concerns the issue of this probability when the wavefunction is expressed as a sum or linear superposition of two terms $\Psi (x, t) = \Psi_A (x, t) + \Psi_B (x, t)$. The probability of finding the object at $x$ is then given by:

$$
P(x) = |\Psi (x, t)|^2 = |\Psi_A (x, t)|^2 + |\Psi_B (x, t)|^2 + (\Psi_A^* (x, t) \Psi_B (x, t) + \Psi_A (x, t) \Psi_B^* (x, t))
$$

This equation can be interpreted as the probability of finding the object at $x$ when it is in situation A plus the probability of finding the object at $x$ when it is in situation B plus an extra term, which is called the "quantum interference term". This term can add or subtract from $P(x)$ depending on whether it is positive or negative.

Quantum interferometry has found practical applications in various fields, including quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. In the following sections, we will explore these applications in more detail.

#### 8.4b Quantum Interferometry Techniques

Quantum interferometry techniques are methods used to manipulate and measure quantum states. These techniques are based on the principles of quantum interference and superposition, and they have led to significant advancements in fields such as quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing.

One of the most common quantum interferometry techniques is interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT). This technique has been used in multiple applications, including the study of biological systems, materials science, and quantum optics. iSCAT is a non-linear imaging technique that allows for the detection of single molecules with high sensitivity and resolution. It is based on the principle of quantum interference, where the interference of light waves can be used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of a detected signal.

Another important quantum interferometry technique is quantum key distribution (QKD). This technique is used to securely distribute cryptographic keys between two parties. It is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, particularly the concept of quantum superposition and quantum entanglement. QKD ensures the security of the key distribution process by exploiting the principles of quantum mechanics, such as the no-cloning theorem and the uncertainty principle.

Quantum interferometry also plays a crucial role in quantum sensing. Quantum sensors are devices that can measure physical quantities with high precision. They are used in a variety of applications, including navigation, metrology, and medical imaging. Quantum interferometry techniques, such as quantum lithography and quantum metrology, are used to enhance the sensitivity and resolution of these sensors.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the principles and applications of these quantum interferometry techniques.

#### 8.4c Applications of Quantum Interferometry

Quantum interferometry has found a wide range of applications in various fields, including quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. In this section, we will explore some of these applications in more detail.

##### Quantum Computing

Quantum computing is a field that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computational tasks more efficiently than classical computers. Quantum interferometry plays a crucial role in quantum computing, particularly in the implementation of quantum gates. Quantum gates are the basic building blocks of quantum circuits, and they are used to manipulate quantum states. Quantum interferometry techniques, such as quantum superposition and quantum entanglement, are used to implement these gates.

For example, the controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate is a fundamental quantum gate that flips the second qubit (target) if and only if the first qubit (control) is in the state $|1\rangle$. This operation can be implemented using quantum interferometry techniques. The control qubit and the target qubit are prepared in the state $|0\rangle \otimes |0\rangle$. The control qubit is then sent through a quantum interferometer, where it is superposed with the state $|1\rangle$. The resulting state is $|0\rangle \otimes |0\rangle + |1\rangle \otimes |1\rangle$. The target qubit is then measured in the computational basis, resulting in the desired operation.

##### Quantum Communication

Quantum communication is another important application of quantum interferometry. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a method used to securely distribute cryptographic keys between two parties. Quantum interferometry plays a crucial role in QKD, particularly in the generation of entangled states. These entangled states are used to ensure the security of the key distribution process.

For example, consider two parties, Alice and Bob, who want to distribute a secret key. Alice prepares a pair of entangled particles, each in a superposition of two states. She then sends one particle to Bob and retains the other for herself. Bob measures his particle in one of the two possible bases, and Alice measures her particle in the same basis. The resulting state is a shared secret key, which is the measurement outcome on Alice's particle.

##### Quantum Sensing

Quantum sensing is a field that uses quantum systems to measure physical quantities with high precision. Quantum interferometry plays a crucial role in quantum sensing, particularly in the implementation of quantum sensors. Quantum sensors are used to measure physical quantities, such as time, length, and temperature, with high precision.

For example, consider a quantum sensor used to measure time. The sensor is a superposition of two states, one representing the present time and the other representing the future time. The sensor is then sent through a quantum interferometer, where it is superposed with the state representing the future time. The resulting state is a superposition of the present and future times. The sensor is then measured in the computational basis, resulting in the desired measurement of time.

In conclusion, quantum interferometry is a powerful tool in quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. It allows for the manipulation and measurement of quantum states with high precision, leading to significant advancements in these fields.

#### 8.4b Quantum Interferometry in Quantum Optics

Quantum interferometry in quantum optics is a powerful tool that allows us to manipulate and measure quantum states of light. It is based on the principles of quantum interference, which we have discussed in the previous section. In this section, we will delve deeper into the applications of quantum interferometry in quantum optics, particularly in the context of quantum radar and quantum illumination.

Quantum radar is a technology that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to improve radar systems. Unlike classical radar, which relies on classical light sources, quantum radar uses quantum light sources, such as squeezed light or entangled photons, to illuminate the target. This allows for the detection of very small changes in the target's position, even when it is hidden behind a reflective surface.

One of the key challenges in implementing a quantum radar prototype is the management of the idler pulse, which is ideally jointly detected together with the signal pulse returning from the potential target. This requires the use of a quantum memory with a long coherence time, which can be difficult to achieve. Other solutions may degrade the quantum correlations between signal and idler pulses, potentially reducing the quantum advantage.

Quantum illumination is another application of quantum interferometry in quantum optics. It is a method of transmitting information from one location to another using quantum states of light. Quantum illumination can be used to achieve higher communication rates than classical illumination, particularly in noisy environments.

The design of quantum illumination systems, however, also faces certain limitations. For instance, storing the idler pulse in a delay line using a standard optical fiber would degrade the system and limit the maximum range of a quantum illumination radar to about 11 km. This value should be interpreted as a theoretical limit of this design, not an achievable range.

Other limitations of quantum illumination designs include the fact that they only consider a single polarization, azimuth, elevation, range, and Doppler bin at a time. This makes it difficult to implement a practical quantum illumination system.

Despite these challenges, quantum interferometry in quantum optics continues to be a promising field, with ongoing research aimed at overcoming these limitations and improving the performance of quantum radar and quantum illumination systems.

#### 8.4c Applications of Quantum Interferometry

Quantum interferometry has found numerous applications in quantum optics, particularly in the field of quantum radar and quantum illumination. However, it has also been instrumental in other areas such as quantum computing and quantum communication.

Quantum computing, for instance, relies heavily on quantum interferometry to manipulate quantum states of particles, known as qubits, to perform complex calculations. The principles of quantum interference are used to create superposition states, where a qubit can exist in multiple states simultaneously, and entanglement, where two or more qubits can become correlated in such a way that the state of one qubit cannot be described without considering the state of the other. These properties allow quantum computers to perform calculations much faster than classical computers.

Quantum communication, on the other hand, uses quantum interferometry to transmit information securely. Quantum key distribution (QKD), for example, uses the principles of quantum interference to generate and distribute cryptographic keys. The no-cloning theorem, a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics, ensures that any attempt to intercept the key will be detected, making QKD a highly secure method of communication.

Quantum interferometry has also been used in quantum metrology, a field that aims to improve the precision of measurements beyond the classical limit. This is achieved by using quantum entanglement to create states that are more sensitive to small changes in the system being measured.

In addition to these applications, quantum interferometry has also been used in quantum sensing, quantum imaging, and quantum cryptography. The versatility and power of quantum interferometry make it a fundamental tool in the field of quantum optics.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical foundations of quantum interferometry, exploring concepts such as quantum superposition, quantum entanglement, and the Schrödinger equation.




#### 8.4c Practical Applications

Quantum interferometry has found numerous practical applications in the field of quantum optics. These applications range from quantum radar and quantum illumination, as discussed in the previous section, to quantum cryptography and quantum computing.

Quantum cryptography is a method of secure communication that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics. It is based on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, including the no-cloning theorem and the uncertainty principle. Quantum cryptography allows for the secure transmission of information, as any attempt to intercept the information would alter the quantum state of the transmitted information, thus alerting the sender and receiver of the interception.

Quantum computing is another area where quantum interferometry plays a crucial role. Quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations that are not possible with classical computers. Quantum computers can solve certain problems much more efficiently than classical computers, making them particularly useful in fields such as cryptography and optimization.

Quantum interferometry also plays a key role in the development of quantum sensors. Quantum sensors are devices that use quantum phenomena to measure physical quantities with high precision. Quantum interferometry allows for the manipulation and measurement of quantum states of light, which can be used to create highly sensitive quantum sensors.

### Section: 9.1 Finite-difference Time-domain Method

The Finite-difference Time-domain Method (FDTD) is a numerical technique used to solve Maxwell's equations in electromagnetism. It is a powerful tool for simulating electromagnetic phenomena, particularly in complex geometries and multiscale structures. In this section, we will introduce the FDTD method and discuss its applications and limitations.

#### 9.1a Introduction to Finite-difference Time-domain Method

The FDTD method is a time-domain method, meaning that it solves Maxwell's equations directly in the time domain. This is in contrast to the Finite Element Method (FEM), which is a frequency-domain method. The FDTD method is particularly well-suited for problems involving transient phenomena, such as pulse propagation or nonlinear dynamics.

The FDTD method is based on the Yee grid, a staggered grid where electric and magnetic fields are defined at different points in space and time. This grid allows for the explicit integration of Maxwell's equations, leading to a set of coupled differential equations that can be solved numerically.

The FDTD method is similar to the FDTD method in many respects. Both methods are time-domain methods and both are based on the Yee grid. However, there are some key differences. Unlike the FDTD method, the FDTD method does not require solving a sparse linear system, which can be computationally expensive. Additionally, the FDTD method is easier to implement, as it does not require the sequential computation of time steps.

However, the FDTD method also has its limitations. It is restricted mostly to rectangular structures, which can be circumvented by using a very fine grid mesh or by approximating the effects with surface boundary conditions. Non-uniform gridding can lead to spurious charges at the interface boundary, which can be circumvented by enforcing weak continuity across the interface using basis functions, as is done in FEM.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the FDTD method and discuss its implementation in more detail.

#### 9.1b Yee Grid and Time Advancement

The Yee grid, named after its creator Kenneth C. Yee, is a key component of the Finite-difference Time-domain Method (FDTD). It is a staggered grid where electric and magnetic fields are defined at different points in space and time. This grid allows for the explicit integration of Maxwell's equations, leading to a set of coupled differential equations that can be solved numerically.

The Yee grid is a three-dimensional grid, with electric and magnetic fields defined at the vertices of the grid. The electric field $E$ and the magnetic field $H$ are defined at the vertices of the grid, while the electric current density $J$ and the electric displacement $D$ are defined at the edges of the grid. This staggered arrangement allows for the explicit integration of Maxwell's equations.

The time advancement in the Yee grid is achieved through a process known as time marching. In this process, the fields at each time step are updated sequentially, starting from the electric fields and ending with the magnetic fields. This process is repeated for each time step, leading to the propagation of electromagnetic waves through the grid.

The time marching process can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
E(t+\Delta t) &= E(t) + \Delta t \cdot \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} \\
H(t+\Delta t) &= H(t) + \Delta t \cdot \frac{\partial H}{\partial t} \\
\end{align*}
$$

where $\Delta t$ is the time step, $E(t)$ and $H(t)$ are the electric and magnetic fields at time $t$, and $\frac{\partial E}{\partial t}$ and $\frac{\partial H}{\partial t}$ are the time derivatives of the electric and magnetic fields, respectively.

The Yee grid and time marching process form the basis of the FDTD method. They allow for the explicit integration of Maxwell's equations, leading to a powerful tool for simulating electromagnetic phenomena. However, as with any numerical method, the FDTD method has its limitations. It is restricted mostly to rectangular structures, which can be circumvented by using a very fine grid mesh or by approximating the effects with surface boundary conditions. Non-uniform gridding can lead to spurious charges at the interface boundary, which can be circumvented by enforcing weak continuity across the interface using basis functions, as is done in FEM.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the FDTD method and discuss its implementation in more detail.

#### 9.1c Applications of Finite-difference Time-domain Method

The Finite-difference Time-domain Method (FDTD) has been widely used in various applications due to its ability to accurately simulate electromagnetic phenomena. In this section, we will discuss some of the key applications of FDTD.

##### 9.1c.1 Electromagnetic Wave Propagation

One of the primary applications of FDTD is in the simulation of electromagnetic wave propagation. The Yee grid and time marching process allow for the explicit integration of Maxwell's equations, leading to accurate simulations of wave propagation in various media. This is particularly useful in the design and analysis of antennas, waveguides, and other electromagnetic devices.

##### 9.1c.2 Nonlinear Dynamics

The FDTD method is also well-suited for the simulation of nonlinear dynamics. The explicit integration of Maxwell's equations allows for the accurate representation of nonlinear effects, such as those found in metamaterials and plasmas. This has led to significant advancements in the study of these complex systems.

##### 9.1c.3 Biomedical Applications

FDTD has also found applications in the field of biomedical engineering. For instance, it has been used to simulate the interaction of electromagnetic fields with biological tissues, which is crucial in the design of medical devices such as MRI machines and hyperthermia treatments.

##### 9.1c.4 Other Applications

The FDTD method has been used in a wide range of other applications, including the study of electromagnetic scattering, the analysis of optical fibers, and the design of photonic devices. Its ability to accurately simulate complex electromagnetic phenomena makes it a valuable tool in many areas of research.

In conclusion, the Finite-difference Time-domain Method is a powerful tool for the simulation of electromagnetic phenomena. Its ability to accurately represent complex systems and its wide range of applications make it an essential topic for any advanced study of electromagnetism.




### Subsection: 9.1b Finite-difference Time-domain Method in Electromagnetic Theory and Computation

The Finite-difference Time-domain Method (FDTD) is a powerful tool in the field of electromagnetic theory and computation. It allows for the simulation of complex electromagnetic phenomena, providing insights into the behavior of electromagnetic fields and their interactions with various materials and structures.

#### 9.1b.1 Application of FDTD in Electromagnetic Theory

The FDTD method is particularly useful in the study of electromagnetic theory. It allows for the direct simulation of Maxwell's equations, providing a detailed understanding of the behavior of electromagnetic fields. This is particularly useful in the study of transient phenomena, such as pulse propagation or nonlinear dynamics.

One of the key applications of FDTD in electromagnetic theory is the study of electromagnetic radiation. The FDTD method can be used to simulate the propagation of electromagnetic radiation, providing insights into the behavior of light as it interacts with various materials and structures. This can be particularly useful in the design and analysis of optical devices, such as lenses, filters, and waveguides.

#### 9.1b.2 Limitations of FDTD in Electromagnetic Theory

Despite its power and versatility, the FDTD method does have some limitations in the field of electromagnetic theory. One of the main limitations is its restriction to rectangular structures. This can be circumvented by using a very fine grid mesh, but this increases the computational cost. Additionally, non-uniform gridding can lead to spurious charges at the interface boundary, which can be circumvented by enforcing weak continuity across the interface using basis functions, as is done in FEM.

Another limitation of FDTD is its inability to handle complex geometries and multiscale structures. This can be circumvented by using a very fine grid mesh, but this increases the computational cost. Additionally, the Yee grid, which is used in FDTD, is restricted to rectangular structures. This can be circumvented by using a very fine grid mesh, but this increases the computational cost.

#### 9.1b.3 Comparison with Other Methods

The FDTD method is similar to the Finite Element Method (FEM), though there are some major differences. Unlike the FDTD method, there are no time steps that must be computed sequentially, thus making FDFD easier to implement. However, the FDTD method does not require solving a sparse linear system, which can be computationally expensive. Additionally, model order reduction techniques can be employed to reduce problem size.

FDFD, and FDTD for that matter, does not lend itself well to complex geometries or multiscale structures, as the Yee grid is restricted mostly to rectangular structures. This can be circumvented by either using a very fine grid mesh (which increases computational cost), or by approximating the effects with surface boundary conditions. Non uniform gridding can lead to spurious charges at the interface boundary, as the zero divergence conditions are not maintained when the grid is not uniform along an interface boundary. E and H field continuity can be maintained to circumvent this problem by enforcing weak continuity across the interface using basis functions, as is done in FEM. Perfectly matched layer (PML) boundary conditions can also be used to truncate the grid, and avoid meshing empty space.

By simulating the propagation of electromagnetic radiation, engineers can gain insights into the behavior of light as it interacts with various materials and structures. This can be particularly useful in the design of lenses, filters, and waveguides.

For example, consider the design of a lens. The FDTD method can be used to simulate the propagation of light through the lens, allowing engineers to optimize the lens design for maximum light transmission. This can save time and resources compared to traditional trial-and-error methods.

#### 9.1c.2 Electromagnetic Interference Analysis

Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is a major concern in the design of electronic devices. It can cause malfunctions, data loss, and even safety hazards. The FDTD method can be used to simulate the propagation of electromagnetic fields, allowing engineers to analyze the potential for EMI and design devices that minimize it.

For example, consider the design of a wireless communication device. The FDTD method can be used to simulate the propagation of electromagnetic fields from the device, allowing engineers to identify potential sources of EMI and design the device to minimize it.

It is particularly useful in the field of electromagnetics, where it is known as the Method of Moments (MoM) or abbreviated as MoM. The BEM is applicable to problems for which Green's functions can be calculated, which usually involve fields in linear homogeneous media. This places certain restrictions on the range and generality of problems to which boundary elements can be applied. Nonlinearities can be included in the formulation, although they will generally introduce volume integrals which then require the volume to be discretised before solution can be attempted. A useful technique for treating the volume integral without discretising the volume is the dual-reciprocity method.

The BEM attempts to use the given boundary conditions to fit boundary values into the integral equation. Once this is done, the integral equation can then be used to calculate numerically the solution directly at any desired point in the interior of the solution domain. This is a significant advantage over other methods, as it allows for a more efficient and accurate solution of the problem.

The mathematical basis of the BEM involves the use of Green's functions, which are solutions to the differential equation that describe the effect of a point source on the field. These functions are used to construct the boundary element equation, which is then solved to obtain the solution to the problem.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the theory and computation of the Boundary Element Method, exploring its applications in electromagnetics and its advantages over other methods. We will also discuss the practical aspects of implementing the BEM, including the use of software tools and the interpretation of the results.




#### 9.3b Boundary Element Method in Electromagnetic Theory and Computation

The Boundary Element Method (BEM) has been widely used in the field of electromagnetics due to its ability to provide accurate solutions to problems involving electromagnetic fields. The method is particularly useful in the analysis of electromagnetic devices and systems, as it allows for the efficient computation of the electromagnetic field at any point within the device or system.

The BEM is based on the principle of superposition, which states that the total field at any point is the sum of the individual fields due to each source. In the context of electromagnetics, the sources can be electric charges or currents. The BEM exploits this principle by considering only the boundary conditions, which are the values of the field at the boundaries of the device or system.

The BEM is implemented in a number of software tools, including the popular finite element method (FEM) software. These tools provide a user-friendly interface for defining the geometry of the device or system and the boundary conditions, and then compute the electromagnetic field at any point within the device or system.

The BEM is particularly useful in the analysis of electromagnetic devices and systems due to its ability to provide accurate solutions to problems involving electromagnetic fields. However, it is important to note that the BEM is not without its limitations. For example, it is only applicable to problems for which Green's functions can be calculated, which usually involves fields in linear homogeneous media. Nonlinearities can be included in the formulation, although they will generally introduce volume integrals which then require the volume to be discretised before solution can be attempted.

#### 9.5a Introduction to Fast Multipole Method

The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) is a numerical technique that was developed to speed up the calculation of long-ranged forces in the "n"-body problem. It does this by expanding the system Green's function using a multipole expansion, which allows one to group sources that lie close together and treat them as if they are a single source. This method has been widely used in various fields, including computational electromagnetics, quantum mechanics, and molecular dynamics.

The FMM was first introduced in the context of computational electromagnetics by Leslie Greengard and Vladimir Rokhlin Jr. in 1997. They proposed using the FMM to accelerate the iterative solver in the Method of Moments (MOM), which is a numerical method for solving boundary value problems. The FMM was shown to significantly reduce the required memory and improve the complexity of matrix-vector products, making it a powerful tool for solving large-scale electromagnetic problems.

The FMM algorithm reduces the complexity of matrix-vector multiplication involving a certain type of dense matrix which can arise out of many physical systems. This has expanded the area of applicability of the MOM to far greater problems than were previously possible. The FMM has also been applied for efficiently treating the Coulomb interaction in the Hartree–Fock method and density functional theory calculations in quantum mechanics.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the theory and computation of the Fast Multipole Method. We will start by discussing the basic principles of the FMM, including the multipole expansion and the hierarchical FMM. We will then move on to discuss the implementation of the FMM in the MOM, including the treatment of far-away basis functions and the improvement of the complexity of matrix-vector products. Finally, we will explore some practical applications of the FMM in computational electromagnetics.

#### 9.5b Basic Principles of Fast Multipole Method

The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) is based on the multipole expansion of the vector Helmholtz equation. This expansion allows us to group sources that lie close together and treat them as if they are a single source. The FMM then uses this expansion to speed up the calculation of long-ranged forces.

The FMM is based on the following key principles:

1. **Multipole Expansion**: The system Green's function is expanded using a multipole expansion. This allows us to group sources that lie close together and treat them as if they are a single source.

2. **Hierarchical FMM**: The FMM is applied in a hierarchical manner. This means that the interactions between far-away basis functions are treated using the FMM, while the interactions between nearby basis functions are treated using direct methods. This approach allows for a significant reduction in the required memory and improves the complexity of matrix-vector products.

3. **Matrix-Vector Products**: The FMM improves the complexity of matrix-vector products from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N)$. This is achieved by treating the interactions between far-away basis functions using the FMM, which reduces the number of matrix elements that need to be explicitly stored.

4. **Tolerance Dependence**: The complexity of the FMM is $\mathcal{O}(N\log(1/\varepsilon))$, where $\varepsilon$ is the tolerance. This means that the complexity of the FMM depends on the tolerance, and a smaller tolerance results in a higher complexity.

The FMM has been shown to be a powerful tool for solving large-scale electromagnetic problems. It has been applied in various fields, including computational electromagnetics, quantum mechanics, and molecular dynamics. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the theory and computation of the Fast Multipole Method.

#### 9.5c Practical Applications

1. **Computational Electromagnetics**: The FMM has been widely used in computational electromagnetics to solve Maxwell's equations. The FMM allows for the efficient calculation of electromagnetic fields, which is crucial in the design and analysis of antennas, waveguides, and other electromagnetic devices.

2. **Quantum Mechanics**: In quantum mechanics, the FMM has been used to efficiently treat the Coulomb interaction in the Hartree–Fock method and density functional theory calculations. This has allowed for the simulation of larger systems than were previously possible.

3. **Molecular Dynamics**: The FMM has also been applied in molecular dynamics simulations to efficiently treat long-ranged forces between molecules. This has allowed for the simulation of larger systems and longer simulation times.

4. **Image Processing**: The FMM has been used in image processing to efficiently compute convolutions. This has applications in image enhancement, restoration, and classification.

5. **Computer Graphics**: The FMM has been used in computer graphics to efficiently compute shadows and other lighting effects. This has applications in real-time rendering and virtual reality.

The FMM has proven to be a versatile and powerful tool in a wide range of applications. Its ability to speed up the calculation of long-ranged forces makes it a valuable tool in many areas of science and engineering.

### Section: 10.1a Introduction to Complex Media

In the previous chapters, we have discussed electromagnetic waves propagating in simple, homogeneous media. However, in many practical applications, we encounter media that are complex and inhomogeneous. These media can be characterized by their anisotropy, non-uniformity, and non-linearity. In this section, we will introduce the concept of complex media and discuss their properties.

#### 10.1a.1 Anisotropy

Anisotropy refers to the property of a medium where its physical properties (such as permittivity and permeability) vary with direction. This is in contrast to isotropic media, where these properties are the same in all directions. Anisotropic media are common in many practical applications, such as in optical fibers and certain types of dielectric materials.

The anisotropy of a medium can be described by its dielectric tensor, which is a 3x3 matrix that relates the electric field to the electric displacement. For an isotropic medium, this tensor simplifies to a scalar, the permittivity. However, for an anisotropic medium, the dielectric tensor is more complex and can be represented as a 3x3 matrix.

#### 10.1a.2 Non-Uniformity

Non-uniformity refers to the property of a medium where its physical properties vary with position. This is in contrast to uniform media, where these properties are the same at all points. Non-uniform media are common in many practical applications, such as in inhomogeneous dielectric materials and non-uniform magnetic structures.

The non-uniformity of a medium can be described by its spatial variation of physical properties. For example, the permittivity of a dielectric material can vary with position, leading to a non-uniform medium.

#### 10.1a.3 Non-Linearity

Non-linearity refers to the property of a medium where its physical properties depend on the magnitude of the applied electromagnetic field. This is in contrast to linear media, where the physical properties are independent of the applied field. Non-linear media are common in many practical applications, such as in certain types of dielectric materials and magnetic materials.

The non-linearity of a medium can be described by its response to the applied electromagnetic field. For example, the permittivity of a dielectric material can increase with the applied electric field, leading to a non-linear medium.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the propagation of electromagnetic waves in these complex media, and discuss the techniques for analyzing and designing systems that operate in these media.

$$
\Psi^{+} ({\mathbf r} , t) = \left[ - F_x^{+} + {\rm i} F_y^{+} \\
F_z^{+} \\
F_z^{+} \\
\right]\, \quad 
\Psi^{-} ({\mathbf r} , t) = \left[ - F_x^{-} - {\rm i} F_y^{-} \\

\right]
$$

\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
M_x & 0 \\
0 & M_y \\

- W^{-} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $M_x$ and $M_y$ are the component "M"-matrices, and $\Omega$ and $\beta$ are defined as:

0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}, \quad

0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\

#### 10.2a Introduction to Absorption and Scattering

In the previous sections, we have explored the propagation of electromagnetic waves in complex media. We have seen how these waves interact with different types of media, and how these interactions can be modeled using Maxwell's equations. In this section, we will delve deeper into the topic of electromagnetic absorption and scattering.

Electromagnetic absorption is the process by which an electromagnetic wave is absorbed by a medium, converting its energy into other forms such as heat or chemical energy. This process is governed by the absorption coefficient, which is a measure of the amount of energy absorbed per unit length of the medium. The absorption coefficient is a complex quantity, and its real and imaginary parts represent the energy absorption and phase change, respectively.

On the other hand, electromagnetic scattering is the process by which an electromagnetic wave is deflected or redirected by a medium. This can occur due to various reasons, such as the presence of particles or inhomogeneities in the medium, or the interaction of the wave with the boundary of the medium. The scattering of electromagnetic waves is a crucial phenomenon in many areas of physics and engineering, including radar systems, optical fibers, and medical imaging.

In the following subsections, we will explore these topics in more detail, discussing their theoretical foundations, practical applications, and the latest research developments. We will also introduce some advanced concepts, such as the scattering matrix and the absorption cross-section, and discuss their significance in the study of electromagnetic waves.

#### 10.2b Absorption and Scattering in Different Media

The absorption and scattering of electromagnetic waves depend on the properties of the medium in which they propagate. In this subsection, we will discuss how these properties influence the absorption and scattering of electromagnetic waves.

##### Absorption in Different Media

The absorption of electromagnetic waves is influenced by the dielectric properties of the medium. The dielectric constant, or relative permittivity, of a medium is a measure of its ability to store electrical energy in an electric field. It is defined as the ratio of the electric field in the medium to the electric field in a vacuum for the same applied voltage. The dielectric constant is a complex quantity, and its real and imaginary parts represent the energy storage and energy loss, respectively.

The absorption coefficient, $\alpha$, is related to the dielectric constant by the equation:

$$
\alpha = \frac{1}{\delta} \Im(\epsilon)
$$

where $\delta$ is the skin depth, and $\Im(\epsilon)$ is the imaginary part of the dielectric constant. The skin depth is a measure of the depth at which the electromagnetic wave is attenuated by a factor of $e^{-1}$.

##### Scattering in Different Media

The scattering of electromagnetic waves is influenced by the conductivity of the medium. The conductivity, $\sigma$, is a measure of the ability of a medium to conduct electric current. It is defined as the ratio of the current density to the electric field. The conductivity is a complex quantity, and its real and imaginary parts represent the conduction and polarization, respectively.

The scattering coefficient, $\beta$, is related to the conductivity by the equation:

$$
\beta = \frac{1}{\delta} \Im(\sigma)
$$

where $\delta$ is the skin depth, and $\Im(\sigma)$ is the imaginary part of the conductivity. The scattering coefficient is a measure of the amount of energy scattered per unit length of the medium.

In the next subsection, we will discuss some practical applications of electromagnetic absorption and scattering.

#### 10.2c Applications of Absorption and Scattering

The principles of electromagnetic absorption and scattering have wide-ranging applications in various fields. In this section, we will explore some of these applications, focusing on their relevance to advanced topics in electromagnetism.

##### Absorption in Optical Fibers

Optical fibers are a prime example of a medium where absorption plays a crucial role. The absorption of light in optical fibers is primarily due to impurities and defects in the fiber's glass structure. These impurities and defects can absorb photons, converting their energy into heat. This absorption can limit the transmission distance of optical signals in the fiber, especially at longer wavelengths.

The absorption coefficient, $\alpha$, is a key parameter in the design and operation of optical fibers. It is used to calculate the attenuation of the optical signal as it propagates along the fiber. The attenuation is given by the equation:

$$
A = \int_0^L \alpha(x) dx
$$

where $A$ is the attenuation, $L$ is the length of the fiber, and $\alpha(x)$ is the absorption coefficient at position $x$ along the fiber.

##### Scattering in Radar Systems

Scattering is a fundamental process in radar systems. When a radar wave is scattered by an object, it can be detected by a radar receiver. The scattering cross-section, $\sigma$, is a measure of the amount of radar energy scattered by the object. It is defined as the ratio of the scattered power to the incident power.

The scattering cross-section is related to the radar reflectivity, $R$, by the equation:

$$
\sigma = \frac{4 \pi R}{\lambda^2}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the radar wave. The radar reflectivity is a measure of the amount of radar energy reflected by the object.

##### Absorption and Scattering in Medical Imaging

Absorption and scattering are also important in medical imaging techniques such as X-ray imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In X-ray imaging, the absorption of X-rays by the body is used to create an image. The absorption is proportional to the density of the body tissues, allowing for the visualization of internal structures.

In MRI, the scattering of radio waves by the body is used to create an image. The scattering is proportional to the magnetic properties of the body tissues, providing information about their composition and structure.

In conclusion, the principles of electromagnetic absorption and scattering are fundamental to many areas of advanced electromagnetism. Understanding these principles can lead to significant advancements in these fields.




#### 10.2b Absorption and Scattering in Electromagnetism

In the previous section, we introduced the concepts of electromagnetic absorption and scattering. In this section, we will delve deeper into these topics, focusing on their applications in electromagnetism.

##### Absorption in Electromagnetism

Absorption in electromagnetism is a fundamental process that occurs when an electromagnetic wave interacts with a medium. The absorbed energy can be used to excite the atoms or molecules of the medium, leading to various phenomena such as heating, chemical reactions, and changes in the optical properties of the medium.

The absorption of electromagnetic waves is governed by the absorption coefficient, which is a complex quantity. The real part of the absorption coefficient, often denoted as $\alpha$, represents the energy absorption, while the imaginary part, often denoted as $\beta$, represents the phase change. The absorption coefficient is a function of the frequency of the wave and the properties of the medium, such as its permittivity and permeability.

The absorption of electromagnetic waves can be described by the Beer-Lambert Law, which states that the amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of the absorbing species and the path length of the light through the medium. This law is often expressed as:

$$
A = \alpha \cdot c \cdot l
$$

where $A$ is the absorbance, $\alpha$ is the absorption coefficient, $c$ is the concentration of the absorbing species, and $l$ is the path length of the light through the medium.

##### Scattering in Electromagnetism

Scattering in electromagnetism is another fundamental process that occurs when an electromagnetic wave interacts with a medium. Scattering can occur due to various reasons, such as the presence of particles or inhomogeneities in the medium, or the interaction of the wave with the boundary of the medium.

The scattering of electromagnetic waves can be described by the scattering matrix, often denoted as $S$. The scattering matrix is a complex quantity that relates the incident wave to the scattered wave. It is a function of the properties of the medium and the frequency of the wave.

The scattering of electromagnetic waves can be classified into two types: elastic scattering and inelastic scattering. Elastic scattering, also known as Rayleigh scattering, occurs when the scattered wave has the same frequency as the incident wave. Inelastic scattering, on the other hand, occurs when the scattered wave has a different frequency than the incident wave.

In the next section, we will discuss some advanced concepts in electromagnetism, such as the absorption cross-section and the scattering matrix, and their significance in the study of electromagnetic waves.

## Chapter: Chapter 11: Electromagnetic Induction

### Introduction

Electromagnetic induction is a fundamental concept in the field of electromagnetism, and it is the focus of this chapter. This phenomenon is the basis for many practical applications, including generators, transformers, and induction motors. Understanding electromagnetic induction is crucial for anyone studying or working in the field of electrical engineering.

Electromagnetic induction is the process by which an electric current is generated in a conductor, or a change in the magnetic field around a conductor, due to a changing magnetic field. This phenomenon was first discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831, and it is described by Faraday's law of induction. This law states that the magnitude of the induced electromotive force (emf) in a closed loop is directly proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the loop.

In this chapter, we will delve into the mathematical representation of electromagnetic induction. We will explore the relationship between the induced emf and the rate of change of the magnetic flux, represented by the equation `$\mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}$`. This equation is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism, and it is used to describe the operation of many practical devices.

We will also discuss the concept of mutual inductance, which describes the relationship between two coils of wire. This concept is crucial for understanding the operation of transformers, which are devices that transfer electrical energy from one circuit to another through electromagnetic induction.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of electromagnetic induction and its applications. You should be able to apply Faraday's law of induction to calculate the induced emf in a changing magnetic field, and you should understand the concept of mutual inductance. This knowledge will provide a strong foundation for further study in the field of electromagnetism.
