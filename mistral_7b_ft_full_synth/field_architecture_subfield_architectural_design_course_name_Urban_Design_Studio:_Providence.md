## Chapter 2: Urban Design Concept Development:




### Section 2.1 Alternative Concepts:

In the previous section, we discussed the importance of understanding the context and constraints of a project before beginning the concept development process. Now, we will explore the various alternative concepts that can be considered in urban design.

#### 2.1a Exploring Design Alternatives

Urban design is a complex and multifaceted field that requires careful consideration of various factors such as social, economic, and environmental impacts. As such, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for urban design problems. Therefore, it is crucial for urban designers to explore and evaluate different design alternatives before finalizing a concept.

One approach to exploring design alternatives is through the use of computer programs. With the advancement of technology, there are now various software and tools available to urban designers that can aid in the concept development process. These tools allow for the creation and visualization of different design alternatives, making it easier for designers to compare and evaluate them.

One such tool is the Simple Function Point (SFP) method, which is used for estimating the size and complexity of a software system. This method can also be applied to urban design projects, allowing designers to estimate the size and complexity of a design and compare it to other alternatives.

Another approach to exploring design alternatives is through the use of design tools such as computer-aided design (CAD) software. These programs allow designers to create 3D models and 2D drawings of their designs, providing a more realistic and detailed representation than traditional hand-rendering or paste-up on paper.

However, it is important for urban designers to also consider the potential drawbacks of using computer programs in the concept development process. While these tools can aid in the exploration of design alternatives, they can also lead to endless iterations and a lack of clear design outcome. Therefore, it is important for designers to also use traditional methods such as sketches to explore and evaluate design alternatives.

In the next section, we will discuss the importance of considering the social, economic, and environmental impacts of urban design concepts.

#### 2.2a.1 The Community Knows Best

One of the key principles of designing public spaces is taking into account the inputs of the community. This is because the community is the one that will be using the space most, and they are likely to have useful insights into how the space does - or should - function. This principle aligns with the first principle of placemaking, as outlined by the Project for Public Spaces. 

In the context of urban design, this means involving the local community in the design process. This can be done through public meetings, surveys, and other forms of community engagement. By involving the community, designers can gain a deeper understanding of the needs and desires of the people who will be using the space, and can incorporate this into the design.

#### 2.2a.2 Places, Not Designs

Another important principle of designing public spaces is taking a holistic approach. This means considering not just the design of the space, but also the interrelations between surrounding retailers, vendors, amenities provided, and activities taking place in the space. The goal is to create a cohesive unit that creates greater value for the community than just the sum of its parts.

In the context of urban design, this means considering the public space in the context of the surrounding urban fabric. This includes considering the existing buildings, streets, and other public spaces in the area. By understanding the interrelations between these elements, designers can create a public space that enhances the overall character and functionality of the urban environment.
