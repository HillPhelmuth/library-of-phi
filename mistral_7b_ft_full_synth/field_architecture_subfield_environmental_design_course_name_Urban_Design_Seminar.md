The advent of technology has had a profound impact on public spaces, transforming them into what William Mitchell has termed "mediated spaces". This term refers to the way in which technology, particularly mobile computing devices, has altered the way we interact with and experience public spaces. 

#### Mediated Spaces

Mediated spaces are public spaces that are shaped and influenced by technology. They are characterized by the ubiquitous presence of mobile computing devices, which allow for a range of activities that were previously impossible or impractical in traditional public spaces. For example, the use of smart phones and tablets allows for instant access to information, communication, and entertainment, blurring the boundaries between public and private spaces.

The impact of mediated spaces on public life is profound. On one hand, it has enhanced the efficiency and convenience of public spaces, making it easier for individuals to access information and services. On the other hand, it has also raised concerns about privacy, social interaction, and inequality in access to technology.

#### Privacy and Social Interaction in Mediated Spaces

The ubiquitous presence of technology in public spaces has raised concerns about privacy. With the ability to track and monitor individuals through various technologies, there is a risk of creating a "surveillance society". This can have a chilling effect on public life, as individuals may feel compelled to censor their behavior in public spaces for fear of being monitored.

At the same time, technology has also altered the dynamics of social interaction in public spaces. The use of mobile computing devices has made it easier for individuals to interact with each other, but it has also led to a shift towards more private and individualized forms of interaction. This can limit the opportunities for spontaneous and unplanned interactions, which are often seen as a key aspect of public life.

#### Inequality in Access to Technology

The advent of mediated spaces has also raised concerns about inequality in access to technology. As mentioned in the previous section, there are significant disparities in access to technology and high-speed internet, particularly among marginalized communities. This can limit their ability to participate in and benefit from mediated spaces, exacerbating existing inequalities in public life.

In conclusion, the advent of mediated spaces has had a profound impact on public spaces, altering the way we interact with and experience them. While it has brought about many benefits, it has also raised a range of challenges that need to be addressed in order to ensure that public spaces remain inclusive and equitable.

This approach not only preserves the architectural and cultural heritage of the industrial landscape, but also has numerous environmental and economic benefits.

#### 5.1a Understanding Adaptive Reuse

Adaptive reuse is a concept that has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in the field of urban design. It is based on the idea of "urban ore", as proposed by Chusid, where existing buildings are seen as a mine of raw materials for new projects. This concept was further developed by Shen and Langston, who studied the potential of adaptive reuse in both urban and non-urban settings.

Their integrated model for assessing adaptive reuse potential is based on the concept of opportunity, which rises and falls within the confines of a negative exponential decay function linked to a building's physical life expectancy. According to their study, a building reaches its maximum potential for adaptive reuse at a point when the building's age and its useful life merge or meet. This point is known as the "optimum point" and is crucial in determining the potential for adaptive reuse.

To assist urban designers in assessing the adaptive reuse potential of a building, Shen and Langston developed an adaptive reuse potential calculator. This tool establishes a "predicted useful life" of a building by considering a series of physical, economic, functional, technological, social, legal, and political characteristics. These characteristics are used to derive an "annual obsolescence rate" and "environmental obsolescence", which are necessary to determine an optimum point at which adaptive reuse intervention should occur.

The concept of obsolescence is advanced as a suitable concept to objectively reduce the expected physical life of a building to its expected useful life. A discounting philosophy is adopted, whereby the annual obsolescence rate across all criteria is the "discount rate" that performs this transformation. An algorithm based on a standard decay (negative exponential) curve produces an index of reuse potential (known as the ARP score) and is expressed as:

$$
ARP = 1 - e^{-k(t-t_0)}
$$

where ARP is the adaptive reuse potential, k is the discount rate, t is the current time, and t0 is the optimum point.

The ARP score is a useful tool for urban designers to assess the potential for adaptive reuse of a building. A higher ARP score indicates a higher potential for adaptive reuse, while a lower score indicates a lower potential. This tool can help urban designers make informed decisions about the adaptive reuse of industrial sites, taking into account the building's physical, economic, and social characteristics.

In the next section, we will explore the role of adaptive reuse in the reclamation of the industrial landscape, and how it can contribute to creating more livable and sustainable cities.





### Subsection: 5.2 Sustainable Water Management in Urban Areas

Water is a vital resource for urban areas, and its management is crucial for the sustainability of these regions. The challenges of urban water management, such as securing a consensus on the definition of Integrated Urban Water Management (IUWM) and implementing stated objectives at operational stages of projects, are significant. However, with the right approaches, these challenges can be addressed, and truly sustainable urban water systems can be achieved.

#### 5.2a Understanding Sustainable Water Management

Sustainable water management is a holistic approach that aims to balance the needs of the present and future generations.

One of the most influential frameworks for understanding urban design principles is the Principles of Intelligent Urbanism (PIU). The PIU is a design approach that seeks to create cities that are socially engaging, interactive, and offer numerous opportunities for gathering and meeting one another. The PIU is based on four key principles: conviviality, hierarchy of places, places for the individual, and places for friendship.

Conviviality, as defined by the PIU, refers to the social interaction that occurs in public domains. These domains, according to the PIU, should be devised in a hierarchy, with each tier having a corresponding physical place in the settlement structure. This hierarchy is conceptualized as a system of social tiers, with each tier offering a different level of social engagement.

The PIU also emphasizes the importance of creating places for the individual. These are spaces where individuals can escape to meditate and contemplate. These spaces, according to the PIU, are crucial for the individual's spiritual and psychological well-being. They are denoted and divined using ceremonial gates, directional walls, and other "silent devices".

##### Rethinking the Principles of Urban Design

The guidelines were a result of the "Fit City" conferences held by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) in 2006. These conferences brought together experts from various fields to discuss the role of urban design in promoting public health. From these discussions, four key concepts emerged:

1. Creating walkable and bikeable communities
2. Designing buildings that encourage physical movement
3. Improving access to recreation sites
4. Promoting healthy food options

These concepts have been implemented in various urban design projects in New York City, leading to improved public health outcomes. For example, the High Line, a 1.45-mile-long elevated linear park built on a former railroad track, has been shown to increase physical activity levels among its users. The park's design encourages walking, running, and cycling, providing a safe and accessible space for physical activity.

#### The Effects of Active Design

While there are few studies on the direct effects of implementing active design concepts, they have been shown to increase physical activity levels among building occupants. Moving to an active design building seems to have physical health benefits, such as improved cardiovascular health and reduced risk of obesity.

Active design also has a positive impact on mental and social well-being. For example, the design of transportation systems can support a safe and vibrant environment for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders, promoting social interaction and reducing feelings of isolation. Additionally, the design of recreation sites can shape play and activity spaces for people of different ages, interests, and abilities, promoting social inclusion and reducing feelings of exclusion.

#### The Future of Active Design

As urban populations continue to grow, the need for active design becomes even more critical. With the rise of smart cities and the integration of technology into urban spaces, there is an opportunity to further enhance the benefits of active design. For example, the use of sensors and data analysis can help identify areas with low levels of physical activity and inform the design of interventions to promote physical activity.

In conclusion, active design plays a crucial role in promoting public health in urban spaces.

First, green space provides opportunities for physical activity, which has been shown to have a positive effect on mental health. As discussed in the previous section, physical activity can help reduce stress, improve mood, and increase feelings of well-being.

Second, green space provides a natural environment that can help reduce stress and promote relaxation. The presence of natural elements, such as trees, plants, and water, can have a calming effect on the mind and body. This is known as "nature therapy" or "ecotherapy," and it has been shown to be effective in treating mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression.

Third, green space can facilitate social interaction, which is an important factor in mental health. Studies have shown that social interaction in green spaces can lead to increased feelings of community and belonging, which can have a positive impact on mental health.

#### The Impact of Urban Green Space on Mental Health

The impact of urban green space on mental health has been studied extensively. One randomized trial compared the mental health outcomes of residents living in a neighborhood with a greening intervention to those living in a neighborhood without a greening intervention. The results showed that residents living in the green neighborhood reported lower levels of psychological distress and higher levels of life satisfaction compared to those living in the non-green neighborhood.

Another study found that access to green space was associated with lower levels of anxiety and depression, particularly among individuals with lower socioeconomic status. This highlights the importance of providing access to green space in urban areas, especially in communities with higher levels of psychological distress and lower socioeconomic status.

#### Conclusion

Urban green space plays a crucial role in promoting mental health and well-being. Its impact on mental health can be attributed to its ability to facilitate physical activity, reduce stress, promote social interaction, and improve overall quality of life.

#### 12.1 Urban Design for Walkability

Walkability is a crucial aspect of urban design that has gained significant attention in recent years. It refers to the ease and convenience of walking or cycling for all trips within a city. The concept of walkability is closely tied to the idea of creating a pedestrian-friendly environment, where walking or cycling is the most convenient mode of transportation for all trips. This not only improves the quality of life for residents but also has numerous environmental and economic benefits.

One of the key factors that contribute to walkability is the internal permeability of a neighborhood. This refers to the ease of movement within a neighborhood, whether by foot or by vehicle. A neighborhood with high internal permeability will have a well-connected street network, allowing for easy access to different destinations. This not only makes walking or cycling more convenient but also reduces the need for private vehicles, leading to a decrease in traffic congestion and air pollution.

Another important aspect of walkability is legibility. This refers to how easy it is to read and understand the structure of a neighborhood. A neighborhood with good legibility will have clear landmarks, variation in building design, and a well-defined street layout. This helps residents navigate through the neighborhood and reduces the need for private vehicles, promoting a more sustainable mode of transportation.

In addition to creating a pedestrian-friendly environment, urban design for walkability also involves incorporating environmental sustainability into spatial planning. This means considering the impact of urban development on the environment and integrating environmental concerns into the design process. One way to achieve this is by incorporating green spaces into the neighborhood. This not only improves the aesthetic appeal of the neighborhood but also provides opportunities for wildlife and diversity, reducing the linearity of resource systems and creating a more sustainable, circular system at the local level.

The concept of walkability is closely tied to the idea of creating a sustainable and livable city. By promoting walking and cycling as the primary modes of transportation, urban design can reduce the negative impacts of private vehicles on the environment and improve the quality of life for residents. However, achieving walkability requires careful planning and consideration of various factors, including the internal permeability and legibility of a neighborhood. By incorporating these principles into urban design, we can create more sustainable and livable cities for the future.





#### 12.2 Urban Design and Public Transit

Public transit plays a crucial role in urban design, providing an efficient and sustainable mode of transportation for residents. It is especially important in the context of sustainable urban neighborhoods (SUNs), where the goal is to reduce car use and promote a more pedestrian-friendly environment. In this section, we will explore the relationship between urban design and public transit, and how it contributes to the overall sustainability of a neighborhood.

Transit planning is a critical aspect of urban design, as it involves the design and implementation of public transportation systems. It is a collaborative process that involves various stakeholders, including urban planners, transportation engineers, and community members. The goal of transit planning is to create a comprehensive and efficient public transportation system that meets the needs of the community.

One of the key considerations in transit planning is the integration of public transit with other modes of transportation, such as walking and cycling. This is important for creating a seamless and convenient transportation experience for residents. For example, in a SUN, bus or tram stops can be designed to be safe and accessible, providing a real public transport alternative to the car. This not only reduces car use but also promotes a more pedestrian-friendly environment.

Another important aspect of transit planning is the consideration of environmental sustainability. As mentioned in the previous section, the priorities for urban development now require environmental sustainability to be integrated into spatial planning, as well as economic and social concerns. This cannot be achieved by focusing either on the technological design of individual buildings or on broad (inter)national policy. The challenge is to raise standards and change behavior at a local (neighborhood) scale – wide enough to address broad environmental issues but small enough to effect practical change in people's lives.

In the context of transit planning, this means considering the environmental impact of public transportation systems. This can be achieved by incorporating sustainable design principles, such as using renewable energy sources for public transportation, reducing emissions, and promoting the use of electric vehicles. Additionally, transit planning can also involve the incorporation of green spaces in the neighborhood, as mentioned in the previous section. This not only improves the environmental sustainability of the neighborhood but also enhances the quality of life for residents.

#### 12.2b Urban Design and Transit Implementation

Once transit planning is complete, the next step is transit implementation. This involves the actual construction and operation of the public transportation system. Urban design plays a crucial role in this process, as it involves the design and construction of infrastructure, such as bus or tram stops, as well as the integration of public transit with other modes of transportation.

One of the key considerations in transit implementation is the design of transit stations and stops. These should be designed to be safe, accessible, and convenient for all users. This can be achieved by incorporating features such as covered shelters, seating, and real-time transit information. Additionally, transit stations and stops can also be designed to be visually appealing and integrated with the surrounding urban fabric, promoting a sense of place and enhancing the overall design of the neighborhood.

Another important aspect of transit implementation is the integration of public transit with other modes of transportation, such as walking and cycling. This can be achieved through the design of multi-modal transportation systems, where different modes of transportation are integrated and connected seamlessly. This not only improves the efficiency and convenience of public transportation but also promotes a more sustainable and environmentally friendly mode of transportation.

In conclusion, urban design plays a crucial role in public transit, from planning to implementation. By incorporating sustainable design principles and promoting the integration of different modes of transportation, urban design can contribute to the overall sustainability and livability of a neighborhood. As cities continue to grow and face challenges such as traffic congestion and air pollution, the role of urban design in public transit will only become more important in creating sustainable and livable communities.
