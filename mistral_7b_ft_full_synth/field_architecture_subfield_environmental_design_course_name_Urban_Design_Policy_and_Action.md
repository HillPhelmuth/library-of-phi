They consist of ten short statements on how cities can become more sustainable. Each principle has a few paragraphs of elaboration that provides additional information on its meaning and application. The Principles are designed to be read by decision-makers, and provide a starting point on the journey towards sustainability. Additional tools will be needed to operationalize the Melbourne Principles.

#### 1.3a.2 The 10 Melbourne Principles

1. Provide a long-term vision for cities based on: sustainability; intergenerational, social, economic and political equity; and their individuality.

"A long-term vision is the starting point for catalysing positive change, leading to sustainability. The vision needs to reflect the distinctive nature and characteristics of each city. The vision should also express the shared aspirations of the people for their cities to become more sustainable. It needs to address equity, which means equal access to both natural and human resources, as well as shared responsibility for preserving the value of these resources for future generations. A vision based on sustainability will help align and motivate communities, governments, businesses and others around a common purpose, and will provide a basis for developing a strategy, an action programme and processes to achieve that vision."

2. Achieve long-term economic vitality.

"Economic vitality is a key component of sustainability. It ensures that cities have the resources to meet their needs and to invest in their future. Economic vitality is achieved through a diverse and resilient economy, with opportunities for all members of the community."

3. Foster social cohesion and equity.

"Social cohesion and equity are essential for the well-being of all members of the community. They ensure that everyone has equal access to opportunities and resources, and that all voices are heard and valued."

4. Ensure equitable access to high quality design and amenity.

"High quality design and amenity are crucial for the livability and attractiveness of cities. They enhance the quality of life for all residents and contribute to the economic vitality of the city."

5. Promote sustainable resource use and management.

"Sustainable resource use and management are key to ensuring the long-term availability of resources for future generations. This includes efficient use of resources, minimizing waste, and promoting renewable resources."

6. Strengthen community participation and engagement.

"Community participation and engagement are essential for the success of sustainable urban development. They ensure that the needs and aspirations of all members of the community are taken into account, and that they have a sense of ownership and responsibility for their city."

7. Enhance ecological sustainability.

As such, they should be considered as a key tool in the urban design policy toolkit.





### Subsection: 2.1b Regulation in Urban Design

Regulation plays a crucial role in implementing urban design policy. It sets the legal framework for the design and development of urban spaces, ensuring that they are in line with the principles and guidelines set forth by urban design policy. Regulation can take various forms, including zoning by-laws, building codes, and design guidelines.

Zoning by-laws are a common form of regulation in urban design. They divide a municipality into different zones, each with its own set of permitted land uses and development standards. This allows for more precise control over the type of development that occurs in different areas of the city. For example, a zone may be designated for residential use, with specific regulations regarding the height and density of buildings.

Building codes are another important form of regulation in urban design. They set the minimum standards for the construction and maintenance of buildings, ensuring that they are safe and meet certain design criteria. Building codes can also include provisions for energy efficiency and sustainability, promoting the use of green building practices.

Design guidelines are a more flexible form of regulation in urban design. They provide guidance on the design and development of urban spaces, without setting strict regulations. Design guidelines can be used to promote a particular design style or aesthetic, or to ensure that new developments are in line with the character and context of the surrounding area.

Regulation in urban design is not without its challenges. One of the main challenges is the potential for conflict between different forms of regulation. For example, a zoning by-law may restrict the height of buildings, while a building code may allow for taller buildings if they meet certain design criteria. This can lead to confusion and delays in the development process.

Another challenge is the potential for regulation to stifle creativity and innovation in urban design. Strict regulations can limit the design options available to developers, leading to a lack of diversity and creativity in the built environment. This can be particularly problematic in the context of smart cities, where new technologies and design approaches are constantly emerging.

However, weak property rights can create challenges for urban design policy, leading to uncertainty and conflict over the use and development of urban spaces.




### Subsection: 2.1d Direct and Indirect Approaches

In the realm of urban design, there are two primary approaches to implementing policy: direct and indirect. Each of these approaches has its own strengths and weaknesses, and understanding them is crucial for effective urban design policy and action.

#### Direct Approaches to Implementing Urban Design Policy

Direct approaches to implementing urban design policy involve explicit and direct action. This can include zoning regulations, building codes, and other legal instruments that directly control the use and development of urban spaces. For example, a city might implement a zoning regulation that requires a certain percentage of new developments to include affordable housing units.

Direct approaches can be effective in achieving specific policy goals, such as promoting affordable housing or reducing urban sprawl. However, they can also be controversial and difficult to implement, particularly in complex urban environments where multiple stakeholders have competing interests.

#### Indirect Approaches to Implementing Urban Design Policy

Indirect approaches to implementing urban design policy involve more subtle and indirect methods. These can include incentives, subsidies, and other financial tools that encourage certain types of development or behavior. For example, a city might offer tax incentives to developers who include green building features in their projects.

Indirect approaches can be more flexible and adaptable than direct approaches, and can be particularly effective in complex urban environments. However, they can also be less transparent and may not always achieve their intended goals.

#### The Role of Property Rights in Direct and Indirect Approaches

Property rights play a crucial role in both direct and indirect approaches to implementing urban design policy. Strong property rights can provide a stable framework for urban development, encouraging investment and innovation. However, they can also limit the effectiveness of indirect approaches, as property owners may be less likely to respond to incentives or regulations if they feel their property rights are not secure.

Conversely, weak property rights can create challenges for both direct and indirect approaches. In the absence of clear and enforceable property rights, there may be uncertainty and conflict over the use and development of urban spaces, hindering the implementation of urban design policy.

In conclusion, understanding the strengths and weaknesses of direct and indirect approaches, as well as their relationship with property rights, is crucial for effective urban design policy and action. By carefully considering these factors, urban designers can develop more effective and sustainable policies for their cities.
