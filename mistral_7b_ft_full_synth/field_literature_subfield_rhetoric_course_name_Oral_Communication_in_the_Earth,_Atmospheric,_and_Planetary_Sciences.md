### Internet

Web-based audience response systems work with the participants' existing computing devices. These include notebook computers, smartphones and PDAs, which are typically connected to the Internet via Wi-Fi, as well as classroom desktop computers. If the facilitator's computer is also Wi-Fi-enabled, they can even create their own IP network, allowing a closed system that doesn't depend on a separate base station. The web server resides on or is accessible to the facilitator's computer, letting them control a set of web pages presenting questions. Participants log into the server using web browsers and see the questions with forms to input their responses. The summarized responses are available on a different set of pages, which can be displayed through the projector and also on each participant's device.

Internet has also made it possible to gather audience responses in massive scale. Various implementations of the concept exist. For example, Microsoft featured Bing Pulse during the 2013 State of The Union (US) address by president Barack Obama. The system allowed registered users to input their responses (positive, negative, neutral) to the address and visualized the results as a trending graph in real time. Bing Pulse has since been used to cast over 35 million votes during national news broadcasts and other live meetings. Over 10,000 viewers powered the iPowow Viewer Vote which tracked live viewer emotional response for Channel 7 during the 2013 Australian Federal Election debates and displayed as a live "worm" graph on the broadcast screen. For advertising and media research, online "dial testing" using an onscreen scale slider that is controlled by a mouse (or finger swipe on a touchscreen) is being used in conjunction with surveys and online communities to gather continuous feedback on video or audio files.

#### Set goals

Groups that set clear, challenging goals outperform groups whose members have lost sight of their objectives. The group's goals should be relatively challenging, instead of being too easily accomplished. The advantages of working in a group are often lost when a task is so easy that it can be accomplished even when members of the group socially loaf. Thus, groups should set their standards high, but not so high that the goals are unattainable. Latham and Baldes (1975) assessed the practical significance of Locke's theory of goal setting by conducting an experiment with truck drivers who hauled logs from the forest to the mill. When the men were initially told to do their best when loading the logs, they carried only about 60 percent of the weight that they could legally haul. When the same drivers were later encouraged to reach a goal of hauling 94 percent of the legal limit, they increased their efficiency and met this specific goal. Thus, the results of this study show that performance improved immediately upon the assignment of a specific, challenging goal. Company cost accounting procedures indicated that this same increase in performance without goal setting would have required an expenditure of a quarter of a million dollars on the purchase of additional trucks alone. So this method of goal setting is extremely effective. Other research has found that clear goals can stimulate a number of other performance-enhancing processes, including increases in effort, better planning, more accurate monitoring of the quality of the groups work, and even an increased commitment to the group.

#### Individual assessment

In order to reduce social loafing, a company can always focus on assessing each members contribution rather than only examining the teams accomplishments as a whole. It is statistically proven that social loafers will tend to put in less effort because of the lack of external or internal assessment of their contributions. This can be achieved through individual performance evaluations or through the implementation of a point system where each member is awarded points for their contributions. By focusing on individual assessments, companies can ensure that each member is motivated to put in their best effort, leading to improved group performance.

### Subsection: 6.2c Presenting Your Arguments

In the previous subsections, we have discussed the importance of identifying strong arguments and refuting arguments in the Great Debate. Now, we will explore the process of presenting your own arguments in a clear and effective manner.

Presenting your arguments means to effectively communicate your ideas and evidence to support your arguments. This can be done by organizing your thoughts and evidence in a logical and coherent manner, and by using effective communication techniques.

When presenting your arguments, it is important to consider the audience and their level of understanding. In the Great Debate, both Shapley and Curtis had to present their arguments to a diverse audience, including scientists, philosophers, and the general public. Therefore, it is important to use language that is accessible and understandable to all.

One effective technique for presenting your arguments is to use the Toulmin model of argumentation. This model breaks down an argument into its components, including the claim, evidence, warrant, backing, and qualifier. The claim is the main argument being presented, the evidence is the supporting information or data, the warrant is the reasoning that connects the evidence to the claim, the backing provides additional support for the warrant, and the qualifier acknowledges any limitations or exceptions to the argument.

In the context of the Great Debate, Shapley and Curtis both used the Toulmin model to present their arguments. Shapley's claim was that the universe is infinite, supported by his evidence of the vastness of the universe and his calculations. His warrant was that the universe is infinite because it is vast and his calculations support this. His backing was the support from other scientists and his qualifier was that his calculations were based on assumptions that may not be entirely accurate.

Curtis, on the other hand, presented his argument that the universe is finite with a different approach. His claim was that the universe is finite, supported by his evidence of the limited size of the universe and his calculations. His warrant was that the universe is finite because it is limited in size and his calculations support this. His backing was the support from other scientists and his qualifier was that his calculations were based on assumptions that may not be entirely accurate.

By using the Toulmin model, both Shapley and Curtis were able to effectively present their arguments and engage in a productive debate. This model can also be applied in other contexts, such as in academic presentations or discussions.

In conclusion, presenting your arguments is an important aspect of effective oral communication. By using techniques such as the Toulmin model and considering the audience, you can effectively communicate your ideas and evidence to support your arguments.

### Section: 8.1 Evaluating Presentation Clips:

Effective oral communication is a crucial skill for any scientist, especially in the fields of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences. As researchers in these fields, we are often tasked with presenting complex and technical information to a variety of audiences, from colleagues and peers to policymakers and the general public. The ability to effectively communicate our findings and ideas is essential for advancing our research and making an impact in our respective fields.

In this section, we will explore the process of evaluating presentation clips, a crucial step in the process of effective oral communication. Presentation clips are short segments of presentations that can be analyzed to identify effective communication techniques and strategies. By evaluating these clips, we can gain valuable insights into the key elements of effective oral communication and apply them to our own presentations.

#### 8.1a Analyzing Presentation Techniques

To effectively evaluate presentation clips, we must first understand the key techniques and strategies used in effective oral communication. These techniques can be broadly categorized into three areas: content, delivery, and visual aids.

Content refers to the information being presented, including the main points, supporting evidence, and overall structure of the presentation. In the Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, it is essential to have a clear and concise understanding of the content being presented. This includes having a strong grasp of the subject matter, as well as being able to effectively communicate complex concepts to a non-expert audience.

Delivery refers to how the information is presented, including the tone, pace, and body language of the presenter. In the Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, effective delivery is crucial for engaging and connecting with the audience. This includes being able to effectively convey enthusiasm and passion for the topic, as well as using appropriate body language and tone to convey confidence and expertise.

Visual aids refer to any visual elements used in the presentation, such as slides, graphs, and images. In the Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, visual aids are often used to enhance the presentation and help convey complex information in a more digestible way. However, it is important to use visual aids effectively and ensure that they are relevant and add value to the presentation.

#### 8.1b Identifying Strengths and Weaknesses

Once we have analyzed the presentation techniques used, it is important to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the presentation. This involves evaluating the effectiveness of the content, delivery, and visual aids, and identifying areas for improvement.

For the content, we can assess the clarity and organization of the main points and supporting evidence. We can also evaluate the overall structure of the presentation and identify any areas that may need to be reworked or expanded upon.

For delivery, we can assess the presenter's tone, pace, and body language, and identify areas for improvement. We can also evaluate the presenter's ability to engage and connect with the audience, and identify ways to improve this aspect of the presentation.

For visual aids, we can assess the relevance and effectiveness of the visual elements used. We can also identify any areas where the visual aids may be distracting or confusing, and suggest ways to improve their use in the presentation.

By identifying strengths and weaknesses, we can gain a better understanding of what makes a presentation effective and use this knowledge to improve our own presentations in the Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences.





### Subsection: 8.1c Learning from Others

In this section, we will explore the benefits of learning from others and how it can improve our own presentation skills.

#### The Power of Observation

Observing others is a powerful tool for learning and improving our own skills. By watching others present, we can gain valuable insights into their techniques and strategies. We can observe how they engage the audience, use visual aids, and handle questions and feedback. This can give us a better understanding of what works and what doesn't in a presentation.

#### Learning from Different Perspectives

Another benefit of learning from others is that we can gain different perspectives on presentation skills. Each individual has their own unique style and approach to presenting. By observing and learning from others, we can expand our own repertoire of presentation techniques and find what works best for us.

#### Feedback and Constructive Criticism

Observing others also allows us to receive feedback and constructive criticism on our own presentation skills. By watching others present, we can see our own strengths and weaknesses in action. This can help us identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments to our own presentations.

#### The Importance of Practice

Learning from others also involves practicing our own presentation skills. By observing and learning from others, we can apply what we have learned to our own presentations. This requires practice and repetition, but it can greatly improve our own presentation skills.

In conclusion, learning from others is a crucial aspect of evaluating presentation skills. By observing and practicing, we can gain valuable insights and improve our own presentation techniques. It is an ongoing process that requires continuous learning and growth. 





### Subsection: 8.2a Self-Assessment Techniques

Self-assessment is a crucial aspect of evaluating presentation skills. It involves taking a critical look at our own performance and identifying both our strengths and weaknesses. This allows us to make necessary improvements and become more effective communicators.

#### The Importance of Self-Assessment

Self-assessment is an essential tool for personal growth and development. It allows us to take ownership of our own learning and improvement. By evaluating our own performance, we can identify areas where we excel and areas where we need to improve. This can help us develop a more well-rounded set of presentation skills.

#### Self-Assessment Techniques

There are several techniques that can be used for self-assessment. These include:

- Self-Reflection: This involves taking a moment to reflect on our own performance. We can ask ourselves questions such as: What did I do well? What could I have done differently? What did I learn from this experience? This can help us identify our strengths and weaknesses and develop a plan for improvement.

- Self-Evaluation: This involves evaluating our own performance against a set of criteria. We can use a rubric or checklist to assess our performance in different areas, such as content, delivery, and visual aids. This can help us identify specific areas where we need to improve.

- Self-Assessment Instruments: There are various self-assessment instruments available, such as the Gifted Rating Scales, which can help us evaluate our own presentation skills. These instruments provide a structured way to assess our own performance and identify areas for improvement.

#### Learning from Self-Assessment

Self-assessment is not just about identifying our weaknesses. It is also about learning from our mistakes and making necessary improvements. By taking the time to self-assess, we can develop a more critical eye for our own performance and become more effective communicators.

#### The Role of Feedback

While self-assessment is an important aspect of evaluating presentation skills, it is also important to seek feedback from others. This can provide a different perspective and help us identify areas for improvement that we may have overlooked. By combining self-assessment with feedback from others, we can develop a more comprehensive understanding of our presentation skills and make necessary improvements.





### Subsection: 8.2b Peer Assessment

Peer assessment is another important aspect of evaluating presentation skills. It involves having our peers evaluate our performance and provide feedback. This can be a valuable tool for identifying our strengths and weaknesses, as well as areas for improvement.

#### The Importance of Peer Assessment

Peer assessment allows us to receive feedback from a different perspective. Our peers may notice things about our presentation that we may not have considered. This can help us identify areas where we may need to improve, and also give us a better understanding of how our presentation is perceived by others.

#### Peer Assessment Techniques

There are several techniques that can be used for peer assessment. These include:

- Peer Evaluation: This involves having our peers evaluate our performance against a set of criteria. We can use a rubric or checklist to assess our performance in different areas, such as content, delivery, and visual aids. This can help us identify specific areas where we need to improve.

- Peer Feedback: This involves having our peers provide feedback on our presentation. This can be done through a written evaluation or a discussion. Peer feedback can provide valuable insights and suggestions for improvement.

### Section: 9.1 Defining the Problem Statement:

The problem statement is a crucial component of any research project. It serves as the foundation for the entire study and guides the direction of the research. In this section, we will discuss the importance of a clear problem statement and provide guidelines for writing an effective one.

#### 9.1a Importance of a Clear Problem Statement

A clear problem statement is essential for gaining support and approval from stakeholders for a research project. It must be action-oriented and accurately reflect the current gap or issue that needs to be addressed. A poorly crafted or incorrect problem statement can lead to a faulty solution, resulting in wasted time, money, and resources.

To decrease the risk of project failure, it is important to focus on the end user when writing the problem statement. This means understanding the needs and pain points of the stakeholders, customers, or users who will be affected by the issue. By doing so, the problem statement can effectively communicate the importance of the research and its potential impact.

The problem statement should also avoid being too broad or too narrow. A broad problem statement may oversimplify the issue and fail to provide enough detail for understanding the problem and developing an appropriate solution. On the other hand, a narrow problem statement may be solution-biased, stifling creativity and resulting in a suboptimal experience for the user.

To ensure a clear and accurate problem statement, it is helpful to follow a specific format. One commonly used format is the five whys approach, which involves asking a series of "why" questions to get to the root cause of the problem. This approach helps to avoid oversimplification and provides the necessary details for understanding the problem and developing a solution.

#### 9.1b Writing a Problem Statement

When writing a problem statement, it is important to keep in mind the following guidelines:

1. Start by defining the problem in clear and specific terms. This includes identifying the stakeholders, their needs, and the current gap or issue that needs to be addressed.

2. Use the five whys approach to get to the root cause of the problem. This will help to avoid oversimplification and provide the necessary details for understanding the problem and developing a solution.

3. Avoid making assumptions or generalizations. Stick to the facts and use evidence to support your claims.

4. Be concise and to the point. A problem statement should be no more than one page in length.

5. Use a clear and organized format. This will help to ensure that the problem statement is easy to read and understand.

#### 9.1c Examples of Problem Statements

To further illustrate the importance of a clear problem statement, let's look at some examples.

Example 1:

The current gap in the Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences is the lack of interdisciplinary collaboration. This has resulted in a limited understanding of complex phenomena and processes, hindering progress in the field. To address this problem, a research project will be conducted to explore the benefits of interdisciplinary collaboration and its potential impact on the field.

Example 2:

The problem statement for a research project on climate change may be written as follows:

Climate change is a pressing issue that affects the entire planet. The current gap is the lack of effective communication between scientists and the general public, leading to a lack of understanding and action towards addressing climate change. To address this problem, a research project will be conducted to explore effective communication strategies for conveying the urgency and importance of climate change to the general public.

By following these guidelines and examples, researchers can effectively write a problem statement that accurately reflects the current gap or issue and gains support for their research project. 


## Chapter 9: Contextualizing Research:




#### 9.1b Techniques for Defining the Problem

In addition to the five whys approach, there are several other techniques that can be used to define the problem statement. These techniques can help to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the issue and guide the direction of the research.

One such technique is the Pugh matrix, which is a decision-making tool that helps to compare and prioritize different options. This can be useful when trying to determine the best approach for addressing the problem.

Another technique is the use of implicit data structures, which are data structures that are not explicitly defined but can be inferred from the data. This can be helpful when dealing with large and complex datasets, as it allows for a more efficient and effective analysis.

Empirical research is also a valuable technique for defining the problem. This involves collecting and analyzing data to gain a better understanding of the issue. By using empirical research, researchers can identify patterns and trends that may not have been apparent before, leading to a more accurate problem statement.

It is also important to consider the context of the problem. This includes understanding the current state of research in the field, as well as any external factors that may be influencing the issue. By considering the context, researchers can ensure that their problem statement is relevant and meaningful.

In conclusion, defining the problem statement is a crucial step in any research project. By using techniques such as the five whys approach, Pugh matrix, implicit data structures, empirical research, and considering the context, researchers can effectively communicate the importance of their research and guide the direction of their study. 





#### 9.1c Communicating the Problem Statement

Once the problem statement has been defined, it is crucial to effectively communicate it to others. This is especially important in the Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, where collaboration and interdisciplinary research are common. By effectively communicating the problem statement, researchers can ensure that their work is understood and supported by others in the field.

One way to communicate the problem statement is through the use of visual aids. This can include diagrams, charts, and graphs that help to illustrate the issue at hand. Visual aids can be particularly useful when trying to explain complex concepts or data sets. They can also help to highlight the significance of the problem and its potential impact on the field.

Another important aspect of communicating the problem statement is to consider the audience. This includes understanding their background knowledge, interests, and potential biases. By tailoring the communication to the specific audience, researchers can ensure that their message is effectively conveyed.

In addition to visual aids and audience consideration, it is also important to use clear and concise language. This can be achieved by avoiding jargon and technical terms, and instead using everyday language that is easily understandable. By doing so, researchers can ensure that their message is accessible to a wider audience and can be easily communicated to non-experts.

Furthermore, it is important to provide context when communicating the problem statement. This can include discussing the current state of research in the field, as well as any previous studies or findings that have contributed to the understanding of the issue. By providing context, researchers can help to establish the significance of their work and its contribution to the field.

Lastly, it is crucial to be transparent and honest when communicating the problem statement. This includes acknowledging any limitations or uncertainties in the research, as well as being open to feedback and criticism.

### Nominal group technique

Participants are asked to write their ideas anonymously. Then the facilitator collects the ideas and the group votes on each idea. The vote can be as simple as a show of hands in favor of a given idea. This process is called distillation.<fact|date=September 2022>

After distillation, the top-ranked ideas may be sent back to the group or to subgroups for further brainstorming. For example, one group may work on the color required in a product. Another group may work on the size, and so forth. Each group will come back to the whole group for ranking the listed ideas. Sometimes ideas that were previously dropped may be brought forward again once the group has re-evaluated the ideas.<fact|date=September 2022>

It is important that the facilitator is trained in this process before attempting to facilitate this technique. The group should be primed and encouraged to embrace the process. Like all team efforts, it may take a few practice sessions to train the team in the method before tackling the important ideas.<fact|date=September 2022>

### Group passing technique

Each person in a circular group writes down one idea, and then passes the piece of paper to the next person, who adds some thoughts. This continues until everybody gets his or her original piece of paper back. By this time, it is likely that the group will have extensively elaborated on each idea.<fact|date=September 2022>

The group may also create an "idea book" and post a distribution list or routing slip to the front of the book. On the first page is a description of the problem. The first person to receive the book lists his or her ideas and then routes the book to the next person on the distribution list. The second person can log new ideas or add to the ideas already listed. This process continues until all ideas have been thoroughly discussed and evaluated. The group can then make a decision based on the collected ideas and feedback.

### Subsection: 13.2a Importance of Accessibility in Communication

In the field of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, effective oral communication is crucial for sharing research findings, collaborating with colleagues, and communicating complex concepts to a wider audience. However, it is equally important to consider the accessibility of this communication. Accessibility refers to the ability of individuals with disabilities to access and use information and technology. In the context of oral communication, this includes the ability of individuals with disabilities to understand and engage with the information being presented.

The 1990s saw a significant shift in the focus on accessibility in communication. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was passed, which mandated equal access to information and technology for individuals with disabilities. This led to an increased use of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) in schools, where students with special needs were placed in regular classrooms. AAC was used as a means of improving student participation in class, and interventions became more collaborative and naturalistic.

However, the use of AAC also brought to light the importance of considering the cognitive and linguistic demands of communication. Facilitated communication, a method where a facilitator guides the arm of a person with severe communication needs as they type on a keyboard or letter board, received wide attention in the media and in the field. However, it was later rejected by professional organizations and researchers as a pseudoscience, as it was demonstrated that the facilitator rather than the disabled person was the source of the messages generated in this way.

This incident highlights the importance of considering the cognitive and linguistic demands of communication. As we communicate complex concepts in the Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, it is crucial to ensure that our communication is accessible to all individuals, regardless of their cognitive abilities. This includes using clear and concise language, avoiding jargon, and providing visual aids or other forms of support to aid understanding.

In addition to cognitive accessibility, it is also important to consider physical accessibility. This includes ensuring that individuals with physical disabilities can access the information being presented, whether it be through the use of assistive technology or alternative formats.

As we continue to advance in the field of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, it is important to keep in mind the importance of accessibility in communication. By considering the cognitive and physical demands of our communication, we can ensure that our research and findings are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their abilities.

### Subsection: 14.2a Techniques for Effective Debating

Debating is a crucial skill for effective oral communication in the Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences. It allows for the exploration of complex ideas and concepts, the evaluation of evidence, and the development of critical thinking skills. In this section, we will discuss advanced techniques for effective debating, including the use of informal logic and the pragmatic approach to argumentation.

#### Informal Logic in Debating

Informal logic is a branch of logic that deals with the analysis and evaluation of arguments that are not formally structured. In the context of debating, informal logic is often used to analyze and evaluate the arguments presented by both sides. It allows for a more nuanced understanding of the arguments and can help to identify any fallacies or weaknesses.

One of the key techniques in informal logic is the study of fallacies. Fallacies are errors in reasoning that can weaken an argument. In debating, it is important to be able to identify and address fallacies in order to strengthen one's own arguments and weaken those of the opposing side. Some common fallacies in debating include the fallacy of affirming the consequent, the fallacy of denying the antecedent, and the fallacy of begging the question.

#### The Pragmatic Approach to Argumentation

The pragmatic approach to argumentation, as proposed by Douglas N. Walton, sees arguments as speech acts and not merely as a set of premises together with a conclusion. This approach recognizes the importance of context and dialogue in the evaluation of arguments. In debating, this approach can be particularly useful as it allows for a more dynamic and interactive discussion.

In the pragmatic approach, arguments are seen as moves in a dialogue between two players. Each player has their own initial position, which is characterized by the propositions to which they are committed and the conclusion they intend to prove. The goal of the dialogue is for each player to convince the other of their own conclusion through the use of arguments. This is achieved by making arguments that take the opponent's commitments as premises and show how one's own conclusion follows from them.

#### Other Techniques for Effective Debating

In addition to the use of informal logic and the pragmatic approach, there are other techniques that can be used to improve one's debating skills. These include the use of rhetorical devices, such as rhetorical questions and rhetorical appeals, to persuade the audience and strengthen one's arguments. Additionally, the use of visual aids and examples can be effective in conveying complex ideas and concepts.

Furthermore, it is important to practice active listening and asking clarifying questions in order to fully understand the arguments presented by the opposing side. This can help to identify any gaps in reasoning or areas for further discussion.

In conclusion, effective debating requires a combination of techniques, including the use of informal logic, the pragmatic approach, and other rhetorical devices. By mastering these techniques, one can become a more effective debater and communicator in the Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences.

Constructive feedback is an essential part of the evaluation process, as it allows presenters to improve their skills and deliver more effective presentations.

#### 15.2a.1 The Importance of Constructive Feedback

Constructive feedback is feedback that is specific, actionable, and helpful. It goes beyond simply saying "good job" or "needs improvement" and provides specific suggestions for improvement. Constructive feedback is crucial for presenters, as it allows them to understand what they can do to improve their presentations and deliver more effective messages.

#### 15.2a.2 Advanced Techniques for Giving Constructive Feedback

1. Be specific: When giving feedback, it is important to be specific. Instead of saying "your presentation was boring," say "your presentation could benefit from more engaging visuals or examples." This allows the presenter to understand exactly what needs to be improved.

2. Provide actionable suggestions: Along with being specific, feedback should also be actionable. This means providing suggestions for improvement that the presenter can actually implement. For example, instead of saying "your presentation was too long," you could say "consider cutting out some unnecessary information or using visuals to convey complex ideas."

3. Be respectful: Constructive feedback should always be given in a respectful manner. Avoid using harsh or negative language, and focus on the presentation rather than the presenter. Remember, the goal is to help the presenter improve, not to criticize them.

4. Use the "sandwich" method: The "sandwich" method involves sandwiching constructive criticism between positive feedback. This can help soften the blow of criticism and make it easier for the presenter to accept. However, it is important to make sure that the positive feedback is genuine and not just a way to sugarcoat the criticism.

5. Follow up: After giving feedback, it is important to follow up with the presenter to see if they have any questions or need further assistance. This shows that you are invested in their improvement and can help them implement your suggestions.

By using these advanced techniques, you can provide constructive feedback that helps presenters improve their skills and deliver more effective presentations. Remember, the goal is to help, not to criticize. With practice and patience, you can become an effective evaluator and help others improve their oral communication skills.

When giving feedback, it is important to follow the advanced techniques discussed in section 15.2a. Be specific, provide actionable suggestions, and be respectful. It can also be helpful to use the "sandwich" method, sandwiching constructive criticism between positive feedback.

#### 15.2b.2 Practice Receiving Feedback

Receiving feedback can be a challenging skill to develop, but it is crucial for improving as a presenter. When receiving feedback, it is important to listen actively and be open to constructive criticism.

Active listening involves fully engaging with the person giving feedback, asking clarifying questions, and taking notes. This not only helps you better understand the feedback, but also shows the person giving feedback that you value their input.

It is also important to be open to constructive criticism. This means acknowledging and accepting the feedback, even if it is difficult to hear. Remember, the goal is to improve, and constructive feedback is a valuable tool for achieving this.

#### 15.2b.3 Implementing Feedback

Once you have received feedback, it is important to take action and implement it in your presentations. This can involve making changes to your content, delivery, or visuals.

When implementing feedback, it is important to be specific and actionable. This means taking concrete steps to improve, rather than simply saying "I will try to do better." It can also be helpful to set a specific goal or objective to work towards, as this can provide a clear direction for improvement.

Lastly, we can also use advanced self-assessment techniques such as the QUIS (Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction). This tool allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of our presentations from the perspective of the audience. By using the QUIS, we can gain valuable feedback and insights into how our presentations are perceived by others.

By incorporating these advanced self-assessment techniques into our presentation skills, we can become more effective communicators and continuously improve our presentation abilities. 





#### 16.2b Practice Identifying Strengths and Weaknesses

In addition to using advanced self-assessment techniques, it is important for presenters to practice identifying their strengths and weaknesses. This can be done through self-reflection, seeking feedback from others, and participating in workshops or courses on effective oral communication.

One way to practice identifying strengths and weaknesses is to record and review presentations. By watching ourselves present, we can gain a better understanding of our own strengths and weaknesses. We can also ask for feedback from others, such as colleagues or mentors, to gain a different perspective on our presentations.

Another way to practice identifying strengths and weaknesses is to participate in workshops or courses on effective oral communication. These can provide valuable insights and techniques for improving presentation skills. Additionally, working with a coach or mentor can also be helpful in identifying and addressing weaknesses.

It is important to note that identifying strengths and weaknesses is not a one-time activity, but rather an ongoing process. As presenters, we should continuously strive to improve and develop our skills. By practicing identifying our strengths and weaknesses, we can become more effective communicators and deliver impactful presentations.





#### 16.2c Evaluating Self-Assessment Skills

In the previous section, we discussed advanced techniques for identifying strengths and weaknesses in presentations. However, it is important for presenters to not only be able to identify these areas, but also to accurately evaluate their own self-assessment skills.

One study by Orsmond, Merry, and Reiling (1997) found that students often misjudged their assessments. This can be a major hindrance to effective self-assessment, as it can lead to inaccurate evaluations of one's own performance. In their study, they compared students' self-assessment scores with those of the teacher and found a significant disagreement between the two. This highlights the need for additional training in self-assessment skills for students.

Another study by Sadler (1989) emphasizes the importance of teacher guidance in the process of self-assessment. By involving students in the assessment process and providing them with guided but direct and authentic evaluative experience, they can develop their evaluative knowledge and become more accurate in their self-assessments. This also helps to transfer some of the responsibility for decision-making from the teacher to the learner.

A more recent study by McDonald and Boud (2003) investigated the impact of self-assessment training on student learning. They found that students who were trained in self-assessment strategies outperformed their peers in all curriculum assessments. This suggests that self-assessment training can be a valuable tool in improving self-assessment skills.

In addition to these studies, there are also various techniques that presenters can use to evaluate their own self-assessment skills. One such technique is the use of rubrics, which provide a clear set of criteria for evaluating one's own performance. This can help presenters to be more objective and accurate in their self-assessments.

Another technique is to seek feedback from others, such as peers or mentors. This can provide a different perspective on one's own performance and help to identify areas for improvement.

It is important for presenters to continuously evaluate and improve their self-assessment skills. By doing so, they can become more effective communicators and deliver impactful presentations.

# Problem statement

## Defining the problem

Before the problem statement can be crafted, the problem must be defined.

The process of defining the problem is often a group effort. It starts with meeting with the stakeholders, customers, and/or users affected by the issue (if possible) and learning about their pain points. Since people often struggle with effectively communicating their issues, particularly to someone outside of the process, it is helpful to ask a series of "why" questions until the underlying reasoning is identified. This method, known as the five whys, helps drill down to the core problem as many of the experienced frustrations could be mere symptoms of the actual problem. Asking these additional questions as well as paraphrasing what the stakeholder had said demonstrates a degree of empathy and understanding of the problem.

The information collected from these initial interviews is only one part of problem analysis. Many times the problem extends to multiple areas or functions to which the stakeholders, customers, and users are unaware. They may also be familiar with what is happening on the surface but not necessarily the underlying cause. Therefore, it is just as essential to gather knowledge, information, and insights from project team members and subject matter experts concerning the problem. Additional research materials, including work instructions, user manuals, product specifications, workflow charts, and previous project plans may also need to be consulted. Like most other stages in the process improvement project, defining the problem is often iterative as several rounds of discussions may be needed to get the full picture.

Once the problem is understood and the circumstances driving the project initiation are clear, it is time to write the problem statement.
 # Problem statement

## Writing the problem statement

The problem statement will be used to gain project support and approval from stakeholders. As such, it must be action-oriented and clearly state the problem and its impact. It should also include the root cause of the problem and any relevant background information. The problem statement should be concise and specific, avoiding vague or general statements. It should also be written in a way that is easily understandable to all stakeholders, regardless of their technical background.

To effectively communicate the problem statement, it is important to use visual aids such as charts, graphs, and diagrams. These visuals can help to illustrate the problem and its impact, making it easier for stakeholders to understand. Additionally, it is important to involve all stakeholders in the problem statement writing process, as their input and feedback can help to ensure that the statement accurately reflects the problem and its impact.

In conclusion, writing an effective problem statement is crucial for the success of any project in the Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences. By using advanced techniques such as a multiset approach, incorporating open problems, and utilizing implicit data structures, researchers can effectively define and communicate the problem statement. Additionally, involving all stakeholders and using visual aids can help to ensure that the problem statement accurately reflects the problem and its impact.

#### 19.1a Review of Presentation Techniques

Effective oral communication is a crucial skill for any scientist, especially in the fields of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences. As researchers in these fields, we are often tasked with presenting complex and technical information to a variety of audiences, from colleagues and peers to policymakers and the general public. The ability to effectively communicate our findings and ideas is essential for advancing our research and making an impact in our respective fields.

One of the key techniques for effective oral communication is understanding your audience. This involves identifying their level of knowledge and interest in the topic, as well as any potential barriers to understanding, such as cultural or linguistic differences. By understanding our audience, we can tailor our message to effectively convey our ideas and ensure that our audience is engaged and interested.

Another important technique is the use of visual aids. Visual aids, such as graphs, charts, and images, can be powerful tools for conveying complex information in a clear and concise manner. They can also help to engage and captivate our audience, making our presentation more memorable and impactful. However, it is important to use visual aids effectively and avoid overcrowding or cluttered designs.

The art of storytelling is also a crucial aspect of effective oral communication. By framing our research and ideas as a story, we can make them more relatable and engaging for our audience. This involves identifying the key elements of our story, such as the main characters (e.g. our research team), the conflict (e.g. the problem we are trying to solve), and the resolution (e.g. our findings and implications). By incorporating storytelling into our presentations, we can effectively communicate the importance and relevance of our research to our audience.

In addition to these techniques, there are also practical tips and exercises that can help us apply these concepts in our own presentations. These include practicing our delivery, seeking feedback from peers, and incorporating interactive elements, such as audience participation or group activities. By continuously honing our presentation skills, we can become more effective communicators and make a greater impact in our respective fields.

## Structure

This suite consists of five movements # Tonal memory

## Experiments

In the research conducted by Vuvan and her associates, the first experiment aimed to figure out whether the expectancies that are made by tonal melody will affect the memory for single tones. Twenty people were enlisted to be part of the experiment where four of the twenty participants had no musical training at all. These participants listened to an American melody in G-major and right after heard a single probe tone. They were then asked to state whether the probe tone that was heard was in the melody that was previously played. There were a total of 216 trials made to complete the first experiment. In the second experiment, a new group of twenty participants was selected but they all have had years of musical training. The procedure is exactly the same as the first experiment, but the main difference is that the melody is now presented in a minor key. Lastly, the third experiment with a new set of participants who also have experience in musical training. Again, the procedure is the same as experiments one and two but the key difference is that they used an atonal melody for these participants to listen to.

Lilach's and her associates conducted two experiments. In the first experiment, eight undergraduate students were selected who had no musical training at all. They listened to pairs of isochronous tone sequences while simultaneously doing a task to see how accurate they were at comparing the two sequences. The results showed that those with more musical training were better at identifying the similarities and differences between the two sequences. This experiment suggests that musical training can improve one's ability to remember and identify patterns in sound.

In the second experiment, Lilach and her associates explored the effects of musical training on tonal memory. Twenty participants with varying levels of musical training were asked to listen to a series of tones and then identify them from a set of options. The results showed that those with more musical training were better at identifying the tones, suggesting that musical training can improve one's ability to remember and identify specific tones.

These experiments demonstrate the importance of musical training in developing and enhancing tonal memory. By studying and practicing music, individuals can improve their ability to remember and identify patterns in sound, which can have applications in various fields such as speech recognition and language processing.

### Subsection: 19.2b Self-Assessment of Learning

#### The Importance of Self-Assessment

Self-assessment is a crucial skill for students to develop, especially in the field of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences. It allows students to take ownership of their learning and to critically evaluate their own progress. This not only helps students to identify areas of strength and weakness, but also encourages them to take responsibility for their own learning and growth.

#### The Need for Additional Training

Despite the importance of self-assessment, studies have shown that students often struggle with this skill. One of the main difficulties is the accuracy of their assessments. Orsmond, Merry, and Reiling (1997) found that students often misjudged their assessments, with 86% of students showing overall disagreement between their self-assessment scores and those of the teacher. This highlights the need for additional training and support for students in developing their self-assessment skills.

#### Strategies for Effective Self-Assessment

To address these challenges, Sadler (1989) suggests that teachers guide students in critical evaluation of their learning. This involves passing the responsibility of assessment to the student, with the teacher acting as a guide. By providing guided but direct and authentic evaluative experience for students, they can develop their evaluative knowledge and become part of the "guild" of people who are able to determine quality using multiple criteria. This not only helps students to improve their self-assessment skills, but also encourages them to take responsibility for their own learning and growth.

#### The Impact of Self-Assessment Training

A study by McDonald and Boud (2003) investigated whether introducing self-assessment training would affect student learning. The results showed that students who were trained in self-assessment strategies outperformed their peers in all curriculum assessments. This highlights the effectiveness of self-assessment training in improving student learning.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, self-assessment is a crucial skill for students to develop in the field of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences.

2. **Measurable:** I will increase my score on the final exam by at least 10%.

3. **Achievable:** I will practice my communication skills by participating in a student research symposium.

4. **Relevant:** My goal aligns with my career aspirations of becoming a science communicator.

5. **Time-bound:** I will achieve this goal by the end of my undergraduate degree.

#### 20.3e Creating a Learning Plan

Once we have set our learning goals, we can create a learning plan to guide our future learning. This plan should outline the steps we will take to achieve our goals, including specific actions, resources, and timelines.

Here is an example of a learning plan for the learning goal above:

1. **Specific Actions:** Participate in a student research symposium, attend workshops on effective communication, practice communicating complex scientific concepts to peers.

2. **Resources:** Use resources provided by the course, attend workshops, seek feedback from peers and instructors.

3. **Timeline:** By the end of each semester, I will participate in a student research symposium. By the end of my undergraduate degree, I will have achieved my goal of increasing my score on the final exam by at least 10%.

#### 20.3f Reflecting on Your Learning Plan

As we progress through our learning plan, it is important to regularly reflect on our progress. This can help us identify areas where we may need to adjust our plan or goals, and can also help us celebrate our achievements.

Here are some questions to guide your reflection:

1. **What progress have you made towards your learning goals?**

2. **What challenges have you faced and how have you overcome them?**

3. **What resources have been most helpful in your learning?**

4. **What changes would you make to your learning plan?**

5. **How will you celebrate your achievements?**

By planning for future learning, we can ensure that we continue to develop our communication skills and achieve our goals. Remember, effective oral communication is a journey, not a destination.
