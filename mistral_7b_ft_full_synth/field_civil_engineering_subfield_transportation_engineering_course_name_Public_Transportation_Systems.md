#### 5.3a Understanding High Ridership Corridors

High ridership corridors are defined as routes or corridors that have a high demand for public transportation. This demand can be measured in terms of the number of riders, the frequency of service, or the length of the corridor. These corridors are often located in urban areas with dense populations and a high concentration of jobs, businesses, and other destinations.

One of the key challenges in managing high ridership corridors is balancing the needs of different user groups. These corridors often serve a diverse group of riders, including commuters, students, and tourists. Each of these groups may have different travel patterns and preferences, making it challenging to design a single solution that meets the needs of all users.

To address this challenge, it is important to consider the needs and preferences of different user groups when designing HPT strategies for high ridership corridors. This can be achieved through a combination of data analysis, public engagement, and innovative design solutions.

#### 5.3b High Ridership Corridor Strategies

There are several strategies that can be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of high ridership corridors. These strategies can be broadly categorized into three main areas: capacity improvement, frequency enhancement, and amenity upgrades.

Capacity improvement strategies aim to increase the number of riders that can be accommodated on a given corridor. This can be achieved through a variety of means, including adding more buses or trains, increasing the size of vehicles, or implementing dedicated lanes or bus rapid transit systems.

Frequency enhancement strategies aim to increase the frequency of service on a given corridor. This can be achieved through a variety of means, including adding more buses or trains, reducing travel times, or implementing express services.

Amenity upgrades aim to improve the overall travel experience for riders on a given corridor. This can be achieved through a variety of means, including adding more comfortable seating, providing real-time travel information, or implementing bike-sharing programs.

#### 5.3c Case Studies of High Ridership Corridor Strategies

To further illustrate the concepts discussed in this section, let's take a look at some case studies of high ridership corridor strategies.

One example is the Division Street corridor in Spokane, Washington. This corridor is identified as a high performance transit (HPT) route in the city's Connect Spokane plan. The HPT implementation strategy for this corridor includes a three-phase approach, with near, mid, and long-term development stages. The near-term strategies focus on improving capacity and frequency, while the mid-term strategies aim to enhance the overall travel experience through amenity upgrades. The long-term strategies will transition the corridor to electric bus rapid transit vehicles in center-running transit-only lanes.

Another example is the 42nd Street corridor in New York City. This corridor is served by the 42nd Street Shuttle, a dedicated bus route that connects Grand Central Terminal with Times Square. The shuttle operates every 10 minutes during peak hours and every 15 minutes during off-peak hours. The corridor also has dedicated bus lanes and off-board fare payment, making it a popular choice for commuters and tourists alike.

In conclusion, high ridership corridors are essential for the success of any public transportation system. By understanding the needs and preferences of different user groups and implementing a combination of capacity improvement, frequency enhancement, and amenity upgrades, these corridors can be optimized to provide efficient and effective service for all users.

#### Simulation Models

Simulation models are powerful tools that allow transportation planners and policymakers to test the impact of various factors on the system's performance. They work by creating a computer simulation of the system, which can be used to replicate the behavior of the system under different conditions. For example, a simulation model could be used to test the impact of a new bus route, a change in service levels, or an infrastructure improvement on the system's on-time performance.

One of the main advantages of simulation models is that they allow for the testing of scenarios that may not be feasible or practical in the real world. For example, a simulation model could be used to test the impact of a major infrastructure improvement, such as a new bus rapid transit system, without the need for a costly and time-consuming construction project.

However, simulation models also have limitations. They rely on assumptions and simplifications, which may not accurately reflect the real-world system. For example, a simulation model may assume that all buses arrive at their destinations on time, even though in reality, buses may be delayed by traffic or other factors. Therefore, it is important to validate the results of simulation models with real-world data.

#### Optimization Models

Optimization models use mathematical optimization techniques to find the best solution to a specific problem. In the context of public transportation systems, optimization models can be used to optimize the system's performance by finding the most efficient service levels, routes, or schedules.

One of the main advantages of optimization models is that they can handle complex systems with multiple variables and constraints. For example, an optimization model could be used to find the most efficient routes for a bus network, taking into account factors such as traffic patterns, travel times, and service levels.

However, optimization models also have limitations. They may not consider all relevant factors, and they may not be able to handle complex, real-world systems with all their intricacies. Therefore, it is important to use optimization models in conjunction with other types of models to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the system's performance.

#### Statistical Models

Statistical models use statistical techniques to analyze and interpret data. They can be used to identify patterns and trends in the system's performance, and to predict future performance based on historical data.

One of the main advantages of statistical models is that they can handle large amounts of data and can provide valuable insights into the system's performance. For example, a statistical model could be used to identify the factors that contribute most to delays in the system, or to predict future demand for public transportation services.

However, statistical models also have limitations. They may not be able to capture the complexity of the system, and they may not be able to handle complex, real-world systems with all their intricacies. Therefore, it is important to use statistical models in conjunction with other types of models to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the system's performance.

### Subsection: 6.1c Case Studies of Performance Models

To further illustrate the application and effectiveness of performance models in public transportation systems, let's consider a few case studies.

### Subsection: 6.2a Transit Service Reliability

Transit service reliability is a critical aspect of public transportation systems. It refers to the ability of a transit system to consistently provide timely and reliable service to its users. In this section, we will discuss the importance of transit service reliability and its impact on the overall performance of a public transportation system.

Transit service reliability is a key factor in determining the quality of service provided by a public transportation system. It directly impacts the user experience and satisfaction. A reliable transit system is one that consistently delivers the promised service, i.e., the service is timely, frequent, and predictable. This is particularly important for users who rely on public transportation for their daily commute or other essential trips.

Transit service reliability is also closely linked to the concept of transit service quality. As mentioned in the previous section, transit service quality is a multidimensional concept that encompasses various aspects of the user experience. Reliability is one of these dimensions, and it is often considered a key indicator of service quality. A reliable transit system is generally perceived as a high-quality system by its users.

The importance of transit service reliability is further underscored by its impact on ridership. A reliable transit system can attract and retain more riders, leading to increased ridership and revenue. Conversely, a system with poor reliability can result in decreased ridership and revenue. Therefore, transit service reliability is a crucial factor in the financial sustainability of a public transportation system.

Transit service reliability can be measured and evaluated using various methods. One common approach is to calculate the on-time performance of transit vehicles, i.e., the percentage of vehicles that arrive at their destination within a specified time window. Another approach is to measure the variability in travel times, i.e., the difference between the expected and actual travel times. Both of these metrics can provide valuable insights into the reliability of a transit system.

In the next section, we will discuss the factors that can affect transit service reliability and how transit agencies can improve it.
