### Subsection 1.2a The Origin and Principles of Theory U

Theory U is a leadership theory that was developed by Otto Scharmer, a senior lecturer at MIT and founder of the Presencing Institute. It is based on the concept of "presencing," which is the ability to sense and respond to the emerging future. Theory U provides a framework for leading profound innovation by creating a space for individuals and organizations to connect with their deeper purpose and the emerging future.

#### The Origin of Theory U

Theory U was developed out of Scharmer's research on the theory of change in social systems. He observed that many social systems, including organizations, communities, and societies, were facing complex challenges that could not be solved using traditional linear approaches. He also noticed that these systems often had a deep sense of purpose and potential that was not being fully realized. This led him to develop Theory U as a way to tap into this deeper purpose and potential.

#### The Principles of Theory U

Theory U is based on three key principles: presence, co-creation, and transformation. Presence refers to the ability to be fully present and aware of the current situation. Co-creation involves the active collaboration and engagement of all stakeholders in creating a new future. Transformation is the process of bringing the emerging future into the present.

#### Presencing

Presencing is the foundation of Theory U. It is the ability to sense and respond to the emerging future. This involves being fully present and aware of the current situation, while also being open to the possibilities of the future. Presencing is not a passive state, but an active process of sensing, thinking, and acting. It requires a deep level of self-awareness and the ability to connect with the deeper purpose and potential of oneself and others.

#### Co-creation

Co-creation is the process of creating a new future through the active collaboration and engagement of all stakeholders. This involves moving beyond traditional power dynamics and hierarchies, and creating a space where everyone's voices and perspectives are valued. Co-creation requires a deep level of trust and a willingness to engage in dialogue and dialogue.

#### Transformation

Transformation is the process of bringing the emerging future into the present. It involves taking the insights and possibilities that emerge from presencing and co-creation, and translating them into action. This can involve making changes at the individual, organizational, or societal level. Transformation requires a deep level of commitment and a willingness to challenge the status quo.

#### Theory U in Practice

Theory U has been applied in a variety of contexts, including business, education, and community development. It has been used to facilitate strategic planning, organizational change, and leadership development. Theory U has also been used in U-Lab, a massive open online course (MOOC) that aims to equip individuals and organizations with the skills and tools to lead profound innovation for a more sustainable world.

There are several methods for deep diving into the current reality. One such method is the "Five Whys" technique, which involves asking "why" five times to get to the root cause of a problem. This technique helps to uncover underlying issues and assumptions that may be hindering progress.

Another method is the "Systems Thinking" approach, which involves understanding the interconnections and feedback loops within a system. This approach helps to identify the key drivers of change and to understand how different parts of the system interact with each other.

Deep diving into the current reality also involves exploring potential solutions. This can be done through brainstorming sessions, design thinking workshops, or other creative problem-solving techniques. The goal is to generate a wide range of ideas and perspectives, which can then be evaluated and refined.

In conclusion, deep diving into the current reality is a crucial aspect of co-sensing. It provides a shared understanding of the current situation, helps to identify the direction of change, and allows for the co-creation of innovative solutions. By engaging stakeholders and co-creators and deep diving into the current reality, we can build a strong foundation for leading profound innovation and creating a more sustainable world.




#### 2.1d Uncovering Systemic Leverage Points

After deep diving into the current reality, the next step in co-sensing is to uncover systemic leverage points. These are the key drivers of change within the system that can have a significant impact on the direction of innovation.

Uncovering systemic leverage points involves understanding the interconnections and feedback loops within a system. This can be done through various methods, such as systems thinking, causal loop diagrams, and stock and flow diagrams. These methods help to identify the key drivers of change and to understand how different parts of the system interact with each other.

One of the most effective ways to uncover systemic leverage points is through the use of leverage-point modeling. This involves analyzing the results of a model to explore positive or negative behaviors, looking for sources of pressure and imbalance that cause things to change, and determining changes to structure so that behavior is improved and bad events become less frequent.

In the language of system dynamics, important system variables are represented as stocks, flows, and feedback loops. Stocks are the accumulations points in a system, such as water in a bathtub or inventory in a warehouse. Flows are the variables that add to or subtract from stocks, such as the flow of water into or out of a bathtub. Feedback loops are the interactions between stocks and flows that generate the dynamic behavior of the system.

By uncovering systemic leverage points, we can identify the key drivers of change and develop strategies to address them. This can lead to more effective and sustainable solutions for the current reality. It also allows for a more collaborative and co-creative approach to innovation, as stakeholders and co-creators can work together to address the root causes of problems and develop innovative solutions.

In the next section, we will explore some specific methods for uncovering systemic leverage points, including leverage-point modeling and the use of causal loop diagrams and stock and flow diagrams. We will also discuss how to use these methods to develop strategies for addressing systemic leverage points and driving profound innovation.





#### 2.2a Translating Ideas into Tangible Prototypes

After uncovering systemic leverage points, the next step in co-sensing is to translate these ideas into tangible prototypes. This involves taking the abstract concepts and theories developed in the previous stages and creating physical representations that can be tested and refined.

Translating ideas into tangible prototypes is a crucial part of the innovation process. It allows for a more concrete understanding of the system and its dynamics, and provides a basis for further exploration and experimentation. It also allows for a more collaborative and hands-on approach to innovation, as stakeholders and co-creators can work together to refine and improve the prototype.

There are several methods for translating ideas into tangible prototypes. One of the most effective is through the use of tangible user interfaces (TUIs). TUIs are physical interfaces that allow for the manipulation and interaction with digital data in a tangible way. They have been shown to increase learning performance by offering multimodal feedback and leaving as much cognitive capacity as possible for learning (Ottosson, S).

Another method is through the use of physical icons, or phicons. Phicons are tangible interfaces that hold a reference to some digital object and convey meaning. They were first used in the metaDesk project built in 1997 by Professor Hiroshi Ishii's tangible bits research group at MIT. The metaDesk consisted of a table whose surface showed a rear-projected video image. Placing a phicon on the table triggered sensors that altered the video projection.

In addition to TUIs and phicons, there are also various software prototyping tools available, such as the Simple Function Point method and lean product development.

### Subsection: 3.1a Causes and Impacts of Climate Change

Climate change is a complex issue with far-reaching impacts on our planet and its inhabitants. It is caused by the increase in greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere, which trap heat and alter the Earth's climate. This increase is primarily due to human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes.

The effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, affecting oceans, ice, and weather. Changes may occur gradually or rapidly, and evidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past, from modelling, and from modern observations. Since the 1950s, droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency. Extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased in India and East Asia. The rainfall rate and intensity of hurricanes and typhoons is likely increasing, and the geographic range likely expanding poleward in response to climate warming. Frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased as a result of climate change.

Global sea level is rising as a consequence of glacial melt, melt of the Greenland ice sheets and Antarctica, and thermal expansion. Between 1993 and 2020, the rise increased over time, averaging 3.3 ± 0.3 mm per year. Over the 21st century, the IPCC projects that in a very high emissions scenario the sea level could rise by 61–110 cm. Increased ocean warmth is undermining and threatening to unplug Antarctic glacier outlets, risking a large melt of the ice sheet and the possibility of a 2-meter sea level rise by 2100 under high emissions.

Climate change has led to decades of shrinking and thinning of the Arctic sea ice. While ice-free summers are expected to be rare at 1.5 °C degrees of warming, they are set to occur once every three to ten years at a warming level of 2 °C. Higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations have led to changes in ocean chemistry. An increase in dissolved CO2 is causing oceans to acidify. In addition, oxygen levels are decreasing as oxygen is less soluble in warmer water. Dead zones in the ocean, regions with very little oxygen, are expanding too.

The impacts of climate change are not only environmental but also social and economic. Changes in climate can lead to food and water insecurity, displacement of communities, and increased frequency and severity of natural disasters. Climate change also poses a threat to biodiversity, as species struggle to adapt to changing temperatures and habitats.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of sustainability and its importance in addressing the challenges posed by climate change.

#### 3.3d.1 The Endangered Species Act

The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is a federal law in the United States that provides for the conservation of species that are endangered or threatened throughout all or a significant portion of their range, and the conservation of species that are extinct in the wild in the United States. The ESA is administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service.

The ESA lists species as endangered or threatened based on the best scientific and commercial information available. The Act defines an endangered species as any species that is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. A threatened species is any species that is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range.

#### 3.3d.2 Species Recovery Plans

Once a species is listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA, a species recovery plan is developed. This plan outlines the steps necessary to recover the species, including specific goals and objectives, and identifies the actions needed to achieve those goals. The plan is developed in consultation with the states, local governments, and the public.

The recovery plan serves as a roadmap for the conservation of the species. It provides a framework for decision-making and prioritization of conservation efforts. The plan is updated periodically to reflect changes in the status of the species and new information about its biology and threats.

#### 3.3d.3 Species Recovery Programs

Species recovery programs are implemented to carry out the actions outlined in the recovery plan. These programs involve a range of activities, including habitat restoration, captive breeding, and reintroduction of individuals into the wild. The goal is to increase the population size of the species, thereby reducing the risk of extinction.

#### 3.3d.4 Public Education and Involvement

Public education and involvement are crucial for the success of species recovery efforts. The public is informed about the status of the species and the actions being taken to recover it. Public involvement is encouraged through activities such as volunteer monitoring and stewardship programs, public meetings, and educational outreach.

#### 4.1a Alternative Economic Models

As we have seen in the previous sections, our current economic systems are facing significant challenges. The traditional models of economic growth and development are no longer sufficient to address the complex and interconnected issues of our time. In this section, we will explore some alternative economic models that offer promising solutions to these challenges.

##### Agent-Based Computational Economics (ACE)

Agent-Based Computational Economics (ACE) is a modeling methodology that seeks to break down aggregate macroeconomic relationships into microeconomic decisions of individual agents. This approach is similar to the DSGE methodology, but with some key differences. Unlike DSGE models, ACE models often specify the strategies of agents instead of their preferences, and they often include a learning rule whereby these strategies are adjusted according to their past success. This allows for a more realistic representation of individual decision-making, which can lead to more accurate predictions of macroeconomic phenomena.

##### Post-Keynesian Economics

Post-Keynesian economics is another alternative economic model that offers a promising solution to the challenges of our current economic systems. This model is based on the ideas of John Maynard Keynes, but it has been updated and expanded to address the complexities of modern economies. Post-Keynesian economics emphasizes the role of aggregate demand in driving economic growth, and it rejects the neoclassical assumption of full employment. This model also allows for the possibility of endogenous money creation, which can help to address the issue of inadequate aggregate demand.

##### Ecological Economics

Ecological economics is an economic model that takes into account the environmental impacts of economic activities. This model recognizes that economic growth cannot continue indefinitely on a finite planet, and it seeks to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability. Ecological economics also emphasizes the importance of intergenerational equity, recognizing that future generations have a right to inherit a healthy planet.

##### Social Economics

Social economics is an economic model that emphasizes the social and ethical implications of economic activities. This model recognizes that economic decisions have social and ethical consequences, and it seeks to promote economic systems that are fair and equitable for all members of society. Social economics also emphasizes the importance of community and local economies, recognizing that these can provide more meaningful and sustainable alternatives to the globalized, profit-driven economy.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into each of these alternative economic models, exploring their key principles, assumptions, and applications. We will also discuss how these models can be integrated into our current economic systems to create a more sustainable and equitable world.

#### 4.1b Critique of Current Economic Systems

The current economic systems, particularly those of the Global North, are facing a multitude of challenges that are unsustainable in the long run. These challenges include, but are not limited to, economic inequality, environmental degradation, and social instability. 

##### Economic Inequality

Economic inequality is a significant challenge faced by current economic systems. The World Bank reports that the richest 10% of the world's population owns 85% of global wealth, while the poorest 50% owns less than 1% of global wealth. This inequality is not only a matter of fairness, but it also has significant implications for economic stability. High levels of economic inequality can lead to social instability, as those who feel excluded from the economic system may turn to violence or other forms of social unrest.

##### Environmental Degradation

Environmental degradation is another significant challenge faced by current economic systems. The current economic system is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, which contributes to climate change and other environmental issues. The World Bank estimates that the costs of climate change could reach up to 18% of global GDP by 2050. This is a significant financial burden, but it also has implications for the sustainability of our planet. If we continue to degrade our environment at the current rate, we may reach a point where our economic systems can no longer function.

##### Social Instability

Social instability is a third significant challenge faced by current economic systems. The current economic system is often characterized by high levels of individualism and competition, which can lead to social isolation and a lack of community. This can have negative impacts on mental health and well-being, and it can also contribute to social instability.

In conclusion, the current economic systems of the Global North are facing significant challenges that are unsustainable in the long run. These challenges require a profound rethinking of our economic systems, and the development of alternative economic models that prioritize sustainability, equity, and community.

#### 4.1c Case Studies of Unsustainable Economic Systems

To further illustrate the challenges faced by current economic systems, let's examine some case studies from the Global North.

##### The United States

The United States is a prime example of an unsustainable economic system. The country's economic inequality is among the highest in the world. According to the World Bank, the richest 10% of the US population owns 70% of the country's wealth, while the poorest 50% owns less than 1% of the country's wealth. This inequality is reflected in the country's social instability, with high levels of poverty and social unrest.

The US also faces significant environmental challenges. The country is one of the largest consumers of fossil fuels in the world, contributing significantly to climate change and environmental degradation. The costs of climate change are estimated to reach up to 10% of the country's GDP by 2050.

##### The United Kingdom

The United Kingdom also faces significant challenges in its economic system. The country's economic inequality is among the highest in the European Union. According to the World Bank, the richest 10% of the UK population owns 50% of the country's wealth, while the poorest 50% owns less than 1% of the country's wealth. This inequality is reflected in the country's social instability, with high levels of poverty and social unrest.

The UK also faces significant environmental challenges. The country is one of the largest consumers of fossil fuels in the world, contributing significantly to climate change and environmental degradation. The costs of climate change are estimated to reach up to 10% of the country's GDP by 2050.

##### The European Union

The European Union as a whole faces significant challenges in its economic system. The EU's economic inequality is among the highest in the world. According to the World Bank, the richest 10% of the EU population owns 50% of the EU's wealth, while the poorest 50% owns less than 1% of the EU's wealth. This inequality is reflected in the EU's social instability, with high levels of poverty and social unrest.

The EU also faces significant environmental challenges. The EU is one of the largest consumers of fossil fuels in the world, contributing significantly to climate change and environmental degradation. The costs of climate change are estimated to reach up to 10% of the EU's GDP by 2050.

These case studies illustrate the challenges faced by current economic systems in the Global North. They highlight the need for a profound rethinking of our economic systems, and the development of alternative economic models that prioritize sustainability, equity, and community.




#### 4.1b Circular and Regenerative Economy

The current economic systems are unsustainable due to their linear nature, where resources are extracted, used, and disposed of. This approach not only depletes natural resources but also leads to environmental pollution and degradation. To address these issues, there have been efforts to develop alternative economic models that promote circularity and regeneration.

##### Circular Economy

A circular economy is an economic system that aims to eliminate waste and promote the continual use of resources. This is achieved through the design of products and processes that can be reused, repaired, or recycled. The concept of circularity is not new and has been practiced in various forms throughout history. However, with the increasing awareness of the environmental impacts of our current economic systems, the concept of circularity has gained significant attention.

The design of circularity processes is crucial for sustainability and health. The current recycling practices, while commendable, are often inefficient and have negative impacts on human health and the environment. Therefore, it is essential to design circularity processes that minimize these negative impacts and maximize resource efficiency. This can be achieved through the implementation of circular business models.

##### Circular Business Models

Circular business models are designed to leverage the technology and capabilities for circularity and promote the transition towards a circular economy. These models focus on closing, narrowing, slowing, intensifying, and dematerializing loops to minimize resource inputs and waste and emission leakage. This is achieved through various strategies, such as recycling measures, efficiency improvements, use phase extensions, intense use, and the substitution of products by services.

One example of a platform that supports organizations transitioning to circular business models is Rheaply. This platform focuses on asset management and disposition to support organizations in reducing waste and promoting circularity.

In conclusion, the development of alternative economic models, such as circular and regenerative economies, is crucial for addressing the challenges of our current economic systems. These models not only promote sustainability but also offer opportunities for innovation and growth. As we continue to face the complex and interconnected issues of our time, it is essential to explore and implement these alternative economic models to create a more sustainable world.





#### 4.1c Socially Responsible Business Practices

Socially responsible business practices are becoming increasingly important in today's business landscape. As consumers become more conscious of the impact of their purchases, they are demanding that businesses operate in a way that is not only financially profitable but also socially and environmentally responsible. This has led to the rise of socially responsible business practices, which aim to create value for all stakeholders, including employees, customers, and the local community.

##### Socially Responsible Business Practices in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs)

SMEs, due to their size and limited resources, often approach socially responsible business practices in a more direct and personal manner. These enterprises create value and positive contributions towards employees, customers, and the local community through various practices. For example, maintaining a good working condition, creating a healthy relationship with stakeholders, and providing accurate and honest information about the products or services.

The adoption of socially responsible business practices by SMEs has potential business benefits, including improved employee satisfaction, increased customer loyalty, and enhanced reputation in the local community. Additionally, SMEs can also benefit from the growing trend of consumers preferring to consume goods that are produced in a socially responsible way.

##### Certification and Impact Assessment Models

To further promote socially responsible business practices, various certification and impact assessment models have been developed. One such example is the B Corporation (certification), which allows companies to become certified as a business that is better for people, community, and the planet. The B Corporation Impact Assessment model allows for diverse companies to both compete and collaborate to become more socially responsible.

Other industries have also developed organizations dedicated to promoting socially responsible business practices. For example, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has developed ISO 26000, which provides guidance on social responsibility for businesses and organizations.

##### Sustainability Initiatives

In addition to socially responsible business practices, many businesses are also incorporating sustainability initiatives into their operations. This includes addressing social sustainability issues, such as worker's rights, working conditions, child labor, and human trafficking. By complying with national and international initiatives, guidelines, and standards, businesses can demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and gain a competitive advantage in the market.

In conclusion, socially responsible business practices are becoming increasingly important in today's business landscape. As consumers demand more from businesses, SMEs and large corporations alike are adopting these practices to create value for all stakeholders and gain a competitive advantage. By incorporating socially responsible business practices and sustainability initiatives, businesses can contribute to a more sustainable world and create long-term value for all stakeholders.





#### 4.1d Reducing Wealth Disparity

Wealth disparity, or the unequal distribution of wealth among different groups, is a significant issue in many societies. It is often a result of systemic discrimination and exclusion, as well as unequal access to opportunities and resources. In the United States, for example, African Americans and Hispanics have historically faced significant wealth disparities compared to white Americans.

##### The Role of Financial Literacy

One factor contributing to wealth disparity is financial literacy. Lusardi's research has shown that education increases one's chances of having a banking account. A full high school education increases the chance of having a checking account by 15% compared to only an elementary education; having a parent with a high school education rather than only an elementary education increases one's chances of having a checking account by 20%. This suggests that improving financial literacy can help reduce wealth disparity by increasing access to financial services and investment opportunities.

##### Addressing Wealth Disparity

Addressing wealth disparity requires a multifaceted approach. It involves not only improving financial literacy but also addressing systemic discrimination and exclusion. This can be achieved through policies and programs that promote equal access to education, employment, and financial services. It also involves promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace and in leadership positions.

##### The Role of Businesses

Businesses can play a crucial role in reducing wealth disparity. By implementing socially responsible business practices, businesses can create value for all stakeholders, including employees, customers, and the local community. This can help reduce wealth disparity by providing equal opportunities for all employees and promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace.

In conclusion, reducing wealth disparity is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive approach. It involves improving financial literacy, addressing systemic discrimination and exclusion, and promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Businesses can play a crucial role in this process by implementing socially responsible business practices.




#### 4.2a Causes and Consequences of Environmental Degradation

Environmental degradation is a complex issue with multiple causes and far-reaching consequences. It is a result of human activities that disrupt the natural balance of the environment, leading to depletion of resources, pollution, and loss of biodiversity. This section will explore the causes and consequences of environmental degradation, with a focus on the role of population growth and economic growth.

##### Population Growth and Environmental Degradation

Population growth is a significant factor contributing to environmental degradation. As the human population continues to expand, the demand for resources increases, leading to overexploitation of natural resources. This overexploitation can result in resource depletion, which is a major cause of environmental degradation. For instance, the depletion of freshwater resources due to overuse and pollution is a significant concern. According to the United Nations, it is estimated that almost a quarter of the global population is living in an area that is using more than 20% of their renewable water supply. This overuse of water resources is expected to increase with population growth, further exacerbating the issue of water scarcity.

Moreover, population growth also leads to increased pollution. As the population grows, so does the demand for goods and services, which in turn increases industrial activity. This industrial activity is a major source of pollution, contributing to the degradation of air and water quality. For example, the smoke emitted by production industries includes harmful gases such as carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide, which can have detrimental effects on the environment and human health.

##### Economic Growth and Environmental Degradation

Economic growth, driven by increased industrial activity, is another major cause of environmental degradation. As economies grow, so does the demand for resources, leading to overexploitation and depletion of natural resources. This overexploitation can result in resource depletion, which is a major cause of environmental degradation. For instance, the depletion of freshwater resources due to overuse and pollution is a significant concern. According to the United Nations, it is estimated that almost a quarter of the global population is living in an area that is using more than 20% of their renewable water supply. This overuse of water resources is expected to increase with population growth, further exacerbating the issue of water scarcity.

Moreover, economic growth also leads to increased pollution. As economies grow, so does the demand for goods and services, which in turn increases industrial activity. This industrial activity is a major source of pollution, contributing to the degradation of air and water quality. For example, the smoke emitted by production industries includes harmful gases such as carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide, which can have detrimental effects on the environment and human health.

##### Consequences of Environmental Degradation

The consequences of environmental degradation are far-reaching and can have significant impacts on both the environment and human health. Environmental degradation can lead to loss of biodiversity, disruption of ecosystems, and depletion of natural resources. It can also result in increased frequency and severity of natural disasters, such as floods and droughts, due to changes in climate patterns. Furthermore, environmental degradation can have significant economic impacts, as it can lead to loss of jobs and economic productivity.

In conclusion, environmental degradation is a complex issue with multiple causes and far-reaching consequences. It is a result of human activities that disrupt the natural balance of the environment, leading to depletion of resources, pollution, and loss of biodiversity. Addressing environmental degradation requires a comprehensive approach that includes population control, sustainable economic growth, and responsible resource management.

#### 4.2b Strategies for Mitigating Environmental Degradation

Environmental degradation is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach to mitigate its effects. This section will explore some strategies that can be employed to reduce environmental degradation, with a focus on the role of population control and sustainable economic growth.

##### Population Control and Environmental Degradation

Population control is a crucial strategy for mitigating environmental degradation. As discussed in the previous section, population growth is a significant factor contributing to environmental degradation. Therefore, reducing population growth can help alleviate the pressure on natural resources and reduce pollution.

Ethical decision-making is a crucial aspect of ethical leadership. It involves the process of evaluating and choosing the best course of action based on ethical principles and values. In this section, we will explore the various ethical decision-making frameworks that can guide leaders in making ethical decisions.

#### 6.1a Promoting Ethical Behavior in Organizations

Promoting ethical behavior in organizations is essential for creating a culture of ethical leadership. It involves creating an environment where ethical values and principles are upheld and reinforced. This can be achieved through various means, including ethical leadership training, ethical codes of conduct, and ethical decision-making frameworks.

One of the most effective ways to promote ethical behavior in organizations is through ethical leadership training. This involves providing leaders with the necessary tools and knowledge to make ethical decisions. It can include workshops, seminars, and other forms of training that focus on ethical leadership principles and decision-making. By equipping leaders with the necessary skills and knowledge, organizations can create a culture of ethical leadership that permeates throughout the entire organization.

Another way to promote ethical behavior in organizations is through ethical codes of conduct. These codes outline the ethical standards and values that employees are expected to uphold. They serve as a guide for ethical decision-making and help employees understand the ethical expectations of the organization. By implementing ethical codes of conduct, organizations can create a clear framework for ethical behavior and hold employees accountable for their actions.

Ethical decision-making frameworks can also play a crucial role in promoting ethical behavior in organizations. These frameworks provide a structured approach for leaders to make ethical decisions. They can include ethical theories, ethical decision-making models, and ethical decision-making tools. By using these frameworks, leaders can make decisions that align with the organization's ethical values and principles.

One commonly used ethical decision-making framework is the Ethical Leadership Scale (ELS). Developed by Brown et al. in 2005, the ELS consists of 10 items with an internal consistency of alpha = .92. It is a widely used measure of ethical leadership and can be used to assess the ethical behavior of leaders in organizations.

Another ethical decision-making framework is the Ethical Leadership at Work Questionnaire proposed by Kalshoven et al. with 38 items. This framework focuses on the ethical leadership behaviors of leaders and how they impact the ethical climate of the organization.

Lastly, the Ethical Leadership Questionnaire (ELQ) proposed by Yukl et al. in 2013 is another commonly used ethical decision-making framework. It consists of 15 items and focuses on the ethical leadership behaviors of leaders and their impact on followers.

By implementing these ethical decision-making frameworks, organizations can promote ethical behavior and create a culture of ethical leadership. This not only benefits the organization but also contributes to a more sustainable world by upholding ethical values and principles in all aspects of business.

One of the most notable examples of resilient leadership in action is the response of the Calgary Police Service (CPS) to the 2013 floods in Alberta, Canada. The CPS, under the leadership of Chief Rick Hanson, demonstrated resilient leadership by adapting to the changing circumstances and leading their community through a time of uncertainty.

The CPS was divided into several sections, each with a specific role in managing the flood response. These sections worked together seamlessly, demonstrating the power of collaboration in resilient leadership. The CPS also utilized systems thinking, taking a holistic approach to managing the flood response and considering the interconnectedness of all systems involved.

The CPS's response to the floods was a prime example of resilient leadership in action.

The company has a culture of innovation and encourages its employees to think outside the box. This approach has led to the development of many groundbreaking products, such as the Post-it Note and the Scotch Brand tape.

3M's resilient leadership is also evident in its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company quickly pivoted to produce face masks and other protective equipment, demonstrating its adaptability and ability to lead through uncertainty.

#### 7.1c Resilient Leadership in Communities

Resilient leadership is not just about leading organizations and businesses, but also about leading communities. One such example is the community of Post Carbon Institute, which has been working towards building community resilience since 2003.

The Post Carbon Institute's approach to resilient leadership involves building community resilience by addressing the root causes of complex social, economic, and environmental challenges. This approach aligns with the principles of resilient leadership, including systems thinking, adaptability, and collaboration.

The Post Carbon Institute's work has led to the development of the "Think Resilience" online course, which aims to equip individuals and communities with the knowledge and tools to build resilience. This course is a prime example of how resilient leadership can be applied at a community level.
