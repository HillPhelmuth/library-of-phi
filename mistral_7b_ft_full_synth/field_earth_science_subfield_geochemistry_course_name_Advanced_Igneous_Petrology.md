## Foreward

Welcome to the Advanced Igneous Petrology Textbook, a comprehensive guide to the study of igneous rocks and their formation. This book is designed for advanced undergraduate students at MIT and other institutions who are interested in the field of petrology.

The study of igneous petrology is a fascinating and complex field that has been evolving for centuries. From the early studies of Hutton and Playfair in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, to the more recent work of Hamilton and others, the understanding of igneous rocks and their formation has been shaped by a series of paradigm shifts.

In the early 19th century, the paradigm of solid-earth geology was established, which emphasized the study of rocks and their formation. This was followed by the plate tectonics paradigm in the late 20th century, which revolutionized our understanding of the Earth's surface and interior.

However, as Hamilton has pointed out, the application of plate tectonic concepts to the Precambrian geology of the Earth has been problematic. The lack of rocks and assemblages older than late Proterozoic that resemble the products of more recent plate tectonics has led to a re-evaluation of our understanding of igneous petrology.

This book aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge in the field of igneous petrology. It will cover a wide range of topics, from the formation of igneous rocks to their classification and the processes that govern their evolution.

The book will also delve into the latest research and developments in the field, including the work of Hamilton and others who have challenged the conventional wisdom on the Precambrian geology of the Earth.

We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for students and researchers in the field of igneous petrology. Our aim is to provide a textbook that is both comprehensive and accessible, and that will inspire students to further explore this fascinating field.

Thank you for choosing the Advanced Igneous Petrology Textbook. We hope you will find it a valuable addition to your studies.

Sincerely,

### Subsection: 1.1b Petrologic significance of olivine and spinel in igneous rocks

Olivine and spinel are two of the most important rock-forming minerals found in igneous rocks. They are both magnesium-rich minerals and are commonly found in the upper mantle and in the extraterrestrial environment. In this section, we will explore the petrologic significance of olivine and spinel in igneous rocks.

#### Olivine

Olivine is a common mineral found in igneous rocks, particularly in peridotites. It is a magnesium-iron silicate with a chemical formula of (Mg,Fe)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>. Olivine is typically found in the upper mantle and is a major component of the Earth's core-mantle boundary. It is also found in extraterrestrial environments, such as meteorites and planetary bodies.

The presence of olivine in igneous rocks is a key indicator of the rock's composition and origin. Olivine is commonly found in peridotites, which are highly magnesium-rich rocks. The presence of olivine in a rock can indicate that it has undergone minimal melting and has a high magnesium content. This is because olivine is one of the last minerals to melt during the crystallization of a magma, and it is also one of the most magnesium-rich minerals.

Olivine is also an important mineral in the study of the Earth's mantle. The presence of olivine in the upper mantle can provide insights into the composition and dynamics of the mantle. For example, the presence of olivine can indicate the presence of a magnesium-rich layer in the mantle, known as the D" layer. This layer is thought to be a major source of heat and chemical heterogeneity in the mantle.

#### Spinel

Spinel is another important rock-forming mineral found in igneous rocks. It is a magnesium-iron oxide with a chemical formula of MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Spinel is commonly found in the upper mantle and is a major component of the Earth's core-mantle boundary. It is also found in extraterrestrial environments, such as meteorites and planetary bodies.

The presence of spinel in igneous rocks can provide valuable information about the rock's composition and origin. Spinel is commonly found in peridotites, similar to olivine. However, spinel is more likely to be found in rocks with a higher iron content. This is because spinel is more stable at higher temperatures and pressures than olivine, making it more likely to survive the melting process.

Spinel is also an important mineral in the study of the Earth's mantle. The presence of spinel in the upper mantle can indicate the presence of a iron-rich layer, known as the B" layer. This layer is thought to be a major source of iron and other trace elements in the mantle.

In conclusion, olivine and spinel are two of the most important rock-forming minerals found in igneous rocks. Their presence can provide valuable insights into the composition and origin of these rocks, as well as the dynamics of the Earth's mantle. Further research and study of these minerals will continue to enhance our understanding of igneous petrology.





### Subsection: 1.2a Classification and crystal chemistry of pyroxenes

Pyroxenes are a group of silicate minerals that are commonly found in igneous rocks. They are characterized by their chain-like structure and are named according to the chemical species occupying the X (or M2) site, the Y (or M1) site, and the tetrahedral T site. The names of the pyroxene minerals are primarily defined by their chemical composition.

The International Mineralogical Association's Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names recognizes 20 mineral names for pyroxenes, while 105 previously used names have been discarded. The common calcium-iron-magnesium pyroxenes are defined in the 'pyroxene quadrilateral'. The enstatite-ferrosilite series (<chem2|[Mg,Fe]SiO3>) includes the common rock-forming mineral Hypersthene, contains up to 5 mol.% calcium and exists in three polymorphs, orthorhombic orthoenstatite and protoenstatite and monoclinic clinoenstatite (and the ferrosilite equivalents). Increasing the calcium content prevents the formation of the orthorhombic phases and pigeonite (<chem2|[Mg,Fe,Ca][Mg,Fe]Si2O6>) only crystallises in the monoclinic system. There is not complete solid solution in calcium content and Mg-Fe-Ca pyroxenes with calcium contents between about 15 and 25 mol.% are not stable with respect to a pair of exolved crystals. This leads to a miscibility gap between pigeonite and augite compositions. There is an arbitrary separation between augite and the diopside-hedenbergite (<chem2|CaMgSi2O6CaFeSi2O6>) solid solution. The divide is taken at >45 mol.% Ca. As the calcium ion cannot occupy the Y site, pyroxenes with a high calcium content are not stable and will exsolve to form a pair of crystals. This is known as the "miscibility gap" and is a key factor in the classification of pyroxenes.

The crystal chemistry of pyroxenes is also important in their classification. The crystal structure of a pyroxene is determined by the size and charge of the cations occupying the X and Y sites. For example, the enstatite-ferrosilite series has a larger calcium ion in the X site, which prevents the formation of the orthorhombic phases. This leads to the formation of the monoclinic phases, clinoenstatite and ferrosilite. The crystal structure of a pyroxene can also be affected by the presence of other elements, such as iron and magnesium. The presence of these elements can alter the crystal structure and lead to the formation of different pyroxene minerals.

In conclusion, the classification and crystal chemistry of pyroxenes are crucial in understanding their properties and behavior in igneous rocks. The presence of different elements and the size and charge of cations can greatly influence the crystal structure and stability of pyroxenes. Further research and study in this field will continue to enhance our understanding of these important rock-forming minerals.





### Subsection: 1.2b Occurrence and petrogenetic significance of pyroxenes in igneous rocks

Pyroxenes are a common component of igneous rocks, and their occurrence and petrogenetic significance are crucial to understanding the formation and evolution of these rocks. The presence of pyroxenes in a rock can provide valuable information about the conditions under which the rock was formed, including the temperature, pressure, and chemical composition of the melt.

#### Occurrence of Pyroxenes in Igneous Rocks

Pyroxenes are found in a wide range of igneous rocks, from basalt to granite. They are particularly common in mafic and intermediate rocks, such as basalt, andesite, and dacite, due to their high magnesium and iron content. However, they can also be found in felsic rocks, such as granite, although their presence in these rocks is often more limited.

The occurrence of pyroxenes in a rock can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the composition of the melt, the pressure and temperature conditions during crystallization, and the presence of other minerals. For example, the presence of olivine can indicate a high-temperature, low-pressure environment, while the presence of amphibole can suggest a lower temperature, higher pressure environment.

#### Petrogenetic Significance of Pyroxenes

The petrogenetic significance of pyroxenes lies in their ability to provide insights into the conditions under which a rock was formed. The composition of pyroxenes can be used to estimate the composition of the melt from which they crystallized, which can in turn be used to infer the composition of the source of the melt.

For example, the presence of calcium-rich pyroxenes, such as diopside and hedenbergite, can indicate a source rich in silica and calcium, suggesting the melting of a silicate body. On the other hand, the presence of iron-rich pyroxenes, such as hypersthene and pigeonite, can suggest a source rich in iron and magnesium, indicating the melting of a mafic body.

Furthermore, the presence of certain pyroxenes can also provide information about the pressure and temperature conditions during crystallization. For instance, the presence of olivine can indicate a low-pressure, high-temperature environment, while the presence of amphibole can suggest a higher pressure, lower temperature environment.

In conclusion, the occurrence and petrogenetic significance of pyroxenes in igneous rocks are crucial to understanding the formation and evolution of these rocks. By studying the composition and distribution of pyroxenes in a rock, we can gain valuable insights into the conditions under which the rock was formed, and the processes that have shaped it over time.

Pyriboles are a group of minerals that are characterized by their unique structure and properties. They are composed of a combination of elements from group 14 and group 16 of the periodic table, and their structure is based on a tetrahedral arrangement of atoms. This structure is similar to that of other common minerals such as quartz and feldspar, but with some key differences that give pyriboles their distinct properties.

#### Structure of Pyriboles

Pyriboles are typically composed of a combination of elements from group 14 and group 16 of the periodic table. The most common elements found in pyriboles are silicon, aluminum, and iron, but other elements such as magnesium, calcium, and sodium can also be present. The structure of pyriboles is based on a tetrahedral arrangement of atoms, with each atom bonded to four other atoms. This structure is similar to that of other common minerals such as quartz and feldspar, but with some key differences.

One of the key differences in the structure of pyriboles is the presence of a double bond between the silicon and aluminum atoms. This double bond is responsible for the unique properties of pyriboles, including their high hardness and resistance to weathering. The double bond also gives pyriboles their characteristic blue or green color.

#### Properties of Pyriboles

The properties of pyriboles are largely determined by their structure. Due to their tetrahedral arrangement of atoms, pyriboles are highly resistant to weathering and have a high hardness. This makes them ideal for use in applications where durability is important, such as in building materials and jewelry.

Pyriboles also have a high refractive index, which makes them useful in optical applications. The double bond between the silicon and aluminum atoms also gives pyriboles their characteristic blue or green color, which can be used for decorative purposes.

#### Occurrence of Pyriboles

Pyriboles are found in a variety of igneous rocks, including basalt, andesite, and dacite. They are also found in some metamorphic rocks, such as gneiss and schist. Pyriboles are often associated with other minerals such as olivine, pyroxene, and feldspar, and their presence can provide valuable information about the conditions under which the rock was formed.

In addition to their occurrence in igneous and metamorphic rocks, pyriboles can also be found in some sedimentary rocks, such as sandstone and conglomerate. They are often formed through the weathering and erosion of igneous and metamorphic rocks, and their presence in sedimentary rocks can provide insights into the composition and history of the source rocks.

#### Conclusion

Pyriboles are a group of minerals that are characterized by their unique structure and properties. Their tetrahedral arrangement of atoms and double bond between silicon and aluminum atoms make them highly resistant to weathering and give them their characteristic color.

### Subsection: 1.3b Petrogenesis and occurrence of pyriboles in igneous rocks

Pyriboles are commonly found in igneous rocks, particularly in those that have undergone high-grade metamorphism. The petrogenesis of pyriboles is closely tied to the formation of these high-grade metamorphic rocks.

#### Petrogenesis of Pyriboles

Pyriboles are formed through the metamorphism of silicate minerals, particularly those containing silicon and aluminum. During high-grade metamorphism, these minerals undergo recrystallization and rearrangement of their atomic structure. This process can result in the formation of pyriboles, which are stable at high temperatures and pressures.

The formation of pyriboles is also influenced by the composition of the original silicate mineral. For example, minerals with a high silicon and aluminum content are more likely to form pyriboles during metamorphism. Additionally, the presence of other elements, such as iron and magnesium, can also affect the formation of pyriboles.

#### Occurrence of Pyriboles in Igneous Rocks

Pyriboles are commonly found in high-grade metamorphic rocks, such as eclogites and ultramafic rocks. These rocks are formed through the metamorphism of oceanic crust and mantle, which is subjected to high temperatures and pressures. The formation of these rocks is often associated with subduction zones, where one plate is being forced beneath another.

In addition to high-grade metamorphic rocks, pyriboles can also be found in some igneous rocks, particularly those that have undergone partial melting. This is because the high temperatures and pressures of partial melting can also result in the formation of pyriboles.

#### Significance of Pyriboles in Igneous Petrology

The presence of pyriboles in igneous rocks can provide valuable insights into the conditions of their formation. For example, the composition of pyriboles can indicate the temperature and pressure at which the rock was formed. This information can be used to reconstruct the tectonic history of the rock and the surrounding region.

Furthermore, the presence of pyriboles can also be used to identify the source of the rock. For instance, the presence of pyriboles in a rock can indicate that it originated from a subduction zone, as these minerals are commonly found in high-grade metamorphic rocks formed through subduction.

In conclusion, pyriboles play a crucial role in the study of igneous petrology. Their unique properties and occurrence in specific types of rocks make them a valuable tool for understanding the formation and evolution of igneous rocks. 





### Subsection: 1.4a Classification and crystal structure of feldspars

Feldspars are a group of common rock-forming minerals that are found in a wide range of igneous and metamorphic rocks. They are characterized by their framework structure, which is composed of silicon and aluminum tetrahedra. The classification and crystal structure of feldspars are crucial for understanding their role in the formation of igneous rocks.

#### Classification of Feldspars

Feldspars are classified based on their chemical composition and crystal structure. The most common types of feldspars are plagioclase and alkali feldspars. Plagioclase feldspars are characterized by their lower silica content and higher calcium and sodium content, while alkali feldspars have a higher silica content and lower calcium and sodium content.

The classification of feldspars is also influenced by their crystal structure. Plagioclase feldspars have a monoclinic crystal structure, while alkali feldspars have an orthorhombic crystal structure. This difference in crystal structure can affect the physical properties of the feldspars, such as their hardness and cleavage.

#### Crystal Structure of Feldspars

The crystal structure of feldspars is determined by the arrangement of their silicon and aluminum tetrahedra. In feldspars, these tetrahedra are arranged in a framework structure, with the silicon and aluminum atoms sharing corners. This framework structure is held together by oxygen atoms, which form bridges between the tetrahedra.

The crystal structure of feldspars can also be described in terms of their unit cell. The unit cell is the smallest repeating unit of a crystal structure, and it contains all the information about the arrangement of atoms and ions within the crystal. The unit cell of feldspars is typically hexagonal, with a length of about 10 Å and a height of about 6 Å.

#### Polymorphism of Feldspars

Similar to celsian, feldspars also exhibit polymorphism. Polymorphism refers to the ability of a mineral to exist in more than one crystal structure. In the case of feldspars, there are two main polymorphs: plagioclase and alkali feldspar. These polymorphs have different crystal structures and physical properties, but they have the same chemical composition.

The polymorphism of feldspars is important in understanding their role in the formation of igneous rocks. For example, the different crystal structures of plagioclase and alkali feldspars can affect their melting behavior and their ability to form different types of igneous rocks.

In conclusion, the classification and crystal structure of feldspars are crucial for understanding their role in the formation of igneous rocks. The differences in their chemical composition, crystal structure, and polymorphism can have significant implications for the physical and chemical properties of igneous rocks. 





### Subsection: 1.4b Petrologic importance of feldspars in igneous rocks

Feldspars play a crucial role in the formation and classification of igneous rocks. Their abundance and composition can provide valuable insights into the conditions under which the rock was formed. In this section, we will explore the petrologic importance of feldspars in igneous rocks.

#### Feldspar Composition and Rock Classification

The composition of feldspars can be used to classify igneous rocks. As mentioned earlier, plagioclase feldspars have a lower silica content and higher calcium and sodium content, while alkali feldspars have a higher silica content and lower calcium and sodium content. This difference in composition can be used to identify the type of igneous rock.

For example, plagioclase feldspars are commonly found in granites, which are coarse-grained, light-colored rocks with a high silica content. On the other hand, alkali feldspars are more commonly found in basaltic rocks, which are fine-grained, dark-colored rocks with a lower silica content.

#### Feldspar Crystal Structure and Rock Texture

The crystal structure of feldspars can also provide valuable information about the conditions under which the rock was formed. As mentioned earlier, plagioclase feldspars have a monoclinic crystal structure, while alkali feldspars have an orthorhombic crystal structure. This difference in crystal structure can affect the texture of the rock.

For example, plagioclase feldspars have a more coarse-grained texture, while alkali feldspars have a finer-grained texture. This can be useful in identifying the type of igneous rock, as well as the conditions under which it was formed.

#### Feldspar Polymorphism and Rock Metamorphism

Similar to celsian, feldspars also exhibit polymorphism. This means that they can exist in different crystal structures under different conditions. For example, plagioclase feldspars can exist in a monoclinic or triclinic crystal structure, depending on the temperature and pressure conditions.

This polymorphism can be important in understanding the metamorphic history of igneous rocks. If a rock contains feldspars with different crystal structures, it can indicate that the rock has undergone changes in temperature and pressure. This can provide valuable insights into the processes that the rock has undergone since its formation.

In conclusion, feldspars are an essential component of igneous rocks. Their composition, crystal structure, and polymorphism can provide valuable information about the conditions under which the rock was formed and the processes it has undergone since then. Understanding the petrologic importance of feldspars is crucial for any advanced study of igneous petrology.

### Subsection 2.1a Processes and mechanisms of fractional crystallization in MORBs

Fractional crystallization is a fundamental process in the formation of igneous rocks, particularly in the case of Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalts (MORBs). This process involves the separation of minerals from a melt as it cools and solidifies. The order in which minerals crystallize can provide valuable insights into the composition and evolution of the melt.

#### 2.1a.1 Basic Principles of Fractional Crystallization

Fractional crystallization is based on the principle that different minerals have different melting points. As a melt cools, minerals with higher melting points will crystallize first, leaving behind a residual melt with a different chemical composition. This residual melt can then continue to cool and crystallize, leading to the formation of a layered igneous rock.

The efficiency of fractional crystallization, or the amount of separation that occurs, is influenced by several factors. These include the composition of the melt, the temperature and pressure conditions, and the presence of impurities or modifiers. For example, the presence of iron can lower the melting point of olivine, a common mineral in MORBs, and promote its crystallization.

#### 2.1a.2 Mechanisms of Fractional Crystallization in MORBs

There are two main mechanisms by which fractional crystallization can occur in MORBs: settling and filter pressing.

Settling is a process where denser minerals sink to the bottom of the melt chamber, while less dense minerals remain suspended in the melt. This process can occur due to differences in density between minerals, or due to variations in the composition of the melt. For example, olivine, a common mineral in MORBs, is denser than pyroxene and will therefore settle out of the melt.

Filter pressing, on the other hand, is a process where minerals are separated by being squeezed through small spaces between crystals. This can occur as the melt is forced through small gaps between crystals as they grow, or as the melt is squeezed out of the melt chamber as the rock cools and solidifies.

#### 2.1a.3 Implications of Fractional Crystallization in MORBs

Fractional crystallization plays a crucial role in the formation of MORBs. It allows for the separation of minerals, leading to the formation of layered igneous rocks. This process can also provide insights into the composition and evolution of the melt, as different minerals will crystallize at different temperatures and can therefore be used as indicators of the temperature and pressure conditions during the formation of the rock.

In addition, the efficiency of fractional crystallization can also influence the chemical composition of the residual melt. This can have implications for the formation of other types of igneous rocks, such as plagiogranites, which can form from the residual melt of MORBs.

In conclusion, fractional crystallization is a complex process that plays a crucial role in the formation of MORBs. By understanding the basic principles and mechanisms of this process, we can gain valuable insights into the composition and evolution of these important igneous rocks.





### Subsection 2.1b Implications of magma mixing in MORBs

Magma mixing is a crucial process in the formation of Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalts (MORBs). It involves the mixing of different magmas, each with its own unique composition and characteristics. This process can have significant implications for the chemical variations and graphical representations of MORBs.

#### 2.1b.1 Mechanisms of Magma Mixing in MORBs

Magma mixing can occur through several mechanisms. One of the most common is the mixing of different layers of magma within a single chamber. This can occur due to convection, where the hotter, less dense magma rises to the top, while the cooler, denser magma sinks to the bottom. This process can lead to the homogenization of the magma, resulting in a more uniform composition.

Another mechanism is the mixing of magmas from different sources. This can occur when magma from a shallow chamber mixes with magma from a deeper chamber. This can lead to significant changes in the composition of the resulting magma, as the deeper magma is typically more evolved and has undergone more extensive fractional crystallization.

#### 2.1b.2 Implications of Magma Mixing for Chemical Variations

Magma mixing can have profound implications for the chemical variations observed in MORBs. The mixing of different magmas can lead to a more uniform composition, reducing the variations observed between different layers of a single MORB. However, the mixing of magmas from different sources can result in more complex chemical variations, as the compositions of the different magmas can be quite different.

For example, the mixing of a shallow, silica-rich magma with a deeper, silica-poor magma can result in a magma with an intermediate silica content. This can lead to the formation of a hybrid basalt, with characteristics of both tholeiitic and alkaline basalts. This can be particularly challenging to interpret, as the resulting magma may not fit neatly into traditional classification schemes.

#### 2.1b.3 Implications for Graphical Representations

Magma mixing can also have implications for the graphical representations of MORBs. The mixing of different magmas can result in a more uniform composition, reducing the variations observed in plots of major element composition. However, the mixing of magmas from different sources can result in more complex patterns, as the compositions of the different magmas can be quite different.

For example, the mixing of a shallow, silica-rich magma with a deeper, silica-poor magma can result in a magma with an intermediate silica content. This can lead to a more complex pattern in plots of major element composition, as the resulting magma may have characteristics of both tholeiitic and alkaline basalts. This can be particularly challenging to interpret, as the resulting magma may not fit neatly into traditional classification schemes.

In conclusion, magma mixing plays a crucial role in the formation of MORBs, with significant implications for their chemical variations and graphical representations. Understanding the mechanisms and implications of magma mixing is therefore essential for the study of MORBs and their evolution.




### Subsection 2.2a Geochemical variations and trends in MORBs

The Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalts (MORBs) are a unique type of igneous rock that is found in the oceanic crust. They are formed through the melting of the mantle, and their composition can provide valuable insights into the processes occurring within the Earth's interior. In this section, we will explore the geochemical variations and trends observed in MORBs, and how they can be interpreted.

#### 2.2a.1 Compositional Systematics in MORBs

The composition of MORBs is highly variable, and this variability can be attributed to a variety of factors, including the source of the magma, the conditions under which it is formed, and the processes involved in its formation. The composition of MORBs can be broadly classified into two types: tholeiitic and alkaline.

Tholeiitic MORBs are characterized by their high silica content (>65%), low alkali content (<8%), and low iron and magnesium content. They are typically formed through the melting of the upper mantle, and their composition is relatively uniform. This uniformity is a result of the efficient mixing of the mantle, which homogenizes the composition of the resulting magma.

Alkaline MORBs, on the other hand, are characterized by their low silica content (<65%), high alkali content (>8%), and high iron and magnesium content. They are typically formed through the melting of the lower mantle, and their composition is more variable than that of tholeiitic MORBs. This variability is a result of the incomplete mixing of the mantle, which allows for the preservation of the distinct compositions of the different mantle reservoirs.

#### 2.2a.2 Implications of Compositional Systematics for Mantle Melting

The compositional systematics of MORBs can provide valuable insights into the processes involved in mantle melting. The efficient mixing of the mantle that results in the uniform composition of tholeiitic MORBs suggests that the mantle is well-mixed and homogenous. This is consistent with the concept of a convecting mantle, where the mantle is continuously stirred by convection currents.

The incomplete mixing of the mantle that results in the variable composition of alkaline MORBs, on the other hand, suggests that the mantle is not perfectly mixed. This could be due to the presence of distinct mantle reservoirs, each with its own unique composition, or it could be due to the incomplete mixing of the mantle. This could be due to the presence of barriers to mixing, such as the D" layer, or it could be due to the incomplete melting of the mantle.

In conclusion, the compositional systematics of MORBs can provide valuable insights into the processes involved in mantle melting. By studying the geochemical variations and trends observed in MORBs, we can gain a better understanding of the dynamics of the Earth's interior and the processes that shape our planet.




### Subsection 2.2b Sources and processes of mantle melting in MORBs

The mantle is the source of all MORBs, and the processes involved in its melting are crucial to understanding the composition and variability of these rocks. The mantle is a complex system, with different reservoirs and layers that can influence the melting process. In this section, we will explore the sources and processes of mantle melting in MORBs.

#### 2.2b.1 Sources of Mantle Melting

The mantle is composed of a variety of reservoirs, each with its own distinct composition. These reservoirs can be broadly classified into two types: the upper mantle and the lower mantle. The upper mantle is the layer above the core-mantle boundary, and it is where most mantle melting occurs. The lower mantle, on the other hand, is the layer below the core-mantle boundary, and it is thought to be the source of mantle plumes.

The upper mantle is composed of two main reservoirs: the depleted mid-ocean ridge basalt (DMM) and the enriched mantle 1 (EM1). The DMM is thought to be the source of most MORBs, and it is characterized by its low silica content (<65%) and high iron and magnesium content. The EM1, on the other hand, is enriched in silica (>65%) and has lower iron and magnesium content.

The lower mantle is thought to be the source of mantle plumes, which are columns of hot material that rise from the core-mantle boundary. These plumes can bring material from the lower mantle to the surface, resulting in the formation of ocean island basalts (OIBs). The composition of OIBs is highly variable, and it is thought to reflect the composition of the lower mantle.

#### 2.2b.2 Processes of Mantle Melting

The melting of the mantle is a complex process that involves a variety of factors. The most important factor is temperature, which can be influenced by heat flow from the core and the presence of subducted slabs. The melting of the mantle can also be influenced by the composition of the mantle, with more silica-rich reservoirs melting at lower temperatures than more iron and magnesium-rich reservoirs.

Another important process in mantle melting is the role of water. Water can lower the melting point of the mantle, making it easier for it to melt. The presence of water can also result in the formation of hydrous minerals, which can be indicative of the presence of subducted slabs.

The melting of the mantle can also be influenced by the presence of volatiles, such as carbon dioxide and sulfur. These volatiles can lower the melting point of the mantle and can also result in the formation of different types of minerals.

In conclusion, the sources and processes of mantle melting in MORBs are complex and involve a variety of factors. By studying the composition and variability of MORBs, we can gain valuable insights into the processes occurring within the Earth's mantle.





### Section: 2.3 MORB Mantle Melts - Phase Equilibrium Controls on Liquid Compositions

The composition of mantle melts is a crucial aspect of understanding the formation and evolution of igneous rocks. In this section, we will explore the phase equilibrium controls on the liquid compositions of mantle melts, specifically focusing on MORB mantle melts.

#### 2.3a Phase equilibria and liquid compositions in MORB mantle melts

The phase equilibrium of a system refers to the state at which the phases in the system are in equilibrium with each other. In the context of mantle melts, this refers to the state at which the melt and the solid phases are in equilibrium. The phase equilibrium of a mantle melt is influenced by a variety of factors, including temperature, pressure, and the composition of the melt.

The phase equilibrium of a mantle melt can be represented graphically using a phase diagram. A phase diagram is a graphical representation of the phase equilibrium of a system, showing the conditions under which different phases can coexist. For mantle melts, the phase diagram is typically represented with temperature on the y-axis and pressure on the x-axis.

The phase diagram for mantle melts is complex and depends on the composition of the melt. However, there are some general trends that can be observed. For example, at high pressures and temperatures, the melt is typically in a liquid state. As the pressure and temperature decrease, the melt can undergo a phase change, forming a solid phase. The point at which this phase change occurs is known as the solidus.

The composition of the melt can also influence the phase equilibrium. For example, a melt with a higher silica content will have a higher solidus temperature compared to a melt with a lower silica content. This is because silica is more likely to form a solid phase than other minerals, such as iron and magnesium.

The phase equilibrium of a mantle melt is crucial in understanding the composition of the resulting igneous rock. The liquid compositions of mantle melts can vary significantly, depending on the phase equilibrium. For example, a melt with a high silica content will have a different composition than a melt with a low silica content. This can have significant implications for the formation and evolution of igneous rocks.

In the next section, we will explore the role of phase equilibrium in the formation of different types of igneous rocks, including MORBs and OIBs.

#### 2.3b Implications of phase equilibrium for mantle melts

The phase equilibrium of mantle melts has significant implications for the composition and evolution of igneous rocks. As we have seen, the phase equilibrium is influenced by a variety of factors, including temperature, pressure, and the composition of the melt. In this section, we will explore some of the implications of phase equilibrium for mantle melts.

One of the most significant implications of phase equilibrium is its role in the formation of different types of igneous rocks. As we have seen, the phase equilibrium can influence the composition of the melt, which in turn can influence the composition of the resulting igneous rock. For example, a melt with a high silica content will have a different composition than a melt with a low silica content. This can result in the formation of different types of igneous rocks, such as basalt or granite.

Another implication of phase equilibrium is its role in the evolution of igneous rocks. The phase equilibrium can influence the melting process, which can affect the composition of the resulting igneous rock. For example, if a melt undergoes a phase change before it reaches the surface, it can result in the formation of different types of igneous rocks. This can provide valuable insights into the processes that have shaped the Earth's crust over time.

The phase equilibrium of mantle melts can also have implications for the study of mantle plumes. As we have seen, mantle plumes are thought to originate from the core-mantle boundary, and they can bring material from the lower mantle to the surface. The phase equilibrium of the melt in these plumes can provide insights into the composition of the lower mantle, which is otherwise difficult to study.

In conclusion, the phase equilibrium of mantle melts plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of igneous rocks. It can influence the composition of the melt, the formation of different types of igneous rocks, and our understanding of mantle plumes. Further research in this area will continue to provide valuable insights into the processes that have shaped the Earth's crust over time.

#### 2.3c Case studies of phase equilibrium in mantle melts

In this section, we will delve deeper into the implications of phase equilibrium for mantle melts by examining some case studies. These case studies will provide a more detailed understanding of how phase equilibrium can influence the composition and evolution of igneous rocks.

##### Case Study 1: The Role of Phase Equilibrium in the Formation of Basalt

Basalt is a common type of igneous rock that is formed from the melting of the Earth's mantle. The composition of basalt can vary significantly, depending on the phase equilibrium of the mantle melt. For example, a mantle melt with a high silica content will result in the formation of a more silica-rich basalt, while a melt with a lower silica content will result in a more iron and magnesium-rich basalt.

The phase equilibrium of the mantle melt can also influence the texture of basalt. For instance, if the melt undergoes a phase change before it reaches the surface, it can result in the formation of a more fine-grained basalt. This is because the phase change can cause the melt to cool and solidify more quickly, resulting in a smaller grain size.

##### Case Study 2: The Role of Phase Equilibrium in the Evolution of Igneous Rocks

The phase equilibrium of mantle melts can also have implications for the evolution of igneous rocks. For example, the composition of a mantle melt can change as it moves through the Earth's mantle, due to the influence of phase equilibrium. This can result in the formation of different types of igneous rocks at different depths within the mantle.

For instance, a mantle melt that undergoes a phase change as it moves through the mantle can result in the formation of a more iron and magnesium-rich basalt at deeper depths, and a more silica-rich basalt at shallower depths. This can provide valuable insights into the processes that have shaped the Earth's crust over time.

##### Case Study 3: The Role of Phase Equilibrium in the Study of Mantle Plumes

As mentioned in the previous section, mantle plumes are thought to originate from the core-mantle boundary, and they can bring material from the lower mantle to the surface. The phase equilibrium of the melt in these plumes can provide insights into the composition of the lower mantle, which is otherwise difficult to study.

For example, if a mantle plume brings a melt from the lower mantle to the surface, the composition of the melt can provide insights into the composition of the lower mantle. This can help us understand the processes that are occurring within the Earth's mantle, and how they are influencing the formation of igneous rocks.

In conclusion, the phase equilibrium of mantle melts plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of igneous rocks. By studying the phase equilibrium of mantle melts, we can gain valuable insights into the processes that have shaped the Earth's crust over time.

## Chapter: Mineral Physics and Thermodynamics

### Introduction

The study of igneous petrology is a complex and multifaceted field, requiring a deep understanding of various disciplines including mineral physics and thermodynamics. This chapter, "Mineral Physics and Thermodynamics," delves into these two critical areas, providing a comprehensive exploration of their roles in the broader context of igneous petrology.

Mineral physics is a branch of geology that focuses on the physical properties of minerals. It is a field that is deeply intertwined with igneous petrology, as it provides the foundation for understanding the behavior of minerals under different conditions. This chapter will explore the fundamental principles of mineral physics, including the crystal structure of minerals, their thermal and mechanical properties, and their response to various environmental conditions.

Thermodynamics, on the other hand, is a branch of physics that deals with the relationships between heat and other forms of energy. In the context of igneous petrology, thermodynamics is crucial for understanding the processes that occur during the formation and evolution of igneous rocks. This chapter will delve into the principles of thermodynamics, including the laws of thermodynamics, the concept of entropy, and the role of temperature and pressure in geological processes.

Together, mineral physics and thermodynamics provide the tools necessary to understand the complex processes that occur during the formation and evolution of igneous rocks. This chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of these two areas, equipping readers with the knowledge and tools necessary to further explore the fascinating field of igneous petrology.




### Subsection: 2.3b Thermodynamic models for MORB mantle melting

In addition to understanding the phase equilibrium of mantle melts, it is also important to consider the thermodynamic models that can be used to explain the melting behavior of MORB mantle melts. These models take into account the effects of temperature, pressure, and composition on the melting behavior of the mantle.

One commonly used thermodynamic model is the "melt fraction" model, which assumes that the melt is a homogeneous phase that is in equilibrium with the solid phases. This model is useful for understanding the behavior of mantle melts, as it takes into account the effects of temperature and pressure on the melt.

Another important thermodynamic model is the "mineral assemblage" model, which takes into account the individual minerals present in the mantle and their melting behavior. This model is useful for understanding the behavior of mantle melts, as it takes into account the effects of composition on the melting behavior of the mantle.

The "mineral assemblage" model can be represented graphically using a mineral phase diagram, which shows the conditions under which different minerals can coexist. This model is particularly useful for understanding the behavior of mantle melts, as it takes into account the effects of temperature, pressure, and composition on the melting behavior of the mantle.

In addition to these models, there are also more complex thermodynamic models that take into account the effects of multiple phases and their interactions on the melting behavior of the mantle. These models are useful for understanding the behavior of mantle melts, as they take into account the complex interactions between different phases in the mantle.

Overall, thermodynamic models play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of mantle melts and their role in the formation of igneous rocks. By considering the effects of temperature, pressure, and composition on the melting behavior of the mantle, these models provide valuable insights into the processes that shape the Earth's crust.





### Subsection: 2.4a Solid compositions and phase equilibria in MORB mantle melts

The composition of solid phases in MORB mantle melts is a crucial aspect of understanding the behavior of these melts. As mentioned in the previous section, the composition of solid phases can be determined through various analytical techniques, such as X-ray diffraction and electron microprobe analysis. These techniques allow us to identify the minerals present in the mantle and their relative abundances.

The composition of solid phases in MORB mantle melts is also influenced by phase equilibria. Phase equilibria refers to the conditions under which different phases can coexist in equilibrium. In the case of MORB mantle melts, the phase equilibria is influenced by temperature, pressure, and the composition of the melt.

One important aspect of phase equilibria is the concept of solidus and liquidus. The solidus is the temperature at which a solid phase begins to melt, while the liquidus is the temperature at which the melt becomes completely liquid. The difference between the solidus and liquidus is known as the melting range. The melting range is an important factor in determining the composition of solid phases in MORB mantle melts.

Another important aspect of phase equilibria is the concept of eutectic and eutectoid reactions. Eutectic reactions occur when two or more solid phases melt simultaneously, while eutectoid reactions occur when a solid phase transforms into a liquid phase. These reactions can significantly affect the composition of solid phases in MORB mantle melts.

The composition of solid phases in MORB mantle melts can also be represented graphically using a phase diagram. A phase diagram is a graphical representation of the phase equilibria of a system. In the case of MORB mantle melts, the phase diagram can show the composition of solid phases at different temperatures and pressures. This allows us to better understand the behavior of these melts and their role in the formation of igneous rocks.

In conclusion, the composition of solid phases in MORB mantle melts is a crucial aspect of understanding the behavior of these melts. It is influenced by various factors, including temperature, pressure, and composition, and can be represented graphically using a phase diagram. By studying the composition of solid phases, we can gain a better understanding of the role of MORB mantle melts in the formation of igneous rocks.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the topic of metamorphic rocks and their classification. Metamorphic rocks are formed when igneous or sedimentary rocks undergo changes in mineral composition, texture, and structure due to high temperatures and pressures. These changes can occur in a variety of environments, including the Earth's mantle, crust, and even in the presence of water. Understanding the classification of metamorphic rocks is crucial for understanding the processes that shape our planet and the evolution of its rocks.

We will begin by discussing the basics of metamorphic rocks, including their formation and characteristics. We will then delve into the different types of metamorphic rocks, including low-grade, high-grade, and ultra-high-grade metamorphic rocks. Each type will be described in detail, including their mineral composition, texture, and structure. We will also explore the factors that influence the formation of different types of metamorphic rocks, such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of fluids.

Next, we will discuss the classification of metamorphic rocks. This includes the use of various classification schemes, such as the Barrovian and Greenschist facies, and how they are used to identify and differentiate between different types of metamorphic rocks. We will also explore the concept of metamorphic grade and how it relates to the classification of metamorphic rocks.

Finally, we will discuss the importance of studying metamorphic rocks and their classification. This includes the role of metamorphic rocks in understanding the evolution of the Earth's crust and mantle, as well as their economic significance. We will also touch upon the ongoing research and advancements in the field of metamorphic petrology.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of metamorphic rocks and their classification. This knowledge will not only enhance their understanding of igneous petrology, but also provide a foundation for further exploration and research in this fascinating field.

### Subsection: 2.4b Constraints on solid compositions using experimental and field data

In addition to the analytical techniques and graphical representations discussed in the previous section, experimental and field data can also provide valuable constraints on the composition of solid phases in MORB mantle melts. These data can be used to further understand the phase equilibria and behavior of these melts.

Experimental data can be obtained through laboratory experiments, where the conditions of temperature and pressure are carefully controlled and measured. These experiments can involve melting a known composition of mantle material and observing the resulting solid phases. By comparing the observed solid phases to known mineral standards, the composition of the solid phases can be determined. This experimental data can then be used to construct a phase diagram, providing a visual representation of the phase equilibria of the system.

Field data, on the other hand, can be obtained through the study of natural occurrences of MORB mantle melts. This can involve the collection and analysis of samples from various locations, as well as the use of remote sensing techniques to study the composition of the mantle from a distance. By comparing the observed composition of the solid phases in these natural occurrences to the experimental data, further insights into the phase equilibria and behavior of MORB mantle melts can be gained.

One example of the use of experimental and field data in understanding the composition of solid phases in MORB mantle melts is the study of the Selli Event. This event, which occurred approximately 120 million years ago, resulted in a significant increase in iron oxide in the Earth's oceans. By studying the composition of the solid phases in sediments from this event, researchers have been able to determine the source of the increased iron oxide and its potential impact on the Earth's climate.

In conclusion, the use of experimental and field data, in addition to analytical techniques and graphical representations, is crucial in understanding the composition of solid phases in MORB mantle melts. By combining these approaches, a more comprehensive understanding of the phase equilibria and behavior of these melts can be achieved.

### Subsection: 2.5a Petrology and geochemistry of undersaturated magmas

Undersaturated magmas are a type of magma that is characterized by their low silica content. These magmas are typically found in continental settings and are often associated with the formation of intrusive igneous complexes. In this section, we will explore the petrology and geochemistry of undersaturated magmas, with a focus on high K continental magmas.

#### 2.5a.1 Petrology of Undersaturated Magmas

The petrology of undersaturated magmas is largely influenced by their low silica content. This results in the formation of minerals that are typically found in more evolved magmas, such as plagioclase feldspar and quartz. However, the presence of these minerals does not necessarily indicate a high degree of evolution, as they can also form in primary magmas.

The mineral assemblage of undersaturated magmas is also influenced by the presence of volatiles, such as water and carbon dioxide. These volatiles can significantly lower the melting point of the magma, allowing for the formation of more evolved minerals. The presence of volatiles can also result in the formation of hydroxyl-bearing minerals, such as alkali feldspar and biotite.

#### 2.5a.2 Geochemistry of Undersaturated Magmas

The geochemistry of undersaturated magmas is largely determined by their low silica content and the presence of volatiles. The low silica content results in a high concentration of alkali elements, such as potassium and sodium, as well as iron and magnesium. This is in contrast to more evolved magmas, which have a higher silica content and a lower concentration of these elements.

The presence of volatiles can also have a significant impact on the geochemistry of undersaturated magmas. The release of these volatiles during magma formation can result in the formation of hydroxyl-bearing minerals, which can further influence the geochemistry of the magma. Additionally, the presence of volatiles can also result in the formation of hydrogenous minerals, such as olivine and pyroxene, which can also impact the geochemistry of the magma.

#### 2.5a.3 High K Continental Magmas

High K continental magmas are a type of undersaturated magma that is characterized by their high potassium content. These magmas are often associated with the formation of large igneous provinces (LIPs) and are thought to be the result of mantle plumes. The high potassium content of these magmas is a result of the presence of volatiles, which can significantly lower the melting point of the magma and allow for the formation of more evolved minerals.

The petrology and geochemistry of high K continental magmas are largely influenced by their high potassium content and the presence of volatiles. These magmas are typically characterized by the formation of hydroxyl-bearing minerals, such as alkali feldspar and biotite, as well as hydrogenous minerals, such as olivine and pyroxene. The presence of these minerals can provide valuable insights into the origin and evolution of these magmas.

In conclusion, the petrology and geochemistry of undersaturated magmas, particularly high K continental magmas, are largely influenced by their low silica content and the presence of volatiles. These magmas can provide valuable insights into the origin and evolution of the Earth's mantle and the formation of large igneous provinces. Further research and study of these magmas can continue to enhance our understanding of the complex processes that occur within the Earth's interior.





### Subsection: 2.5b High potassium continental igneous rocks

High potassium continental igneous rocks are a type of undersaturated magma that is characterized by their high potassium content. These rocks are typically found in continental settings and are often associated with the formation of intrusive igneous complexes. In this section, we will explore the petrology and geochemistry of high potassium continental igneous rocks.

#### 2.5b.1 Petrology of High Potassium Continental Igneous Rocks

The petrology of high potassium continental igneous rocks is largely influenced by their high potassium content. This results in the formation of minerals that are typically found in more evolved magmas, such as plagioclase feldspar and quartz. However, the presence of these minerals does not necessarily indicate a high degree of evolution, as they can also form in primary magmas.

The mineral assemblage of high potassium continental igneous rocks is also influenced by the presence of volatiles, such as water and carbon dioxide. These volatiles can significantly lower the melting point of the magma, allowing for the formation of more evolved minerals. The presence of volatiles can also result in the formation of hydroxyl-bearing minerals, such as alkali feldspar and biotite.

#### 2.5b.2 Geochemistry of High Potassium Continental Igneous Rocks

The geochemistry of high potassium continental igneous rocks is largely determined by their high potassium content and the presence of volatiles. The high potassium content results in a high concentration of alkali elements, such as potassium and sodium, as well as iron and magnesium. This is in contrast to more evolved magmas, which have a higher silica content and a lower concentration of these elements.

The presence of volatiles can also have a significant impact on the geochemistry of high potassium continental igneous rocks. The release of these volatiles during magma formation can result in the formation of hydroxyl-bearing minerals, which can further influence the geochemistry of the rocks. Additionally, the presence of volatiles can also result in the formation of pegmatite, a type of high potassium granite that is rich in minerals and is often mined for its valuable resources.

### Conclusion

High potassium continental igneous rocks are a unique type of undersaturated magma that is characterized by their high potassium content and the presence of volatiles. Their petrology and geochemistry are largely influenced by these factors, making them an important topic of study in advanced igneous petrology.

## Chapter 3: Metamorphic Rocks

 3.1: Metamorphic Rocks

Metamorphic rocks are an important part of the Earth's crust, and understanding their formation and properties is crucial for understanding the evolution of the Earth's crust. In this section, we will explore the basics of metamorphic rocks, including their definition and characteristics.

#### 3.1a: Definition and Characteristics of Metamorphic Rocks

Metamorphic rocks are rocks that have undergone changes in mineral composition and texture due to high temperatures and pressures. These changes can occur due to various processes, such as heat transfer, fluid-rock interactions, and deformation. The resulting rocks are often different in composition and texture from the original parent rock, and can provide valuable insights into the formation of the Earth's crust.

One of the key characteristics of metamorphic rocks is their mineral assemblage. As a result of the high temperatures and pressures, the minerals in the parent rock can undergo changes, leading to the formation of new minerals or the recrystallization of existing minerals. This can result in a unique mineral assemblage that is different from the original parent rock.

Another important characteristic of metamorphic rocks is their texture. The high temperatures and pressures can cause the minerals to deform and recrystallize, resulting in a new texture that is different from the original parent rock. This can include the formation of new minerals with different textures, such as gneiss or schist.

The formation of metamorphic rocks is also influenced by the composition of the parent rock. Different types of parent rocks, such as sedimentary rocks, igneous rocks, and even other metamorphic rocks, can result in different types of metamorphic rocks. For example, the composition of the parent rock can affect the types of minerals that can form during metamorphism, as well as the overall texture and mineral assemblage of the resulting metamorphic rock.

In addition to their unique mineral assemblage and texture, metamorphic rocks can also provide insights into the processes that shaped the Earth's crust. For example, the presence of certain minerals or textures can indicate the temperature and pressure conditions that the rock experienced during metamorphism. This can help us understand the tectonic history of a region and the processes that have shaped the Earth's crust over time.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of metamorphic rocks and their unique properties in more detail. We will also discuss the factors that influence the formation of metamorphic rocks and the processes that govern their formation.

### Subsection: 2.6a Origin and characteristics of kimberlites and carbonatites

Kimberlites and carbonatites are two unique types of igneous rocks that have distinct origins and characteristics. In this section, we will explore the origin and characteristics of these rocks, as well as their role in the formation of other igneous rocks.

#### 2.6a.1 Origin of Kimberlites and Carbonatites

Kimberlites and carbonatites are both types of ultramafic magmas, meaning they have a high concentration of iron and magnesium. However, their origins differ significantly. Kimberlites are thought to originate from the Earth's mantle, specifically the lower mantle. They are often associated with diamond deposits and are known for their high potassium content. On the other hand, carbonatites are thought to originate from the Earth's crust, specifically from the differentiation of a silicate magma. They are often associated with the formation of other igneous rocks, such as syenites and alkali basic rocks.

#### 2.6a.2 Characteristics of Kimberlites and Carbonatites

The characteristics of kimberlites and carbonatites are largely influenced by their origins. Kimberlites, due to their mantle origin, have a high potassium content and are often associated with diamond deposits. They also have a high concentration of iron and magnesium, resulting in a dark, dense rock. Carbonatites, on the other hand, have a lower potassium content and are often associated with the formation of other igneous rocks. They have a lighter color and are less dense than kimberlites.

#### 2.6a.3 Role of Kimberlites and Carbonatites in the Formation of Other Igneous Rocks

Both kimberlites and carbonatites play a significant role in the formation of other igneous rocks. Kimberlites, due to their high potassium content, can contribute to the formation of other high potassium continental igneous rocks, such as alkali feldspar and biotite. Carbonatites, on the other hand, can contribute to the formation of other igneous rocks, such as syenites and alkali basic rocks, through the differentiation of a silicate magma.

In conclusion, kimberlites and carbonatites are two unique types of igneous rocks with distinct origins and characteristics. Their role in the formation of other igneous rocks highlights their importance in understanding the complex processes of igneous petrology.

Untramafic magmas and komatiites are two important types of igneous rocks that have significant implications for the study of igneous petrology. In this section, we will explore the petrogenesis and significance of these rocks, as well as their role in the formation of other igneous rocks.

#### 2.6b.1 Petrogenesis of Untramafic Magmas and Komatiites

Untramafic magmas and komatiites are both types of ultramafic magmas, meaning they have a high concentration of iron and magnesium. However, their origins differ significantly. Untramafic magmas are thought to originate from the Earth's mantle, specifically the upper mantle. They are often associated with the formation of other igneous rocks, such as basalt and gabbro. Komatiites, on the other hand, are thought to originate from the Earth's mantle, specifically the lower mantle. They are often associated with the formation of other igneous rocks, such as peridotite and dunite.

#### 2.6b.2 Significance of Untramafic Magmas and Komatiites

The significance of untramafic magmas and komatiites lies in their role in the formation of other igneous rocks. Untramafic magmas, due to their high potassium content, can contribute to the formation of other high potassium continental igneous rocks, such as alkali feldspar and biotite. Komatiites, due to their high iron and magnesium content, can contribute to the formation of other ultramafic rocks, such as peridotite and dunite.

### Subsection: 2.7a Processes and consequences of magma mixing

Magma mixing is a crucial process in the formation of igneous rocks. It involves the blending of different magmas, each with its own unique composition and characteristics. This process can have significant implications for the resulting rock, including its mineralogy, texture, and chemical composition.

#### 2.7a.1 Mechanisms of Magma Mixing

There are several mechanisms by which magma mixing can occur. One common mechanism is through the mixing of different magma chambers. As magma rises from the mantle, it can encounter other magmas with different compositions, leading to mixing. This can occur at various depths, from the upper mantle to the shallow crust.

Another mechanism is through the mixing of magmas with different compositions as they erupt. This can occur at volcanic vents, where different magmas can mix and create new compositions. This process can also occur during explosive volcanic eruptions, where magma fragments can mix with other magmas and form new compositions.

#### 2.7a.2 Consequences of Magma Mixing

The consequences of magma mixing can be significant. One of the most notable consequences is the creation of new mineral assemblages. As different magmas mix, they can create new minerals that are not present in either of the original magmas. This can lead to the formation of unique and complex mineral assemblages in the resulting rock.

Magma mixing can also result in changes in the chemical composition of the resulting rock. As different magmas mix, they can exchange elements and ions, leading to changes in the overall composition of the rock. This can result in the formation of new minerals and textures, as well as changes in the physical properties of the rock.

#### 2.7a.3 Magma Mixing and Crustal Assimilation

In addition to mixing, magma can also undergo assimilation of crustal rocks. This process involves the incorporation of crustal rocks into the magma, which can significantly alter its composition. Crustal assimilation can occur through various mechanisms, including the mixing of magma with hydrothermal fluids and the incorporation of crustal rocks into the magma chamber.

Crustal assimilation can have significant implications for the resulting rock. It can lead to the formation of new minerals and textures, as well as changes in the chemical composition of the rock. This process can also result in the formation of new igneous rocks, such as granite, which is a common product of crustal assimilation.

### Conclusion

Magma mixing and crustal assimilation are crucial processes in the formation of igneous rocks. They can result in the creation of new mineral assemblages, changes in the chemical composition of the rock, and the formation of new igneous rocks. Understanding these processes is essential for the study of igneous petrology and the interpretation of geological phenomena.





### Subsection: 2.7b Crustal assimilation in igneous systems

Crustal assimilation is a crucial process in the formation of igneous rocks. It involves the incorporation of crustal rocks into the magma, which can significantly alter the composition and properties of the resulting rock. This process can occur through various mechanisms, including magma mixing and meteoric water interaction.

#### 2.7b.1 Mechanisms of Crustal Assimilation

One of the primary mechanisms of crustal assimilation is through magma mixing. As discussed in the previous section, magma mixing can occur at various depths and can result in the incorporation of crustal rocks into the magma. This can occur through the mixing of different magmas or through the mixing of magma with crustal rocks as it erupts.

Another mechanism of crustal assimilation is through meteoric water interaction. Meteoric water, or water that has interacted with the Earth's crust, can enter the magma system and interact with the magma. This interaction can result in the incorporation of crustal rocks into the magma, as well as changes in the chemical composition of the magma.

#### 2.7b.2 Consequences of Crustal Assimilation

The consequences of crustal assimilation can be significant. One of the most notable consequences is the formation of new minerals. As crustal rocks are incorporated into the magma, they can contribute new minerals to the resulting rock. This can result in the formation of unique and complex mineral assemblages, as well as changes in the physical properties of the rock.

Crustal assimilation can also result in changes in the chemical composition of the resulting rock. As crustal rocks are incorporated into the magma, they can contribute new elements and ions, leading to changes in the overall composition of the rock. This can result in the formation of new minerals and textures, as well as changes in the physical properties of the rock.

#### 2.7b.3 Crustal Assimilation and Magma Mixing

Crustal assimilation and magma mixing are closely intertwined processes. Magma mixing can facilitate crustal assimilation by allowing for the incorporation of crustal rocks into the magma. Similarly, crustal assimilation can enhance magma mixing by altering the composition and properties of the magma.

The combination of these two processes can result in the formation of complex and diverse igneous rocks. The incorporation of crustal rocks into the magma can lead to the formation of new minerals and textures, while the mixing of different magmas can result in changes in the chemical composition of the rock. This can create a wide range of igneous rocks with unique properties and applications.

In the next section, we will explore the role of crustal assimilation and magma mixing in the formation of specific types of igneous rocks.

## Chapter 3: Metamorphic Petrology

 3.1: Metamorphic Rocks

Metamorphic rocks are a fascinating and diverse group of rocks that are formed through the process of metamorphism. Metamorphism is the transformation of one rock type into another due to changes in temperature, pressure, and chemical reactions. In this section, we will explore the different types of metamorphic rocks and their characteristics.

#### 3.1a: Types of Metamorphic Rocks

There are three main types of metamorphic rocks: low-grade, high-grade, and ultra-high-grade metamorphic rocks. Low-grade metamorphic rocks are formed at temperatures below 400°C and pressures below 1 kilobar. High-grade metamorphic rocks are formed at temperatures above 400°C and pressures above 1 kilobar. Ultra-high-grade metamorphic rocks are formed at temperatures above 600°C and pressures above 2 kilobars.

Low-grade metamorphic rocks are further divided into greenschist, chlorite, and albite facies. These rocks are characterized by the presence of green minerals, such as chlorite and actinolite, and have a relatively low metamorphic grade. High-grade metamorphic rocks are divided into amphibolite, biotite, and sillimanite facies. These rocks are characterized by the presence of dark minerals, such as amphibole and biotite, and have a higher metamorphic grade than low-grade rocks. Ultra-high-grade metamorphic rocks are divided into eclogite and granulite facies. These rocks are characterized by the presence of high-pressure minerals, such as omphacite and rutile, and have the highest metamorphic grade of all metamorphic rocks.

Each type of metamorphic rock has its own unique mineral assemblage and texture, which can provide valuable information about the conditions under which it was formed. For example, the presence of certain minerals, such as sillimanite or biotite, can indicate the temperature and pressure at which the rock was metamorphosed.

In addition to their mineral composition, metamorphic rocks also exhibit different textures depending on the type of parent rock and the metamorphic conditions. For instance, low-grade metamorphic rocks tend to have a fine-grained texture, while high-grade rocks have a coarser texture due to the recrystallization of minerals at higher temperatures and pressures.

Overall, the study of metamorphic rocks is crucial in understanding the evolution of the Earth's crust. By examining the mineral composition and texture of these rocks, we can gain insights into the processes that have shaped our planet over billions of years. In the next section, we will delve deeper into the factors that influence metamorphism and the different types of metamorphic reactions that occur during the process.

For example, the presence of certain minerals, such as sillimanite or biotite, can indicate the temperature and pressure at which the rock was metamorphosed. Additionally, the texture of the rock can also provide clues about the deformation and recrystallization processes that occurred during metamorphism.

### Subsection: 3.1b Metamorphic Processes

Metamorphic processes are the mechanisms by which metamorphic rocks are formed. These processes can be broadly categorized into two types: contact metamorphism and regional metamorphism.

Contact metamorphism occurs when a rock is heated by a nearby intrusive igneous body, such as a pluton or a sill. The heat from the intrusive body causes the surrounding rock to undergo metamorphism, resulting in the formation of a metamorphic aureole. The size and shape of the aureole depend on the size and composition of the intrusive body, as well as the distance from the intrusion.

Regional metamorphism, on the other hand, occurs when a large area of rock is subjected to high temperatures and pressures. This can happen due to plate movements, such as subduction or collision, or due to the presence of a deep magma chamber. Regional metamorphism can result in the formation of large-scale metamorphic structures, such as gneiss domes or metamorphic shear zones.

Both contact and regional metamorphism can result in the formation of different types of metamorphic rocks, depending on the specific conditions under which they occur. For example, contact metamorphism is more likely to result in the formation of high-grade metamorphic rocks, while regional metamorphism can produce both high-grade and low-grade rocks.

In addition to these two main types of metamorphism, there are also other processes that can contribute to the formation of metamorphic rocks, such as hydrothermal alteration and fluid-rock interactions. These processes can further complicate the mineral assemblage and texture of metamorphic rocks, making them even more interesting to study.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the specific metamorphic processes and their effects on the formation of metamorphic rocks.

### Subsection: 3.1c Metamorphic Facies

Metamorphic facies are groups of metamorphic rocks that share similar mineral assemblages and textures. These facies are classified based on the dominant mineral assemblage and the metamorphic grade of the rocks. The three main metamorphic facies are the greenschist facies, the amphibolite facies, and the eclogite facies.

The greenschist facies is characterized by the presence of green minerals, such as chlorite and actinolite, and has a relatively low metamorphic grade. This facies is commonly found in low-grade metamorphic rocks and is often associated with hydrothermal alteration.

The amphibolite facies is characterized by the presence of dark minerals, such as amphibole and biotite, and has a higher metamorphic grade than the greenschist facies. This facies is commonly found in high-grade metamorphic rocks and is often associated with regional metamorphism.

The eclogite facies is characterized by the presence of high-pressure minerals, such as omphacite and rutile, and has the highest metamorphic grade of all metamorphic rocks. This facies is commonly found in ultra-high-grade metamorphic rocks and is often associated with deep subduction zones.

Understanding the different metamorphic facies can provide valuable information about the conditions under which a rock was metamorphosed. For example, the presence of certain minerals, such as sillimanite or biotite, can indicate the temperature and pressure at which the rock was metamorphosed. Additionally, the texture of the rock can also provide clues about the deformation and recrystallization processes that occurred during metamorphism.

### Subsection: 2.8a Petrologic and geochemical features of mafic igneous systems

Mafic igneous systems are characterized by their high magnesium and iron content, as well as their low silicon content. These rocks are typically formed through the crystallization of basaltic magmas, which are derived from the mantle. The composition of mafic igneous systems can vary greatly, depending on the source of the magma and the processes it undergoes during its formation and evolution.

#### 2.8a.1 Petrologic Features of Mafic Igneous Systems

The petrologic features of mafic igneous systems are largely determined by the composition of the magma from which they are formed. As mentioned earlier, basaltic magmas are typically high in magnesium and iron, and low in silicon. This results in the formation of minerals such as olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase feldspar.

The crystallization of these minerals can occur in a specific order, known as the Bowen's reaction series. This series describes the order in which minerals crystallize from a cooling magma, with olivine and pyroxene crystallizing first, followed by plagioclase feldspar. This series can be disrupted by various factors, such as changes in temperature or pressure, or the presence of foreign elements.

#### 2.8a.2 Geochemical Features of Mafic Igneous Systems

The geochemical features of mafic igneous systems are also determined by the composition of the magma. The high magnesium and iron content of these rocks can result in high concentrations of these elements in the surrounding environment. This can have significant impacts on the surrounding ecosystem, particularly in areas where these rocks are being actively extruded, such as mid-ocean ridges.

The geochemical features of mafic igneous systems can also provide valuable insights into the processes they undergo during their formation and evolution. For example, the presence of certain elements or isotopes can indicate the source of the magma, whether it is from the mantle or from the crust. This can help to shed light on the tectonic history of the region.

#### 2.8a.3 Graphical Representations of Mafic Igneous Systems

Graphical representations, such as phase diagrams and mineral assemblage diagrams, can be useful tools for understanding the petrologic and geochemical features of mafic igneous systems. These diagrams can help to illustrate the crystallization of minerals and the changes in composition that occur during the formation and evolution of these rocks.

For example, a phase diagram can show the temperature and pressure conditions at which different minerals crystallize from a magma. This can help to explain why certain minerals are more common in some mafic igneous systems than others. Similarly, a mineral assemblage diagram can show the composition of a rock at different stages of its crystallization, providing insights into the processes that occur during its formation.

In conclusion, the petrologic and geochemical features of mafic igneous systems are largely determined by the composition of the magma from which they are formed. These features can be further understood through the use of graphical representations, such as phase diagrams and mineral assemblage diagrams. By studying these features, we can gain a deeper understanding of the processes that shape our planet's crust.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the topic of metamorphic petrology, which is the study of the changes that occur in rocks due to high temperatures and pressures. Metamorphic rocks are formed when igneous or sedimentary rocks are subjected to extreme conditions, such as high temperatures and pressures, or exposure to hot fluids. These changes can result in the formation of new minerals and textures, as well as alterations in the chemical composition of the original rock. Understanding metamorphic petrology is crucial for understanding the evolution of the Earth's crust and the processes that shape it.

Throughout this chapter, we will explore the various types of metamorphic rocks, their formation processes, and the factors that influence their development. We will also discuss the different types of metamorphic facies, which are distinct assemblages of minerals that form under specific conditions. Additionally, we will examine the role of metamorphic rocks in the formation of ore deposits and their importance in mineral exploration.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of metamorphic petrology and its significance in the field of geology. This knowledge will not only enhance their understanding of the Earth's crust and its evolution, but also provide them with the necessary tools to identify and interpret metamorphic rocks in the field. So let us begin our journey into the fascinating world of metamorphic petrology.

## Chapter 3: Metamorphic Petrology

 3.1: Metamorphic Facies

Metamorphic facies are distinct assemblages of minerals that form under specific conditions of temperature, pressure, and fluid chemistry. These conditions are often extreme, and can result in the formation of new minerals and textures, as well as alterations in the chemical composition of the original rock. In this section, we will explore the different types of metamorphic facies and their characteristics.

#### 3.1a: Definition and Classification of Metamorphic Facies

Metamorphic facies can be defined as the assemblage of minerals that form under specific conditions of temperature, pressure, and fluid chemistry. These conditions can vary greatly, and as a result, there are several different types of metamorphic facies that have been identified. These include:

- Eclogite facies: This facies is characterized by high pressures and temperatures, and is typically found in the deep mantle or in subduction zones. The dominant minerals in this facies are olivine, omphacite, and rutile.
- Greenschist facies: This facies is found at lower pressures and temperatures than the eclogite facies, and is commonly found in the upper mantle or in the vicinity of mid-ocean ridges. The dominant minerals in this facies are chlorite, albite, and hornblende.
- Amphibolite facies: This facies is found at even lower pressures and temperatures than the greenschist facies, and is commonly found in the lower crust or in the vicinity of mountain ranges. The dominant minerals in this facies are plagioclase feldspar, hornblende, and biotite.
- Sillimanite facies: This facies is found at high temperatures and pressures, and is commonly found in the lower crust or in the vicinity of mountain ranges. The dominant minerals in this facies are sillimanite, muscovite, and biotite.
- Quartzite facies: This facies is found at high temperatures and pressures, and is commonly found in the upper crust or in the vicinity of mountain ranges. The dominant minerals in this facies are quartz, muscovite, and biotite.

These facies are not mutually exclusive, and a single rock can exhibit characteristics of multiple facies. The dominant facies of a rock is determined by the conditions it experiences during metamorphism.

In addition to these facies, there are also several other types of metamorphic rocks that do not fit into the above categories. These include:

- Skarn: This type of rock is formed when a sedimentary or igneous rock is exposed to hydrothermal fluids that contain high concentrations of metals. The dominant minerals in skarn are sulfides, oxides, and silicates.
- Bauxite: This type of rock is formed when a sedimentary or igneous rock is exposed to hydrothermal fluids that contain high concentrations of aluminum. The dominant minerals in bauxite are kaolinite, gibbsite, and boehmite.
- Serpentinite: This type of rock is formed when a peridotite is exposed to hydrothermal fluids that contain high concentrations of magnesium. The dominant mineral in serpentinite is serpentine.

Understanding the different types of metamorphic facies and their characteristics is crucial for interpreting the formation processes of metamorphic rocks. In the next section, we will explore the factors that influence the development of metamorphic facies.

### Subsection: 2.8b Mantle sources and processes of mafic magmas

The mantle is a crucial source of mafic magmas, which are the primary constituents of mafic igneous systems. The mantle is a layer of the Earth's interior that lies between the crust and the core. It is composed of solid rock, but it can also contain pockets of molten rock, or magma, which can rise to the surface and form mafic igneous systems.

#### 2.8b.1 Mantle Sources of Mafic Magmas

The mantle is a complex and dynamic system, with various sources of mafic magmas. These sources can be broadly categorized into two types: the upper mantle and the lower mantle.

The upper mantle, which extends from a depth of approximately 100 km to 660 km, is the primary source of mafic magmas. It is composed of peridotite, a rock that is rich in iron and magnesium. The upper mantle is also where the process of mantle convection occurs, which is responsible for the movement of heat and material within the mantle. This convection can lead to the formation of plumes, which are columns of hot material that rise from the lower mantle to the upper mantle.

The lower mantle, which extends from a depth of approximately 660 km to the core-mantle boundary at 2,900 km, is also a source of mafic magmas. The lower mantle is composed of a denser and hotter material than the upper mantle, and it is thought to be the source of heat and material for the upper mantle. The lower mantle is also where the process of mantle plumes occurs, which can lead to the formation of hotspots and the creation of mafic igneous systems.

#### 2.8b.2 Processes of Mafic Magma Formation

The formation of mafic magmas is a complex process that involves the melting of the mantle. This melting can occur through various processes, including adiabatic heating, where the mantle material is heated as it rises through the mantle, and thermal metamorphism, where the mantle material is heated by the heat of the Earth's core.

The melting of the mantle can lead to the formation of mafic magmas, which are then transported to the surface through various processes. These processes can include mantle convection, where the magma is transported through the mantle, and mantle plumes, where the magma is transported through the mantle plumes.

The composition of the mafic magmas can vary greatly, depending on the source of the magma and the processes it undergoes during its formation and evolution. For example, the composition of the mafic magmas can be influenced by the composition of the mantle material, the depth at which the magma is formed, and the presence of foreign elements.

In conclusion, the mantle is a crucial source of mafic magmas, and the processes of mantle convection and mantle plumes play a significant role in the formation and evolution of mafic igneous systems. The composition of the mafic magmas can vary greatly, providing valuable insights into the processes they undergo during their formation and evolution.

### Subsection: 2.9a Effects of water on fractional crystallization

Water plays a crucial role in the process of fractional crystallization, which is a fundamental process in the formation of igneous rocks. The presence of water can significantly alter the crystallization behavior of a magma, leading to changes in the mineralogy and chemical composition of the resulting rocks.

#### 2.9a.1 Water and Crystal Growth

The presence of water in a magma can affect the growth of crystals during fractional crystallization. Water can act as a nucleation agent, promoting the formation of new crystals. This can lead to an increase in the number of crystals and a decrease in the size of the crystals, which can significantly alter the texture of the resulting rock.

Moreover, water can also affect the growth rate of crystals. Studies have shown that the growth rate of crystals decreases linearly with increasing reciprocal concentration, which means that the presence of water can slow down the crystallization process. This can have important implications for the formation of different types of igneous rocks, as the crystallization process can influence the mineralogy and chemical composition of the rock.

#### 2.9a.2 Water and Mineral Stability

Water can also affect the stability of minerals in a magma. The presence of water can alter the solubility of minerals, leading to changes in their stability. This can result in the formation of new minerals or the dissolution of existing minerals, which can significantly alter the mineralogy of the rock.

For example, the presence of water can increase the solubility of minerals such as olivine and pyroxene, leading to their dissolution and the formation of new minerals such as plagioclase feldspar. This can result in the formation of different types of igneous rocks, such as granite, which is primarily composed of plagioclase feldspar.

#### 2.9a.3 Water and Magma Viscosity

Water can also affect the viscosity of a magma, which is a measure of its resistance to flow. The presence of water can decrease the viscosity of a magma, making it more fluid and allowing it to flow more easily. This can have important implications for the formation of different types of igneous rocks, as the viscosity of a magma can influence its ability to flow and the resulting texture of the rock.

In conclusion, the presence of water can significantly alter the crystallization behavior of a magma, leading to changes in the mineralogy and chemical composition of the resulting rocks. Understanding the effects of water on fractional crystallization is crucial for understanding the formation of igneous rocks and their variations.




### Subsection: 2.9b Comparison of wet and dry fractional crystallization processes

Fractional crystallization is a fundamental process in the formation of igneous rocks. It involves the separation of minerals from a melt or solution as it cools and solidifies. This process can occur in both wet and dry conditions, and the differences between these two processes can have significant implications for the resulting rock.

#### 2.9b.1 Wet Fractional Crystallization

Wet fractional crystallization occurs when a melt or solution is in contact with water. The presence of water can significantly alter the crystallization process. As mentioned in the previous section, water can act as a nucleation agent, promoting the formation of new crystals. It can also affect the growth rate of crystals and the stability of minerals.

In wet fractional crystallization, the water can also act as a medium for the transport of ions and minerals. This can lead to the formation of different minerals and the redistribution of elements within the melt. This can result in the formation of more complex and diverse rock types.

#### 2.9b.2 Dry Fractional Crystallization

Dry fractional crystallization, on the other hand, occurs when a melt or solution is not in contact with water. In this process, the crystallization of minerals occurs without the influence of water. This can result in a more straightforward crystallization process, with fewer changes in mineralogy and chemical composition.

However, dry fractional crystallization can also lead to the formation of more homogeneous rock types, as the lack of water can limit the redistribution of elements and minerals. This can result in rocks with more uniform mineralogy and chemical composition.

#### 2.9b.3 Comparison of Wet and Dry Fractional Crystallization

The comparison of wet and dry fractional crystallization processes is complex and depends on a variety of factors, including the composition of the melt or solution, the presence of water, and the temperature and pressure conditions.

In general, wet fractional crystallization can lead to more complex and diverse rock types, due to the influence of water on the crystallization process. However, this can also result in more heterogeneous rock types, with variations in mineralogy and chemical composition.

Dry fractional crystallization, on the other hand, can lead to more homogeneous rock types, with fewer variations in mineralogy and chemical composition. However, this can also result in more straightforward crystallization processes, with fewer changes in mineralogy and chemical composition.

In conclusion, the comparison of wet and dry fractional crystallization processes is complex and depends on a variety of factors. Understanding these differences is crucial for the study of igneous petrology and the formation of different types of rocks.

Extrusive igneous rocks, such as basalt and andesite, are formed when magma is ejected onto the Earth's surface, while intrusive igneous rocks, such as granite and diorite, are formed when magma cools and solidifies beneath the surface.

We have also examined the chemical variations within igneous rocks, understanding that these variations can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the composition of the original magma, the conditions under which the magma cools and solidifies, and the presence of other minerals or rocks. We have learned that these variations can be represented graphically, using tools such as the QAPF diagram and the AFM diagram, which allow us to visualize the chemical composition of igneous rocks in a clear and intuitive way.

### Section 3.1 Hydrous Differentiation - The Role of Amphibole:

#### 3.1a Petrology and geochemistry of hydrous differentiation

Hydrous differentiation is a fundamental process in the formation of igneous rocks. It involves the separation of minerals and melts based on their affinity for water. This process is particularly important in the formation of amphibole, a common mineral found in many igneous rocks.

Amphibole is a hydrous silicate mineral that is commonly found in mafic and intermediate igneous rocks. It is characterized by its double chain structure, which allows it to accommodate a significant amount of water. The presence of amphibole in a rock can provide valuable insights into the conditions under which it was formed.

The formation of amphibole is closely tied to the process of hydrous differentiation. As a melt cools and solidifies, minerals with a higher affinity for water will crystallize first, leaving behind a more water-rich melt. This process can lead to the formation of amphibole, which has a high affinity for water.

The geochemistry of amphibole is also important in understanding the process of hydrous differentiation. Amphibole is typically enriched in elements such as iron, magnesium, and calcium, which are commonly found in mafic and intermediate rocks. However, the presence of amphibole can also indicate the presence of water in the melt, as it is one of the few minerals that can accommodate significant amounts of water.

The role of amphibole in hydrous differentiation is crucial in understanding the formation of igneous rocks. By studying the mineral composition and geochemistry of amphibole, we can gain insights into the conditions under which it was formed and the processes that it has undergone.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the topic of metamorphic differentiation, which is a fundamental concept in the field of igneous petrology. Metamorphic differentiation refers to the process by which different minerals and rocks are formed from a single parent material under varying conditions of temperature and pressure.

### Subsection 3.1b The role of amphibole in hydrous differentiation processes

Amphibole plays a crucial role in the process of hydrous differentiation. As mentioned earlier, amphibole is a hydrous silicate mineral that is commonly found in mafic and intermediate igneous rocks. Its presence can provide valuable insights into the conditions under which a rock was formed.

One of the key roles of amphibole in hydrous differentiation is its ability to accommodate a significant amount of water. As a melt cools and solidifies, minerals with a higher affinity for water will crystallize first, leaving behind a more water-rich melt. Amphibole, with its double chain structure, is one of the minerals that can accommodate this water-rich melt. This allows for the formation of amphibole in the later stages of crystallization, as the melt becomes more water-rich.

The geochemistry of amphibole also plays a crucial role in hydrous differentiation. Amphibole is typically enriched in elements such as iron, magnesium, and calcium, which are commonly found in mafic and intermediate rocks. However, the presence of amphibole can also indicate the presence of water in the melt. This is because amphibole is one of the few minerals that can accommodate significant amounts of water. Therefore, the presence of amphibole can provide evidence for the occurrence of hydrous differentiation.

Furthermore, the role of amphibole in hydrous differentiation can also be seen in its effect on the overall composition of a rock. As amphibole crystallizes, it can incorporate elements from the melt, altering the composition of the melt. This can lead to the formation of different minerals and melts, further contributing to the process of hydrous differentiation.

In conclusion, amphibole plays a crucial role in the process of hydrous differentiation. Its ability to accommodate water and its effect on the overall composition of a rock make it a valuable indicator of the conditions under which a rock was formed. By studying the mineral composition and geochemistry of amphibole, we can gain a deeper understanding of the processes that occur during the formation of igneous rocks.





### Subsection 3.2a Phase equilibria and liquid compositions in hydrous mantle melting

Hydrous mantle melting is a complex process that involves the interaction of various phases and their equilibrium. The composition of the melt plays a crucial role in determining the phase equilibrium and ultimately the composition of the resulting igneous rock. In this section, we will explore the role of phase equilibria and liquid compositions in hydrous mantle melting.

#### Phase Equilibria in Hydrous Mantle Melting

The phase equilibrium in hydrous mantle melting is governed by the principles of thermodynamics. The Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of the system all play a role in determining the stability of different phases. The Gibbs free energy is a measure of the energy available to do work in a system at constant temperature and pressure. It is given by the equation:

$$
G = H - TS
$$

where $H$ is the enthalpy, $T$ is the temperature, and $S$ is the entropy. The enthalpy is a measure of the total energy of the system, while the entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness in the system.

In hydrous mantle melting, the phase equilibrium is determined by the relative values of the Gibbs free energy of the different phases. The phase with the lowest Gibbs free energy is the most stable and will be the dominant phase in the melt. The Gibbs free energy of a phase can be calculated using the equation:

$$
G = H - TS + \mu N
$$

where $\mu$ is the chemical potential and $N$ is the number of moles of the phase. The chemical potential is a measure of the energy required to add or remove a mole of a substance from the system.

#### Liquid Compositions in Hydrous Mantle Melting

The composition of the melt plays a crucial role in determining the phase equilibrium and ultimately the composition of the resulting igneous rock. The composition of the melt is determined by the relative amounts of different phases present in the system. The composition of the melt can be calculated using the equation:

$$
X = \frac{N_1}{N_1 + N_2 + ... + N_n}
$$

where $N_1, N_2, ..., N_n$ are the number of moles of the different phases present in the system. The composition of the melt can also be represented graphically using a ternary diagram, where the composition of the melt is represented by a point within a triangle formed by the three phases.

In hydrous mantle melting, the composition of the melt can be influenced by the presence of water. Water can increase the solubility of certain elements, leading to changes in the composition of the melt. This can result in the formation of different phases and ultimately the formation of different types of igneous rocks.

In conclusion, the phase equilibria and liquid compositions play a crucial role in hydrous mantle melting. The principles of thermodynamics and the composition of the melt determine the phase equilibrium and ultimately the composition of the resulting igneous rock. Understanding these concepts is essential for understanding the significance of igneous rock series.





### Subsection 3.2b Constraints on hydrous mantle melting using experimental and natural data

Hydrous mantle melting is a complex process that is influenced by a variety of factors, including temperature, pressure, and the composition of the mantle. In order to better understand this process, scientists have turned to both experimental and natural data.

#### Experimental Constraints on Hydrous Mantle Melting

Experimental studies have been used to investigate the conditions under which hydrous mantle melting occurs. These studies involve subjecting mantle rocks to high temperatures and pressures, similar to those found in the mantle, and observing the resulting melting behavior.

One of the key findings from these experiments is the role of water in the melting process. Water is a powerful agent for reducing the melting point of mantle rocks, and its presence can significantly increase the amount of melt produced. This is due to the fact that water can weaken the bonds between minerals, making them more susceptible to melting.

Experimental studies have also shed light on the composition of the resulting melt. By analyzing the composition of the melt produced in these experiments, scientists have been able to identify the major and trace elements present in the melt, as well as their relative abundances. This information can then be compared to natural data to further understand the melting process.

#### Natural Constraints on Hydrous Mantle Melting

Natural data, such as the composition of volcanic rocks and the isotopic signature of mantle plumes, can also provide valuable insights into hydrous mantle melting. By studying the composition of volcanic rocks, scientists can determine the relative amounts of different elements and isotopes present in the melt. This information can then be used to infer the composition of the mantle source and the conditions under which the melt was produced.

Isotopic data, in particular, has been used to study the melting process. Isotopes of elements, such as oxygen and hydrogen, can provide information about the source of the water involved in the melting process. For example, the presence of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, can indicate the involvement of subducted oceanic crust in the melting process.

In addition to studying the composition of volcanic rocks, scientists have also used seismic data to study the melting process. Seismic tomography, for example, has been used to map the temperature and composition of the mantle, providing valuable insights into the conditions under which hydrous mantle melting occurs.

Overall, both experimental and natural data have been crucial in advancing our understanding of hydrous mantle melting. By combining these two approaches, scientists have been able to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this complex process. 





### Subsection 3.3a Phase relations and petrogenetic processes in felsic magmas

Felsic magmas, also known as silicic magmas, are a type of magma that is rich in silica and have a high viscosity. They are characterized by their high silica content, typically greater than 63%, and are responsible for the formation of many of the world's most well-known volcanic features, such as the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone Caldera.

#### Phase Relations in Felsic Magmas

The phase relations in felsic magmas are complex and highly dependent on the composition of the magma. As mentioned in the previous section, felsic magmas have a high silica content, which means they are dominated by silicate minerals. However, the exact composition of these minerals can vary greatly depending on the source of the magma and the conditions it experiences during its formation and evolution.

One of the key factors that influence the phase relations in felsic magmas is the presence of water. As mentioned in the previous section, water can significantly increase the amount of melt produced during hydrous mantle melting. In felsic magmas, water can also play a crucial role in the formation of different minerals. For example, the presence of water can promote the formation of minerals such as plagioclase feldspar, which is a common mineral in felsic magmas.

#### Petrogenetic Processes in Felsic Magmas

The petrogenetic processes that occur in felsic magmas are also highly dependent on the composition of the magma. As mentioned earlier, felsic magmas have a high silica content, which means they are dominated by silicate minerals. However, the exact composition of these minerals can vary greatly depending on the source of the magma and the conditions it experiences during its formation and evolution.

One of the key processes that occurs in felsic magmas is the crystallization of minerals. As the magma cools and evolves, different minerals will crystallize at different temperatures. This process can be influenced by the presence of water, as well as the composition of the magma. For example, the presence of water can promote the crystallization of minerals such as plagioclase feldspar, while the composition of the magma can influence the crystallization of other minerals such as quartz and biotite.

Another important process that occurs in felsic magmas is the separation of different phases. As the magma evolves, different phases may separate from the melt, forming distinct layers within the magma chamber. This process can be influenced by the composition of the magma, as well as the presence of water. For example, the presence of water can promote the separation of different phases, leading to the formation of distinct layers within the magma chamber.

In conclusion, the phase relations and petrogenetic processes in felsic magmas are highly complex and dependent on the composition of the magma. The presence of water can play a crucial role in these processes, promoting the formation of different minerals and influencing the crystallization and separation of different phases. Further research and study are needed to fully understand these processes and their significance in the formation of felsic magmas.

## Chapter 4: Plutonic Rocks

 4.1: Plutonic Textures

Plutonic rocks are a type of igneous rock that is formed deep within the Earth's crust. They are characterized by their coarse-grained texture and their formation through the crystallization of molten rock, or magma. In this section, we will explore the different textures of plutonic rocks and how they are formed.

#### Subsection 4.1a: Coarse-grained Textures in Plutonic Rocks

Coarse-grained textures are a common feature of plutonic rocks. These textures are formed when the magma cools slowly, allowing the minerals to grow and crystallize in a larger size. This results in a coarse-grained texture, with visible grains that are typically larger than 2 millimeters in size.

The formation of coarse-grained textures is influenced by several factors, including the composition of the magma, the temperature and pressure conditions, and the rate of cooling. For example, magmas with a high silica content tend to produce coarse-grained textures, as the silica molecules hinder the growth of minerals and result in larger grains.

Coarse-grained textures are also commonly found in plutonic rocks that have undergone partial melting. This occurs when the magma is heated to a high temperature, causing it to partially melt and form a mixture of melt and solid minerals. As the magma cools, the minerals in the mixture can continue to grow and crystallize, resulting in a coarse-grained texture.

In addition to their formation processes, coarse-grained textures also provide valuable information about the conditions under which the magma was formed. For example, the size and shape of the grains can indicate the temperature and pressure conditions, as well as the rate of cooling. This information can be used to reconstruct the geological history of the Earth's crust and understand the processes that have shaped it over time.

In conclusion, coarse-grained textures are a defining characteristic of plutonic rocks and play a crucial role in understanding the formation and evolution of these rocks. By studying the textures of plutonic rocks, we can gain valuable insights into the processes and conditions that occur deep within the Earth's crust.

For example, the size and shape of the grains can indicate the temperature and pressure conditions, as well as the rate of cooling. This information can be used to reconstruct the geological history of the Earth's crust and understand the processes that have shaped it over time.

### Subsection 4.1b: Fine-grained Textures in Plutonic Rocks

In contrast to coarse-grained textures, fine-grained textures are characterized by smaller grains, typically less than 2 millimeters in size. These textures are formed when the magma cools rapidly, preventing the minerals from growing and crystallizing in a larger size. This results in a fine-grained texture, with smaller grains that are difficult to see with the naked eye.

The formation of fine-grained textures is also influenced by the composition of the magma, as well as the temperature and pressure conditions. Magmas with a lower silica content tend to produce fine-grained textures, as the minerals can grow and crystallize more quickly in a lower silica environment.

Fine-grained textures are commonly found in plutonic rocks that have undergone rapid cooling, such as in volcanic arcs or in the presence of large amounts of water. These textures can also provide valuable information about the conditions under which the magma was formed, as well as the processes that have shaped the Earth's crust over time.

### Subsection 4.1c: Microtextures in Plutonic Rocks

In addition to coarse-grained and fine-grained textures, plutonic rocks can also exhibit microtextures. These textures are characterized by extremely small grains, typically less than 0.1 millimeters in size. They are formed when the magma cools very rapidly, preventing the minerals from growing and crystallizing in a larger size.

Microtextures are commonly found in plutonic rocks that have undergone extremely rapid cooling, such as in the presence of large amounts of water or in the formation of small intrusive igneous bodies. These textures can provide valuable information about the conditions under which the magma was formed, as well as the processes that have shaped the Earth's crust over time.

In conclusion, the texture of plutonic rocks is an important aspect of understanding their formation and evolution. Coarse-grained, fine-grained, and microtextures all provide valuable information about the conditions under which the magma was formed and the processes that have shaped the Earth's crust over time. By studying these textures, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex and dynamic nature of plutonic rocks.

 4.2: Plutonic Mineralogy

Plutonic rocks are a type of igneous rock that is formed deep within the Earth's crust. They are characterized by their coarse-grained texture and their formation through the crystallization of molten rock, or magma. In this section, we will explore the different mineral compositions of plutonic rocks and how they are formed.

#### Subsection 4.2a: Common Minerals in Plutonic Rocks

Plutonic rocks are composed of a variety of minerals, each with its own unique properties and characteristics. Some of the most common minerals found in plutonic rocks include quartz, feldspar, mica, and amphibole.

Quartz is a common mineral found in many types of igneous rocks, including plutonic rocks. It is a silicate mineral with a hardness of 7 on the Mohs scale, making it resistant to weathering and erosion. Quartz is typically colorless or white, and its crystals are often intergrown with other minerals, giving it a granular or microcrystalline texture.

Feldspar is another common mineral found in plutonic rocks. It is a group of minerals that make up about 60% of the Earth's crust. Feldspar is typically light in color, with a hardness of 6 on the Mohs scale. It is commonly found in granitic rocks and is known for its ability to form large, euhedral crystals.

Mica is a group of minerals that are commonly found in plutonic rocks. They are characterized by their thin, platy shape and their ability to split into thin sheets. Mica is typically found in metamorphic rocks, but it can also be found in some igneous rocks, such as gneiss.

Amphibole is a group of minerals that are commonly found in plutonic rocks. They are characterized by their dark color and their prismatic crystals. Amphibole is typically found in mafic igneous rocks, such as basalt and gabbro.

The mineral composition of plutonic rocks is influenced by several factors, including the composition of the magma, the temperature and pressure conditions, and the rate of cooling. For example, magmas with a high silica content tend to produce more quartz and feldspar, while magmas with a lower silica content tend to produce more mica and amphibole.

In addition to their mineral composition, plutonic rocks also exhibit different textures, as discussed in the previous section. These textures can provide valuable information about the conditions under which the magma was formed and the processes that have shaped the Earth's crust over time.

### Subsection 4.2b: Mineral Compositions and Textures in Plutonic Rocks

The mineral composition and texture of plutonic rocks can vary greatly depending on the type of magma from which they were formed. For example, plutonic rocks formed from a silica-rich magma will have a different mineral composition and texture than those formed from a silica-poor magma.

In general, plutonic rocks formed from a silica-rich magma will have a more felsic texture, with a higher proportion of quartz and feldspar. These rocks are typically light in color and have a coarse-grained texture. On the other hand, plutonic rocks formed from a silica-poor magma will have a more mafic texture, with a higher proportion of mica and amphibole. These rocks are typically dark in color and have a fine-grained texture.

The mineral composition and texture of plutonic rocks can also provide valuable information about the processes that have shaped the Earth's crust. For example, the presence of certain minerals, such as biotite or hornblende, can indicate the presence of a magmatic water system. This can provide insights into the role of water in the formation of plutonic rocks and the overall geological history of the Earth's crust.

In conclusion, the mineral composition and texture of plutonic rocks are important aspects of understanding their formation and evolution. By studying the different minerals and textures found in these rocks, we can gain a deeper understanding of the processes that have shaped the Earth's crust over time.

### Subsection 3.4b Petrogenesis and magma evolution in large silicic magmatic systems

The petrogenesis of large silicic magmatic systems is a complex process that involves the melting of the Earth's mantle or the partial melting of the crust. This process is influenced by a variety of factors, including the composition of the source material, the pressure and temperature conditions, and the presence of water and other volatiles.

#### The Role of Water in Magma Evolution

Water plays a crucial role in the evolution of magmas in large silicic magmatic systems. As mentioned earlier, water can significantly increase the amount of melt produced during hydrous mantle melting. This is because water lowers the melting point of the mantle, allowing more melt to be produced. Additionally, water can also promote the formation of different minerals in the magma, such as plagioclase feldspar.

The presence of water can also influence the viscosity of the magma. Water can decrease the viscosity of the magma, making it more fluid and allowing it to flow more easily. This can have a significant impact on the evolution of the magma, as a more fluid magma can undergo more extensive mixing and differentiation processes.

#### The Influence of Pressure and Temperature Conditions

The pressure and temperature conditions in which the magma forms can also have a significant impact on its evolution. As the magma rises towards the surface, it experiences a decrease in pressure and an increase in temperature. This can lead to changes in the mineralogy and composition of the magma, as different minerals may crystallize or dissolve at different temperatures and pressures.

For example, in the case of the Peach Spring Tuff, the magma body that erupted was compositionally and texturally zoned, indicating a change in temperature and pressure conditions. The textural and compositional shift represents a zoned magma body because the first material to erupt is slightly different than the last material, indicating change from shallow magma to deep magma.

#### The Role of Volatiles in Magma Evolution

Volatiles, such as water, carbon dioxide, and sulfur, can also play a significant role in the evolution of magmas in large silicic magmatic systems. These volatiles can be incorporated into the magma during the melting process, and their presence can influence the viscosity, mineralogy, and composition of the magma.

For example, the presence of volatiles can decrease the viscosity of the magma, making it more fluid and allowing it to flow more easily. This can have a significant impact on the evolution of the magma, as a more fluid magma can undergo more extensive mixing and differentiation processes.

Volatiles can also influence the mineralogy of the magma. For instance, the presence of water can promote the formation of different minerals, such as plagioclase feldspar. Additionally, volatiles can also play a role in the crystallization of minerals, as they can affect the temperature and pressure conditions in which minerals crystallize.

In conclusion, the petrogenesis and evolution of large silicic magmatic systems are complex processes that are influenced by a variety of factors. The role of water, pressure and temperature conditions, and volatiles are all crucial in understanding the formation and evolution of these systems. Further research and study are needed to fully understand the intricacies of these processes and their significance in the study of igneous petrology.

### Subsection 3.5a Geology and igneous activity in Hawaii

The Hawaiian Islands are a chain of volcanic islands formed by a hot spot in the Earth's mantle. The hot spot is responsible for the creation of the Hawaiian Islands and the Emperor Seamount Chain. The Hawaiian Islands are a prime example of the significance of igneous rock series, as they exhibit a range of igneous rocks and their associated processes.

#### The Hawaiian Islands and the Emperor Seamount Chain

The Hawaiian Islands are a chain of volcanic islands formed by a hot spot in the Earth's mantle. The hot spot is responsible for the creation of the Hawaiian Islands and the Emperor Seamount Chain. The Hawaiian Islands are a prime example of the significance of igneous rock series, as they exhibit a range of igneous rocks and their associated processes.

The Hawaiian Islands are composed of a series of volcanic rocks, including basalt, basaltic andesite, andesite, dacite, and rhyodacite. These rocks are formed by the cooling and solidification of magma from the hot spot. The composition of the magma changes as it moves away from the hot spot, resulting in the formation of different types of igneous rocks.

#### The Role of Water in Hawaiian Magma Evolution

Water plays a crucial role in the evolution of magmas in the Hawaiian Islands. As mentioned earlier, water can significantly increase the amount of melt produced during hydrous mantle melting. This is because water lowers the melting point of the mantle, allowing more melt to be produced. Additionally, water can also promote the formation of different minerals in the magma, such as plagioclase feldspar.

The presence of water can also influence the viscosity of the magma. Water can decrease the viscosity of the magma, making it more fluid and allowing it to flow more easily. This can have a significant impact on the evolution of the magma, as a more fluid magma can undergo more extensive mixing and differentiation processes.

#### The Influence of Pressure and Temperature Conditions

The pressure and temperature conditions in which the magma forms can also have a significant impact on its evolution. As the magma rises towards the surface, it experiences a decrease in pressure and an increase in temperature. This can lead to changes in the mineralogy and composition of the magma, as different minerals may crystallize or dissolve at different temperatures and pressures.

For example, in the case of the Hawaiian Islands, the magma body that erupted was compositionally and texturally zoned, indicating a change in temperature and pressure conditions. The textural and compositional shift represents a zoned magma body because the first material to erupt is slightly different than the last material to erupt. This can be attributed to the changes in pressure and temperature as the magma rises towards the surface.

### Subsection 3.5b Petrogenesis and magma evolution in Hawaii

The petrogenesis of the Hawaiian Islands is a complex process that involves the interaction of various factors, including the hot spot, the lithosphere, and the atmosphere. The hot spot is responsible for the creation of the Hawaiian Islands and the Emperor Seamount Chain, but it is not the only factor at play. The lithosphere, the outermost layer of the Earth's mantle and crust, also plays a crucial role in the formation of the Hawaiian Islands. The atmosphere, specifically water, also has a significant impact on the evolution of the magma in the Hawaiian Islands.

#### The Role of the Hot Spot

The hot spot is a plume of hot material that rises from the Earth's mantle. It is responsible for the creation of the Hawaiian Islands and the Emperor Seamount Chain. The hot spot is thought to be a remnant of the mantle plume that formed the Hawaiian Islands, and it continues to create new islands as it moves across the Pacific Ocean.

The hot spot is responsible for the creation of the Hawaiian Islands and the Emperor Seamount Chain. As the hot spot moves across the Pacific Ocean, it creates a chain of volcanic islands. The Hawaiian Islands are the youngest of these islands, and they are still being formed by the hot spot.

#### The Role of the Lithosphere

The lithosphere, the outermost layer of the Earth's mantle and crust, also plays a crucial role in the formation of the Hawaiian Islands. The lithosphere is responsible for the creation of the Emperor Seamount Chain, which is a chain of volcanic seamounts that extends from the Hawaiian Islands to the Pacific Ocean.

The lithosphere is thought to be responsible for the creation of the Emperor Seamount Chain because it is the only layer of the Earth's mantle and crust that is not affected by the hot spot. The lithosphere is too thick to be affected by the hot spot, and it continues to create new seamounts as it moves across the Pacific Ocean.

#### The Role of Water

Water plays a crucial role in the evolution of magmas in the Hawaiian Islands. As mentioned earlier, water can significantly increase the amount of melt produced during hydrous mantle melting. This is because water lowers the melting point of the mantle, allowing more melt to be produced. Additionally, water can also promote the formation of different minerals in the magma, such as plagioclase feldspar.

The presence of water can also influence the viscosity of the magma. Water can decrease the viscosity of the magma, making it more fluid and allowing it to flow more easily. This can have a significant impact on the evolution of the magma, as a more fluid magma can undergo more extensive mixing and differentiation processes.

#### The Influence of Pressure and Temperature Conditions

The pressure and temperature conditions in which the magma forms can also have a significant impact on its evolution. As the magma rises towards the surface, it experiences a decrease in pressure and an increase in temperature. This can lead to changes in the mineralogy and composition of the magma, as different minerals may crystallize or dissolve at different temperatures and pressures.

For example, in the case of the Hawaiian Islands, the magma body that erupted was compositionally and texturally zoned, indicating a change in temperature and pressure conditions. The textural and compositional shift represents a zoned magma body because the first material to erupt is slightly different than the last material to erupt. This can be attributed to the changes in pressure and temperature as the magma rises towards the surface.

### Subsection 3.5c Igneous processes and volcanic hazards in Hawaii

The Hawaiian Islands are a prime example of the significance of igneous rock series, as they exhibit a range of igneous rocks and their associated processes. The islands are also home to a variety of volcanic hazards, making them a crucial area of study for understanding the complex interplay between igneous processes and volcanic hazards.

#### Igneous Processes in Hawaii

The Hawaiian Islands are formed by a hot spot in the Earth's mantle, which creates a chain of volcanic islands as it moves across the Pacific Ocean. The hot spot is responsible for the creation of the Hawaiian Islands and the Emperor Seamount Chain. The hot spot is thought to be a remnant of the mantle plume that formed the Hawaiian Islands, and it continues to create new islands as it moves across the Pacific Ocean.

#### Volcanic Hazards in Hawaii

The Hawaiian Islands are also home to a variety of volcanic hazards, including lava flows, volcanic bombs, and pyroclastic flows. These hazards can have devastating effects on the islands and their inhabitants.

Lava flows are one of the most common volcanic hazards in Hawaii. They are formed when molten rock, or magma, flows from a volcano and solidifies as it cools. Lava flows can be slow-moving or fast-moving, and they can cover large areas of land, destroying everything in their path.

Volcanic bombs are another common volcanic hazard in Hawaii. They are formed when molten rock, or magma, is ejected from a volcano and solidifies as it cools in mid-air. Volcanic bombs can be small or large, and they can cause significant damage when they impact the ground.

Pyroclastic flows are also a major volcanic hazard in Hawaii. They are formed when a volcanic eruption sends a mixture of hot gas, ash, and rock fragments flowing down the volcanic slope. Pyroclastic flows can travel at high speeds and can cause significant damage to the surrounding area.

#### The Role of Water in Volcanic Hazards

Water plays a crucial role in the formation and impact of volcanic hazards in Hawaii. As mentioned earlier, water can significantly increase the amount of melt produced during hydrous mantle melting. This can lead to more frequent and larger volcanic eruptions, which can result in more severe volcanic hazards.

Additionally, water can also play a role in the formation of volcanic bombs. As water is introduced to the molten rock, or magma, it can cause the magma to become more viscous, making it more likely to form volcanic bombs as it is ejected from the volcano.

In conclusion, the Hawaiian Islands are a prime example of the significance of igneous rock series and the complex interplay between igneous processes and volcanic hazards. The hot spot, lithosphere, and atmosphere all play crucial roles in the formation and evolution of the Hawaiian Islands, and the study of these processes can provide valuable insights into the formation of other volcanic systems.

## Chapter 4: The Geochemical Cycles

### Introduction

The Earth is a complex system, with intricate processes that govern the distribution and cycling of elements and compounds. These processes, known as geochemical cycles, play a crucial role in shaping the planet's surface and interior. In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of geochemical cycles, exploring their significance and the mechanisms that drive them.

Geochemical cycles involve the movement of elements and compounds between the Earth's surface, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere. These cycles are driven by a variety of factors, including physical processes such as weathering and erosion, chemical reactions, and biological activity. They are responsible for the distribution of elements and compounds on the Earth's surface, as well as their cycling between the Earth's surface and interior.

In this chapter, we will explore the major geochemical cycles, including the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, the phosphorus cycle, and the sulfur cycle. We will discuss the role of these cycles in regulating the Earth's climate, influencing the composition of the atmosphere, and shaping the evolution of the Earth's surface and interior. We will also examine the impact of human activities on these cycles, and the potential consequences of disrupting these delicate systems.

Understanding geochemical cycles is not only important for geologists and environmental scientists, but also for anyone interested in the workings of our planet. By studying these cycles, we can gain a deeper understanding of the Earth as a dynamic system, and the interconnectedness of its various components. This knowledge can help us make more informed decisions about our use of natural resources, and our impact on the environment.

In the following sections, we will explore the major geochemical cycles in detail, starting with the carbon cycle. We will begin by discussing the role of carbon in the Earth's systems, and the processes that govern its cycling between the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere. We will then move on to discuss the other major geochemical cycles, exploring their mechanisms, significance, and the impact of human activities.




### Subsection 3.5b Geology and igneous activity in Iceland

Iceland is another prime example of the significance of igneous rock series. The country is located on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a divergent plate boundary where the North American and Eurasian Plates are pulling apart. This results in a high level of volcanic activity, with over 100 volcanoes and volcanic systems active in Iceland.

#### The Icelandic Plateau and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge

The Icelandic Plateau is a vast lava plateau that covers most of Iceland. It is the result of the divergence of the North American and Eurasian Plates, which has been occurring for the past 15-20 million years. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which runs through the center of Iceland, is a key factor in this process. The ridge is a mountain range that is the result of the upwelling of the Earth's mantle as the plates move apart.

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is also a site of intense hydrothermal activity, which plays a crucial role in the evolution of magmas in Iceland. Hydrothermal systems can introduce water and other fluids into the magma, altering its composition and viscosity. This can lead to the formation of different types of igneous rocks, as seen in the Hawaiian Islands.

#### The Role of Water in Icelandic Magma Evolution

Water plays a significant role in the evolution of magmas in Iceland. As mentioned earlier, water can increase the amount of melt produced during hydrous mantle melting. In Iceland, this is particularly important due to the high level of hydrothermal activity. The introduction of water and other fluids can significantly alter the composition of the magma, leading to the formation of different types of igneous rocks.

Water can also influence the viscosity of the magma in Iceland. As in the Hawaiian Islands, a more fluid magma can undergo more extensive mixing and differentiation processes, resulting in a range of igneous rocks. This is particularly evident in the Icelandic Plateau, where the composition of the magma changes dramatically from the coast to the interior.

#### The Influence of Plate Tectonics on Icelandic Volcanism

The Icelandic Plateau is a result of the divergence of the North American and Eurasian Plates. This process has been occurring for millions of years, and it has had a significant impact on the volcanic activity in Iceland. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which runs through the center of Iceland, is a key factor in this process. The ridge is a site of intense volcanic activity, with over 100 volcanoes and volcanic systems active in Iceland.

The plate tectonic setting of Iceland also plays a crucial role in the formation of different types of igneous rocks. The divergence of the plates results in the upwelling of the Earth's mantle, which can introduce new minerals and elements into the magma. This can lead to the formation of unique igneous rocks, such as olivine basalt and rhyolite, which are found in Iceland.

In conclusion, the geology and igneous activity in Iceland are heavily influenced by the plate tectonic setting of the country. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge, hydrothermal activity, and the introduction of water and other fluids all play a crucial role in the evolution of magmas and the formation of different types of igneous rocks.

We have also discussed the different types of igneous rocks, including plutonic and volcanic rocks, and how they are formed. Plutonic rocks, which are formed deep within the Earth, are typically coarse-grained and have undergone extensive crystallization. Volcanic rocks, on the other hand, are formed at the surface and are typically fine-grained and have undergone little to no crystallization.

Furthermore, we have examined the concept of igneous rock series, which are groups of related igneous rocks that share similar mineral compositions and textures. These series can provide valuable information about the source of the magma and the processes that have acted upon it.

## Chapter: The Role of Water in Igneous Processes

### Introduction

Water plays a crucial role in the field of igneous petrology, influencing the formation, evolution, and behavior of igneous rocks. This chapter, "The Role of Water in Igneous Processes," delves into the intricate relationship between water and igneous rocks, exploring how water can alter the physical and chemical properties of magmas, and ultimately, the resulting igneous rocks.

The presence of water in magmas can significantly affect their viscosity, density, and melting behavior. It can also introduce new minerals and alter the mineral assemblage of the resulting igneous rocks. Understanding these processes is essential for interpreting the geological history of igneous rocks and their role in the Earth's evolution.

This chapter will also explore the various ways in which water can enter the magmatic system, from its initial incorporation during magma formation to its subsequent introduction through hydrothermal fluids. We will also discuss the mechanisms by which water can be removed from the system, such as through evaporation or incorporation into minerals.

Furthermore, we will examine the role of water in the formation of different types of igneous rocks, including basalt, granite, and rhyolite. Each of these rock types has a unique relationship with water, and understanding these relationships is crucial for understanding the formation of these rocks.

In summary, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of water in igneous processes, highlighting its importance in the formation and evolution of igneous rocks. By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the complex interplay between water and igneous rocks, and its implications for the Earth's geological history.




### Subsection 3.6a Introduction to Continental Flood Basalts (CFBs)

Continental Flood Basalts (CFBs) are a type of igneous rock series that have been the subject of extensive research due to their unique characteristics and formation processes. They are large, thick sequences of basaltic lava flows that cover large areas of the Earth's continents. The most well-known example of CFBs is the Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG) in North America.

#### The Columbia River Basalt Group

The Columbia River Basalt Group is a large igneous province (LIP) that covers an area of approximately 100,000 square kilometers in the northwestern United States and southwestern Canada. It is composed of more than 300 individual basalt lava flows, with an average volume of about 1 cubic kilometer each. The CRBG is divided into four major categories: The Steens Basalt, Grande Ronde Basalt, the Wanapum Basalt, and the Saddle Mountains Basalt.

The formation of the CRBG was marked by a transition from periodic, regular eruptions of the Western Cascade stratovolcanoes to a shift towards shield volcanic flooding. This transition occurred around 17.5 million years ago and was accompanied by an increase in the volume and frequency of eruptions. The CRBG is a prime example of the significance of igneous rock series, as it provides valuable insights into the processes of magma formation and evolution.

#### The Role of Volatiles in CFB Formation

The formation of CFBs is closely linked to the release of volatiles, particularly sulphur dioxide (SO2). The CRBG, like other LIPs, was marked by atmospheric loading through the mass exsolution and emission of volatiles. Comparative analysis of volatile concentrations in source feeder dikes to associated extruded flow units have been quantitatively measured to determine the magnitude of degassing exhibited in CRBG eruptions.

The Roza flow, a member of the Wanapum formation within the CRBG, contains some of the most well chemically preserved basalts for volatile analysis. The emission of sulphur for the Roza flow is calculated to be on the order of 12Gt (12,000 million tonnes) at a rate of 1.2Gt (1,200 million tonnes) annually, in the form of sulphur dioxide. However, other research through petrologic analysis has yielded SO2 mass degassing values at 0.12% - 0.28% of the total erupted mass of the magma, translating to lower emission estimates.

The role of volatiles in CFB formation is a topic of ongoing research, with the aim of understanding the processes that lead to the formation of these large igneous provinces. The study of CFBs provides valuable insights into the evolution of the Earth's continents and the role of volatiles in magma formation and evolution.

### Subsection 3.6b The Role of CFBs in Geological Processes

Continental Flood Basalts (CFBs) play a significant role in geological processes, particularly in the context of plate tectonics and the evolution of the Earth's continents. The formation of CFBs is often associated with large igneous provinces (LIPs), which are regions of extensive igneous activity that can cover areas of hundreds of thousands of square kilometers.

#### The Role of CFBs in Plate Tectonics

The formation of CFBs is closely linked to plate tectonics. The movement of tectonic plates can lead to the creation of hotspots, which are areas of intense heat and volcanic activity. These hotspots can trigger the formation of LIPs, including CFBs. The Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG) is a prime example of this, as it is associated with the Yellowstone hotspot.

The Yellowstone hotspot is a mantle plume that has been active for at least the last 16 million years. It is responsible for the formation of the CRBG and other volcanic features, including the Yellowstone Caldera. The heat from the Yellowstone hotspot is still active today, as evidenced by the ongoing volcanic activity in the region.

#### The Role of CFBs in the Evolution of the Earth's Continents

The formation of CFBs can also provide valuable insights into the evolution of the Earth's continents. The CRBG, for instance, is believed to have formed as a result of the separation of the Pacific and North American plates. This separation led to the creation of the Juan de Fuca and Explorer Plateaus, which are now part of the Pacific Ocean floor.

The formation of the CRBG also coincided with a period of intense volcanic activity in the region. This activity led to the extrusion of large volumes of basaltic lava, which covered the existing continental crust. The CRBG is therefore a key part of the geological history of the region, providing a record of the processes that shaped the Earth's continents.

#### The Role of CFBs in the Carbon Cycle

The formation of CFBs also plays a role in the Earth's carbon cycle. The extrusion of large volumes of basaltic lava can lead to the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. This CO2 can then be absorbed by the oceans, leading to ocean acidification.

The CRBG, for instance, is believed to have released large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere during its formation. This release of CO2 led to a spike in atmospheric CO2 levels, which had a significant impact on the Earth's climate. The CRBG therefore provides a natural experiment for studying the effects of large-scale volcanic activity on the Earth's carbon cycle.

In conclusion, CFBs play a crucial role in geological processes, including plate tectonics, the evolution of the Earth's continents, and the Earth's carbon cycle. The study of CFBs therefore provides valuable insights into the processes that shape our planet.

### Subsection 3.6c Case Studies of CFBs

In this section, we will delve into specific case studies of Continental Flood Basalts (CFBs) to further illustrate their significance in geological processes. We will focus on the Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG) and the Selli Event, two well-studied examples of CFBs.

#### The Columbia River Basalt Group

The Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG) is a prime example of a CFB. It is a large igneous province (LIP) that covers an area of approximately 100,000 square kilometers in the northwestern United States and southwestern Canada. The CRBG is composed of more than 300 individual basalt lava flows, with an average volume of about 1 cubic kilometer each.

The formation of the CRBG was marked by a transition from periodic, regular eruptions of the Western Cascade stratovolcanoes to a shift towards shield volcanic flooding. This transition occurred around 17.5 million years ago and was accompanied by an increase in the volume and frequency of eruptions. The CRBG is a key part of the geological history of the region, providing a record of the processes that shaped the Earth's continents.

#### The Selli Event

The Selli Event is another well-studied example of a CFB. It occurred approximately 120 million years ago and is named after the Selli Event crater, a large impact crater in the North Atlantic Ocean. The Selli Event is believed to have been caused by a large meteorite impact, which triggered a series of volcanic eruptions that led to the formation of a large igneous province.

The Selli Event is particularly significant because it coincided with a period of intense volcanic activity in the region. This activity led to the extrusion of large volumes of basaltic lava, which covered the existing continental crust. The Selli Event therefore provides valuable insights into the evolution of the Earth's continents and the role of CFBs in this process.

#### The Role of CFBs in the Carbon Cycle

The formation of CFBs also plays a role in the Earth's carbon cycle. The extrusion of large volumes of basaltic lava can lead to the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. This CO2 can then be absorbed by the oceans, leading to ocean acidification.

The CRBG and the Selli Event are both examples of CFBs that have had a significant impact on the Earth's carbon cycle. The release of CO2 during their formation has been linked to changes in the Earth's climate and ocean chemistry. These case studies therefore highlight the importance of studying CFBs in understanding the Earth's geological processes.

We have explored the formation of these rocks, their composition, and their role in the Earth's geological history. The CRBG, with its more than 300 individual basalt lava flows, provides a rich source of information about the processes of igneous petrology. Similarly, the Selli Event, a large impact event that occurred approximately 120 million years ago, has left a lasting impact on the Earth's crust and mantle.

The study of these igneous rock series is crucial in understanding the dynamics of the Earth's interior. It allows us to reconstruct the conditions under which these rocks were formed, and to infer the processes that shaped the Earth's crust and mantle. Furthermore, the study of these rocks can provide insights into the role of volcanism in the Earth's climate system, and into the mechanisms of plate tectonics.

## Chapter 4: The Role of Volatiles in Igneous Processes

### Introduction

The study of igneous processes is a fascinating and complex field, and one of the most intriguing aspects of this discipline is the role of volatiles. Volatiles, or volatile elements, are substances that are present in magma but are released as gases during the cooling and solidification process. These gases play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of igneous rocks, influencing their composition, texture, and structure.

In this chapter, we will delve into the intriguing world of volatiles and their role in igneous processes. We will explore how these gases are generated, how they interact with the magma, and how they influence the final product - the igneous rock. We will also discuss the various methods used to study these gases, and the challenges and limitations of these methods.

The study of volatiles is not just an academic exercise. It has practical implications in various fields, including mineral exploration, petrology, and geochemistry. Understanding the role of volatiles can help us predict the composition of magmas, identify the source of volcanic eruptions, and even locate potential mineral deposits.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of volatiles in igneous processes. It is designed to be accessible to both students and professionals in the field, and to provide a solid foundation for further study. We hope that this chapter will spark your interest in this fascinating and complex field, and inspire you to explore it further.

As we journey through this chapter, we will encounter many technical terms and concepts. These will be presented in a clear and concise manner, with explanations and examples to help you understand them. We will also provide references to more detailed discussions of these topics, for those who wish to delve deeper into the subject.

So, let's embark on this exciting journey into the world of volatiles and igneous processes.




### Subsection 3.6b Petrologic and geochemical characteristics of CFBs

Continental Flood Basalts (CFBs) are not only significant for their size and volume, but also for their unique petrologic and geochemical characteristics. These characteristics provide valuable insights into the processes of magma formation and evolution, as well as the Earth's mantle and crust.

#### The Petrologic Characteristics of CFBs

The petrologic characteristics of CFBs are largely determined by their mineral composition. The most common minerals found in CFBs are plagioclase feldspar, pyroxene, and olivine. These minerals are typically found in varying proportions, depending on the specific CFB. For example, the Steens Basalt of the CRBG is characterized by a high proportion of olivine, while the Grande Ronde Basalt is characterized by a high proportion of plagioclase feldspar.

The mineral composition of CFBs can also provide insights into the processes of magma formation and evolution. For example, the presence of olivine in a CFB can indicate a high-temperature, low-pressure origin, while the presence of plagioclase feldspar can indicate a lower temperature, higher pressure origin.

#### The Geochemical Characteristics of CFBs

The geochemical characteristics of CFBs are largely determined by their chemical composition. The most common elements found in CFBs are iron, magnesium, calcium, and silicon. These elements are typically found in varying proportions, depending on the specific CFB.

The chemical composition of CFBs can provide valuable insights into the Earth's mantle and crust. For example, the high iron and magnesium content of CFBs can indicate a deep mantle origin, while the high calcium and silicon content can indicate a shallow crustal origin.

#### The Role of Volatiles in CFB Geochemistry

The role of volatiles in CFB geochemistry is a topic of ongoing research. As mentioned in the previous section, the release of volatiles, particularly sulphur dioxide (SO2), is closely linked to the formation of CFBs. The presence of volatiles can significantly alter the chemical composition of CFBs, and their role in CFB geochemistry is an important area of study.

For example, the presence of volatiles can increase the silicon content of CFBs, which can affect their mineral composition and petrologic characteristics. Volatiles can also affect the melting behavior of the mantle, which can influence the formation and evolution of CFBs.

In conclusion, the petrologic and geochemical characteristics of CFBs provide valuable insights into the processes of magma formation and evolution, as well as the Earth's mantle and crust. The role of volatiles in CFB geochemistry is an important area of ongoing research.

## Chapter 4: The Role of Igneous Processes in Geological History

### Introduction

The study of igneous petrology is not just about understanding the properties of different types of rocks. It is also about understanding the processes that shape the Earth's crust and mantle. In this chapter, we will delve into the role of igneous processes in geological history. We will explore how these processes have influenced the evolution of the Earth's surface and the formation of different types of igneous rocks.

Igneous processes are fundamental to the Earth's geological history. They are responsible for the formation of the Earth's continents and oceans, as well as the creation of many of the Earth's most important mineral resources. Understanding these processes is crucial for understanding the Earth's past, present, and future.

In this chapter, we will cover a range of topics related to the role of igneous processes in geological history. We will start by discussing the different types of igneous processes, including magma formation, magma differentiation, and magma extrusion. We will then explore how these processes have shaped the Earth's crust and mantle over geological time scales.

We will also discuss the role of igneous processes in the formation of different types of igneous rocks. These include intrusive igneous rocks, such as granite and diorite, and extrusive igneous rocks, such as basalt and andesite. We will explore how the properties of these rocks are determined by the processes that formed them.

Finally, we will discuss the implications of igneous processes for the Earth's future. We will explore how these processes are likely to continue shaping the Earth's surface in the future, and how they may impact the Earth's climate and environment.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of the role of igneous processes in geological history. You should be able to understand how these processes have shaped the Earth's crust and mantle, and how they continue to shape the Earth's surface today.

### Subsection 3.7a Phase equilibria and mantle sources of CFBs

The phase equilibria of CFBs provide valuable insights into their mantle sources. The phase equilibria of a system is the set of conditions under which different phases of the system can coexist in equilibrium. In the context of CFBs, the phase equilibria can be used to determine the conditions under which different minerals can coexist in the magma.

#### The Role of Phase Equilibria in CFBs

The phase equilibria of CFBs can be used to determine the conditions under which different minerals can coexist in the magma. This is important because the mineral composition of a CFB can provide insights into the processes of magma formation and evolution, as well as the Earth's mantle and crust.

For example, the phase equilibria of olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase feldspar can be used to determine the conditions under which these minerals can coexist in a CFB. This can provide insights into the temperature and pressure conditions under which the magma was formed.

#### The Role of Mantle Sources in CFBs

The mantle sources of CFBs can also be determined using phase equilibria. The mantle sources of CFBs can be determined by studying the mineral composition of the CFB and comparing it to the mineral composition of the mantle.

For example, the presence of olivine in a CFB can indicate a deep mantle source, while the presence of plagioclase feldspar can indicate a shallow crustal source. This can provide insights into the processes of magma formation and evolution, as well as the Earth's mantle and crust.

#### The Role of Volatiles in CFB Phase Equilibria

The role of volatiles in CFB phase equilibria is a topic of ongoing research. As mentioned in the previous section, the release of volatiles, particularly sulphur dioxide (SO2), can have a significant impact on the phase equilibria of a CFB.

For example, the release of SO2 can lower the melting point of the magma, which can affect the phase equilibria of the magma. This can provide insights into the processes of magma formation and evolution, as well as the Earth's mantle and crust.

In conclusion, the phase equilibria and mantle sources of CFBs are important topics in advanced igneous petrology. They provide valuable insights into the processes of magma formation and evolution, as well as the Earth's mantle and crust. Further research in these areas will continue to enhance our understanding of CFBs and their significance in the Earth's history.

## Chapter: Advanced Igneous Petrology Textbook

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamental concepts of igneous petrology, including the formation and evolution of igneous rocks. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic and discuss the role of igneous processes in the Earth's mantle. The mantle is a crucial component of the Earth's interior, extending from a depth of approximately 80 km to the core-mantle boundary at 2900 km. It is composed of solid rock, but can also exhibit plastic behavior under certain conditions. The study of igneous processes in the mantle is essential for understanding the dynamics of the Earth's interior and its evolution over time.

This chapter will cover a range of topics related to igneous processes in the mantle. We will begin by discussing the composition and structure of the mantle, including the different layers and their properties. We will then explore the various processes that occur in the mantle, such as convection, subduction, and mantle plumes. These processes play a crucial role in the movement of heat and material within the Earth's interior, and have a significant impact on the formation and evolution of igneous rocks.

Next, we will examine the role of igneous processes in the formation of different types of igneous rocks. This includes the formation of basalt, gabbro, and other mafic rocks, as well as the formation of felsic rocks such as granite and rhyolite. We will also discuss the role of igneous processes in the formation of volcanic rocks, including extrusive and intrusive igneous rocks.

Finally, we will explore the impact of igneous processes on the Earth's surface. This includes the formation of volcanic structures, such as volcanoes and calderas, as well as the role of igneous processes in the formation of geological features such as faults and fractures. We will also discuss the role of igneous processes in the formation of mineral deposits, including precious metals and other valuable resources.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the role of igneous processes in the Earth's mantle and their impact on the formation and evolution of igneous rocks. This knowledge will provide a solid foundation for further exploration and research in the field of igneous petrology.

### Subsection 3.7b Constraints on CFB mantle sources using petrologic and geochemical data

The petrologic and geochemical data of CFBs can provide valuable constraints on their mantle sources. These data can be used to determine the composition of the mantle source, as well as the processes involved in the formation of the CFB.

#### The Role of Petrologic Data in CFB Mantle Sources

Petrologic data, such as the mineral composition and texture of the CFB, can provide insights into the mantle source. For example, the presence of olivine and pyroxene can indicate a deep mantle source, while the presence of plagioclase feldspar can indicate a shallow crustal source.

The texture of the CFB can also provide insights into the processes involved in its formation. For example, the presence of phenocrysts can indicate a rapid cooling process, while the absence of phenocrysts can indicate a slow cooling process.

#### The Role of Geochemical Data in CFB Mantle Sources

Geochemical data, such as the major and trace element composition of the CFB, can also provide valuable constraints on the mantle source. The major element composition of the CFB can provide insights into the composition of the mantle source, while the trace element composition can provide insights into the processes involved in the formation of the CFB.

For example, the presence of high concentrations of incompatible elements, such as potassium and rubidium, can indicate a deep mantle source, while the presence of low concentrations of these elements can indicate a shallow crustal source.

#### The Role of Volatiles in CFB Mantle Sources

The role of volatiles in CFB mantle sources is a topic of ongoing research. The presence of volatiles, such as water and carbon dioxide, can affect the melting behavior of the mantle source and the composition of the CFB.

For example, the presence of water can lower the melting point of the mantle source, leading to the formation of a more silica-rich CFB. The presence of carbon dioxide can also affect the composition of the CFB by promoting the crystallization of olivine and pyroxene.

In conclusion, the petrologic and geochemical data of CFBs can provide valuable constraints on their mantle sources. These data can be used to determine the composition of the mantle source, as well as the processes involved in the formation of the CFB.

Understanding the role of volatiles in igneous processes is therefore essential for a comprehensive understanding of igneous petrology.

In this chapter, we will explore the various types of volatiles, their sources, and their effects on igneous processes. We will also discuss the methods and techniques used to study volatiles in igneous rocks. By the end of this chapter, you will have a deeper understanding of the role of volatiles in igneous processes, and their importance in the study of igneous petrology.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of volatiles in igneous processes, bridging the gap between basic knowledge and advanced concepts. It is designed to be accessible to both students and professionals in the field of geology and petrology.

### Subsection 3.8a Geology and petrogenesis of Bushveld, Stillwater, and Skaergaard intrusions

The Bushveld, Stillwater, and Skaergaard intrusions are three of the most well-known and studied layered igneous complexes in the world. These intrusions are not only significant for their size and complexity, but also for the insights they provide into the processes of magma formation and differentiation.

#### The Bushveld Igneous Complex

The Bushveld Igneous Complex, located in South Africa, is one of the largest layered intrusions in the world. It is divided into an eastern and western lobe, with a further northern extension. The complex was formed about 2 billion years ago, and is thought to predate the nearby Vredefort impact by some 30 million years.

The formation of the Bushveld Complex involved the injection of molten rock from Earth's mantle through long vertical cracks in the crust. This resulted in the formation of a structure rather like a layered cake, with distinct rock strata including three PGM-bearing layers, referred to as reefs. The extrusions were emplaced over an early diabasic sill, outcrops of which are visible on the southeastern side of the Complex.

The Bushveld Complex includes layered mafic intrusions (the Rustenburg Layered Suite) and a felsic phase. The complex has its geographic centre located north of Pretoria in South Africa at about 25° S and 29° E. It covers an area of over 6,000 km², making it one of the largest intrusions in the world.

#### The Stillwater Igneous Complex

The Stillwater Igneous Complex, located in Montana, USA, is another large layered intrusion. It is known for its high-grade PGM deposits, and is thought to have formed in a similar manner to the Bushveld Complex. The Stillwater Complex is also divided into an eastern and western lobe, with a further northern extension.

The Stillwater Complex is thought to have formed around the same time as the Bushveld Complex, about 2 billion years ago. Like the Bushveld Complex, it is also thought to predate the nearby Sudbury impact by some 30 million years.

#### The Skaergaard Intrusion

The Skaergaard Intrusion, located in Greenland, is a layered intrusion that is known for its well-defined layering and its role in the study of magma differentiation. The intrusion is divided into three main layers: a lower ultramafic layer, a middle mafic layer, and an upper felsic layer.

The Skaergaard Intrusion is thought to have formed around 1.8 billion years ago, and is one of the youngest of the three intrusions discussed in this section. It is also one of the smallest, covering an area of only about 10 km².

The petrogenesis of the Skaergaard Intrusion is still a topic of ongoing research, but it is thought to have formed through the differentiation of a single magma chamber. This differentiation is thought to have been driven by the separation of minerals due to changes in temperature and pressure.

In conclusion, the Bushveld, Stillwater, and Skaergaard intrusions are all significant for their size, complexity, and the insights they provide into the processes of magma formation and differentiation. The study of these intrusions continues to be a topic of ongoing research, and they remain some of the most important examples of layered igneous complexes in the world.




### Subsection 3.8b Petrologic and geochemical features of these large layered intrusions

The Bushveld, Stillwater, and Skaergaard intrusions are not only significant for their size and complexity, but also for their unique petrologic and geochemical features. These features provide valuable insights into the processes of magma formation and differentiation, and the evolution of the Earth's mantle.

#### Petrologic Features

The Bushveld, Stillwater, and Skaergaard intrusions are all composed of a variety of igneous rocks, including mafic and felsic rocks. The mafic rocks, such as diorite and gabbro, are found in the lower layers of these intrusions, while the felsic rocks, such as granite and rhyolite, are found in the upper layers. This layered structure is a result of the differentiation of magma as it cooled and solidified.

The Bushveld and Stillwater intrusions are also known for their high-grade PGM deposits, which are found in distinct layers within these intrusions. These layers, known as reefs, are thought to have formed as a result of the separation of different minerals within the cooling and solidifying magma.

#### Geochemical Features

The Bushveld, Stillwater, and Skaergaard intrusions also exhibit unique geochemical features. For example, the Bushveld Complex is known for its high iron content, with some layers containing up to 40% iron. This is thought to be a result of the mixing of different magmas during the formation of the intrusion.

The Stillwater intrusion, on the other hand, is known for its high platinum group metal (PGM) content. These metals, which include platinum, palladium, and rhodium, are found in distinct layers within the intrusion. The formation of these layers is still not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to the separation of different minerals within the cooling and solidifying magma.

#### The Skaergaard Intrusion

The Skaergaard intrusion, located in Greenland, is another large layered intrusion that is known for its unique petrologic and geochemical features. The intrusion is composed of a series of layered rocks, including gabbro, diorite, and plagiogranite. These layers are thought to have formed as a result of the differentiation of magma as it cooled and solidified.

The Skaergaard intrusion is also known for its high-grade PGM deposits, which are found in distinct layers within the intrusion. These layers, known as reefs, are thought to have formed as a result of the separation of different minerals within the cooling and solidifying magma.

The Skaergaard intrusion also exhibits unique geochemical features. For example, the intrusion is known for its high iron content, with some layers containing up to 40% iron. This is thought to be a result of the mixing of different magmas during the formation of the intrusion.

In conclusion, the Bushveld, Stillwater, and Skaergaard intrusions are not only significant for their size and complexity, but also for their unique petrologic and geochemical features. These features provide valuable insights into the processes of magma formation and differentiation, and the evolution of the Earth's mantle.

### Introduction

The study of igneous petrology is a fascinating and complex field that delves into the formation and evolution of igneous rocks. This chapter, "The Role of Igneous Petrology in Geochemical Cycles," aims to explore the intricate relationship between igneous petrology and geochemical cycles. 

Igneous petrology is the study of the origin, composition, and evolution of igneous rocks. It is a field that is deeply intertwined with geochemical cycles, which are the processes by which elements are transferred between the Earth's surface and the interior. These cycles are fundamental to the functioning of our planet, influencing everything from the climate to the health of ecosystems.

In this chapter, we will delve into the role of igneous petrology in these geochemical cycles. We will explore how the formation and evolution of igneous rocks can impact these cycles, and how, in turn, these cycles can influence the formation and evolution of igneous rocks. 

We will also discuss the importance of understanding these relationships in a variety of fields, from environmental science to mineral exploration. By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of the role of igneous petrology in geochemical cycles, and how this knowledge can be applied in a variety of contexts.

This chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of the topic, starting with a brief introduction to igneous petrology and geochemical cycles. We will then delve into the specifics of how these two fields interact, exploring topics such as the role of igneous rocks in the carbon cycle, the impact of igneous activity on the water cycle, and the role of igneous petrology in mineral exploration.

Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field, this chapter will provide you with a solid foundation in the role of igneous petrology in geochemical cycles. So, let's embark on this journey of discovery together.




### Subsection 3.9a Occurrence and petrogenesis of anorthosites

Anorthosites are a unique type of igneous rock that are of great interest to geologists due to their composition and formation. They are characterized by their high plagioclase feldspar content, with a minimal mafic component. This composition is not common in most igneous rocks, and it is still not fully understood how anorthosites form.

#### Occurrence of Anorthosites

Anorthosites can be found on Earth in five distinct types, with the first two being the most common. These two types have different modes of occurrence and appear to be restricted to different periods in Earth's history. They are thought to have had different origins.

The first type of anorthosite is found in the Proterozoic Eon, which spans from approximately 2,500 to 542 million years ago. These anorthosites were emplaced during this time period, with most being emplaced between 1,800 and 1,000 million years ago. They typically occur as extensive stocks or batholiths, with the areal extent of anorthosite batholiths ranging from relatively small (dozens or hundreds of square kilometers) to nearly 1,000,000 square kilometers, as seen in the Nain Plutonic Suite or Mistastin crater in northern Labrador, Canada.

The second type of anorthosite is found in the Appalachian Mountains, specifically in the Honeybrook Upland of eastern Pennsylvania. These anorthosites are thought to be younger than those found in the Proterozoic Eon, but their exact age is still being researched.

#### Petrogenesis of Anorthosites

The formation of anorthosites is still a topic of ongoing research. One of the most widely accepted theories is that anorthosites form through the separation of plagioclase crystals based on their density. As plagioclase crystallizes in a magma chamber, the plagioclase crystals float to the top, concentrating there. This process is known as fractional crystallization.

However, this theory does not fully explain the formation of all types of anorthosites. For example, the anorthosites found in the Proterozoic Eon are thought to have formed through a different process, possibly involving the mixing of different magmas.

In addition to fractional crystallization, other processes such as magma mixing and differentiation may also play a role in the formation of anorthosites. Further research is needed to fully understand the petrogenesis of these unique igneous rocks.

### Conclusion

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of metamorphic rocks. Metamorphic rocks are a result of the transformation of pre-existing rocks under extreme conditions of temperature, pressure, and chemical reactions. These rocks are found in a variety of geological settings, from the deepest parts of the Earth's mantle to the highest mountain ranges. Understanding the formation and characteristics of metamorphic rocks is crucial for comprehending the evolution of the Earth's crust and the processes that shape it.

We will begin by exploring the basic concepts of metamorphism, including the factors that drive metamorphic reactions and the different types of metamorphic processes. We will then delve into the various types of metamorphic rocks, discussing their unique properties and how they are formed. This will include a detailed examination of the different types of metamorphic textures and structures, such as foliation and lineation, and how they can be used to identify metamorphic rocks.

Next, we will discuss the role of metamorphic rocks in the Earth's history. We will explore how metamorphic rocks can provide insights into the conditions of the Earth's early atmosphere and oceans, as well as the processes that have shaped the Earth's continents over billions of years. We will also discuss the importance of metamorphic rocks in mineral exploration, as many valuable minerals are found in metamorphic rocks.

Finally, we will touch upon the current research and advancements in the field of metamorphic petrology. This will include a discussion of cutting-edge techniques for studying metamorphic rocks, such as high-pressure experiments and advanced microscopy methods. We will also touch upon the ongoing debates and controversies in the field, such as the role of water in metamorphism and the origins of high-grade metamorphic rocks.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of metamorphic rocks and their significance in the Earth's history. You will also have the tools to identify and interpret metamorphic rocks in the field, and to appreciate the beauty and complexity of these fascinating rocks.




### Subsection 3.9b Petrologic and geochemical characteristics of anorthosites

Anorthosites are characterized by their high plagioclase feldspar content, with a minimal mafic component. This composition is not common in most igneous rocks, and it is still not fully understood how anorthosites form. In this section, we will explore the petrologic and geochemical characteristics of anorthosites, including their chemical and isotopic characteristics.

#### Chemical and Isotopic Characteristics of Anorthosites

Proterozoic anorthosites are typically >90% plagioclase, and the plagioclase composition is commonly between An<sub>40</sub> and An<sub>60</sub> (40–60% anorthite). This compositional range is intermediate, and is one of the characteristics which distinguish Proterozoic anorthosites from Archean anorthosites (which are typically >An<sub>80</sub>).

Proterozoic anorthosites often have significant mafic components in addition to plagioclase. These phases can include olivine, pyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides, and/or apatite. Mafic minerals in Proterozoic anorthosites have a wide range of composition, but are not generally highly magnesian.

The trace-element chemistry of Proterozoic anorthosites, and the associated rock types, has been examined in some detail by researchers with the aim of arriving at a plausible genetic theory. However, there is still little agreement on just what the results mean for anorthosite genesis; see the 'Origins' section below. A very short list of results, including results for rocks thought to be related to Proterozoic anorthosites,<Clarify|date=September 2013>

Some research has focused on neodymium (Nd) and strontium (Sr) isotopic determinations for anorthosites, particularly for anorthosites of the Nain Plutonic Suite (NPS). Such isotopic determinations are of use in gauging the viability of prospective sources for magmas that gave rise to anorthosites. Some results are detailed below in the 'Origins' section.

#### High-alumina orthopyroxene megacrysts (HAOMs)

Many Proterozoic-age anorthosites contain large crystals of orthopyroxene with distinctive compositions. These are the so-called high-alumina orthopyroxene megacrysts (HAOM).

HAOM are distinctive because 1) they contain higher amounts of Al than typically seen in orthopyroxenes; 2) they are cut by numerous thin lathes of plagioclase, which may represent exsolution lamellae; and 3) they appear to be older than the anorthosites in which they occur. The presence of HAOM in anorthosites is a key factor in understanding the formation of these rocks.

In the next section, we will explore the origins of anorthosites, including the role of HAOM and the ongoing research in this field.

### Section: 3.10 Lunar Highland and Maria:

The Moon's surface is divided into two main regions: the highlands and the maria. The highlands, also known as terrae, are the lighter-colored regions that cover about 60% of the Moon's surface. They are dominated by mafic plutonic rocks and regolith breccias with similar protoliths. The maria, on the other hand, are the darker regions that cover about 30% of the Moon's surface. They are primarily composed of mare basalts, which are named as such because they frequently constitute large portions of the lunar maria.

#### 3.10a Geology and igneous activity in lunar highland and maria regions

The geology of the Moon's highlands and maria regions is complex and fascinating. The highlands, for instance, are composed of three distinct groups of primary igneous rocks: the ferroan anorthosite suite, the magnesian suite, and the alkali suite. These rocks are named based on their chemical composition and are important indicators of the Moon's early history.

The ferroan anorthosite suite, for example, is characterized by its high iron content and is thought to have formed early in the Moon's history. The magnesian suite, on the other hand, is rich in magnesium and is believed to have formed later. The alkali suite, as the name suggests, is rich in alkali elements and is thought to have formed even later.

The maria, on the other hand, are primarily composed of mare basalts. These rocks are similar to terrestrial basalts, but have many important differences. For instance, mare basalts contain 18–21 percent FeO by weight, and 1–13 percent TiO<sub>2</sub>. They are also similar to terrestrial basalts in their isotopic composition of the element oxygen.

The Moon rocks collected during the Apollo missions provide valuable insights into the geology and igneous activity of the Moon's highlands and maria regions. These rocks were collected using a variety of tools, including hammers, rakes, scoops, tongs, and core tubes. They were photographed prior to collection to record the condition in which they were found. They were then placed inside sample bags and a "Special Environmental Sample Container" for return to the Earth to protect them from contamination.

In contrast to the Earth, large portions of the lunar crust appear to be composed of rocks with high concentrations of the mineral anorthite. The mare basalts, on the other hand, have relatively high iron values. Furthermore, some of the mare basalts have very high levels of titanium (in the form of ilmenite).

The geology and igneous activity of the Moon's highlands and maria regions are still not fully understood. However, ongoing research and the analysis of Moon rocks continue to provide valuable insights into the Moon's early history and the processes that shaped its surface.

#### 3.10b Petrologic and geochemical characteristics of lunar highland and maria rocks

The petrologic and geochemical characteristics of lunar highland and maria rocks are crucial to understanding the Moon's early history and the processes that shaped its surface. The Moon's rocks are depleted in volatiles and are completely lacking in hydrated minerals common in Earth rocks. This is a significant difference that has important implications for the Moon's formation and evolution.

The Apollo Moon rocks, collected during the Apollo missions, provide valuable insights into the petrologic and geochemical characteristics of lunar highland and maria rocks. These rocks were collected using a variety of tools, including hammers, rakes, scoops, tongs, and core tubes. They were photographed prior to collection to record the condition in which they were found. They were then placed inside sample bags and a "Special Environmental Sample Container" for return to the Earth to protect them from contamination.

The highlands rocks, primarily composed of the ferroan anorthosite suite, the magnesian suite, and the alkali suite, are characterized by their high iron content and their isotopic composition of the element oxygen. The mare basalts, on the other hand, are characterized by their high iron and titanium content. They contain 18–21 percent FeO by weight, and 1–13 percent TiO<sub>2</sub>.

The petrologic and geochemical characteristics of lunar highland and maria rocks are still not fully understood. However, ongoing research and the analysis of Moon rocks continue to provide valuable insights into the Moon's early history and the processes that shaped its surface.

#### 3.10c Implications of lunar highland and maria geology for understanding early Earth

The geology of the Moon's highlands and maria regions provides valuable insights into the early history of the Earth. The Moon, being one of the oldest objects in the solar system, has preserved a record of the early processes that shaped the Earth. The Moon's rocks, particularly the highlands rocks, are similar to the rocks found on Earth, suggesting that the Earth and the Moon formed from the same material.

The Moon's highlands, composed of the ferroan anorthosite suite, the magnesian suite, and the alkali suite, are particularly important for understanding the early Earth. These rocks are characterized by their high iron content and their isotopic composition of the element oxygen. This is similar to the composition of the Earth's early mantle, suggesting that the Earth and the Moon formed from the same material.

The Moon's maria, on the other hand, provide insights into the later stages of the Earth's evolution. The mare basalts, which constitute the majority of the maria, are characterized by their high iron and titanium content. These rocks are similar to terrestrial basalts, but have many important differences. For instance, mare basalts contain 18–21 percent FeO by weight, and 1–13 percent TiO<sub>2</sub>. These differences suggest that the Earth's mantle evolved over time, with the early mantle being more similar to the Moon's highlands rocks and the later mantle being more similar to the Moon's maria rocks.

The geology of the Moon's highlands and maria regions also provides insights into the early atmosphere of the Earth. The Moon's rocks are depleted in volatiles and are completely lacking in hydrated minerals common in Earth rocks. This suggests that the early Earth had a thin atmosphere and was not as hydrated as it is today.

In conclusion, the geology of the Moon's highlands and maria regions provides valuable insights into the early history of the Earth. The Moon's rocks, particularly the highlands rocks, are similar to the rocks found on Earth, suggesting that the Earth and the Moon formed from the same material. The Moon's maria, on the other hand, provide insights into the later stages of the Earth's evolution. The geology of the Moon's highlands and maria regions also provides insights into the early atmosphere of the Earth. Ongoing research and the analysis of Moon rocks continue to provide valuable insights into the Moon's early history and the processes that shaped the Earth.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the significance of igneous rock series, focusing on the Moon's highlands and maria regions. We have explored the geological and igneous activity that has shaped these regions, and how these processes have influenced the composition and characteristics of the rocks found there. 

The Moon's highlands, dominated by anorthosite, provide a unique insight into the early stages of the Moon's formation. The anorthosite, a plagioclase feldspar, is indicative of the Moon's early magmatic activity. The highlands also exhibit a variety of other igneous rocks, including basalt and gabbro, which provide further insights into the Moon's early history.

The maria regions, on the other hand, are characterized by their basaltic composition. These regions are thought to have formed later than the highlands, and their basaltic composition is indicative of the Moon's later magmatic activity. The maria also exhibit a variety of other igneous rocks, including anorthosite and gabbro, which provide further insights into the Moon's later history.

In conclusion, the study of igneous rock series on the Moon provides a wealth of information about the Moon's early history and evolution. By studying the composition and characteristics of these rocks, we can gain a better understanding of the processes that have shaped the Moon over billions of years.

### Section: 3.10b Petrologic and geochemical features of lunar igneous rocks

The petrologic and geochemical features of lunar igneous rocks provide valuable insights into the Moon's early history and the processes that shaped its surface. The rocks collected during the Apollo missions, in particular, have been instrumental in deciphering the geologic evolution of the Moon.

#### 3.10b.1 Mineral Composition

The lunar rocks are primarily composed of the same common rock-forming minerals found on Earth, such as olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase feldspar. Plagioclase feldspar is most commonly found in the lunar crust, while pyroxene and olivine are typically seen in the lunar mantle. The mineral ilmenite is highly abundant in some mare basalts, and a new mineral named armalcolite was first discovered in the lunar samples.

#### 3.10b.2 Composition of the Maria

The maria, or darker regions of the Moon, are primarily composed of basalt. These rocks contain higher abundances of olivine and pyroxene, and less plagioclase, compared to the rocks of the lunar highlands. They are also richer in iron than terrestrial basalts, and have lower viscosities. Some of the basaltic rocks found in the maria have been classified as low-K Fra Mauro composition, which have a higher proportion of iron and magnesium than typical upper crust anorthositic rocks, as well as higher abundances of KREEP.

#### 3.10b.3 Composition of the Highlands

The highlands, or lighter-colored regions of the Moon, are composed of three distinct groups of primary igneous rocks: the ferroan anorthosite suite, the magnesian suite, and the alkali suite. These rocks are named based on their chemical composition and are important indicators of the Moon's early history. The ferroan anorthosite suite, for example, is characterized by its high iron content and is thought to have formed early in the Moon's history. The magnesian suite, on the other hand, is rich in magnesium and is believed to have formed later. The alkali suite, as the name suggests, is rich in alkali elements and is thought to have formed even later.

#### 3.10b.4 Composite Rocks

Composite rocks on the lunar surface often appear in the form of breccias. These breccias are categorized into three subcategories: fragmental, granulitic, and impact-melt breccias, depending on how they were formed. The mafic impact melt breccias, which are typified by the "low-K Fra Mauro" composition, have a higher proportion of iron and magnesium than typical upper crust anorthositic rocks, as well as higher abundances of KREEP.

In conclusion, the petrologic and geochemical features of lunar igneous rocks provide valuable insights into the Moon's early history and the processes that shaped its surface. The rocks collected during the Apollo missions, in particular, have been instrumental in deciphering the geologic evolution of the Moon.

### Section: 3.11 Howardites, Eucrites, and Diogenites:

#### 3.11a Classification and petrogenesis of Howardites, Eucrites, and Diogenites

Howardites, Eucrites, and Diogenites are a group of igneous rocks found on the Moon. They are classified based on their mineral composition and are named after their type localities on the Moon. These rocks provide valuable insights into the Moon's early history and the processes that shaped its surface.

#### 3.11a.1 Classification of Howardites, Eucrites, and Diogenites

Howardites, Eucrites, and Diogenites are all classified as basaltic achondrites, meaning they are differentiated, iron-rich, and lack chondrules. They are distinguished from each other based on their mineral composition. Howardites are primarily composed of olivine and pyroxene, with some plagioclase feldspar. Eucrites, on the other hand, are richer in plagioclase feldspar and have less olivine and pyroxene. Diogenites are the most iron-rich of the three and have the highest proportion of olivine and pyroxene.

#### 3.11a.2 Petrogenesis of Howardites, Eucrites, and Diogenites

The petrogenesis of Howardites, Eucrites, and Diogenites is still a topic of ongoing research. However, it is believed that these rocks formed from the melting of the Moon's mantle. The high temperatures and pressures of the Moon's early history are thought to have caused the mantle to melt, forming a magma ocean. As the Moon cooled, this magma ocean solidified, forming the Moon's early crust. The differentiation of Howardites, Eucrites, and Diogenites is thought to have occurred as the magma ocean cooled, with the more iron-rich Diogenites forming first, followed by the more silica-rich Eucrites and Howardites.

#### 3.11a.3 Significance of Howardites, Eucrites, and Diogenites

The discovery of Howardites, Eucrites, and Diogenites has greatly advanced our understanding of the Moon's early history. These rocks provide valuable insights into the processes that shaped the Moon's surface and the composition of its early crust. They also serve as important reference materials for studying other basaltic achondrites found in meteorites and on other planetary bodies.

#### 3.11a.4 Further Reading

For more information on Howardites, Eucrites, and Diogenites, we recommend the following publications:

- "The Petrology of the Moon" by David Kring and Daniel Durda
- "The Geology of the Moon" by William McBirney
- "The Moon: A Handbook" by Thomas McCord and David Durda

These publications provide a comprehensive overview of the Moon's geology and the role of Howardites, Eucrites, and Diogenites in our understanding of its early history.

#### 3.11b Geochemical and mineralogical features of Howardites, Eucrites, and Diogenites

The geochemical and mineralogical features of Howardites, Eucrites, and Diogenites provide valuable insights into the early history of the Moon. These rocks are primarily composed of olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase feldspar, with varying proportions of these minerals depending on the type of rock.

#### 3.11b.1 Geochemical Features

The geochemical features of Howardites, Eucrites, and Diogenites are largely similar, with some notable differences. All three types of rocks have high iron and magnesium contents, reflecting their origin from the Moon's iron-rich mantle. However, Diogenites have the highest iron content, followed by Eucrites and then Howardites. This trend is also reflected in their silicon content, with Diogenites having the lowest silicon content and Howardites having the highest.

The geochemical features of these rocks also provide insights into the processes that shaped the Moon's early crust. For example, the high iron content of Diogenites suggests that they formed early in the Moon's history, when the mantle was still hot and iron-rich.

## Chapter 4: The Role of Igneous Processes in Ore Deposit Formation

### Introduction

The formation of ore deposits is a complex process that involves a series of geological events. Among these events, igneous processes play a crucial role. This chapter, "The Role of Igneous Processes in Ore Deposit Formation," delves into the intricate relationship between igneous processes and ore deposit formation.

Igneous processes are fundamental to the formation of ore deposits. They are responsible for the creation of the host rocks in which these deposits are found. The melting of the Earth's mantle and crust, the movement of magma, and the cooling and solidification of these melts are all part of the igneous processes that contribute to ore deposit formation.

The chapter will explore how these processes influence the composition and distribution of ore deposits. It will also discuss the role of igneous processes in the formation of different types of ore deposits, including hydrothermal, magmatic, and sedimentary deposits.

In addition, the chapter will delve into the impact of igneous processes on the quality and quantity of ore deposits. It will examine how the composition of the magma, the conditions of its crystallization, and the interaction with other geological processes can affect the formation of ore deposits.

Finally, the chapter will discuss the implications of these findings for the exploration and exploitation of ore deposits. It will highlight the importance of understanding igneous processes in the search for new ore deposits and the optimization of ore extraction processes.

## Chapter: - Chapter 4: Igneous Petrology Techniques:

### Introduction

Welcome to Chapter 4 of the "Advanced Igneous Petrology Textbook". In this chapter, we will delve into the various techniques used in the study of igneous petrology. These techniques are essential for understanding the formation, evolution, and characteristics of igneous rocks. 

Igneous petrology is a branch of petrology that deals with the study of igneous rocks. These rocks are formed from the solidification of molten rock, or magma, and are a crucial component of the Earth's crust. The study of igneous petrology is crucial for understanding the processes that shape our planet, from the formation of mountains to the creation of new landforms.

In this chapter, we will explore the various techniques used in igneous petrology, including microscopic analysis, chemical analysis, and geophysical methods. These techniques allow us to study the composition, structure, and properties of igneous rocks in detail. We will also discuss how these techniques are used in conjunction with each other to provide a comprehensive understanding of igneous rocks.

Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field of geology, this chapter will provide you with a solid foundation in the techniques used in igneous petrology. So, let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of igneous petrology techniques.




### Section: 4.1 Microscopy:

Microscopy is a fundamental technique in the study of igneous petrology. It allows us to observe the microstructure of igneous rocks, which provides valuable information about their formation and evolution. In this section, we will focus on optical microscopy, which is the most commonly used microscopy technique in igneous petrology.

#### 4.1a Optical microscopy in igneous petrology

Optical microscopy is a technique that uses visible light to observe the microstructure of a sample. In igneous petrology, it is used to study the mineral composition and texture of igneous rocks. The technique involves passing light through a thin section of the rock, which is then observed through a microscope. The light is scattered by the minerals in the rock, and the resulting pattern can be used to identify the minerals present.

One of the key advantages of optical microscopy is its ability to provide high-resolution images of the microstructure of igneous rocks. This allows us to study the size, shape, and arrangement of minerals, as well as their color and transparency. This information can be used to determine the mineral composition of the rock, which is crucial for understanding its formation and evolution.

Optical microscopy is also a non-destructive technique, meaning that the sample is not damaged during the observation process. This allows us to study the same sample multiple times, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the rock.

However, optical microscopy also has its limitations. It is a qualitative technique, meaning that it can only provide a general idea of the mineral composition of the rock. For a more precise determination of mineral composition, other techniques such as X-ray diffraction or electron microprobe are required.

Despite its limitations, optical microscopy remains an essential tool in the study of igneous petrology. It allows us to observe the microstructure of igneous rocks, providing valuable insights into their formation and evolution. In the next section, we will explore another important technique in igneous petrology - chemical analysis.





### Subsection: 4.1b Electron microscopy in igneous petrology

Electron microscopy is another powerful technique used in the study of igneous petrology. Unlike optical microscopy, which uses visible light, electron microscopy uses a beam of electrons to observe the microstructure of a sample. This allows for much higher resolution imaging, with the ability to observe features as small as a few nanometers.

There are two main types of electron microscopy used in igneous petrology: scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). SEM is used to observe the surface of a sample, while TEM is used to observe the internal structure of a sample.

#### 4.1b.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)

SEM is a powerful tool for studying the surface of igneous rocks. It uses a focused beam of electrons to scan the surface of a sample, and the resulting signal is used to create an image. This allows for the observation of surface features such as mineral grains, textures, and inclusions.

One of the key advantages of SEM is its ability to provide high-resolution images of the surface of a sample. This allows for the identification of mineral grains and the observation of their size, shape, and arrangement. SEM can also be used to determine the chemical composition of a sample through techniques such as energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).

#### 4.1b.2 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)

TEM is a technique used to observe the internal structure of a sample. It uses a beam of electrons to pass through a thin section of a sample, and the resulting image is used to study the internal features of the sample.

One of the key advantages of TEM is its ability to provide high-resolution images of the internal structure of a sample. This allows for the observation of features such as mineral grains, textures, and inclusions that are not visible with other techniques. TEM can also be used to determine the crystal structure of minerals through techniques such as electron diffraction.

### Conclusion

Electron microscopy is a powerful tool in the study of igneous petrology. It allows for the observation of the surface and internal structure of igneous rocks, providing valuable information about their formation and evolution. Combined with other techniques such as optical microscopy, it provides a comprehensive understanding of igneous rocks and their properties.





### Subsection: 4.2a X-ray fluorescence (XRF) in igneous petrology

X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is a powerful analytical technique used in the study of igneous petrology. It is a non-destructive method that allows for the determination of the chemical composition of a sample, including elements such as iron, magnesium, calcium, and aluminum.

#### 4.2a.1 Principles of XRF

XRF is based on the principle of fluorescence, where the excitation of atoms in a sample by high-energy electrons or X-rays causes the emission of lower energy X-rays. These X-rays are characteristic of the elements present in the sample and can be used to identify and quantify them.

The XRF instrument consists of a source of high-energy X-rays, a sample chamber, and a detector. The sample is placed in the sample chamber, and a beam of high-energy X-rays is directed at it. The X-rays from the sample are then detected by the detector, and their intensity is measured.

#### 4.2a.2 Applications of XRF in Igneous Petrology

XRF has a wide range of applications in the study of igneous petrology. It is commonly used for the analysis of whole-rock samples, as well as for the analysis of individual mineral grains.

One of the key applications of XRF in igneous petrology is the determination of the chemical composition of igneous rocks. This allows for the identification of the source of the rock, as well as the processes that have affected it. For example, the analysis of the chemical composition of a basalt can provide information about the composition of the mantle from which it originated, as well as any processes such as fractional melting or metamorphism that have occurred.

XRF is also used for the analysis of mineral grains in igneous rocks. This allows for the identification of the minerals present, as well as their chemical composition. This is particularly useful in the study of plagioclase feldspar, which is a common mineral in igneous rocks. The analysis of plagioclase feldspar can provide information about the crystallization processes that have occurred, as well as the composition of the melt from which it crystallized.

#### 4.2a.3 Advantages and Limitations of XRF

One of the key advantages of XRF is its non-destructive nature. This allows for the analysis of valuable samples without the need for destruction. XRF is also a relatively quick and efficient technique, making it suitable for the analysis of large numbers of samples.

However, XRF also has some limitations. It is not as sensitive as other techniques such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). This means that it may not be suitable for the analysis of very small samples or for the detection of trace elements.

In conclusion, XRF is a powerful technique in the study of igneous petrology. Its ability to provide information about the chemical composition of igneous rocks and minerals makes it an essential tool for understanding the processes that have shaped the Earth's crust. 





### Subsection: 4.2b Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in igneous petrology

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a powerful analytical technique used in the study of igneous petrology. It is a non-destructive method that allows for the determination of the chemical composition of a sample, including elements such as iron, magnesium, calcium, and aluminum.

#### 4.2b.1 Principles of ICP-MS

ICP-MS is based on the principle of mass spectrometry, where the sample is ionized and then separated based on the mass-to-charge ratio of the ions. In ICP-MS, the sample is first introduced into an inductively coupled plasma (ICP), which is a high-temperature, high-pressure gas discharge. The sample is then ionized by the plasma, and the ions are transported into a mass spectrometer.

The mass spectrometer consists of a series of electrodes and a detector. The ions are accelerated by an electric field and then separated based on their mass-to-charge ratio by a series of electrodes. The ions are then detected by the detector, and their intensity is measured.

#### 4.2b.2 Applications of ICP-MS in Igneous Petrology

ICP-MS has a wide range of applications in the study of igneous petrology. It is commonly used for the analysis of whole-rock samples, as well as for the analysis of individual mineral grains.

One of the key applications of ICP-MS in igneous petrology is the determination of the chemical composition of igneous rocks. This allows for the identification of the source of the rock, as well as the processes that have affected it. For example, the analysis of the chemical composition of a basalt can provide information about the composition of the mantle from which it originated, as well as any processes such as fractional melting or metamorphism that have occurred.

ICP-MS is also used for the analysis of mineral grains in igneous rocks. This allows for the identification of the minerals present, as well as their chemical composition. This is particularly useful in the study of plagioclase feldspar, which is a common mineral in igneous rocks. The analysis of plagioclase feldspar can provide information about the composition of the melt from which it crystallized, as well as any processes that have affected it.

High-pressure and high-temperature experiments in igneous petrology are essential for studying the behavior of magmas under extreme conditions. These experiments allow us to simulate the conditions found in the Earth's mantle and core, providing insights into the processes that govern the formation of igneous rocks.

One of the most commonly used techniques for high-pressure and high-temperature experiments is the Bridgman anvil, which was first developed by Percy Bridgman in the early 20th century. The Bridgman anvil uses a combination of pressure and temperature to simulate the conditions found in the Earth's mantle and core. The sample is placed between two anvils, which are then brought together to apply pressure. The anvils are heated to a high temperature, causing the sample to melt and form a droplet. The pressure and temperature are then increased, causing the droplet to solidify and form a high-pressure and high-temperature sample.

Another important technique for high-pressure and high-temperature experiments is the laser-heated diamond anvil cell (LHDAC). This technique uses a diamond anvil to apply high pressure to a sample, while a laser is used to heat the sample to a high temperature. The LHDAC allows for precise control of pressure and temperature, making it a valuable tool for studying the behavior of magmas under extreme conditions.

High-pressure and high-temperature experiments in igneous petrology have provided valuable insights into the formation of igneous rocks. For example, these experiments have shown that the melting behavior of magmas is strongly influenced by pressure and temperature, with higher pressures and temperatures leading to more extensive melting. These experiments have also revealed the presence of volatiles, such as water and carbon dioxide, in magmas, which can significantly affect their behavior.

In addition to studying the behavior of magmas, high-pressure and high-temperature experiments have also been used to investigate the properties of minerals under extreme conditions. For instance, these experiments have shown that the stability of minerals can change dramatically under high pressure and temperature, leading to the formation of new minerals. This has important implications for our understanding of the Earth's interior, as it allows us to identify the presence of certain minerals and their behavior under different conditions.

Overall, high-pressure and high-temperature experiments in igneous petrology have been crucial for advancing our understanding of the formation and evolution of igneous rocks. These experiments have provided valuable insights into the behavior of magmas and minerals under extreme conditions, helping us to better understand the processes that govern the Earth's interior. As technology continues to advance, we can expect these experiments to play an even more significant role in our understanding of igneous petrology.

Additionally, we will discuss the different types of volcanic structures, such as volcanoes, calderas, and lava domes, and how they are formed.

### Subsection 5.1a: Basaltic Volcanism

Basalt is a common type of volcanic rock that is formed from the cooling and solidification of basaltic magma. This magma is typically dark in color and has a high iron and magnesium content. Basaltic volcanism is responsible for the formation of many of the Earth's volcanoes, including those found in the Hawaiian Islands and the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest.

The formation of basaltic magma begins deep within the Earth's mantle, where temperatures and pressures are high enough to melt the surrounding rock. As the magma rises towards the surface, it undergoes changes in temperature and pressure, which can affect its composition and texture. This is why basaltic magma can vary in its mineral composition and texture, even when it is formed from the same source.

One of the key factors that influence the formation of basaltic magma is the presence of volatiles, such as water, carbon dioxide, and sulfur. These volatiles can significantly lower the melting point of the surrounding rock, allowing for the formation of basaltic magma. The amount and type of volatiles present can also affect the composition of the magma, leading to variations in the resulting basaltic rock.

Basaltic magma can also undergo changes in composition as it moves through the Earth's crust. This is known as differentiation, and it can result in the formation of different types of basaltic rocks. For example, as basaltic magma moves through the crust, it can interact with surrounding rocks and pick up minerals, leading to the formation of more evolved basaltic rocks, such as andesite and dacite.

In addition to its role in the formation of volcanic rocks, basaltic volcanism also plays a crucial role in the Earth's evolution. The cooling and solidification of basaltic magma can release large amounts of carbon dioxide and other volatiles, which can have a significant impact on the Earth's atmosphere and climate. Basaltic volcanism also plays a role in the formation of the Earth's continents, as it can contribute to the formation of new landmasses through the process of plate tectonics.

In conclusion, basaltic volcanism is a complex and dynamic process that plays a crucial role in the formation of volcanic rocks and the Earth's evolution. By studying the composition and behavior of basaltic magma, we can gain valuable insights into the processes that occur deep within the Earth's mantle and crust.

### Subsection 5.1b: Andesitic Volcanism

Andesite is another common type of volcanic rock that is formed from the cooling and solidification of andesitic magma. This magma is typically intermediate in composition, with a lower iron and magnesium content compared to basalt, but a higher iron and magnesium content compared to rhyolite. Andesitic volcanism is responsible for the formation of many of the Earth's volcanoes, including those found in the Andes Mountains in South America.

The formation of andesitic magma is similar to that of basaltic magma, beginning deep within the Earth's mantle and undergoing changes in temperature and pressure as it rises towards the surface. However, andesitic magma is more likely to undergo differentiation as it moves through the crust, leading to the formation of more evolved andesitic rocks, such as dacite and rhyolite.

The composition of andesitic magma can also be influenced by the presence of volatiles, but to a lesser extent compared to basaltic magma. This is because andesitic magma already has a lower iron and magnesium content, making it less susceptible to changes in composition due to volatiles.

In addition to its role in the formation of volcanic rocks, andesitic volcanism also plays a crucial role in the Earth's evolution. The formation of andesitic rocks can provide valuable insights into the timing and composition of past volcanic events, allowing us to better understand the history of our planet.

### Subsection 5.1c: Rhyolitic Volcanism

Rhyolite is a type of volcanic rock that is formed from the cooling and solidification of rhyolitic magma. This magma is typically light in color and has a high silica content, making it more viscous compared to basalt and andesite. Rhyolitic volcanism is responsible for the formation of many of the Earth's volcanoes, including those found in the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest.

The formation of rhyolitic magma is similar to that of andesitic magma, beginning deep within the Earth's mantle and undergoing changes in temperature and pressure as it rises towards the surface.

### Subsection 5.1d: Volcanic Structures

Volcanic structures are the physical features that result from volcanic activity. These structures can vary in size and shape, and can be found on land or under the ocean. Some common types of volcanic structures include volcanoes, calderas, and lava domes.

Volcanoes are the most well-known type of volcanic structure. They are conical in shape and are formed when magma is expelled from a vent in the Earth's crust. As the magma cools and solidifies, it forms a layer of solid rock, known as lava, on the surface. Over time, repeated eruptions can build up the lava layer, creating a volcano.

Calderas are large, circular depressions on the Earth's surface that are formed when a volcano collapses. This can occur when the magma chamber beneath the volcano is depleted, causing the volcano to sink and form a caldera. Calderas can also be formed by explosive volcanic activity, where the force of the eruption blows the top of the volcano off, leaving behind a caldera.

Lava domes are small, circular structures that are formed when viscous lava is extruded from a volcanic vent. As the lava cools and solidifies, it forms a dome-like structure on the surface. Lava domes can also be formed when lava is injected into the Earth's crust, creating a plug that eventually cools and solidifies.

In conclusion, volcanic rocks and structures play a crucial role in understanding the processes that occur deep within the Earth's mantle and crust. By studying the composition and behavior of these rocks and structures, we can gain valuable insights into the history of our planet and the forces that shape it.

### Subsection: 5.1a Partial melting in the mantle

Partial melting is a fundamental process in the formation of igneous rocks. It occurs when the temperature and pressure conditions in the mantle cause the melting of only a portion of the mantle material. This process is crucial in the formation of different types of igneous rocks, as it allows for the mixing of different mantle materials and the release of volatile elements.

#### 5.1a.1 Mechanisms of Partial Melting

There are several mechanisms by which partial melting can occur in the mantle. These include adiabatic heating, conduction, and convection. Adiabatic heating occurs when a mass of mantle material rises due to buoyancy, and as it rises, it cools adiabatically, leading to the melting of a portion of the material. Conduction and convection, on the other hand, occur due to the transfer of heat from the core-mantle boundary to the mantle. Conduction is the transfer of heat through direct contact, while convection involves the movement of mantle material due to differences in temperature and density.

#### 5.1a.2 Factors Influencing Partial Melting

The amount and composition of the melt produced during partial melting are influenced by several factors. These include the composition of the mantle material, the temperature and pressure conditions, and the presence of volatiles. The composition of the mantle material plays a crucial role in determining the amount of melt produced. For instance, the presence of olivine in the mantle can lead to the production of a large amount of melt, while the presence of pyroxene can result in a smaller amount of melt.

The temperature and pressure conditions in the mantle also play a significant role in partial melting. As the temperature and pressure increase, the melting point of the mantle material decreases, leading to the production of more melt. The presence of volatiles, such as water, can also lower the melting point of the mantle material, promoting partial melting.

#### 5.1a.3 Implications of Partial Melting

Partial melting has significant implications for the formation of igneous rocks. It allows for the mixing of different mantle materials, leading to the production of heterogeneous melts. This mixing can result in the formation of different types of igneous rocks, each with its own unique composition and characteristics. Partial melting also plays a crucial role in the release of volatile elements, which can have a significant impact on the Earth's atmosphere and climate.

In conclusion, partial melting is a complex process that plays a crucial role in the formation of igneous rocks. It is influenced by various factors and has significant implications for the Earth's crust and mantle. In the next section, we will explore the different types of igneous rocks and their characteristics, as well as the methods used to study them.

### Subsection: 5.1b Mantle plumes and hotspots

Mantle plumes and hotspots are two important concepts in the study of igneous petrology. They are responsible for the formation of many of the world's volcanoes and oceanic islands, and understanding their behavior is crucial for understanding the dynamics of the Earth's mantle.

#### 5.1b.1 Mantle Plumes

Mantle plumes are columns of hot, buoyant material that rise from the core-mantle boundary to the surface. They are typically associated with hotspots, but not all hotspots are necessarily associated with mantle plumes. The concept of mantle plumes was first proposed by Xavier Le Pichon in the 1970s, who suggested that the Hawaiian Islands were formed by a hotspot that had been active for millions of years.

The behavior of mantle plumes is still not fully understood, and there are several competing theories about their formation and behavior. One theory suggests that mantle plumes are formed by the melting of a thin layer of low-density material at the base of the mantle, which then rises due to buoyancy. Another theory suggests that mantle plumes are formed by the melting of a thick layer of high-density material at the base of the mantle, which then rises due to adiabatic heating as it cools and expands.

#### 5.1b.2 Hotspots

Hotspots are regions of the Earth's surface where volcanic activity is significantly higher than the surrounding areas. They are typically associated with mantle plumes, but not all hotspots are necessarily associated with mantle plumes. The Hawaiian Islands, the Yellowstone Caldera, and the Iceland hotspot are all examples of hotspots.

The behavior of hotspots is also not fully understood. Some hotspots, such as the Hawaiian Islands, have been active for millions of years, while others, such as the Yellowstone Caldera, have been active for only a few hundred thousand years. The reason for this variability is still not fully understood.

#### 5.1b.3 Chemistry, Heat Flow, and Melting

The chemistry and heat flow of mantle plumes and hotspots are crucial for understanding their behavior. The chemical and isotopic composition of basalts found at hotspots differs subtly from mid-ocean ridge basalts. These basalts, also called ocean island basalts (OIBs), are analyzed in their radiogenic and stable isotope compositions. In radiogenic isotope systems, the originally subducted material creates diverging trends, termed mantle components. Identified mantle components are DMM (depleted mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) mantle), HIMU (high U/Pb-ratio mantle), EM1 (enriched mantle 1), EM2 (enriched mantle 2) and FOZO (focus zone). This geochemical signature arises from the mixing of near-surface materials such as subducted slabs and continental sediments, in the mantle source.

Stable isotopes like Fe are used to trace the origin of these mantle components. For example, the presence of high FeO content in OIBs is indicative of a deep mantle origin, while low FeO content is indicative of a shallow mantle origin. The heat flow at hotspots is also important, as it can provide insights into the behavior of mantle plumes. The heat flow at hotspots is typically higher than at other regions of the Earth's surface, reflecting the presence of mantle plumes.

In conclusion, mantle plumes and hotspots are two important concepts in the study of igneous petrology. Their behavior and the chemistry and heat flow associated with them are still not fully understood, but ongoing research is shedding light on these complex phenomena.

## Chapter: Chapter 6: The Role of Volatiles in Igneous Petrology

### Introduction

The study of igneous petrology is a fascinating journey into the heart of the Earth, exploring the processes that shape our planet's crust and mantle. In this chapter, we delve deeper into the role of volatiles in igneous petrology, a critical aspect that has been largely overlooked in traditional petrology textbooks. 

Volatiles, substances with low boiling points, play a pivotal role in the formation and evolution of igneous rocks. They are the key to understanding the complex interplay between the Earth's mantle and crust, and their influence extends to the formation of ore deposits and the evolution of life. 

This chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of the role of volatiles in igneous petrology, exploring their sources, behavior, and impact on the formation of different types of igneous rocks. We will also delve into the latest research and advancements in this field, shedding light on the intricate processes that govern the Earth's interior.

From the formation of basaltic magmas to the genesis of granitic rocks, the role of volatiles is a central theme in igneous petrology. This chapter aims to equip readers with a solid understanding of these processes, providing the necessary tools to interpret the complex chemical and mineralogical signatures of igneous rocks.

As we navigate through this chapter, we will also touch upon the environmental implications of volatiles in igneous petrology. The release of volatiles during volcanic eruptions, for instance, can have profound effects on the atmosphere and climate. Understanding these processes is not only crucial for petrologists but also for environmental scientists and policymakers.

In essence, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive and accessible introduction to the role of volatiles in igneous petrology. It is our hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and anyone interested in the fascinating world of igneous petrology.




### Subsection: 5.2a Fractional crystallization

Fractional crystallization is a fundamental process in the differentiation of magmas. It is a process by which different minerals crystallize from a melt at different temperatures, leading to the formation of different types of igneous rocks. This process is crucial in understanding the evolution of magmas and the formation of different types of volcanic rocks.

#### 5.2a.1 Basic Principles of Fractional Crystallization

Fractional crystallization is based on the principle that different minerals have different melting points. As a magma cools, minerals with higher melting points will crystallize first, leaving behind a residual melt with a different chemical composition. This residual melt can then continue to cool and crystallize, leading to the formation of different types of igneous rocks.

The efficiency of fractional crystallization is determined by the crystallization behavior of the minerals present in the magma. Minerals with high crystallization efficiencies, such as olivine and pyroxene, will crystallize early and remove a large amount of melt from the system. In contrast, minerals with low crystallization efficiencies, such as plagioclase feldspar, will crystallize later and remove a smaller amount of melt.

#### 5.2a.2 Types of Fractional Crystallization

There are two main types of fractional crystallization: batch and continuous. In batch fractional crystallization, the magma is cooled and crystallized in a single batch, with the crystals being removed from the system. This type of fractional crystallization is common in intrusive igneous processes, where the magma is trapped in a chamber and cools slowly.

In continuous fractional crystallization, the magma is continuously cooled and crystallized, with the crystals being removed from the system as the magma continues to cool. This type of fractional crystallization is common in extrusive igneous processes, where the magma is erupted at the surface and cools rapidly.

#### 5.2a.3 Factors Affecting Fractional Crystallization

The efficiency of fractional crystallization is influenced by several factors, including the composition of the magma, the temperature and pressure conditions, and the crystallization behavior of the minerals present. Magmas with higher silica contents tend to have lower crystallization efficiencies, as the minerals with higher melting points, such as olivine and pyroxene, are more likely to crystallize early and remove a large amount of melt from the system.

Temperature and pressure conditions also play a crucial role in fractional crystallization. Higher temperatures and pressures can delay the crystallization of minerals, allowing for more efficient fractional crystallization to occur. Conversely, lower temperatures and pressures can lead to earlier crystallization of minerals, reducing the efficiency of fractional crystallization.

The crystallization behavior of the minerals present in the magma is also a significant factor in fractional crystallization. Minerals with high crystallization efficiencies, such as olivine and pyroxene, will crystallize early and remove a large amount of melt from the system. In contrast, minerals with low crystallization efficiencies, such as plagioclase feldspar, will crystallize later and remove a smaller amount of melt.

#### 5.2a.4 Applications of Fractional Crystallization

Fractional crystallization has many applications in the study of igneous petrology. It is used to understand the evolution of magmas and the formation of different types of volcanic rocks. By studying the mineral assemblages and chemical compositions of different types of igneous rocks, geologists can reconstruct the processes by which they were formed, including the role of fractional crystallization.

Fractional crystallization is also used in the extraction of valuable minerals from magmatic systems. By controlling the conditions of temperature and pressure, as well as the composition of the magma, it is possible to optimize the crystallization of specific minerals, allowing for their efficient extraction.

In conclusion, fractional crystallization is a crucial process in the differentiation of magmas and the formation of different types of igneous rocks. By understanding the basic principles and factors influencing this process, geologists can gain valuable insights into the evolution of magmas and the formation of volcanic rocks. 





### Subsection: 5.2b Magma mixing

Magma mixing is a crucial process in the differentiation of magmas. It occurs when two or more magmas meet, comele, and form a magma of a composition somewhere between the two end-member magmas. This process is common in volcanic magma chambers, which are open-system chambers where magmas enter the chamber, undergo some form of assimilation, fractional crystallisation and partial melt extraction (via eruption of lava), and are replenished.

#### 5.2b.1 Mechanisms of Magma Mixing

There are two main mechanisms of magma mixing: conduit mixing and chamber mixing. Conduit mixing occurs when magmas are mixed as they move through a conduit towards the surface. This can happen due to the mixing of different magmas entering the conduit from different sources, or due to the mixing of a single magma as it moves through the conduit.

Chamber mixing, on the other hand, occurs within the magma chamber itself. This can happen due to the mixing of different magmas entering the chamber from different sources, or due to the mixing of a single magma as it moves through the chamber. Chamber mixing can also occur due to the movement of magmas within the chamber, such as during the Kīlauea Iki eruption where two different magma sources provided material to the surface.

#### 5.2b.2 Implications of Magma Mixing

Magma mixing has significant implications for the composition and evolution of magmas. By mixing, magmas can exchange heat and mass, leading to changes in their chemical and mineralogical composition. This can result in the formation of new minerals, the alteration of existing minerals, and the creation of new types of igneous rocks.

In the case of the Kīlauea Iki eruption, magma mixing led to the formation of a new type of magma with a high ratio of CaO to MgO. This magma was a mixture of the two different magma sources, and its composition was somewhere between the two end-member magmas. The subsequent eruption episodes at the single vent on the west side of the caldera contained a mixture of the two magmas, plus some additional amount of olivine. This suggests that the magma chamber was not homogeneous, and that different magma sources were contributing to the eruption.

#### 5.2b.3 Magma Mixing and Igneous Petrogenesis

Magma mixing plays a crucial role in the petrogenesis of igneous rocks. By mixing, magmas can exchange heat and mass, leading to changes in their chemical and mineralogical composition. This can result in the formation of new minerals, the alteration of existing minerals, and the creation of new types of igneous rocks. Understanding the mechanisms and implications of magma mixing is therefore essential for understanding the petrogenesis of igneous rocks.




### Subsection: 5.3a Magma ascent mechanisms

The ascent of magma is a complex process that involves a series of physical and chemical interactions. The mechanisms of magma ascent are crucial to understanding the formation of igneous rocks and the evolution of magmas. In this section, we will explore the two main mechanisms of magma ascent: Stokes diapirism and fracture propagation.

#### 5.3a.1 Stokes Diapirism

Stokes diapirism is a mechanism of magma ascent that involves the buoyancy of the magma. The magma, being less dense than the surrounding rocks, rises through the crust as a single mass. As it rises, it heats the wall rocks, causing them to behave as a power-law fluid and thus flow around the intrusion allowing it to pass without major heat loss. This mechanism is feasible in the warm, ductile lower crust where rocks are easily deformed, but runs into problems in the upper crust which is far colder and more brittle. Rocks there do not deform so easily: for magma to rise as a diapir it would expend far too much energy in heating wall rocks, thus cooling and solidifying before reaching higher levels within the crust.

#### 5.3a.2 Fracture Propagation

Fracture propagation is another mechanism of magma ascent that involves the propagation of fractures along which the magma can move. These fractures form along self-propagating dykes which form along new or pre-existing fracture or fault systems and networks of active shear zones. As these narrow conduits open, the first magma to enter solidifies and provides a form of insulation for later magma. This mechanism is particularly effective in the upper crust, where the rocks are colder and more brittle.

These mechanisms can operate in tandem. For example, diapirs may continue to rise through the brittle upper crust through stoping, where the granite cracks the roof rocks, removing blocks of the overlying crust which then sink to the bottom of the diapir while the magma rises through the fractures.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of these magma ascent mechanisms for the formation of igneous rocks and the evolution of magmas.

### Subsection: 5.3b Emplacement mechanisms

The emplacement of magma is a critical step in the formation of igneous rocks. It involves the process by which magma is injected into the crust and forms intrusive igneous bodies. The mechanisms of magma emplacement are diverse and complex, and they are influenced by a variety of factors, including the composition of the magma, the properties of the surrounding rocks, and the tectonic setting.

#### 5.3b.1 Sill Emplacement

Sill emplacement is a common mechanism of magma emplacement. A sill is a tabular igneous body that is bounded by horizontal surfaces and is typically emplaced in the lower part of the crust. The emplacement of sills is often associated with the extrusion of lava flows. The magma that forms sills is typically basaltic in composition and is injected into the crust along fractures or faults. The emplacement of sills can occur through a variety of mechanisms, including diapiric rise, fracture propagation, and stoping.

#### 5.3b.2 Batholith Emplacement

Batholith emplacement is another important mechanism of magma emplacement. A batholith is a large, intrusive igneous body that is typically composed of granitic rocks. The emplacement of batholiths is often associated with the formation of mountain ranges and other orogenic features. The magma that forms batholiths is typically more evolved than the magma that forms sills, and it is often injected into the crust through a series of intrusive events.

#### 5.3b.3 Pluton Emplacement

Pluton emplacement is a mechanism of magma emplacement that involves the intrusion of magma into the crust through a series of intrusive events. A pluton is an igneous body that is bounded by vertical surfaces and is typically composed of granitic rocks. The emplacement of plutons is often associated with the formation of mountain ranges and other orogenic features. The magma that forms plutons is typically more evolved than the magma that forms batholiths, and it is often injected into the crust through a series of intrusive events.

#### 5.3b.4 Volcanic Emplacement

Volcanic emplacement is a mechanism of magma emplacement that involves the extrusion of magma onto the surface of the Earth. This can occur through a variety of processes, including lava domes, lava flows, and pyroclastic flows. The composition of the magma that is extruded can vary widely, from basaltic to rhyolitic, and the emplacement of volcanic rocks can occur through a variety of mechanisms, including diapiric rise, fracture propagation, and stoping.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of these emplacement mechanisms for the formation of igneous rocks and the evolution of magmas.

## Chapter: Chapter 6: Igneous Textures and Microstructures

### Introduction

The study of igneous petrology is a fascinating journey into the heart of the Earth, exploring the processes that shape our planet's crust and mantle. In this chapter, we delve into the intricate world of igneous textures and microstructures, a critical aspect of understanding the formation and evolution of igneous rocks.

Igneous textures and microstructures are the physical manifestations of the processes that occur during the formation and cooling of magma. They provide a window into the conditions under which the magma was formed, the processes it underwent during its journey to the surface, and the interactions it had with the surrounding rocks. 

The study of these textures and microstructures is not just about understanding the past, but also about predicting the future. By understanding the processes that create these textures and microstructures, we can better predict how future volcanic eruptions might occur, how they might affect the environment, and how we might mitigate their impact.

In this chapter, we will explore the various types of igneous textures and microstructures, their formation processes, and their significance in the broader context of igneous petrology. We will also discuss the methods and techniques used to study these textures and microstructures, and how they contribute to our understanding of igneous rocks.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of igneous textures and microstructures, equipping readers with the knowledge and tools to explore this fascinating field further. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or simply a curious reader, we hope that this chapter will ignite your interest in the world of igneous petrology.




### Subsection: 5.3b Magma emplacement processes

The emplacement of magma is a critical step in the formation of igneous rocks. It involves the process of magma moving from its source to the surface, where it is eventually erupted. The emplacement of magma is influenced by a variety of factors, including the composition of the magma, the structure of the crust, and the presence of fluids.

#### 5.3b.1 Magma Chamber Formation

Magma chambers are the primary sites of magma emplacement. These chambers can be located at various depths beneath the surface, and their size and shape can vary significantly. The formation of a magma chamber involves the accumulation of magma at a specific location. This can occur through the ascent of magma from the mantle, the mixing of different magmas, or the accumulation of magma from hydrothermal systems.

The composition of the magma can also play a significant role in the formation of a magma chamber. For instance, the presence of volatile elements such as water, carbon dioxide, and sulfur can lower the melting point of the magma, promoting its accumulation in a chamber. Additionally, the composition of the magma can influence its viscosity, which can affect its ability to flow and fill a chamber.

#### 5.3b.2 Magma Emplacement Mechanisms

The emplacement of magma can occur through various mechanisms, including diapiric intrusion, sill formation, and dyke propagation. Diapiric intrusion, as discussed in the previous section, involves the buoyancy of the magma as it rises through the crust. Sill formation, on the other hand, involves the horizontal movement of magma beneath the crust, forming a sheet-like intrusion. Dyke propagation involves the vertical movement of magma along fractures or faults, forming narrow, elongated intrusions.

The choice of emplacement mechanism can be influenced by the composition of the magma, the structure of the crust, and the presence of fluids. For instance, diapiric intrusion is more likely to occur in warm, ductile lower crust, while sill formation is more likely to occur in cooler, more brittle upper crust. Dyke propagation, on the other hand, can occur in both the lower and upper crust, and is often influenced by the presence of pre-existing fractures or faults.

#### 5.3b.3 Magma-Hydrothermal Interactions

Interactions between magma and hydrothermal systems can also play a significant role in magma emplacement. Hydrothermal systems, which involve the circulation of hot fluids through the crust, can interact with magma in various ways. For instance, hydrothermal fluids can introduce volatile elements into the magma, lowering its melting point and promoting its accumulation in a chamber. Additionally, hydrothermal fluids can alter the composition of the magma, leading to the formation of new minerals and the precipitation of others.

In some cases, hydrothermal systems can even drive the emplacement of magma. For instance, the circulation of hydrothermal fluids can create pressure gradients that drive the movement of magma. This can occur in systems where the magma is not buoyant enough to rise on its own, but where the circulation of hydrothermal fluids creates a pressure gradient that drives the magma upward.

In conclusion, the emplacement of magma is a complex process that is influenced by a variety of factors. Understanding these processes is crucial for understanding the formation of igneous rocks and the evolution of magmas.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the fascinating world of igneous petrogenesis, exploring the processes that lead to the formation of igneous rocks. We have learned that igneous rocks are formed through the crystallization of molten rock, or magma, which is derived from the mantle, crust, or other sources. The composition and characteristics of the resulting igneous rock depend on a variety of factors, including the source of the magma, the conditions under which it crystallizes, and the presence of other elements or compounds.

We have also examined the different types of igneous rocks, including plutonic and volcanic rocks, and how they are formed. Plutonic rocks, which are formed deep within the Earth's crust, are typically coarse-grained and have undergone significant crystallization. Volcanic rocks, on the other hand, are formed at the surface of the Earth and are often fine-grained and glassy.

Finally, we have discussed the role of igneous petrology in understanding the evolution of the Earth's crust and mantle. By studying the composition and characteristics of igneous rocks, we can gain insights into the processes that have shaped our planet over billions of years.

## Chapter: Chapter 6: Igneous Textures and Mineral Assemblages

### Introduction

The study of igneous petrology is a fascinating journey into the heart of the Earth, exploring the processes that shape our planet's crust and mantle. In this chapter, we delve into the intricate world of igneous textures and mineral assemblages, two fundamental aspects of igneous petrology.

Igneous textures refer to the arrangement of minerals within an igneous rock. They provide valuable insights into the conditions under which the rock was formed, including temperature, pressure, and the rate of cooling. Understanding these textures can help us decipher the history of the rock, from its origin as molten magma to its solidification and cooling.

Mineral assemblages, on the other hand, are the collection of minerals found in an igneous rock. Each mineral has its own unique properties and characteristics, which can reveal important information about the rock's composition and formation. By studying these assemblages, we can gain a deeper understanding of the processes that led to the formation of the rock.

In this chapter, we will explore the various types of igneous textures and mineral assemblages, and how they are formed. We will also discuss the techniques and tools used to study these aspects of igneous petrology, including microscopy and spectroscopy. By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid foundation in these topics, equipping you with the knowledge and skills to further explore the fascinating world of igneous petrology.




### Subsection: 5.4a Eruption styles and products

Volcanism is a complex process that involves the eruption of magma from the mantle to the surface. The style of an eruption, or the way in which magma is expelled from a volcano, is determined by the composition of the magma, the structure of the volcanic system, and the presence of fluids. The products of an eruption, or the materials that are expelled during an eruption, can provide valuable insights into the processes that occur during volcanism.

#### 5.4a.1 Eruption Styles

Eruptions can be classified into two main styles: explosive and effusive. Explosive eruptions are characterized by the violent expulsion of magma, often accompanied by the formation of volcanic bombs and ash clouds. These eruptions are typically associated with high-viscosity magmas, which are resistant to flow and tend to fragment under the high pressures and temperatures of the volcanic conduit.

Effusive eruptions, on the other hand, involve the smooth and continuous extrusion of magma. These eruptions are typically associated with low-viscosity magmas, which are more fluid and tend to flow rather than fragment under the lower pressures and temperatures of the volcanic conduit. Effusive eruptions can produce a variety of products, including lava flows, spatter cones, and pahoehoe.

#### 5.4a.2 Products of Eruptions

The products of an eruption can provide valuable insights into the processes that occur during volcanism. These products can include lava flows, spatter cones, pahoehoe, and ash clouds.

Lava flows are the most common product of volcanic eruptions. They are formed when magma is extruded from a volcanic conduit and flows down the volcanic edifice. The composition of the lava flow can provide insights into the composition of the magma and the processes that occur during volcanism.

Spatter cones are another common product of volcanic eruptions. They are formed when magma is ejected from a volcanic conduit and forms a cone of solidified magma. The composition and structure of the spatter cone can provide insights into the composition of the magma and the processes that occur during volcanism.

Pahoehoe is a type of lava flow that is characterized by its smooth, ropy surface. It is formed when low-viscosity magmas are extruded from a volcanic conduit and flow down the volcanic edifice. The composition and structure of the pahoehoe can provide insights into the composition of the magma and the processes that occur during volcanism.

Ash clouds are a common product of explosive eruptions. They are formed when magma is violently expelled from a volcanic conduit and breaks up into small fragments. These fragments can range in size from fine ash to large volcanic bombs. The composition and structure of the ash cloud can provide insights into the composition of the magma and the processes that occur during volcanism.

In conclusion, the study of eruption styles and products is a crucial aspect of volcanology. It allows us to understand the processes that occur during volcanism and provides valuable insights into the composition of magmas and the structure of volcanic systems.




### Subsection: 5.4b Volcano monitoring and hazard assessment

Volcano monitoring and hazard assessment are crucial aspects of volcanology. They involve the use of various techniques to monitor volcanic activity and assess the potential hazards associated with volcanic eruptions. This section will discuss the techniques used in volcano monitoring and hazard assessment.

#### 5.4b.1 Techniques for Volcano Monitoring

Volcano monitoring involves the use of various techniques to monitor volcanic activity. These techniques can be broadly categorized into two types: remote sensing techniques and direct monitoring techniques.

Remote sensing techniques involve the use of instruments that can detect and measure volcanic activity from a distance. These techniques include seismic monitoring, satellite imaging, and gas monitoring.

Seismic monitoring involves the use of seismometers to detect and record seismic activity.

### Subsection: 6.1a Mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs)

Mid-ocean ridges are underwater mountain ranges that form the backbone of the oceanic crust. They are sites of intense volcanic activity and are responsible for the creation of new oceanic crust. The volcanism at mid-ocean ridges is primarily driven by the process of seafloor spreading, where new crust is created at the ridge axis and moves away from the axis as the older crust is subducted into the mantle.

The volcanic rocks formed at mid-ocean ridges are known as mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs). These rocks are primarily composed of plagioclase feldspar, pyroxene, and olivine, and are typically dark in color due to their high iron and magnesium content. The composition of MORBs is largely controlled by the melting of the upper mantle, which is enriched in iron and magnesium compared to the Earth's crust.

#### 6.1a.1 Composition of MORBs

The composition of MORBs is largely controlled by the melting of the upper mantle. The mantle is composed of peridotite, a rock rich in iron and magnesium. As the mantle rises towards the surface at mid-ocean ridges, it undergoes decompression melting, which results in the formation of basaltic magma. This magma then cools and solidifies to form MORBs.

The composition of MORBs can vary depending on the location and the specific processes occurring at the mid-ocean ridge. However, in general, MORBs are low in silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) and are classified as tholeiitic basalts. This means that they are enriched in iron and magnesium, and have a high affinity for iron.

#### 6.1a.2 Formation of MORBs

The formation of MORBs is a complex process that involves the interaction of various factors. These include the composition of the mantle, the pressure and temperature conditions at the mid-ocean ridge, and the presence of other minerals or rocks.

The mantle is the primary source of the magma that forms MORBs. The mantle is composed of peridotite, a rock rich in iron and magnesium. As the mantle rises towards the surface at mid-ocean ridges, it undergoes decompression melting, which results in the formation of basaltic magma.

The pressure and temperature conditions at the mid-ocean ridge also play a crucial role in the formation of MORBs. As the mantle rises towards the surface, it experiences a decrease in pressure and an increase in temperature. This change in conditions can affect the melting behavior of the mantle and can result in the formation of different types of MORBs.

The presence of other minerals or rocks can also influence the formation of MORBs. For example, the presence of ultramafic rocks, such as dunite, can result in the formation of more iron-rich MORBs. Similarly, the presence of mafic-to-felsic series rocks can result in the formation of more silica-rich MORBs.

#### 6.1a.3 Significance of MORBs

MORBs play a crucial role in the study of igneous petrology. They provide valuable insights into the processes occurring at mid-ocean ridges and the composition of the mantle. By studying the composition and formation of MORBs, scientists can gain a better understanding of the dynamics of the Earth's mantle and the processes that drive plate tectonics.

Furthermore, MORBs are also important in the study of the Earth's early history. The presence of certain elements, such as iron and magnesium, in MORBs can provide clues about the composition of the Earth's early mantle. This information can be used to reconstruct the conditions that existed on Earth billions of years ago.

In conclusion, MORBs are a crucial component of the oceanic crust and play a significant role in the study of igneous petrology. Their composition and formation are influenced by a variety of factors, and their study can provide valuable insights into the processes occurring at mid-ocean ridges and the early history of the Earth. 





### Subsection: 6.1b Ocean island basalts (OIBs)

Ocean island basalts (OIBs) are a type of igneous rock found on oceanic islands. They are formed by the melting of the mantle, similar to MORBs, but the processes involved in their formation are distinct. OIBs are known for their diverse compositions and their role in understanding the Earth's mantle dynamics.

#### 6.1b.1 Composition of OIBs

The composition of OIBs is highly variable, making them a rich source of information about the Earth's mantle. Unlike MORBs, which are primarily tholeiitic basalts, OIBs can be either tholeiitic or alkali basalts. Tholeiitic OIBs are enriched in iron and magnesium, similar to MORBs, but alkali OIBs are enriched in sodium and potassium.

The composition of OIBs is also influenced by the presence of mantle plumes, which are columns of hot, buoyant mantle material that rise from the core-mantle boundary. These plumes can introduce additional chemical components into the mantle, leading to the formation of OIBs with unique compositions.

#### 6.1b.2 Formation of OIBs

The formation of OIBs is a complex process that involves the interaction of various factors, including mantle plumes, subduction, and the presence of hotspots.

Mantle plumes play a crucial role in the formation of OIBs. These plumes can introduce additional chemical components into the mantle, leading to the formation of OIBs with unique compositions. The presence of mantle plumes can also influence the melting behavior of the mantle, leading to the formation of different types of OIBs.

Subduction also plays a role in the formation of OIBs. The subduction of oceanic crust can introduce water and other volatile elements into the mantle, which can influence the composition of OIBs. Additionally, the subduction of oceanic crust can also lead to the formation of mantle wedges, which can enhance the melting of the mantle and contribute to the formation of OIBs.

Hotspots, such as the Hawaiian hotspot, also play a role in the formation of OIBs. These hotspots can cause the mantle to rise and melt, leading to the formation of OIBs. The composition of OIBs formed by hotspots can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the Earth's mantle.

#### 6.1b.3 Geochemistry of OIBs

The geochemistry of OIBs is highly variable, reflecting the diverse processes involved in their formation. OIBs are enriched in trace elements, such as strontium, neodymium, hafnium, lead, and osmium, which can provide insights into the composition of the mantle.

The stable isotope ratios of OIBs also provide valuable information about the mantle. For example, the <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratio can be used to trace the origin of the mantle material, while the <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O ratio can provide insights into the water content of the mantle.

The composition of OIBs can also be used to identify the presence of mantle plumes. For example, the presence of HUIMU, EM1, and EM2 reservoirs can be inferred from the composition of OIBs, providing insights into the dynamics of the Earth's mantle.

In conclusion, the study of OIBs is crucial for understanding the Earth's mantle dynamics. Their diverse compositions and geochemical signatures make them a valuable tool for studying the mantle and its processes.




### Subsection: 6.2a Granitoids

Granitoids are a group of coarse-grained, light-colored igneous rocks that are commonly found in the continents. They are formed by the crystallization of magma at high temperatures and pressures, and they are characterized by their high silica content and their granular texture. Granitoids play a crucial role in the formation of continental crust and are a key component of many igneous rock associations.

#### 6.2a.1 Composition of Granitoids

The composition of granitoids is highly variable, but they are generally characterized by their high silica content. This is due to the fact that granitoids are formed from the crystallization of magma at high temperatures and pressures, which allows for the formation of silicate minerals. The most common minerals found in granitoids include quartz, plagioclase feldspar, and potassium feldspar.

The composition of granitoids can also be influenced by the presence of mantle plumes, which can introduce additional chemical components into the mantle. This can lead to the formation of granitoids with unique compositions, similar to OIBs.

#### 6.2a.2 Formation of Granitoids

The formation of granitoids is a complex process that involves the interaction of various factors, including mantle plumes, subduction, and the presence of hotspots.

Mantle plumes play a crucial role in the formation of granitoids. These plumes can introduce additional chemical components into the mantle, leading to the formation of granitoids with unique compositions. The presence of mantle plumes can also influence the melting behavior of the mantle, leading to the formation of different types of granitoids.

Subduction also plays a role in the formation of granitoids. The subduction of oceanic crust can introduce water and other volatile elements into the mantle, which can influence the composition of granitoids. Additionally, the subduction of oceanic crust can also lead to the formation of mantle wedges, which can enhance the melting of the mantle and contribute to the formation of granitoids.

Hotspots, such as the Hawaiian hotspot, also play a role in the formation of granitoids. The presence of hotspots can lead to the formation of plumes, which can introduce additional chemical components into the mantle and contribute to the formation of granitoids with unique compositions.

### Subsection: 6.4a Lunar basalts

Lunar basalts are a type of igneous rock found on the Moon, specifically in the lunar maria or "seas". These rocks are formed by the solidification of basaltic magma, which is a type of mafic (high in iron and magnesium) igneous rock. The composition of lunar basalts is highly variable, but they are generally classified as tholeiitic, with some exceptions such as the KREEP basalts.

#### 6.4a.1 Composition of Lunar Basalts

The composition of lunar basalts is highly variable, but they are generally classified as tholeiitic. This means that they have a high silica content (>52 wt.%) and are relatively low in iron and magnesium. However, there are exceptions to this classification, such as the KREEP basalts, which are abnormally rich in potassium (K), rare-earth elements (REE), and phosphorus (P).

One of the most striking differences between lunar basalts and terrestrial basalts is the near-total absence of water in any form in the lunar basalts. This is due to the lack of hydrogen-bearing minerals like the amphiboles and phyllosilicates that are common in terrestrial basalts.

#### 6.4a.2 Formation of Lunar Basalts

The formation of lunar basalts is a complex process that is still not fully understood. However, it is believed that they are formed by the solidification of basaltic magma, which is generated by the melting of the Moon's mantle. The Moon's mantle is believed to be composed of a mixture of olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase feldspar, which are the primary minerals found in lunar basalts.

The Moon's mantle is believed to be composed of a mixture of olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase feldspar, which are the primary minerals found in lunar basalts. The melting of the mantle is believed to be caused by the Moon's internal heat, which is generated by the decay of radioactive elements and residual heat from its formation.

The melting of the mantle is believed to be caused by the Moon's internal heat, which is generated by the decay of radioactive elements and residual heat from its formation.

#### 6.4a.3 Types of Lunar Basalts

There are three main types of lunar basalts: high-Ti basalts, low-Ti basalts, and very-low-Ti (VLT) basalts. These basalts are classified based on their major element chemistry, specifically their titanium (Ti) content. High-Ti basalts have the highest TiO<sub>2</sub> abundances, reaching up to 15 wt.%, while low-Ti basalts have lower TiO<sub>2</sub> abundances, typically less than 4 wt.%. Very-low-Ti (VLT) basalts have the lowest TiO<sub>2</sub> abundances, typically less than 1 wt.%.

The high-Ti basalts were once thought to be distinct from the low-Ti and VLT basalts, but recent remote sensing data from the Clementine mission has shown that there is a continuum of titanium concentrations between these end members. This has led to the reclassification of some high-Ti basalts as low-Ti basalts.

#### 6.4a.4 KREEP Basalts

The KREEP basalts are a special group of lunar basalts that are abnormally rich in potassium (K), rare-earth elements (REE), and phosphorus (P). These basalts are believed to have formed from the melting of a deep mantle reservoir, known as the KREEP layer, which is composed of potassium-rich pyroxene. The KREEP layer is believed to have formed early in the Moon's history, and its melting is believed to have contributed to the formation of the Moon's early crust.

#### 6.4b.3 Martian Basalt Associations

Martian basalts are found in various associations on the surface of Mars. These associations are formed by the interaction of different types of basalts and other igneous rocks. The most common associations are the Columbia Hills, which are composed of a variety of rocks, some of which have been altered by water, but not by very much water. The dust in Gusev Crater is the same as dust all around the planet and is magnetic. The spectra of the dust was similar to spectra of bright, low thermal inertia regions like Tharsis and Arabia that have been detected by orbiting satellites. A thin layer of dust, maybe less than one millimeter thick covers all surfaces. Something in it contains a small amount of chemically bound water.
