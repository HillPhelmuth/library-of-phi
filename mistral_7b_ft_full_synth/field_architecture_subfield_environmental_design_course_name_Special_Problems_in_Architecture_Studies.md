## The effects of digitization on consumer choice

### Search, search engines and recommendation systems

Perhaps the oldest and largest stream of research on the Internet and market frictions emphasizes reduced search costs. This literature builds on an older theory literature in economics that examines how search costs affect prices. Digitization of retail and marketing meant that consumers could easily compare prices across stores, so the empirical work on Internet pricing examined the impact on prices and price dispersion. Initially hypothesized by Bakos (1997), the first wave of this research empirically documented lower prices, but still substantial dispersion.

The newest wave of this research collects data about online searches to examine the actual search process that consumers undertake when looking for a product online. This question also emphasizes that the final stage of purchase is often controlled by a more familiar retail environment, and it raises questions about the growing importance of standards and platforms in the distribution of creative content.

As noted earlier, near-zero marginal costs of distribution for information goods might change where and how information goods get consumed. Geographic boundaries might be less important if information can travel long distances for free. One open question concerns the incidence of the impact of low distribution costs. The benefits might vary by location, and it is an open question whether these benefits will be captured by consumers or producers.

Multimodal interaction is a technique that involves the use of multiple modes of communication, such as visual, auditory, and tactile, to interact with a system. This technique can be particularly useful for creating engaging interfaces, as it allows for a more natural and immersive interaction with the system.

For example, a multimodal interface for a virtual reality game might use visual cues to represent the game world, auditory cues for sound effects and dialogue, and tactile cues for physical interactions with objects in the game world. This combination of modes can create a more immersive and engaging experience for the user.

#### 10.1b.2 Interface Metaphor

Interface metaphor is a technique that involves creating a concrete metaphor to represent the system or its functions. This metaphor is then used to guide the design of the interface, with the goal of making the interface resemble the user's real-world experiences as closely as possible.

For example, a file management system might use a metaphor of a physical file cabinet, with folders representing drawers and files representing documents. This metaphor can make the interface more intuitive and easier to understand for users who are familiar with physical file cabinets.

#### 10.1b.3 Continual Technological Improvement

Continual technological improvement is a key factor in creating engaging and intuitive interfaces. As technology advances, designers can create more realistic and immersive metaphors, and they can also incorporate new modes of interaction, such as virtual reality or augmented reality.

For example, as virtual reality technology has advanced, designers have been able to create more realistic and immersive virtual environments, which can enhance the engagement and enjoyment of users. Similarly, as augmented reality technology has advanced, designers have been able to create interfaces that overlay information onto the real world, which can make the interface more intuitive and easy to understand.

#### 10.1b.4 Empirical Evidence

While the concept behind interface metaphors appears simple, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support these claims. Little research has actually been completed that demonstrates the benefits of implementing metaphors in computer systems as well as what makes a metaphor most effective.

However, several studies have been conducted to investigate the benefits of implementing metaphors in computer systems. For example, a study by Kahney (2002) found that users who were familiar with the metaphor of a file cabinet were able to learn and use a file management system more quickly and easily than users who were not familiar with this metaphor.

In conclusion, creating engaging and intuitive interfaces requires a deep understanding of the user, their needs and preferences, and the context in which the system will be used. It also requires the use of advanced techniques, such as multimodal interaction, interface metaphor, and continual technological improvement. By incorporating these techniques into the design process, designers can create interfaces that are not only easy to use, but also enjoyable and meaningful to the user.

In addition to organization, it is important for speakers to be engaging and conversational. This can be achieved by using a limited number of notes and avoiding a read or memorized presentation. Instead, speakers should practice and rehearse as many times as needed to become familiar with the subject and deliver the content using their own words and a conversational style. This not only makes the delivery more engaging for the audience, but also allows for greater understanding of the topic.

Lastly, it is important for speakers to be confident and confident in their delivery. This can be achieved by practicing and rehearsing in front of an audience, whether it be a small group of peers or a larger audience. This will help speakers become more comfortable and confident in their delivery, leading to a more effective presentation.

In conclusion, effective public speaking is a crucial skill for architects to possess, especially in the context of advanced project presentations. By following these advanced techniques, speakers can effectively communicate their design ideas and engage their audience in a meaningful way.
