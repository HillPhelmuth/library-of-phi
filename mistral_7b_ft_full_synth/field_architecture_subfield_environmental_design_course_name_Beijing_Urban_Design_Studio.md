### Section: 3.2 Human Scale and Proportion:

Human scale and proportion are fundamental concepts in urban design that directly impact the quality of life for residents. In this section, we will explore the importance of human scale and proportion in urban design, and how it can be applied to create more livable and sustainable cities.

#### 3.2a Importance of Human Scale

Human scale refers to the size and proportion of urban elements in relation to the human body. It is a crucial aspect of urban design as it directly affects the experience of the city for its inhabitants. A city with a human scale is one where the built environment is designed to accommodate the needs and abilities of the human body. This includes factors such as the height and width of buildings, the size of public spaces, and the distance between different urban elements.

One of the key benefits of human scale in urban design is its impact on the pedestrian experience. When urban elements are designed at a human scale, it becomes easier for pedestrians to navigate and interact with the city. This is especially important in dense urban areas where walking is often the primary mode of transportation. Human scale also promotes a sense of familiarity and comfort for residents, as they are able to easily navigate and understand the city around them.

Moreover, human scale plays a crucial role in creating a sense of place and identity in a city. When urban elements are designed at a human scale, they are able to convey a sense of warmth and intimacy, making the city feel more like a community. This is in contrast to a city with a non-human scale, where the built environment may feel cold and impersonal. Human scale also allows for a more diverse and vibrant urban fabric, as it enables the coexistence of different scales and types of urban elements.

In addition to its impact on the pedestrian experience, human scale also has implications for sustainability. By designing urban elements at a human scale, we can reduce the need for automobiles and promote more sustainable modes of transportation such as walking and cycling. This not only reduces carbon emissions and improves air quality, but also creates a more livable and walkable city for its inhabitants.

#### 3.2b Proportion in Urban Design

Proportion refers to the relationship between different urban elements in terms of size and scale. It is an important aspect of urban design as it helps to create a harmonious and visually appealing city. Proportion is closely related to human scale, as it ensures that urban elements are designed in a way that is appropriate for the human body.

One of the key principles of proportion in urban design is the concept of the golden ratio. This is a mathematical ratio that is often used in design to create a sense of balance and harmony. The golden ratio is approximately 1.618 and is often used to determine the proportions of urban elements such as building height, public space size, and distance between different elements.

Another important aspect of proportion in urban design is the concept of hierarchy. This refers to the arrangement of different urban elements in terms of importance and scale. For example, in a city, the main streets and avenues may be designed at a larger scale than the side streets and alleys. This creates a sense of hierarchy and helps to guide the flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic.

#### 3.2c Case Studies of Human Scale and Proportion

To further illustrate the importance of human scale and proportion in urban design, let us examine some case studies. One example is the city of Copenhagen, Denmark, which is known for its human-scale design and pedestrian-friendly streets. The city has a strong emphasis on creating a livable and sustainable city, and this is reflected in its urban design. The streets are designed with a human scale, with wide sidewalks and narrow vehicle lanes, promoting walking and cycling as the primary modes of transportation. The city also has a diverse and vibrant urban fabric, with a mix of different scales and types of urban elements.

Another example is the city of Curitiba, Brazil, which is known for its innovative urban design and sustainable transportation system. The city has a strong focus on human scale and proportion, with wide sidewalks and bike lanes, and a well-defined hierarchy of streets. The city also has a strong emphasis on creating a sense of place and identity, with a mix of different architectural styles and public spaces.

In conclusion, human scale and proportion are crucial concepts in urban design that directly impact the quality of life for residents. By understanding and applying these concepts, we can create more livable and sustainable cities that are designed with the needs and abilities of the human body in mind.

By designing urban elements at a human scale, we can reduce the need for energy-intensive transportation methods and promote more sustainable modes of transportation such as walking and cycling. This not only reduces carbon emissions, but also creates a more livable and healthy environment for residents.

#### 3.2b Designing for Human Proportion

When designing for human proportion, it is important to consider the human body as a reference point. The average human height is approximately 1.7 meters, and this can be used as a guide for determining the appropriate scale for urban elements. For example, buildings should be designed to be no taller than 1.7 meters for every 1.7 meters of human height. This ensures that the built environment is in proportion to the human body and creates a sense of balance and harmony.

In addition to height, it is also important to consider the width and depth of urban elements. The width of buildings should be no wider than the distance between a person's shoulders, and the depth of public spaces should be no deeper than the distance between a person's elbow and fingertips. This creates a sense of intimacy and allows for easy interaction between individuals.

Furthermore, the distance between different urban elements should also be considered. The distance between buildings, for example, should be no greater than the distance between a person's outstretched arms. This creates a sense of enclosure and promotes a sense of community.

By designing for human proportion, we can create a more livable and sustainable city that is tailored to the needs and abilities of its inhabitants. It is important for urban designers to consider human scale and proportion in all aspects of their work, from the design of individual buildings to the overall layout of the city. By doing so, we can create a city that is truly designed for people.

By designing urban elements at a human scale, we can create more walkable and bikeable cities, reducing the need for cars and promoting a more sustainable mode of transportation. Human scale also allows for more efficient use of space, as it encourages the development of compact and dense urban areas. This can help reduce urban sprawl and preserve natural resources.

#### 3.2b Proportion in Urban Design

Proportion is another important aspect of human scale in urban design. It refers to the relationship between different elements in the city, such as buildings, public spaces, and street furniture. Proportion is crucial in creating a harmonious and visually appealing urban environment.

In urban design, proportion is often discussed in terms of the Golden Ratio, a mathematical ratio that is believed to be aesthetically pleasing. The Golden Ratio is often used to determine the proportions of buildings and public spaces, as well as the spacing between different elements. By following the Golden Ratio, urban designers can create a sense of balance and harmony in the city.

However, it is important to note that the Golden Ratio is not a strict rule that must be followed in all cases. Each city and context may require a different approach to proportion. Urban designers must consider the specific needs and characteristics of the community when determining proportion.

#### 3.2c Case Studies of Human Scale and Proportion

To further illustrate the importance of human scale and proportion in urban design, let us examine some case studies.

One example is the city of Copenhagen, Denmark. Known for its high quality of life and sustainable transportation system, Copenhagen has implemented strict regulations on building height and density. This has resulted in a city with a human scale, where pedestrians and cyclists are prioritized over cars. The city's compact and walkable design has also helped reduce urban sprawl and preserve natural resources.

Another example is the city of Curitiba, Brazil. Known for its innovative urban planning, Curitiba has implemented a comprehensive public transportation system that prioritizes buses and bicycles. The city's narrow streets and pedestrian-friendly design have also created a human scale that promotes a sense of community and familiarity for its residents.

These case studies demonstrate the positive impact of human scale and proportion in urban design. By prioritizing the needs and abilities of the human body, urban designers can create more livable and sustainable cities for all residents.

Public space design is a crucial aspect of urban design, as it involves creating spaces that are accessible and enjoyable for all members of the community. In this section, we will explore the principles of public space design and how they can be applied to create vibrant and inclusive public spaces in Beijing.

#### 3.3a Principles of Public Space Design

The principles of public space design are based on the concept of placemaking, which involves creating spaces that are meaningful and valuable to the community. According to the Project for Public Spaces, successful placemaking is based on eleven basic principles:

1. The Community Knows Best: This principle emphasizes the importance of involving the community in the design process. The community is the ultimate user of the public space, and their input is crucial in creating a space that meets their needs and reflects their values.

2. Places, Not Designs: Public space design is not just about creating a visually appealing design. It involves considering the interrelations between surrounding retailers, vendors, amenities, and activities, and fine-tuning the space to create a cohesive unit that adds value to the community.

3. Placemaking is a Group Effort: Successful public space design requires collaboration and partnerships. This can include individuals, private or municipal institutions, museums, and schools. These partners can provide political, financial, and intellectual backing, which is crucial for getting a public space improvement project off the ground.

4. Make and Act on Observations: By observing how a public space is used, designers can gain an understanding of what the community likes and dislikes about the space. This information can then be used to assess what activities and amenities may be missing from the space.

5. Requires a Vision: A placemaking project needs a vision to succeed. This vision should not be the grand design of a single person, but rather a collaborative effort that reflects the values and needs of the community.

6. Public Space is an Extension of Private Space: Public space should be designed to feel like an extension of private space, where individuals feel safe and comfortable. This can be achieved through creating a sense of enclosure and providing opportunities for social interaction.

7. Public Space is a Reflection of the Community: Public space should reflect the identity and values of the community. This can be achieved through incorporating cultural elements, local history, and community art.

8. Public Space is for Everyone: Public space should be designed to be inclusive and accessible to all members of the community, regardless of age, ability, or socioeconomic status.

9. Public Space is a Place for Social Interaction: Public space should provide opportunities for social interaction and community building. This can be achieved through creating a variety of spaces for different activities, such as gathering, playing, and relaxing.

10. Public Space is a Place for Cultural Expression: Public space should be a place for cultural expression, where individuals and groups can express their identity and values. This can be achieved through incorporating cultural elements and providing opportunities for artistic expression.

11. Public Space is a Place for Learning: Public space should be a place for learning and discovery. This can be achieved through incorporating educational elements and providing opportunities for informal learning.

By following these principles, designers can create public spaces that are meaningful, vibrant, and inclusive for the Beijing community. 





### Subsection: 3.3b Types of Public Spaces

#### 3.5a Principles of Contextual Design

Contextual design is a user-centered design approach that focuses on understanding the context in which a product or system will be used. This approach is particularly relevant in urban design, where the context is complex and dynamic, and includes a wide range of factors such as social, cultural, economic, and environmental conditions.

The principles of contextual design are based on the understanding that users are embedded in a context, and their behavior and needs are shaped by this context. Therefore, to design effective and meaningful urban spaces, urban designers need to understand the context in which these spaces will be used.

#### 3.5a.1 Understanding the Context

The first principle of contextual design is to understand the context in which the urban space will be used. This involves observing and analyzing the physical environment, social interactions, cultural practices, and economic activities that shape the context.

In the context of urban design, this can be achieved through a variety of methods, including contextual inquiry, data analytics, and visioning. Contextual inquiry is a field data collection technique that involves observing and interacting with users in their normal environment. Data analytics involves collecting and analyzing data about the users' behavior and interactions with the urban space. Visioning is a creative process that involves imagining and designing the future urban space based on the insights gained from contextual inquiry and data analytics.

#### 3.5a.2 Designing for the Context

The second principle of contextual design is to design for the context. This involves using the insights gained from understanding the context to design urban spaces that are meaningful and relevant to the users.

For instance, if the contextual inquiry reveals that a particular urban space is used for social interactions, the urban design should reflect this by providing spaces for social activities. Similarly, if the data analytics reveals that a particular urban space is used for economic activities, the urban design should reflect this by providing spaces for economic activities.

#### 3.5a.3 Evaluating the Context

The third principle of contextual design is to evaluate the context. This involves assessing the effectiveness and relevance of the urban design in the context.

This can be achieved through various methods, including user testing, user feedback, and usability evaluation. User testing involves observing and interacting with users in the actual urban space. User feedback involves collecting feedback from users about their experience with the urban space. Usability evaluation involves assessing the usability of the urban space based on various usability metrics.

4. **Refining the Design**: Based on the evaluation, the urban design is refined. This involves making necessary adjustments to the design to improve its effectiveness in the context.

#### 3.5b.2 Contextual Design and Urban Design Theory

Contextual design is closely aligned with the principles of urban design theory. For instance, the principles of contextual design align with the principles of the Transect Method, a comprehensive urban design theory that provides a framework for creating walkable, sustainable, and economically viable urban spaces.

The Transect Method is based on the concept of a transect, a line that crosses the urban space and defines a set of design criteria. These criteria are organized into five categories: Urban Design, Connectivity, Environmental Quality, Public Life, and Equity. Each category is further divided into a set of criteria, and each criterion is assigned a point value. The goal of the Transect Method is to achieve a high point value, which indicates a high level of performance in each category.

Contextual design, by understanding the context and designing for the context, helps to achieve this goal. For instance, by understanding the physical environment, social interactions, cultural practices, and economic activities that shape the context, urban designers can design urban spaces that meet the criteria of the Transect Method. Similarly, by designing for the context, urban designers can ensure that the urban space contributes to the overall functionality and livability of the urban space, which is a key criterion of the Transect Method.

In conclusion, contextual design is a critical process in urban design that helps to implement urban design theories. By understanding the context, designing for the context, and evaluating the context, urban designers can create urban spaces that are meaningful, relevant, and effective for the users.

### Analysis

Once artifacts and structures have been excavated, or collected from surface surveys, it is necessary to properly study them. This process is known as post-excavation analysis, and is usually the most time-consuming part of an archaeological investigation. It is not uncommon for final excavation reports for major sites to take years to be published.

At a basic level of analysis, artifacts found are cleaned, catalogued and compared to published collections. This comparison process often involves classifying them typologically and identifying other sites with similar artifact assemblages. However, a much more comprehensive range of analytical techniques are available through archaeological science, meaning that artifacts can be dated and their compositions examined. Bones, plants, and pollen collected from a site can all be analyzed using the methods of zooarchaeology, paleoethnobotany, palynology and stable isotopes while any texts can usually be deciphered.

These techniques frequently provide information that would not otherwise be known, and therefore they contribute greatly to the understanding of a site.

### Computational and virtual archaeology

Computer graphics are now used to build virtual 3D models of sites, such as the throne room of an Assyrian palace or ancient Rome. Photogrammetry is also used as an analytical tool, and digital archaeology is used to analyze and interpret archaeological data. These techniques allow for a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of archaeological sites, and can aid in the interpretation of archaeological data.

#### 5.3a Understanding Affordable Housing

Affordable housing is a critical aspect of urban design that has a significant impact on the social fabric of a city. It refers to housing that is deemed affordable to those with a household income at or below the median, as rated by the national government or a local government by a recognized housing affordability index. This includes a range of housing options, from emergency homeless shelters to affordable home ownership.

The concept of affordable housing is complex and multifaceted, and it is influenced by a variety of factors. These include economic, social, and psychological impulses, as well as government policies and regulations. For example, some households may choose to spend more on housing because they feel they can afford to, while others may not have a choice due to limited options and high housing costs.

## Definition and Measurement

There are several means of defining and measuring affordable housing. The definition and measurement may change in different nations, cities, or for specific policy goals.

### Definitions

The definition of affordable housing may change depending on the country and context. For example, in Australia, the National Affordable Housing Summit Group developed their definition of affordable housing as housing that is "...reasonably adequate in standard and location for lower or middle income households and does not cost so much that a household is unlikely to be able to meet other basic needs on a sustainable basis." In the United Kingdom, affordable housing includes "social rented and intermediate housing, provided to specified eligible households whose needs are not met by the market." In some contexts, affordable housing may only mean subsidized or public housing, while in other cases it may include naturally occurring affordable housing or "affordable" by different income levels from no income households to moderate income but cost-burdened households.

### Median Multiple Approaches

The median multiple indicator, recommended by the National Association of Realtors, is a commonly used method for measuring housing affordability. It compares the median home price to the median household income, with a ratio of 3 or less indicating affordability. However, this method has its limitations, as it does not take into account other factors such as interest rates, taxes, and insurance.

Another approach to measuring affordable housing is the Housing Affordability Index (HAI), developed by the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo. This index takes into account the median household income, median home price, and mortgage interest rates to determine the affordability of housing in a given area. A higher HAI indicates a more affordable housing market.

### Conclusion

Affordable housing is a crucial aspect of urban design that has a significant impact on the social and economic well-being of a city. It is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive understanding of economic, social, and psychological factors, as well as government policies and regulations. By using various methods of definition and measurement, we can better understand the affordability of housing in different contexts and work towards creating more livable and equitable cities.

The size and layout of affordable housing units can also have a significant impact on their affordability. Larger units are generally more expensive to build and maintain, which can increase the overall cost of the housing. However, smaller units may not provide enough space for households, particularly those with children or multiple family members.

One solution to this challenge is to design units that can be easily adapted to different household sizes. For example, units could be designed with modular furniture or walls that can be easily moved or removed to create more or less space as needed. This can help to reduce construction costs while still providing flexibility for households.

#### 5.3b.3 Materials and Construction Methods

The materials and construction methods used in affordable housing projects can also affect their affordability. Traditional construction methods, such as brick and mortar, can be expensive and time-consuming. Alternative construction methods, such as modular or prefabricated housing, can be more cost-effective and faster to build.

In addition, the use of sustainable materials and construction techniques can help to reduce the long-term costs of housing. For example, using energy-efficient materials and designs can reduce heating and cooling costs, while incorporating renewable energy sources can further reduce energy costs.

#### 5.3b.4 Affordable Housing Standards

As mentioned in the previous section, some governments have implemented sustainability standards for affordable housing projects. These standards can help to ensure the energy efficiency and durability of the housing, but they can also increase construction costs. Therefore, it is important for designers to carefully consider the potential impact of these standards on the affordability of the housing.

In conclusion, designing for affordable housing requires a careful balance of various factors. By considering the location, size, layout, materials, and construction methods, as well as any applicable standards, designers can create housing that is both affordable and sustainable.

This can be achieved through a variety of means, including the use of indigenous architecture, participatory design, and co-design.

#### 5.5b.1 Indigenous Architecture

Indigenous architecture is a design approach that draws inspiration from the cultural and environmental context of a particular community.

Participatory design is a design approach that involves the active participation of the community in the design process. This can be particularly effective in creating spaces that reflect the cultural identity of a community. By involving community members in the design process, designers can gain a deeper understanding of the community's cultural values and traditions, and can use this information to create spaces that are meaningful and relevant to the community.

#### 5.5b.3 Co-Design

Co-design is a design approach that involves the simultaneous development of interrelated software and hardware systems. This approach has been particularly popular in the development of mobile phones, where the two perspectives of hardware and software design are brought into a co-design process. In the context of urban design, co-design can be used to create spaces that are responsive to the needs and preferences of the community. By involving all stakeholders in the design process, designers can ensure that the final design reflects the cultural identity of the community.

The role of the designer in co-design is evolving. Traditionally, designers have been seen as experts who create designs based on their own knowledge and understanding. However, in co-design, the designer takes on a new role as a facilitator and philosopher. The designer is required to shift their role from one of expertise to one of an egalitarian mindset. This shift allows for the designer to position themselves and their designs within the context of the world around them, creating better and more meaningful spaces for the community.

Adaptive reuse is the process of repurposing existing buildings for uses other than those initially intended. This approach is often applied to historic buildings, but it can also be used for modern buildings that are no longer suitable for their original purpose. The key principle of adaptive reuse is to respect the existing fabric of the building while making necessary modifications to accommodate the new use.

The process of adaptive reuse involves several steps, including:

1. Identifying suitable buildings: This involves assessing the existing buildings in the urban space to determine which ones are suitable for adaptive reuse. The suitability of a building depends on various factors, including its structural condition, architectural value, and potential for adaptation.

2. Defining the new use: Once a suitable building is identified, the next step is to define the new use. This could be a commercial space, a residential unit, a public facility, or any other type of use that is compatible with the building's characteristics and the surrounding urban context.

3. Designing the adaptation: The adaptation design involves modifying the building to accommodate the new use. This could involve structural modifications, architectural changes, and the integration of new systems and equipment.

4. Implementing the adaptation: The implementation phase involves carrying out the adaptation design. This could involve construction work, renovation, or a combination of both.

5. Monitoring and evaluation: After the adaptation is implemented, it is important to monitor and evaluate its performance. This involves assessing the building's functionality, user satisfaction, and impact on the surrounding urban space.

#### 7.4a.2 Benefits of Adaptive Reuse

Adaptive reuse offers several benefits, including:

1. Efficient use of existing buildings: By repurposing existing buildings, adaptive reuse helps to reduce the need for new construction, thereby conserving resources and reducing environmental impact.

### Subsection: 7.4c Case Studies of Adaptive Reuse and Revitalization

Adaptive reuse and revitalization have been successfully implemented in various urban spaces in Beijing. This section will explore some of these case studies, including the adaptive reuse of a historic building and the revitalization of an abandoned industrial area.

#### 7.4c.1 Adaptive Reuse of a Historic Building

The adaptive reuse of a historic building is a common practice in Beijing, particularly in the city's old quarters. One such example is the adaptive reuse of the Siheyuan, a traditional courtyard house. The Siheyuan was originally built during the Ming dynasty and was used as a residence for the elite. However, with the rapid modernization of Beijing, many of these historic buildings were abandoned or left in a state of disrepair.

The adaptive reuse of the Siheyuan involved converting the building into a boutique hotel. This not only preserved the historic building but also provided a unique and culturally immersive experience for tourists. The adaptive reuse process involved extensive renovations, including the addition of modern amenities while maintaining the building's historic features.

The Simple Function Point method was used to estimate the complexity of the adaptation design. The building had a high number of function points, indicating a high potential for adaptation. Value-stream mapping was also used to identify and eliminate waste in the adaptation process.

#### 7.4c.2 Revitalization of an Abandoned Industrial Area

The revitalization of an abandoned industrial area is another example of adaptive reuse and revitalization in Beijing. The area, known as the Dashilar Industrial Zone, was once a bustling hub of industry but had been abandoned for over a decade. The revitalization process involved transforming the area into a mixed-use development, with residential, commercial, and recreational spaces.

The revitalization process involved extensive planning and design, including the use of value-stream mapping to identify and eliminate waste in the development process. The Simple Function Point method was also used to estimate the complexity of the design and to plan and budget for the project.

The adaptive reuse and revitalization of these urban spaces not only preserved the city's historic and cultural heritage but also provided new opportunities for economic development and community engagement. These case studies serve as valuable examples for future adaptive reuse and revitalization projects in Beijing.




### Subsection: 7.5a Understanding Public Health and Well-being

Public health and well-being are crucial considerations in urban design. The design of cities and neighborhoods can have a significant impact on the health and well-being of their inhabitants. This section will explore the concept of public health and well-being, and how it relates to urban design.

#### 7.5a.1 Definition of Public Health and Well-being

Public health refers to the health of a population or community as a whole, rather than the health of an individual. It is concerned with the health of the population as a whole, rather than the health of individual people. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as "a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity." This definition highlights the holistic nature of health, encompassing not just physical health, but also mental and social well-being.

Well-being, on the other hand, is a broader concept that encompasses not just health, but also happiness, satisfaction, and quality of life. The New Economics Foundation (NEF) defines well-being as "the realization of human potential, encompassing health, happiness, and life satisfaction, as well as the ability to lead a fulfilling life." This definition highlights the importance of not just physical health, but also mental and emotional well-being.

#### 7.5a.2 The Role of Urban Design in Public Health and Well-being

Urban design plays a crucial role in public health and well-being. The design of cities and neighborhoods can have a significant impact on the health and well-being of their inhabitants. For example, the design of a neighborhood can influence the amount of physical activity people engage in, which in turn can impact their physical health. Similarly, the design of a city can influence the availability of green spaces and access to fresh food, which can impact mental and physical well-being.

#### 7.5a.3 The Importance of Including Public Health and Well-being in Urban Design

Including public health and well-being in urban design is crucial for creating livable and sustainable cities. By considering the health and well-being of the population as a whole, urban designers can create cities that are not just functional, but also healthy and enjoyable to live in. This can lead to improved quality of life for residents, as well as reduced healthcare costs and increased productivity.

#### 7.5a.4 The Challenges and Opportunities of Including Public Health and Well-being in Urban Design

While including public health and well-being in urban design presents many opportunities, it also comes with its own set of challenges. One of the main challenges is the lack of standardization in the field. Unlike other areas of urban design, such as transportation or energy efficiency, there is no universal standard for measuring and evaluating public health and well-being. This makes it difficult to quantify the impact of urban design on public health and well-being, and to compare different design strategies.

However, this also presents an opportunity for innovation and creativity. With the rise of smart cities and the Internet of Things, there is an opportunity to use data and technology to measure and improve public health and well-being. For example, sensors can be used to track physical activity levels, air quality, and access to green spaces, providing valuable insights for urban designers.

In conclusion, public health and well-being are crucial considerations in urban design. By understanding the role of urban design in public health and well-being, and by addressing the challenges and opportunities of including public health and well-being in urban design, we can create cities that are not just functional, but also healthy and enjoyable to live in.





### Subsection: 7.5b Designing for Public Health and Well-being

Designing for public health and well-being is a complex task that requires a multidisciplinary approach. It involves not only urban planners and designers, but also healthcare professionals, social scientists, and environmental psychologists. The goal is to create environments that not only meet the physical needs of the population, but also enhance their mental and social well-being.

#### 7.5b.1 Principles of Designing for Public Health and Well-being

There are several key principles that guide the design for public health and well-being. These include:

1. **Biophilia**: The concept of biophilia, or the innate human connection to nature, has been shown to have positive impacts on health and well-being. Designs that incorporate elements of nature, such as natural light, green spaces, and water features, can enhance emotional functioning and reduce stress.

2. **Evidence-based Design**: Evidence-based design (EBD) is a design approach that is informed by research and evidence. It involves using scientific research to inform design decisions, with the goal of optimizing health outcomes. For example, studies have shown that exposure to nature can alleviate pain and improve sleep, so EBD would incorporate design elements that maximize exposure to nature.

### Subsection: 10.1a Ancient Beijing

The history of urban design in Beijing dates back to ancient times, with the city's earliest traces of human habitation found in the caves of Dragon Bone Hill near the village of Zhoukoudian in Fangshan District. These caves, inhabited by "Homo erectus" and later by "Homo sapiens," provide evidence of human settlement in the region dating back to 230,000 to 250,000 years ago.

The first walled city in Beijing was Jicheng, built in 1045 BC. This settlement, located around the present Guang'anmen area in the south of Xicheng District, was the capital city of the state of Ji. It was later conquered by the state of Yan and made its capital.

During the Three Kingdoms period, Jicheng was held by Gongsun Zan and Yuan Shao before falling to the Wei Kingdom of Cao Cao. The AD third-century Western Jin demoted the town, placing the prefectural seat in neighboring Zhuozhou. During the Sixteen Kingdoms period when northern China was conquered and divided by the Wu Hu, Jicheng was briefly the capital of the Xianbei Former Yan Kingdom.

After China was reunified by the Sui dynasty in 581, Jicheng, also known as Zhuojun, became the northern terminus of the Grand Canal. Under the Tang dynasty, Jicheng as Youzhou, served as a military frontier command center. During the An-Shi Rebellion and again amidst the turmoil of the late Tang, local military commanders founded their own short-lived Yan dynasties and called the city Yanjing, or the "Yan Capital." In 938, after the fall of the Tang, the Later Jin ceded the frontier territory including what is now Beijing to the Khitan Liao dynasty, which treated the city as Nanjing.

The Liao dynasty's rule marked a significant period in the history of urban design in Beijing. The city was fortified with a new wall, and the layout of the city was reorganized. The city was divided into three sections: the inner city, the outer city, and the suburbs. The inner city was the seat of the Liao dynasty and was home to the imperial palace, government offices, and the homes of the elite. The outer city was a commercial and residential area, while the suburbs were primarily agricultural.

The Liao dynasty's urban design principles were influenced by the nomadic lifestyle of the Khitan people. The city was designed to be easily defensible and to accommodate the needs of the nomadic lifestyle, with wide streets and open spaces. The city's layout also reflected the hierarchical structure of the Liao dynasty, with the imperial palace at the center and the homes of the common people on the outskirts.

The Liao dynasty's urban design principles have had a lasting impact on the city of Beijing. The wide streets and open spaces, as well as the hierarchical layout, can still be seen in the city today. The Liao dynasty's urban design also laid the foundation for the city's future development, with the inner city becoming the site of the Forbidden City and the outer city becoming the site of the modern city center.

#### Commercial Area Zoning

Commercial area zoning is a key aspect of Beijing's zoning laws and regulations. Cities often use zoning laws to prevent conflicts between residential homeowners and businesses. In Beijing, land designated as a commercial area is rarely located in the middle of residential zones. This helps to keep traffic to these sites manageable and prevents noise and other disturbances from affecting residential areas.

Some areas of the city may be designated for 'mixed usage', which means some commercial areas may be used for residential purposes. This is often seen in quaint downtown shopping areas with apartments. However, zoning laws still regulate the level of industry permitted in these areas. Heavier industries are often located on the fringes of the city or in unincorporated areas. Some commercial zones in the city do allow for light industrial usage, usually smaller factories with minimal emissions and transportation needs.

#### Commercial Area Buildings

The Neighbourhood Commercial 1 (CN1) zone is intended for small sites in or near dense residential neighbourhoods. This zone encourages the provision of small-scale retail and service uses for nearby residential areas. Some uses which are not retail or service in nature are also allowed, promoting a variety of uses in existing buildings.

#### Integration with Urban Planning

Transportation planning in Beijing is closely integrated with urban planning. This integration is crucial for creating a sustainable and livable city. Transport isochrone maps, for example, are a measure of accessibility that can be used by urban planners to evaluate sites. These maps help planners to identify areas that are well-served by transportation networks and those that may require additional investments.

#### Models and Sustainability

Transportation planning in Beijing follows the rational planning model of defining goals and objectives, identifying problems, generating alternatives, evaluating alternatives, and developing plans. However, other models, such as transit-oriented development, incremental planning, and political bargaining, are also used. These models are particularly important in promoting sustainability through integrated transport policies.

For example, in Hanoi, the increasing number of motorcycles is responsible for not only environmental damage but also traffic congestion. To address these issues, planners are increasingly expected to adopt a multidisciplinary approach, especially due to the rising importance of environmentalism. This includes the use of behavioural psychology to persuade drivers to abandon their automobiles and use public transport instead. The role of the transport planner is shifting from technical analysis to promoting sustainability through integrated transport policies.

#### Case Studies of Transportation Planning in Beijing

To further illustrate the principles of transportation planning in Beijing, let's examine two case studies: the 3rd Ring Road and Beyond, and the Daxing International Airport.

The 3rd Ring Road, completed in 1999, marked a significant milestone in Beijing's urban development. It was the first major road project that encircled the city, connecting its various districts and facilitating the movement of people and goods. The construction of the 3rd Ring Road also led to the development of new residential and commercial areas, as well as the expansion of existing ones. The land use and zoning policies in these areas were designed to promote a mix of uses, with a focus on creating walkable and transit-oriented communities.

The Daxing International Airport, completed in 2019, was another major transportation project in Beijing. The airport, located in the southern part of the city, required the relocation of over 100,000 residents and the development of a new urban area. The transportation planning for this project involved the construction of a new high-speed rail station, a new subway line, and a new bus network to connect the airport with the rest of the city. These transportation improvements not only facilitate the movement of people and goods but also contribute to the sustainability of the city.

In conclusion, transportation planning in Beijing is a complex and collaborative process that involves various stakeholders and follows a variety of models. It is closely integrated with urban planning and plays a crucial role in promoting sustainability through integrated transport policies. The case studies of the 3rd Ring Road and Beyond, and the Daxing International Airport, provide valuable examples of how transportation planning is implemented in Beijing.

In Beijing, community engagement has been particularly important in addressing social issues related to urban development. The city's rapid growth has led to significant changes in the local communities, and community engagement has been a way of ensuring that these changes are managed in a way that is beneficial to the local residents.

Community engagement in Beijing has been facilitated by various institutions, including the government, urban planning agencies, and non-governmental organizations. These institutions have recognized the importance of community engagement in creating more livable and sustainable urban spaces.

#### 14.1b Case Studies of Community Engagement in Beijing

Community engagement in Beijing has been evident in various urban design projects across the city. One such project is the Beijing Dongcheng District, which has undergone several urban renewal projects with the active involvement of the local community. The community has been involved in the planning and design of these projects, ensuring that their needs and concerns are addressed. This has led to more equitable and sustainable development in the district.

Another example is the 798 Art Zone, located in the Dashanzi area of Beijing. The zone was transformed from a military factory complex into a vibrant art district through a collaborative effort between the government, urban planners, and the local community. The community was actively involved in the planning and design process, providing input on the types of art and cultural spaces they wanted to see in the zone. This has not only created a vibrant and inclusive art district but also addressed social issues related to gentrification and displacement.

#### 14.1c Challenges and Opportunities in Community Engagement in Beijing

Despite the success stories, community engagement in Beijing has also faced challenges. One of the main challenges is the unequal distribution of resources and power among community members. This can lead to unequal participation and representation in decision-making processes.

However, there are also opportunities for improvement. With the advancement of technology, online platforms have been increasingly used for community engagement in Beijing. These platforms have the potential to reach a wider audience and facilitate more inclusive participation.

In conclusion, community engagement has been a crucial aspect of urban design in Beijing, particularly in addressing social issues. It has been instrumental in creating more equitable and sustainable urban spaces. However, there are also challenges that need to be addressed to ensure that community engagement is truly inclusive and representative.
