In the next section, we will explore some of the emerging technologies that are being used in Agile development, and how they are changing the way software is built.





#### 16.1b Principles of Agile

The Agile Manifesto is a set of values and principles that guide the Agile approach to software development. These values and principles are summarized in the following table:

| Value | Principle |
|-------|-----------|
| Individuals and interactions over processes and tools | The Agile Manifesto emphasizes the importance of individuals and their interactions in the development process. It recognizes that processes and tools can hinder collaboration and creativity, and therefore should not be the focus. |
| Working software over comprehensive documentation | The Agile Manifesto prefers working software over comprehensive documentation. This does not mean that documentation is not important, but rather that it should be done in a way that supports the development process and not hinders it. |
| Customer collaboration over contract negotiation | The Agile Manifesto values customer collaboration over contract negotiation. This means that customers should be involved in the development process and their needs should be prioritized over following a strict contract. |
| Responding to change over following a plan | The Agile Manifesto recognizes that plans can change and that it is important to be able to respond to these changes. This does not mean that planning is not important, but rather that it should be flexible and adaptable. |

These values and principles guide the Agile approach to software development and are the foundation of Agile methodologies. In the following sections, we will explore some of the most popular Agile methodologies and how they embody these principles.

#### 16.1c Challenges of Agile

### Related Context
```
# Software quality

In the context of software engineering, software quality refers to two related but distinct notions:


Many aspects of structural quality can be evaluated only statically through the analysis of the software inner structure, its source code (see Software metrics), at the unit level, and at the system level (sometimes referred to as end-to-end testing), which is in effect how its architecture adheres to sound principles of software architecture outlined in a paper on the topic by Object Management Group (OMG).

However some structural qualities, such as usability, can be assessed only dynamically (users or others acting on their behalf interact with the software or, at least, some prototype or partial implementation; even the interaction with a mock version made in cardboard represents a dynamic test because such version can be considered a prototype). Other aspects, such as reliability, might involve not only the software but also the underlying hardware, therefore, it can be assessed both statically and dynamically (stress test).

Functional quality is typically assessed dynamically but it is also possible to use static tests (such as software reviews).

Historically, the structure, classification and terminology of attributes and metrics applicable to software quality management have been derived or extracted from the ISO 9126 and the subsequent ISO/IEC 25000 standard. Based on these models (see Models), the Consortium for IT Software Quality (CISQ) has defined five major desirable structural characteristics needed for a piece of software to provide business value: Reliability, Efficiency, Security, Maintainability and (adequate) Size.

Software quality measurement quantifies to what extent a software program or system rates along each of these five dimensions. An aggregated measure of software quality can be computed through a qualitative or a quantitative scoring scheme or a mix of both and then a weighting system reflecting the priorities.




### Subsection: 20.1b Principles of Software Quality Assurance

Software quality assurance (QA) is a systematic process that ensures the quality of software products and services. It involves a set of principles, processes, and practices that are used to verify and validate the quality of software. These principles are based on the ISO 9126 and ISO/IEC 25000 standards, which provide a framework for measuring and evaluating software quality.

The principles of software quality assurance can be broadly categorized into two types: functional and non-functional. Functional quality refers to the functionality of the software, while non-functional quality refers to other attributes such as reliability, efficiency, security, maintainability, and size.

#### Functional Quality Assurance

Functional quality assurance involves verifying that the software meets the specified functional requirements. This is typically done through dynamic testing, where the software is interacted with by users or others acting on their behalf. This allows for the assessment of the software's functionality and usability.

#### Non-Functional Quality Assurance

Non-functional quality assurance involves verifying that the software meets the specified non-functional requirements. This can be done through both static and dynamic testing. Static testing involves analyzing the software's inner structure and source code, while dynamic testing involves interacting with the software or a prototype to assess its reliability, efficiency, security, maintainability, and size.

The Consortium for IT Software Quality (CISQ) has defined five major desirable structural characteristics needed for a piece of software to provide business value: Reliability, Efficiency, Security, Maintainability, and Size. These characteristics are used to measure and evaluate the quality of software.

In conclusion, software quality assurance is a crucial aspect of software development that ensures the quality and reliability of software products and services. It involves a set of principles, processes, and practices that are used to verify and validate the quality of software. By adhering to these principles, software developers can ensure that their products meet the specified functional and non-functional requirements, providing value to their customers and stakeholders.





### Subsection: 20.1c Implementing Software Quality Assurance in Projects

The QA objectives should align with the project's overall objectives and should be measurable. The scope of QA activities should cover all the relevant aspects of the software, including functionality, reliability, efficiency, security, maintainability, and size. The QA approach should be tailored to the specific needs and characteristics of the project, taking into account factors such as the project's size, complexity, and risk level.

#### Conducting QA Activities

Once the QA activities have been planned and executed, the next step is to conduct the QA activities. This involves performing various QA techniques, such as dynamic testing, static testing, and peer reviews. Dynamic testing involves interacting with the software or a prototype to assess its functionality and usability. Static testing involves analyzing the software's inner structure and source code. Peer reviews involve having other developers review the code for errors and defects.

#### Monitoring and Measuring QA Performance

After conducting the QA activities, it is important to monitor and measure the QA performance. This involves tracking the number and type of defects found, the time and resources spent on QA activities, and the overall quality of the software. This information can be used to assess the effectiveness of the QA activities and to make necessary adjustments.

#### Continuous Improvement

Finally, implementing software QA should be seen as an ongoing process of continuous improvement. This involves learning from past experiences, identifying areas for improvement, and implementing changes to enhance the QA process. This can be achieved through regular reviews and audits, as well as through the use of advanced QA tools and technologies.

In conclusion, implementing software QA in projects is a critical aspect of ensuring the quality and reliability of software products.
