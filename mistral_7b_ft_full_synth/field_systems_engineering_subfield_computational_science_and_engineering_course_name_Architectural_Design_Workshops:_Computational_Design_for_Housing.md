As the world continues to grapple with the challenges of rapid urbanization and the need for sustainable and affordable housing, computational design offers a promising solution.

The book is structured around the concept of the design continuum, a term that encapsulates the entire life cycle of a building, from construction to destruction. This continuum is characterized by the shared use of digital design tools and the exchange of information and knowledge between designers and across different projects. The design continuum is a critical concept in computational design, as it underscores the importance of integrating models that were previously isolated and the need for combining various forms of expert knowledge, tools, and media.

In the realm of computational design, the two-way mapping of activities and functionalities is a key advantage. This mapping is typically between the surface structures and the deep structures, and it is an abstraction that allows us to discuss the process of design and deployment of CAAD systems.

Shape grammars are a type of formal grammar that define the shape of a design. They are based on the concept of shape rules, which define how a shape can be broken down into smaller shapes and how these smaller shapes can be combined to create a new shape. By using shape grammars, designers can generate a large number of variations on a design, making it a valuable tool in the design process.

Shape grammars are particularly useful in housing design, as they allow designers to create a variety of layouts and configurations for a given site. This is especially important in urban areas where space is limited and designers need to make the most out of every square foot.

To understand shape grammars, we must first understand the concept of shape rules. A shape rule is a set of instructions that define how a shape can be broken down and recombined. These rules are based on a set of shape primitives, which are the basic building blocks of a design. By combining these shape primitives in different ways, designers can create a wide range of designs.

Shape grammars also allow for the use of shape variables, which are placeholders for specific shapes. These variables can be replaced with different shapes, allowing for even more variation in the final design. This is particularly useful in housing design, where designers may want to create multiple layouts for a single site.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of shape rules and how they can be used to generate designs for 2D site plans. We will also discuss the advantages and limitations of using shape grammars in housing design, as well as potential applications and case studies. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of 2D shape grammars and their role in computational design for housing.

We have discussed the principles of shape grammars and their role in generating complex designs from simple rules. In this section, we will delve deeper into the world of shape grammars and explore their three-dimensional (3D) applications in housing design.

#### 4.1a Basics of 3D Shape Grammars

Shape grammars are a powerful tool in computational design, allowing designers to create complex and intricate designs from a set of simple rules. These rules, known as shape rules, define how a shape can be broken down into smaller shapes and how these smaller shapes can be combined to create a larger shape. By using shape grammars, designers can generate an infinite number of variations from a single shape, providing a high level of flexibility and creativity in their designs.

In the context of 3D housing design, shape grammars are used to generate 3D housing designs from a set of simple rules. These rules are defined by shape grammars, which are a set of instructions that dictate how a shape can be broken down and recombined to create a new shape. These grammars are based on the principles of shape language, which is a formal language used to describe shapes.

Shape language is a mathematical language that is used to describe shapes in a precise and unambiguous manner. It is based on the concept of shape rules, which are a set of instructions that define how a shape can be broken down into smaller shapes and how these smaller shapes can be combined to create a larger shape. These rules are represented by a set of symbols and operators, which are used to manipulate shapes and create new ones.

One of the key advantages of using shape grammars in 3D housing design is the ability to generate an infinite number of variations from a single shape. This allows designers to explore a wide range of design possibilities and create unique and innovative housing designs. Additionally, shape grammars also allow for the optimization of designs, as designers can easily modify and adjust the shape rules to achieve specific design goals.

However, there are also some limitations to using shape grammars in 3D housing design. One of the main challenges is the complexity of the design process. Shape grammars require a deep understanding of shape language and the ability to translate complex design ideas into a set of shape rules. This can be a challenging task for designers who are not familiar with shape language or computational design.

Another limitation is the potential for repetition in the generated designs. As shape grammars are based on a set of rules, there is a risk of creating repetitive designs. This can be mitigated by carefully designing the shape rules and incorporating randomization techniques, but it is still a concern that designers must consider.

In conclusion, shape grammars are a powerful tool in 3D housing design, allowing designers to create complex and innovative designs from a set of simple rules. While there are some limitations, the benefits of using shape grammars far outweigh the challenges, making them an essential tool for modern computational design. In the next section, we will explore the applications of shape grammars in 3D housing design in more detail.

Shape grammars in computation are a specific class of production systems that generate geometric shapes. Typically, shapes are 2- or 3-dimensional, thus shape grammars are a way to study 2- and 3-dimensional languages. Shape grammars were first introduced in a seminal article by George Stiny and James Gips in 1971. The mathematical and algorithmic foundations of shape grammars (in particular, for linear elements in two-dimensions) were developed in "Pictorial and Formal Aspects of Shapes and Shape Grammars" (Birkhäuser Basel, 1975) by George Stiny. Applications of shape grammars were first considered in "Shape Grammars and their Uses" (Birkhäuser Basel, 1975) by James Gips. These publications also contain two independent, though equivalent, constructions showing that shape grammars can simulate Turing machines.

## Definition

A shape grammar consists of "shape rules" and a "generation engine" that selects and processes rules. A shape rule defines how an existing (part of a) shape can be transformed. A shape rule consists of two parts separated by an arrow pointing from left to right. The part left of the arrow is termed the "Left-Hand Side" (LHS). It depicts a condition in terms of a shape and a marker. The part right of the arrow is termed the "Right-Hand Side" (RHS). It depicts how the LHS shape should be transformed and where the marker is positioned. The marker helps to locate and orient the new shape.

A shape grammar minimally consists of three shape rules: a "start rule", at least one transformation rule, and a "termination rule". The start rule is necessary to start the shape generation process. The termination rule is necessary to make the shape generation process stop. The simplest way to stop the process is by a shape rule that removes the marker. Shape grammars differ from Chomsky grammars in a major respect: the production rules of a shape grammar are not necessarily left-recursive. This means that the generation of a shape can be done in a top-down manner, where the shape is generated by applying the start rule, and then by applying the transformation rules until the termination rule is reached. Alternatively, a bottom-up approach can be used, where the shape is generated by applying the termination rule, and then by applying the transformation rules until the start rule is reached. This allows for a more flexible and dynamic approach to shape generation, as the generation process can be controlled by the designer.

### 4.1b Application of Shape Grammars in 3D

Shape grammars have been widely used in the field of 3D housing design, with notable applications in the work of architect Michael Batty. Batty's work, as described in his 1997 book "The New Urban Crisis: Urban Sprawl and How to End It", highlights the importance of understanding the underlying processes that shape cities and their growth. This approach, known as "process urbanism", emphasizes the need to study the processes that create urban form, rather than just the form itself.

Batty's work also explores the concept of "urban morphology", which is the study of the physical form and structure of cities. This approach recognizes the complexity and diversity of urban form, and seeks to understand the underlying processes that create this diversity. By using shape grammars, Batty was able to generate a wide range of urban designs that reflected the complexity and diversity of real cities.

In addition to its applications in urban design, shape grammars have also been used in the field of computational design for housing. By using shape grammars, designers can create complex and intricate housing designs that are tailored to specific needs and preferences. This allows for a more personalized and efficient approach to housing design, as well as the ability to explore a wide range of design possibilities.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, shape grammars are a powerful tool in computational design for housing. By using shape grammars, designers can generate an infinite number of variations from a single shape, allowing for a high level of flexibility and creativity in their designs. This approach has been widely used in the field of urban design, and has also shown great potential in the field of computational design for housing. As technology continues to advance, shape grammars will play an increasingly important role in shaping the future of housing design.

### Subsection: 4.1c Examples of 3D Shape Grammars

In this section, we will explore some examples of 3D shape grammars to better understand their applications and capabilities. These examples will demonstrate how shape grammars can be used to generate complex 3D structures, such as housing designs.

#### 4.1c.1 Housing Design Generation

One of the most common applications of shape grammars in computational design is the generation of housing designs. By defining a set of shape rules, designers can generate a variety of housing designs that adhere to specific design principles and constraints.

For example, consider a shape grammar for generating single-family homes. The start rule could define the basic shape of a house, such as a rectangular footprint with a pitched roof. The transformation rules could then introduce variations in the design, such as adding a garage, changing the roof style, or altering the layout of the interior. The termination rule could be a shape rule that removes the marker, signaling the end of the generation process.

By applying this shape grammar, designers can generate a large number of unique housing designs that still adhere to the basic principles and constraints of the grammar. This can be particularly useful in the early stages of the design process, where designers are exploring different design options.

#### 4.1c.2 Parametric Design

Another application of shape grammars is in parametric design. Parametric design is a method of design in which the parameters of a design are defined and manipulated to create variations in the design. Shape grammars can be used to define these parameters and the rules for manipulating them.

For example, consider a shape grammar for generating a series of furniture designs. The start rule could define the basic shape of a chair, such as a rectangular seat and back. The transformation rules could then introduce variations in the design, such as changing the height of the seat, altering the angle of the back, or adding armrests. The termination rule could be a shape rule that removes the marker, signaling the end of the generation process.

By applying this shape grammar, designers can generate a large number of unique furniture designs that still adhere to the basic principles and constraints of the grammar. This can be particularly useful in the design of furniture for a specific space, where the designer needs to create a series of designs that fit within a specific set of constraints.

#### 4.1c.3 Generating Complex Structures

Shape grammars can also be used to generate complex structures, such as buildings or urban plans. By defining a set of shape rules, designers can generate a variety of structures that adhere to specific design principles and constraints.

For example, consider a shape grammar for generating a series of urban plans. The start rule could define the basic shape of a city block, such as a rectangular footprint with a grid of streets. The transformation rules could then introduce variations in the design, such as adding parks, changing the building height, or altering the layout of the streets. The termination rule could be a shape rule that removes the marker, signaling the end of the generation process.

By applying this shape grammar, designers can generate a large number of unique urban plans that still adhere to the basic principles and constraints of the grammar. This can be particularly useful in the planning and design of cities, where designers need to create a series of plans that fit within a specific set of constraints.

In conclusion, shape grammars are a powerful tool in computational design, allowing designers to generate a large number of unique designs that adhere to specific design principles and constraints. By understanding the principles and applications of shape grammars, designers can harness their power to create innovative and efficient housing designs.




### Subsection: 4.2a Introduction to 3D Grammar Practice

In the previous section, we explored some examples of 3D shape grammars and their applications in computational design. Now, we will delve deeper into the practical application of 3D shape grammars by hand. This section will provide a step-by-step guide on how to practice 3D shape grammars by hand, using the principles and concepts discussed in the previous sections.

#### 4.2a.1 Understanding the Grammar

Before we start practicing 3D shape grammars by hand, it is crucial to have a solid understanding of the grammar rules. The grammar rules define the shape of the object and how it can be transformed into different variations. They are the backbone of the shape grammar and are used to generate new shapes.

For example, consider the shape grammar for generating single-family homes discussed in the previous section. The start rule defines the basic shape of a house, the transformation rules introduce variations, and the termination rule signals the end of the generation process.

#### 4.2a.2 Applying the Grammar

Once we understand the grammar rules, we can start applying them to generate new shapes. This involves using the start rule to create the initial shape, applying the transformation rules to introduce variations, and stopping when the termination rule is reached.

For instance, if we want to generate a series of furniture designs using the shape grammar, we would start with the basic shape of a chair defined by the start rule. We would then apply the transformation rules to change the height of the seat, alter the angle of the back, and introduce other variations. We would continue applying the transformation rules until we reach the termination rule, signaling the end of the generation process.

#### 4.2a.3 Visualizing the Shapes

As we generate new shapes, it is important to visualize them in our minds. This helps us understand the shape better and identify any potential errors in our application of the grammar rules.

For example, if we are generating a series of furniture designs, we can visualize each design in our minds. We can imagine the shape of the chair, the height of the seat, the angle of the back, and any other variations introduced by the transformation rules. This visualization can help us identify any discrepancies between the intended shape and the actual shape generated.

#### 4.2a.4 Refining the Grammar

As we practice generating shapes by hand, we may encounter situations where the grammar rules are not sufficient to generate the desired shape. In such cases, we can refine the grammar by adding new rules or modifying existing ones.

For example, if we are generating a series of furniture designs and we encounter a shape that cannot be generated by the current grammar rules, we can add a new rule to handle this shape. Alternatively, we can modify an existing rule to allow for more variations in the shape.

#### 4.2a.5 Automating the Process

Finally, once we have a solid understanding of the grammar and can generate shapes by hand, we can start automating the process. This involves writing a computer program that can apply the grammar rules to generate new shapes.

For example, we can write a program that takes a set of shape rules and generates a series of furniture designs. This program can then be used to generate a large number of variations, making it a powerful tool in the field of computational design.

In the next section, we will provide a step-by-step guide on how to practice 3D shape grammars by hand, using the principles and concepts discussed in this section. We will start with a simple shape grammar and gradually move on to more complex ones.

Consider the shape grammar for generating single-family homes discussed in the previous section. Write out the grammar rules and use them to generate a series of single-family homes. Visualize each home in your mind and describe the variations introduced by the transformation rules.

#### 4.2b.2 Exercise 2: Applying the Grammar to Furniture Design

Choose a piece of furniture, such as a chair or a table, and write out a shape grammar for it. Use the grammar to generate a series of variations of the furniture piece. Visualize each variation in your mind and describe the changes introduced by the transformation rules.

#### 4.2b.3 Exercise 3: Exploring the Limitations of the Grammar

Choose a shape that cannot be generated by the shape grammar. Write out the shape and explain why it cannot be generated. Discuss potential modifications to the grammar that could allow for the generation of this shape.

#### 4.2b.4 Exercise 4: Using the Grammar for Generating 3D Objects

Consider a 3D object, such as a building or a sculpture. Write out a shape grammar for the object and use it to generate a series of variations. Visualize each variation in your mind and describe the changes introduced by the transformation rules.

#### 4.2b.5 Exercise 5: Exploring the Relationship between the Grammar and the Shape

Choose a shape generated by the shape grammar. Write out the shape and the corresponding grammar rules. Discuss the relationship between the shape and the grammar. How does the grammar rule generate the shape? What changes would need to be made to the grammar rule to generate a different shape?

By practicing these exercises, you will gain a deeper understanding of 3D shape grammars and their applications in computational design. You will also develop the skills needed to apply these concepts in your own work.

We have discussed the principles of design, the role of algorithms, and the use of parametric modeling. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the world of computational design by focusing on 3D abstract models of clusters.

The creation of 3D abstract models of clusters is a crucial step in the design process. It allows designers to visualize and test their designs in a virtual environment, providing a more efficient and effective way of exploring design options. This chapter will guide you through the process of creating these models, from the initial concept to the final product.

### Subsection: 5.1a Understanding 3D Abstract Models

Before we dive into the specifics of creating 3D abstract models of clusters, it is important to understand what these models are and how they are used in the design process. 3D abstract models are virtual representations of physical objects or systems. In the context of housing design, these models are used to represent the built environment, including buildings, streets, and open spaces.

The process of creating a 3D abstract model involves using specialized software to create a virtual representation of the built environment. This software allows designers to manipulate and visualize the model in a realistic and detailed manner. The model can then be used for various purposes, such as testing design options, analyzing the impact of different design decisions, and communicating design ideas to clients or stakeholders.

One of the key advantages of using 3D abstract models in housing design is the ability to test and evaluate design options in a virtual environment. This allows designers to make adjustments and modifications to their designs without the need for physical construction, saving time and resources. Additionally, 3D abstract models can be used to simulate real-world scenarios, such as traffic flow or natural disasters, providing valuable insights into the functionality and resilience of the design.

### Subsection: 5.1b Creating 3D Abstract Models of Clusters

The process of creating a 3D abstract model of a cluster involves several steps, including data collection, modeling, and visualization. The first step is to collect data about the site, such as topography, existing buildings, and surrounding context. This data can be collected through various methods, such as site surveys, aerial imagery, or GIS data.

Once the data is collected, it is then used to create a digital model of the site. This model is created using specialized software, such as AutoCAD, Revit, or SketchUp. The software allows designers to create a detailed and accurate representation of the site, including buildings, streets, and open spaces.

After the model is created, it can then be visualized and explored in a virtual environment. This allows designers to test and evaluate their designs in a realistic and detailed manner. The model can also be shared with clients or stakeholders to communicate design ideas and gather feedback.

### Subsection: 5.1c Applications of 3D Abstract Models in Housing Design

The use of 3D abstract models in housing design has numerous applications. One of the most significant applications is in the evaluation and testing of design options. By creating multiple models representing different design options, designers can compare and contrast them to determine the most effective and efficient design.

Another application is in the analysis of the impact of design decisions. By simulating real-world scenarios in the virtual environment, designers can assess the functionality and resilience of their designs. This can help identify potential issues and inform design decisions to improve the overall quality of the housing cluster.

Additionally, 3D abstract models can be used for communication and collaboration. By sharing the model with clients or stakeholders, designers can gather feedback and input, leading to a more collaborative and inclusive design process.

In conclusion, 3D abstract models of clusters are a valuable tool in the housing design process. They allow designers to test and evaluate design options, analyze the impact of design decisions, and communicate design ideas effectively. As technology continues to advance, the use of 3D abstract models will only become more prevalent in the field of housing design.


## Chapter 5: 3D Abstract Models of Clusters:




### Subsection: 5.1b Role of Shape Grammars in 3D Models

Shape grammars play a crucial role in the creation of 3D abstract models of clusters. They provide a systematic and structured approach to generating complex shapes, which is essential in the design of housing clusters. 

Shape grammars are a specific class of production systems that generate geometric shapes. They were first introduced in a seminal article by George Stiny and James Gips in 1971. The mathematical and algorithmic foundations of shape grammars were developed in "Pictorial and Formal Aspects of Shapes and Shape Grammars" (Birkhäuser Basel, 1975) by George Stiny. Applications of shape grammars were first considered in "Shape Grammars and their Uses" (Birkhäuser Basel, 1975) by James Gips.

A shape grammar consists of "shape rules" and a "generation engine" that selects and processes rules. A shape rule defines how an existing shape can be transformed. The generation engine then applies these rules to generate new shapes. This process is repeated until the desired shape is achieved.

In the context of 3D abstract models of clusters, shape grammars are used to generate the complex shapes and forms of the built environment. They allow designers to systematically create and manipulate these shapes, providing a powerful tool for exploring design options and testing design decisions.

The use of shape grammars in 3D abstract models is not without its challenges. As with any computational tool, there is a learning curve associated with using shape grammars. Designers must understand the principles and rules of shape grammars, as well as the specific software and tools used to implement them. However, with the right training and practice, shape grammars can be a powerful tool in the design of housing clusters.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the process of creating 3D abstract models of clusters, exploring the specific techniques and tools used in this process.





#### 5.1c Examples of 3D Abstract Models

In the previous section, we discussed the role of shape grammars in the creation of 3D abstract models of clusters. In this section, we will explore some examples of these models to better understand their applications and benefits.

##### Example 1: Housing Cluster in a Suburban Area

Consider a housing cluster located in a suburban area. The cluster is designed to accommodate a diverse population, with a mix of single-family homes, townhouses, and apartments. The design also incorporates green spaces and pedestrian-friendly pathways to promote a sense of community and encourage active living.

Using shape grammars, the designer can generate a variety of layouts for this cluster, each with its own unique characteristics. For example, one layout might prioritize privacy and space, with larger homes and larger green spaces. Another layout might prioritize community and walkability, with smaller homes and more interconnected pathways.

By using shape grammars, the designer can quickly explore these different layouts and make informed decisions about the final design. This not only saves time and effort, but also allows for a more creative and iterative design process.

##### Example 2: Mixed-Use Development in a Urban Area

In a bustling urban area, a mixed-use development is planned to cater to the needs of the local community. The development includes residential units, commercial spaces, and public amenities such as parks and community centers.

Using shape grammars, the designer can generate a variety of layouts for this development, each with its own unique mix of uses and forms. For example, one layout might prioritize pedestrian access and public spaces, with residential units and commercial spaces located on the ground floor and public amenities in the center. Another layout might prioritize vehicular access and private spaces, with residential units and commercial spaces located on higher floors and public amenities in the periphery.

By using shape grammars, the designer can quickly explore these different layouts and make informed decisions about the final design. This not only saves time and effort, but also allows for a more efficient and sustainable development.

##### Example 3: Adaptive Reuse of an Existing Building

In a historic district, an existing building is being considered for adaptive reuse as a mixed-use development. The building has a unique architectural style and is located in a prime location, making it a valuable asset for the community.

Using shape grammars, the designer can generate a variety of layouts for the building, each with its own unique mix of uses and forms. For example, one layout might prioritize preserving the historic character of the building, with residential units and commercial spaces located in the existing structure. Another layout might prioritize maximizing the building's potential, with additional floors and new facades added to accommodate more uses.

By using shape grammars, the designer can quickly explore these different layouts and make informed decisions about the final design. This not only saves time and effort, but also allows for a more sensitive and context-sensitive approach to adaptive reuse.

In conclusion, 3D abstract models of clusters are powerful tools for exploring and communicating design ideas. By using shape grammars and other computational design techniques, designers can quickly generate and evaluate a variety of layouts, leading to more creative, efficient, and sustainable designs. 





#### 5.2a Role of Shape Grammars in 3D Study

Shape grammars play a crucial role in the 3D study of clusters. They provide a systematic and structured approach to generating and analyzing complex 3D forms. This section will delve into the specifics of how shape grammars are used in the 3D study of clusters.

##### 5.2a.1 Generation of 3D Abstract Models

As discussed in the previous section, shape grammars are used to generate a variety of layouts for a given cluster. This is achieved through the use of shape rules, which define how an existing shape can be transformed. These rules are applied iteratively to generate a complex 3D form.

The generation process begins with a start rule, which defines the initial shape of the cluster. This could be a simple geometric shape, such as a cube or a sphere, or a more complex form derived from a higher-level shape rule.

The transformation rules then come into play. These rules define how the initial shape can be modified to create a new shape. This could involve adding or removing parts of the shape, changing its size or orientation, or introducing new elements. The transformation rules are applied in a systematic manner, with each rule being applied to the current shape until a termination rule is reached.

The termination rule signals the end of the generation process. This could be a rule that removes the marker, indicating that there are no more transformations to be applied. Alternatively, it could be a rule that generates a specific final shape, such as a completed housing cluster.

##### 5.2a.2 Analysis of 3D Abstract Models

Once the 3D abstract model has been generated, it can be analyzed to gain insights into the underlying design principles and patterns. This is achieved through the use of shape grammars, which provide a formal and systematic way of describing and analyzing complex 3D forms.

The shape rules can be used to identify the key design elements and their relationships. For example, a shape rule that adds a new element to the current shape can be used to identify the role of this element in the overall design. Similarly, a shape rule that transforms the current shape can be used to identify the underlying design principles that guide this transformation.

Furthermore, the shape grammars can be used to identify the underlying design principles and patterns that govern the generation of the 3D abstract model. This can be achieved through the use of shape inference, a technique that uses the shape rules to infer the underlying design principles and patterns from the generated 3D form.

In conclusion, shape grammars play a crucial role in the 3D study of clusters. They provide a systematic and structured approach to generating and analyzing complex 3D forms, and can be used to gain insights into the underlying design principles and patterns.

#### 5.2b Techniques for Using Shape Grammars in 3D Study

Shape grammars are a powerful tool in the 3D study of clusters. They allow us to systematically generate and analyze complex 3D forms, providing insights into the underlying design principles and patterns. In this section, we will explore some of the techniques for using shape grammars in the 3D study of clusters.

##### 5.2b.1 Parametric Shape Grammars

Parametric shape grammars are a variant of shape grammars that allow for the use of parameters in the shape rules. These parameters can be used to control the size, orientation, and other properties of the shapes generated by the grammar. This can be particularly useful in the 3D study of clusters, where we often want to explore how different design parameters affect the overall form of the cluster.

For example, consider a shape grammar for a housing cluster. The start rule might define a simple 3D form, such as a cube. The transformation rules might then include parameters for the size and orientation of the new shapes, allowing us to generate a variety of different cluster forms by varying these parameters. The termination rule might specify a maximum size for the cluster, ensuring that the generation process does not continue indefinitely.

##### 5.2b.2 Shape Inference

Shape inference is a technique for inferring the underlying design principles and patterns from a given 3D form. This can be achieved by analyzing the shape rules used in the generation of the form. By identifying the key design elements and their relationships, we can gain insights into the underlying design principles that guide the generation of the form.

For example, consider a 3D abstract model of a housing cluster generated using a shape grammar. By analyzing the shape rules used in the generation of this model, we can infer the key design elements and their relationships. This might include the use of modular units, the importance of spatial organization, or the role of symmetry in the design.

##### 5.2b.3 Shape Optimization

Shape optimization is a technique for optimizing the design of a 3D form based on a set of design objectives. This can be achieved by using shape grammars to generate a variety of different forms, and then selecting the form that best meets the design objectives.

For example, consider a housing cluster designed to maximize natural light. By using a shape grammar to generate a variety of different cluster forms, we can explore how different design parameters affect the amount of natural light entering the cluster. The form that maximizes natural light can then be selected as the optimal design.

In conclusion, shape grammars provide a powerful tool for the 3D study of clusters. By using techniques such as parametric shape grammars, shape inference, and shape optimization, we can gain insights into the underlying design principles and patterns, and optimize the design of complex 3D forms.

##### 5.2b.1 Generating 3D Abstract Models

As discussed in the previous section, shape grammars are used to generate a variety of layouts for a given cluster. This is achieved through the use of shape rules, which define how an existing shape can be transformed. These rules are applied iteratively to generate a complex 3D form.

The generation process begins with a start rule, which defines the initial shape of the cluster. This could be a simple geometric shape, such as a cube or a sphere, or a more complex form derived from a higher-level shape rule.

The transformation rules then come into play. These rules define how the initial shape can be modified to create a new shape. This could involve adding or removing parts of the shape, changing its size or orientation, or introducing new elements. The transformation rules are applied in a systematic manner, with each rule being applied to the current shape until a termination rule is reached.

The termination rule signals the end of the generation process. This could be a rule that removes the marker, indicating that there are no more transformations to be applied. Alternatively, it could be a rule that generates a specific final shape, such as a completed housing cluster.

##### 5.2b.2 Analyzing 3D Abstract Models

Once the 3D abstract model has been generated, it can be analyzed to gain insights into the underlying design principles and patterns. This is achieved through the use of shape grammars, which provide a formal and systematic way of describing and analyzing complex 3D forms.

The shape rules can be used to identify the key design elements and their relationships. For example, a shape rule that adds a new element to the cluster can be used to identify the role of this element in the overall design. Similarly, a shape rule that transforms an existing element can be used to understand how this element contributes to the overall form.

Furthermore, the shape grammars can be used to identify patterns in the generated 3D forms. These patterns can provide insights into the underlying design principles and can be used to guide the design of new clusters.

### Section: 6.2 Understanding Given Spatial Relations:

In the previous section, we introduced AutoGrammar and its applications in housing design. In this section, we will focus on understanding the given spatial relations in housing design.

#### 6.2a Understanding Spatial Relations

Spatial relations refer to the relationships between different elements in a spatial context. In housing design, these relations are crucial in understanding the layout and organization of a housing unit. By understanding these relations, we can better design and optimize the use of space in a housing unit.

One way to understand spatial relations is through the use of AutoGrammar. As mentioned earlier, AutoGrammar is a rule-based algorithm that uses a set of design rules to generate new designs. These design rules are derived from a given set of data, which can include previous designs, user preferences, and design constraints. By analyzing this data, AutoGrammar can identify patterns and relationships between different elements in a housing unit.

For example, let's say we have a housing unit with a living room, kitchen, and bedroom. By analyzing the layout and organization of these elements, AutoGrammar can identify the spatial relations between them. It may find that the living room is adjacent to the kitchen, and the bedroom is located on the other side of the living room. This information can then be used to generate new designs that maintain these spatial relations.

Another way to understand spatial relations is through the use of spatial calculus. Spatial calculus is a mathematical framework that allows us to describe and manipulate spatial relations. It is based on the concept of a spatial calculus, which is a set of rules for manipulating spatial relations. By using spatial calculus, we can formally define and analyze spatial relations in housing design.

For example, let's say we have a housing unit with a living room, kitchen, and bathroom. We can use spatial calculus to define the spatial relations between these elements. We can say that the living room is adjacent to the kitchen, and the bathroom is located on the other side of the living room. We can also use spatial calculus to manipulate these relations. For instance, we can say that the kitchen is to the left of the living room, and the bathroom is to the right of the living room.

By understanding spatial relations, we can better design and optimize the use of space in a housing unit. This is especially important in today's housing market, where space is at a premium and efficient use of space is crucial. By using computational tools like AutoGrammar and mathematical frameworks like spatial calculus, we can analyze and manipulate spatial relations to create more efficient and functional housing units.





### Section: 6.2 Understanding Given Spatial Relations:

In the previous section, we discussed the basics of AutoGrammar and how it can be used to understand spatial relations in housing design. In this section, we will delve deeper into understanding given spatial relations and how they can be applied in design.

#### 6.2b Applying Spatial Relations in Design

Once we have a better understanding of the spatial relations in a housing unit, we can use this information to inform our design decisions. By applying spatial relations in design, we can create more efficient and optimized housing units.

One way to apply spatial relations in design is through the use of AutoGrammar. As mentioned earlier, AutoGrammar uses a set of design rules to generate new designs. By incorporating the spatial relations identified by AutoGrammar, we can create designs that maintain these relations and optimize the use of space.

For example, if AutoGrammar identifies that the living room and kitchen are adjacent in a housing unit, we can use this information to create a more efficient layout. By keeping these two spaces adjacent, we can reduce the need for unnecessary movement and create a more functional living space.

Another way to apply spatial relations in design is through the use of spatial calculus. By formally defining and analyzing spatial relations, we can create designs that adhere to these relations and optimize the use of space.

For instance, if we have a housing unit with a living room, kitchen, and bathroom, we can use spatial calculus to determine the optimal placement of these spaces. By considering the spatial relations between these spaces, we can create a layout that maximizes the use of space and creates a more functional living environment.

In addition to these methods, we can also use computational design tools to apply spatial relations in design. These tools, such as Grasshopper and Dynamo, allow us to create complex and optimized designs by incorporating spatial relations and other design parameters.

By understanding and applying spatial relations in design, we can create more efficient and optimized housing units that meet the needs and preferences of residents. This is especially important in the context of computational design, where we can use algorithms and tools to create designs that adhere to specific spatial relations and optimize the use of space.

# Spatial–temporal reasoning

<technical|date=October 2012>
Spatial–temporal reasoning is an area of artificial intelligence which draws from the fields of computer science, cognitive science, and cognitive psychology. The theoretic goal—on the cognitive side—involves representing and reasoning spatial-temporal knowledge in mind. The applied goal—on the computing side—involves developing high-level control systems of automata for navigating and understanding time and space.

## Influence from cognitive psychology

A convergent result in cognitive psychology is that the connection relation is the first spatial relation that human babies acquire, followed by understanding orientation relations and distance relations. Internal relations among the three kinds of spatial relations can be computationally and systematically explained within the theory of cognitive prism as follows: (1) the connection relation is primitive; (2) an orientation relation is a distance comparison relation: you being in front of me can be interpreted as you are nearer to my front side than my other sides; (3) a distance relation is a connection relation using a third object: you being one meter away from me can be interpreted as a one meter long object connected with you and me simultaneously.

## Fragmentary representations of temporal calculi

Without addressing internal relations among spatial relations, AI researchers contributed many fragmentary representations. Examples of temporal calculi include Allen's interval algebra, and Vilain's & Kautz's point algebra. The most prominent spatial calculi are mereotopological calculi, Frank's cardinal direction calculus, Freksa's double cross calculus, Egenhofer and Franzosa's 4- and 9-intersection calculi, Ligozat's flip-flop calculus, various region connection calculi (RCC), and the Oriented Point Relation Algebra. Recently, spatio-temporal calculi have been designed that combine spatial and temporal information. For example, the spatiotemporal con

## VisualIDs, semanticons, and identicons

The mass availability of computer graphics supported the introduction of approaches
that make better use of the brain's "visual hardware", by providing
individual files and other abstract data with distinguishable appearance.
This idea initially appeared in strictly academic 
VisualIDs
and Semanticons
works, but the web community has explored and rapidly adopted similar ideas, such as the Identicon.

The VisualIDs project 
automatically generated icons for files or other data based 
on a hash of the data identifier, so the icons had no relation to the content or meaning of the data.
It was argued not only that generating meaningful icons is unnecessary (their user study showed rapid learning of the arbitrary icons), 
but also that basing icons on "content" is actually "incorrect" ("contrasting visualization with visual identifiers").

The Semanticons project
developed by Setlur et al. demonstrated an algorithm to create icons that reflect the content of files.
In this work the name, location and content of a file are parsed and used to retrieve
related image(s) from an image database. These are then processed using a Non-photorealistic rendering technique in order to generate graphical icons.

Developer Don Park introduced the identicon library for making a visual icon from a hash
of a data identifier. This initial public implementation has spawned a large number
of implementations for various environments. In particular, identicons are
now being used as default visual user identifiers (avatars) for several widely used systems. They are also used as a complement to Gravatars, which are pre-existing avatar images created or chosen by users, instead of automatically generated images.
