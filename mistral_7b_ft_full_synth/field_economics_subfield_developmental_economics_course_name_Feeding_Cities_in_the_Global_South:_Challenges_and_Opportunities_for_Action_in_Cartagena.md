# Title: Feeding Cities in the Global South: Challenges and Opportunities for Action in Cartagena":

## Foreward

As we delve into the complex and multifaceted issue of feeding cities in the Global South, it is crucial to acknowledge the role of urban agriculture in addressing food security. The concept of food security, as defined by the Community Food Security Coalition, is a fundamental aspect of this discussion. It encompasses the idea that all individuals within a community have access to culturally acceptable, nutritionally adequate food through local, non-emergency sources at all times.

The influx of the world population to urban areas has significantly increased the need for fresh and safe food. However, this has also led to challenges such as limited choices, often relying on highly processed fast food or convenience store foods that are high in calories and low in nutrients. This has brought about the concept of food justice, which serves as a bridge between scholarship and activism on sustainable agriculture, food insecurity, and environmental justice.

Urban agriculture, as a part of this larger discussion, plays a crucial role in addressing food insecurity, inaccessibility of fresh foods, and unjust practices on multiple levels of the food system. It is led by various actors, including food-insecure individuals, farm workers, educators and academics, policymakers, social movements, organizations, and marginalized people globally.

However, the issue of food security is accompanied by the related movements of food justice and food sovereignty. These movements incorporate urban agriculture in how they address food-resources of a community. Food sovereignty, in particular, is a concept that emphasizes the right of peoples and nations to define their own food and agriculture systems. It is a response to the failures of the current global food regime, which has led to the loss of biodiversity, the erosion of small-scale food producers, and the exploitation of natural resources.

In the context of Cartagena, a city in the Global South, the challenges and opportunities for action in urban agriculture are numerous. The city faces significant food security issues, but it also has the potential to leverage its unique geographical and cultural context to develop innovative and sustainable urban agriculture practices. This book aims to explore these challenges and opportunities, and to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of urban agriculture in feeding cities in the Global South.

As we embark on this journey, it is important to remember that urban agriculture is not just about producing food. It is also about creating spaces for community engagement, promoting healthy eating habits, and fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility among urban dwellers. It is about transforming our cities into places where food is not just a commodity, but a source of life, culture, and community.

Welcome to the exploration of urban agriculture in Cartagena. Let's delve into the challenges and opportunities, and work together to create a more sustainable and equitable food future for all.




### Section 1.1:  Introduction:

In the rapidly growing cities of the Global South, the challenge of providing food for the growing urban population is a pressing issue. This chapter serves as an introduction to the seminar on food provisioning in Global South cities, and aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges and opportunities that come with this task.

The Global South, also known as the developing world, is home to a significant portion of the world's population. As urbanization continues to accelerate in these regions, the demand for food is increasing at an unprecedented rate. However, the existing food systems in these cities are often ill-equipped to meet this demand, leading to a host of challenges that need to be addressed.

This chapter will delve into the various aspects of food provisioning in Global South cities, including the socio-economic, political, and environmental factors that influence it. We will also explore the current state of food provisioning in these cities, and the challenges that hinder the efficient and equitable distribution of food.

Moreover, this chapter will also highlight the opportunities that exist for improving food provisioning in these cities. From innovative agricultural practices to efficient food distribution systems, there are numerous opportunities for action that can be explored.

In the subsequent chapters, we will delve deeper into these topics, providing a more detailed analysis of the challenges and opportunities for action in food provisioning in Global South cities. This book aims to serve as a comprehensive guide for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners who are interested in addressing the challenges of food provisioning in these cities.




### Section 1.1a: Introduction to Food Markets

Food markets play a crucial role in the food provisioning system of any city, and this is particularly true in the Global South. These markets are the primary points of distribution for food, serving as the interface between food producers and consumers. They are also a reflection of the socio-economic conditions of the city, with different types of markets catering to different segments of the population.

In the Global South, food markets can be broadly categorized into two types: traditional markets and modern markets. Traditional markets, also known as informal markets, are typically small-scale, open-air markets where farmers and vendors sell their produce directly to consumers. These markets are often located in the outskirts of the city and are a source of livelihood for many rural farmers.

On the other hand, modern markets, also known as formal markets, are large, organized markets that operate under a set of rules and regulations. These markets are typically located in the urban centers and are characterized by a high degree of specialization and professionalism. They are often managed by private companies or government agencies, and they cater to the needs of the urban population.

The role of food markets in the Global South is multifaceted. They not only provide a platform for food producers to sell their produce, but they also play a crucial role in food security. In many cities, a significant portion of the population relies on these markets for their daily food needs. Therefore, any disruptions in these markets can have a profound impact on food security.

However, food markets in the Global South also face a host of challenges. These include issues related to quality and safety, lack of infrastructure, and competition from modern retail formats. These challenges not only affect the efficiency of these markets, but they also have implications for food security and nutrition.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the role of food markets in the Global South, exploring their challenges and opportunities in more detail. We will also examine the policies and interventions that can be used to address these challenges and improve the functioning of these markets.




### Subsection 1.1b: Role of Development Policy in Food Markets

Development policy plays a crucial role in shaping the food markets of the Global South. It is through these policies that governments can create an enabling environment for food producers and consumers, and address the challenges faced by food markets.

#### The Role of Development Policy in Traditional Markets

Traditional markets in the Global South are often characterized by a lack of formal infrastructure and regulations. This can lead to issues related to food safety and quality, as well as difficulties in accessing credit and other financial services for market vendors. Development policy can play a key role in addressing these issues.

For instance, governments can implement policies that provide incentives for vendors to improve food safety and quality. This could include training programs, subsidies for improved infrastructure, or regulations that require vendors to meet certain standards. Additionally, governments can also work with financial institutions to provide credit and other financial services to market vendors, thereby improving their livelihoods and the overall functioning of the market.

#### The Role of Development Policy in Modern Markets

Modern markets in the Global South often face challenges related to competition from modern retail formats, lack of infrastructure, and issues related to food safety and quality. Development policy can play a crucial role in addressing these challenges.

For instance, governments can implement policies that promote the development of modern retail formats, thereby creating a level playing field for all market actors. This could include policies that facilitate investment in modern retail infrastructure, or regulations that prevent anti-competitive practices. Additionally, governments can also work with food safety agencies to ensure that modern markets adhere to high standards of food safety and quality.

#### The Role of Development Policy in Food Security

Food security is a key concern in the Global South, and food markets play a crucial role in ensuring food security. Development policy can play a key role in addressing food security issues.

For instance, governments can implement policies that promote the production and consumption of locally produced foods. This could include policies that provide incentives for farmers to produce certain types of food, or regulations that require schools and other institutions to serve locally produced food. Additionally, governments can also work with food banks and other organizations to ensure that vulnerable populations have access to food.

In conclusion, development policy plays a crucial role in shaping the food markets of the Global South. By addressing the challenges faced by food markets and promoting food security, development policy can contribute to the overall development of cities in the Global South.




### Subsection 1.1c: Case Studies of Development Policies

In this section, we will explore some case studies of development policies in the Global South, focusing on their impact on food markets. These case studies will provide a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities faced by food markets in the Global South, and how development policies can address them.

#### Case Study 1: The Impact of Development Policy on Traditional Markets in India

In India, traditional markets are characterized by a lack of formal infrastructure and regulations. This has led to issues related to food safety and quality, as well as difficulties in accessing credit and other financial services for market vendors. However, the Indian government has implemented several development policies to address these issues.

One such policy is the National Food Safety and Standards Authority (NFSA), which was established in 2011 to ensure food safety and quality in the country. The NFSA has implemented regulations that require vendors to meet certain standards, such as maintaining clean and hygienic premises, and using safe and standardized packaging materials. These regulations have improved food safety and quality in traditional markets, thereby enhancing consumer trust and increasing market demand.

Another important policy is the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), which was launched in 2014 to provide access to formal banking services to the unbanked population in India. Under this policy, over 300 million bank accounts have been opened, providing market vendors with access to credit and other financial services. This has not only improved the livelihoods of market vendors, but also the overall functioning of traditional markets.

#### Case Study 2: The Impact of Development Policy on Modern Markets in Brazil

In Brazil, modern markets face challenges related to competition from modern retail formats, lack of infrastructure, and issues related to food safety and quality. To address these challenges, the Brazilian government has implemented several development policies.

One such policy is the Lei Orgânica da Economia (LOE), which was enacted in 2012 to promote the development of modern retail formats. The LOE provides incentives for investment in modern retail infrastructure, and also regulates anti-competitive practices. This has created a level playing field for all market actors, and has led to the development of modern retail formats in Brazil.

Another important policy is the Lei de Incentivo à Produção de Alimentos (LIPA), which was enacted in 2006 to promote the production of food in Brazil. The LIPA provides incentives for food producers, such as tax breaks and subsidies, to improve food safety and quality. This has not only improved the quality of food available in modern markets, but has also created job opportunities in the food sector.

These case studies highlight the crucial role of development policy in shaping food markets in the Global South. By addressing the challenges faced by food markets, development policy can create an enabling environment for food producers and consumers, and contribute to food security and nutrition in the region.

Urban agriculture, therefore, offers a viable solution to this pressing issue. 

This chapter will explore the various aspects of urban agriculture, including its potential to increase food production, improve food quality, and enhance the livelihoods of urban dwellers. It will also discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with urban agriculture, and how these can be addressed to maximize its potential. 

The chapter will also delve into the policy implications of urban agriculture, examining how urban agriculture can be integrated into urban planning and food policy. It will also discuss the role of various stakeholders, including governments, non-governmental organizations, and urban dwellers themselves, in promoting and supporting urban agriculture. 

In essence, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of urban agriculture in food provisioning in the Global South. It is hoped that this will inform policy and practice, contributing to the development of more sustainable and resilient food systems in urban areas.




### Subsection 1.2a Understanding Informality in Developing Countries

Informality is a pervasive phenomenon in developing countries, affecting various aspects of economic activity, including food provisioning. The informal economy is characterized by the absence of formal contracts or employment, and is often driven by the need to circumvent bureaucratic barriers and regulations. This section will explore the concept of informality in developing countries, its impact on economic development, and the challenges it presents for food provisioning.

#### The Nature of Informality

Informality in developing countries is often a response to the lack of formal opportunities and the perceived barriers to formal economic activity. This can include barriers to entry, high transaction costs, and a lack of access to credit and other financial services. As a result, many individuals and businesses operate in the informal sector, engaging in activities that are not formally recognized or regulated by the government.

The informal economy is characterized by a high degree of mobility and flexibility. Workers in the informal sector can easily shift between different activities and locations, adapting to changes in market conditions and consumer demand. This flexibility can be a key advantage in a rapidly changing economic environment, but it can also make it difficult to track and regulate informal economic activity.

#### The Impact of Informality on Economic Development

The informal economy plays a significant role in the economic development of developing countries. It is estimated that up to 60% of economic activity in some developing countries is informal, and this sector is often a major source of employment and income generation. However, the informal economy also presents significant challenges for economic development.

The informal economy is often characterized by low wages and poor working conditions. Workers in the informal sector are typically not covered by labor laws and regulations, and they often lack access to social protection programs. This can lead to high levels of poverty and inequality, as well as social and economic exclusion.

Moreover, the informal economy can also hinder economic growth and development. The lack of formal contracts and regulations can lead to inefficiencies and market distortions, making it difficult for businesses to operate and compete. This can limit investment and innovation, and can ultimately hold back economic development.

#### Challenges for Food Provisioning

The informal economy also presents significant challenges for food provisioning in developing countries. The informal sector is often a major source of food production and distribution, but it operates outside of formal regulations and standards. This can lead to issues related to food safety and quality, as well as difficulties in accessing credit and other financial services for food producers and vendors.

In addition, the mobility and flexibility of the informal economy can make it difficult to implement and enforce policies related to food provisioning. For example, efforts to improve food safety and quality standards can be undermined by the ability of informal food producers and vendors to easily shift to different activities or locations.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, informality plays a significant role in the economic development of developing countries, but it also presents significant challenges for food provisioning and economic growth. Understanding the nature of informality and its impact on economic development is crucial for developing effective policies and strategies to address these challenges.




### Subsection 1.2b Economic Development and Mobility

Economic development and mobility are closely intertwined, particularly in the context of developing countries. The concept of mobility, as discussed in the previous section, refers to the ability of individuals and businesses to move and adapt in response to economic opportunities and challenges. In the context of economic development, mobility can be a key driver of growth and progress.

#### The Role of Mobility in Economic Development

Mobility plays a crucial role in economic development by facilitating the efficient allocation of resources. As individuals and businesses move in response to economic opportunities, they can better match their skills and resources to the needs of the market. This can lead to increased productivity and economic growth.

Moreover, mobility can also help to alleviate regional disparities in economic development. By allowing labor and resources to move between regions, mobility can help to balance economic activity and reduce inefficiencies. This is particularly important in developing countries, where regional disparities can be significant.

#### The Impact of Mobility on Food Provisioning

The concept of mobility is particularly relevant to the challenge of food provisioning in developing countries. The food sector is characterized by a high degree of informality, with many food producers, vendors, and consumers operating in the informal economy. This makes the food sector particularly vulnerable to the challenges posed by informality, such as lack of access to formal markets and financial services.

However, mobility can also present opportunities for food provisioning. For example, the ability of food producers to move and adapt in response to market conditions can help to increase their productivity and improve their livelihoods. Similarly, the mobility of food consumers can help to increase their access to affordable and nutritious food options.

#### The Challenges of Mobility for Food Provisioning

Despite its potential benefits, mobility can also present significant challenges for food provisioning in developing countries. For example, the mobility of food producers can be hindered by barriers to market access, such as lack of transportation or high transaction costs. Similarly, the mobility of food consumers can be limited by factors such as poverty and lack of access to transportation.

Moreover, the mobility of food producers and consumers can also exacerbate existing inequalities. For example, the mobility of food producers can lead to the concentration of economic activity in certain regions, further widening regional disparities. Similarly, the mobility of food consumers can lead to the concentration of food consumption in urban areas, exacerbating urban food insecurity.

In conclusion, mobility plays a crucial role in economic development and food provisioning in developing countries. While it presents significant challenges, it also offers important opportunities for action. By addressing the barriers to mobility and promoting inclusive and sustainable mobility, we can help to improve food provisioning and contribute to economic development in the Global South.




### Subsection 1.2c Impact of Informality on Economic Development

Informality, as a concept, has a significant impact on economic development in the Global South. The informal economy, characterized by the absence of formal contracts or employment, is a dominant feature of many developing countries. This informality is often driven by a variety of factors, including the lack of formal job opportunities, the need for flexibility in work arrangements, and the desire to avoid government regulations and taxes.

#### The Role of Informality in Economic Development

Informality plays a complex role in economic development. On one hand, it can be seen as a barrier to development, as it often involves low wages, lack of job security, and limited access to social protections. This can trap individuals and communities in a cycle of poverty and hinder economic growth.

On the other hand, informality can also be seen as a driver of economic development. It allows for the creation of jobs and the generation of income, particularly in sectors such as agriculture, services, and manufacturing. Informal businesses can also play a crucial role in providing affordable goods and services to low-income households.

#### The Impact of Informality on Food Provisioning

The impact of informality on food provisioning is particularly significant in the Global South. The food sector is heavily reliant on informal activities, from small-scale farming and food vending to informal food markets. This informality can have both positive and negative implications for food provisioning.

On one hand, informality can facilitate food provisioning by allowing for the efficient allocation of resources. Informal food producers and vendors can adapt to changing market conditions and consumer preferences, helping to ensure the availability and affordability of food.

On the other hand, informality can also pose challenges to food provisioning. The lack of formal contracts and regulations can lead to insecurity and vulnerability for informal food producers and vendors. This can limit their ability to invest in their businesses and improve their livelihoods, ultimately hindering food provisioning.

#### The Role of Social Capital in Informal Economies

Social capital, as a form of social support and cooperation, can play a crucial role in mitigating the negative impacts of informality on economic development and food provisioning. As noted by Mwangi and Ouma (2012) and Sarker (2012), social capital can increase access to informal credit and financial inclusion, which can support the growth and sustainability of informal businesses.

However, the role of social capital in informal economies is complex and multifaceted. While it can provide important benefits, it can also reinforce existing inequalities and exclusions. For example, women, who often play a crucial role in the informal economy, may face barriers to accessing social capital due to gender-specific norms and constraints.

In conclusion, informality plays a significant role in economic development and food provisioning in the Global South. While it presents both challenges and opportunities, understanding and addressing the impact of informality is crucial for promoting sustainable and inclusive economic development.

### Conclusion

In this introductory chapter, we have set the stage for a comprehensive exploration of the challenges and opportunities for action in feeding cities in the Global South. We have highlighted the importance of understanding the unique context of each city, the role of various stakeholders, and the need for a multidisciplinary approach to address the complex issues surrounding food provisioning. 

The challenges are numerous and multifaceted, ranging from the physical constraints of urban spaces to the socio-economic inequalities that limit access to food. However, these challenges also present opportunities for innovative solutions and creative approaches to food provisioning. 

The action required is not just about addressing the immediate needs of the urban poor, but also about building resilience and sustainability into our food systems. This will require a shift from traditional approaches to food provisioning, and a commitment to long-term change. 

In the following chapters, we will delve deeper into these issues, exploring the specific challenges and opportunities in Cartagena, and examining the strategies and actions that can be taken to address them. We will also look at the role of various stakeholders, from government agencies to NGOs, in this process.

### Subsection 1.3a Defining Sustainable Food Systems

Sustainable food systems are a critical component of sustainable development. They are designed to provide healthy food to people while creating sustainable environmental, economic, and social systems that surround food. This includes the development of sustainable agricultural practices, the creation of more sustainable food distribution systems, the development of sustainable diets, and the reduction of food waste throughout the system.

#### The Importance of Sustainable Food Systems

Sustainable food systems are essential for addressing the causes of climate change and adapting to it. A 2020 review conducted for the European Union found that up to 37% of global greenhouse gas emissions could be attributed to the food system, including crop and livestock production, transportation, changing land use (including deforestation), and food loss and waste. Reduction of meat production, which accounts for ~60% of greenhouse gas emissions and ~75% of agriculturally used land, is one major component of this change.

The global food system is facing major interconnected challenges, including mitigating food insecurity, effects from climate change, biodiversity loss, malnutrition, inequity, soil degradation, pest outbreaks, water and energy scarcity, economic and political crises, natural resource depletion, and preventable ill-health. Addressing these challenges requires a shift towards sustainable food systems.

#### Defining Sustainable Food Systems

There are many different definitions of a sustainable food system. From a global perspective, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations describes a sustainable food system as follows:

> "A sustainable food system is one that delivers food and agricultural products to meet the needs of the current population without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."

The American Public Health Association (APHA) defines a sustainable food system as:

> "A sustainable food system is one that provides safe, nutritious, and culturally appropriate food to all people within the context of natural resource constraints and environmental sustainability."

The European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program defines a sustainable food system as:

> "A sustainable food system is one that ensures food security and nutrition for all in a socially, economically and environmentally sustainable manner."

These definitions highlight the multifaceted nature of sustainable food systems and the importance of considering various factors, including environmental, economic, social, and health aspects.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of sustainable food systems and explore how they can be implemented in urban areas of the Global South.

### Subsection 1.3b Role of Sustainable Food Systems in Urban Areas

Sustainable food systems play a crucial role in urban areas, particularly in the Global South. The urbanization of these regions has led to a significant increase in food demand, which has put pressure on the existing food systems. The role of sustainable food systems in urban areas is multifaceted and includes addressing food security, reducing environmental impact, promoting economic development, and improving public health.

#### Addressing Food Security

Food security is a major challenge in urban areas of the Global South. The rapid urbanization and population growth have led to a surge in food demand, which has outpaced the growth in food production. This has resulted in food insecurity, characterized by limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe food. Sustainable food systems can help address this challenge by promoting efficient food production and distribution systems, reducing food waste, and promoting sustainable diets.

#### Reducing Environmental Impact

The food system is a significant contributor to environmental degradation. The production, distribution, and consumption of food account for a significant portion of global greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and water use. Sustainable food systems can help reduce this environmental impact by promoting sustainable agricultural practices, reducing food waste, and promoting sustainable diets. For instance, shifting towards more plant-based diets can significantly reduce the environmental impact of the food system.

#### Promoting Economic Development

The food sector is a major contributor to the economy in urban areas. It provides employment opportunities and contributes to the local economy. Sustainable food systems can promote economic development by creating jobs in the food sector, particularly in areas such as sustainable agriculture, food processing, and food distribution. This can help alleviate poverty and improve the economic well-being of urban populations.

#### Improving Public Health

The food system has a direct impact on public health. Unhealthy diets, characterized by high consumption of processed foods and low consumption of fruits and vegetables, are a major contributor to non-communicable diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Sustainable food systems can help improve public health by promoting the consumption of healthy and nutritious foods, reducing the availability of unhealthy foods, and promoting sustainable diets.

In conclusion, sustainable food systems play a crucial role in urban areas of the Global South. They can help address food security, reduce environmental impact, promote economic development, and improve public health. However, achieving sustainable food systems in these areas requires concerted efforts from all stakeholders, including governments, food producers, consumers, and civil society organizations.

### Subsection 1.3c Challenges of Implementing Sustainable Food Systems

Implementing sustainable food systems in urban areas of the Global South is not without its challenges. These challenges can be broadly categorized into three areas: institutional, economic, and social.

#### Institutional Challenges

Institutional challenges to implementing sustainable food systems include the lack of supportive policies and regulations, weak institutional capacity, and corruption. In many urban areas of the Global South, the institutional framework for food systems is often fragmented and lacks coordination. This can hinder the implementation of sustainable food systems, which require a holistic and integrated approach. Additionally, weak institutional capacity can limit the ability of local governments and organizations to effectively manage and regulate the food system. Corruption can also pose a significant challenge, as it can undermine the effectiveness of policies and programs aimed at promoting sustainable food systems.

#### Economic Challenges

Economic challenges to implementing sustainable food systems include the high cost of sustainable practices, limited access to finance, and the dominance of large-scale food producers. The adoption of sustainable practices, such as organic farming or precision agriculture, can be costly for small-scale food producers. This can be a barrier for many farmers in the Global South, who often operate on limited resources. Limited access to finance can also hinder the adoption of sustainable practices. Furthermore, the dominance of large-scale food producers can limit the ability of small-scale producers to participate in the food system. This can exacerbate inequalities and limit the potential benefits of sustainable food systems.

#### Social Challenges

Social challenges to implementing sustainable food systems include cultural preferences, social norms, and power imbalances. Cultural preferences and social norms can influence food consumption patterns and dietary behaviors, which can impact the adoption of sustainable diets. Power imbalances can also limit the ability of marginalized groups, such as women and indigenous communities, to participate in the food system. This can exacerbate social inequalities and limit the potential benefits of sustainable food systems.

Despite these challenges, there are many examples of successful implementation of sustainable food systems in urban areas of the Global South. These examples demonstrate the potential for sustainable food systems to address the multifaceted challenges of food provisioning in these areas. However, it is important to recognize and address the challenges to ensure that the benefits of sustainable food systems are equitably distributed and that the potential negative impacts are minimized.

## Chapter: The Role of Urban Agriculture in Food Provisioning

### Introduction

Urban agriculture, a practice that has been prevalent for centuries, has gained significant attention in recent years as a potential solution to the challenges of food provisioning in the global south. This chapter delves into the role of urban agriculture in food provisioning, exploring its potential to address the complex issues of food security, nutrition, and sustainability in urban environments.

The global south, characterized by rapid urbanization and increasing food insecurity, faces unique challenges in food provisioning. Urban agriculture, by virtue of its proximity to urban populations, has the potential to address these challenges. It can provide fresh, nutritious food to urban dwellers, reduce food costs, create employment opportunities, and contribute to the sustainability of urban environments.

However, the role of urban agriculture in food provisioning is not without its challenges. These include issues related to land tenure, water and resource management, and the integration of urban agriculture into urban planning and policy. This chapter will explore these challenges and discuss potential strategies to overcome them.

Through a comprehensive study of urban agriculture in the global south, this chapter aims to provide a deeper understanding of its potential and limitations in food provisioning. It will also highlight the importance of integrating urban agriculture into urban planning and policy, and the role of various stakeholders in achieving this.

As we navigate through the complexities of urban agriculture and food provisioning, this chapter aims to provide a balanced perspective, highlighting the potential of urban agriculture while also acknowledging its limitations and challenges. It is our hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for policymakers, researchers, and urban dwellers alike, in their quest for sustainable and equitable food provisioning in the global south.




### Subsection 1.3b Role of Urban Areas in Sustainable Food Systems

Urban areas play a crucial role in sustainable food systems. As the world's population continues to grow and more people move to cities, the demand for food in urban areas is increasing. This presents both challenges and opportunities for sustainable food provisioning.

#### The Challenges of Sustainable Food Provisioning in Urban Areas

The rapid urbanization of the Global South has led to a number of challenges in food provisioning. These include:

- **Increased Food Demand:** As more people move to cities, the demand for food in urban areas is increasing. This puts pressure on the existing food supply systems, which may not be equipped to handle the increased demand.

- **Food Insecurity:** Rapid urbanization can lead to food insecurity, particularly among the urban poor. As land becomes more expensive in cities, it becomes difficult for low-income residents to afford food. This can lead to malnutrition and other health issues.

- **Environmental Impact:** Urban areas are often characterized by high levels of pollution and waste generation. This can have a significant impact on the environment and the sustainability of food systems. For example, the production and disposal of plastic packaging, which is often used in food distribution, can contribute to pollution and harm ecosystems.

- **Social and Economic Inequalities:** Urban areas often have high levels of social and economic inequalities. This can lead to unequal access to food, with the urban poor often facing the greatest challenges in accessing nutritious and affordable food.

#### The Opportunities for Sustainable Food Provisioning in Urban Areas

Despite these challenges, urban areas also present opportunities for sustainable food provisioning. These include:

- **Urban Agriculture:** Urban agriculture, which involves the cultivation of crops and raising of animals within the city, can help to increase food production and reduce the environmental impact of food systems. Urban agriculture can also contribute to food security by providing affordable and nutritious food options for urban residents.

- **Food Waste Reduction:** Urban areas often have high levels of food waste, which can be reduced through initiatives such as food waste reduction programs and the use of technology to track and reduce food waste. This can help to reduce the environmental impact of food systems and contribute to food security by ensuring that more food is available for consumption.

- **Community-Based Food Systems:** Community-based food systems, such as farmers' markets and community-supported agriculture, can help to increase access to fresh, nutritious food for urban residents. These systems can also help to build community resilience and reduce social and economic inequalities.

- **Policy and Advocacy:** Policies and advocacy efforts can play a crucial role in promoting sustainable food systems in urban areas. This can include policies that support urban agriculture, reduce food waste, and promote equitable access to food. Advocacy efforts can also help to raise awareness about the importance of sustainable food systems and mobilize action towards this goal.

In conclusion, urban areas play a crucial role in sustainable food systems. While they present challenges, they also offer opportunities for action that can help to ensure the availability, accessibility, and adequacy of food for all urban residents.

### Section: 2.1 Contradictions of Food Marketing in Developing Cities:

#### 2.1a Understanding Food Marketing in Developing Cities

Food marketing in developing cities is a complex and multifaceted issue. It is influenced by a variety of factors, including economic, social, cultural, and political factors. These factors interact in complex ways to create a unique food marketing landscape in each city. 

In developing cities, food marketing is often characterized by a mix of traditional and modern practices. Traditional food marketing practices, such as street vendors and local markets, are often the primary sources of food for the urban poor. These practices are often informal and operate outside of formal regulatory frameworks. 

On the other hand, modern food marketing practices, such as supermarkets and food delivery services, are becoming increasingly prevalent in developing cities. These practices are often formal and operate within regulatory frameworks. However, they are also often inaccessible to the urban poor due to factors such as cost and location.

The coexistence of traditional and modern food marketing practices in developing cities creates a number of contradictions. For example, while modern food marketing practices can provide access to a wider range of food options and potentially healthier food choices, they can also exacerbate food insecurity and malnutrition among the urban poor. This is because these practices often operate in ways that exclude the urban poor, who are already struggling to meet their basic food needs.

Furthermore, the modernization of food markets in developing cities can also lead to the displacement of traditional food marketing practices. This can have significant implications for the livelihoods of those who rely on these practices for their income, as well as for the cultural and social significance of these practices.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the contradictions of food marketing in developing cities, exploring the various factors that contribute to these contradictions and the potential implications for food security and nutrition in these cities.

#### 2.1b Challenges of Food Marketing in Developing Cities

The challenges of food marketing in developing cities are multifaceted and complex. They are shaped by a variety of factors, including economic, social, cultural, and political factors. These factors interact in complex ways to create a unique set of challenges for each city.

One of the primary challenges of food marketing in developing cities is the issue of food insecurity. As discussed in the previous section, the urban poor often struggle to meet their basic food needs due to factors such as cost and location. This is particularly true in the context of modern food marketing practices, which can be inaccessible to the urban poor. 

Food insecurity is a significant challenge in developing cities. It is characterized by limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe food. This is often due to factors such as low income, high food prices, and limited access to food. Food insecurity can have serious implications for the health and well-being of individuals and communities. It can lead to malnutrition, stunting, and other health issues.

Another challenge of food marketing in developing cities is the issue of food safety. As food markets modernize, there is a growing concern about the safety of the food supply. This is particularly true in the context of imported food, which can be difficult to regulate and monitor. The lack of proper regulations and enforcement can lead to the sale of unsafe food, which can have serious health implications for consumers.

The modernization of food markets in developing cities can also lead to the displacement of traditional food marketing practices. This can have significant implications for the livelihoods of those who rely on these practices for their income, as well as for the cultural and social significance of these practices. 

In the next section, we will explore some of the strategies that have been proposed to address these challenges and improve food marketing in developing cities.

#### 2.1c Strategies for Addressing Contradictions in Food Marketing

Addressing the contradictions in food marketing in developing cities requires a multifaceted approach that takes into account the complex interplay of economic, social, cultural, and political factors. Here are some strategies that can be employed:

1. **Promoting Inclusive Food Marketing Practices:** To address the issue of food insecurity, efforts should be made to promote inclusive food marketing practices. This could involve initiatives such as setting up food hubs or food cooperatives that provide affordable and accessible food options for the urban poor. It could also involve policies that promote the location of supermarkets and other modern food outlets in low-income areas.

2. **Strengthening Food Safety Regulations:** To address the issue of food safety, efforts should be made to strengthen food safety regulations and enforcement. This could involve initiatives such as setting up food safety inspection units, conducting regular food safety audits, and providing training for food handlers. It could also involve policies that promote the use of local food products, which are often easier to regulate and monitor.

3. **Supporting Traditional Food Marketing Practices:** To address the issue of the displacement of traditional food marketing practices, efforts should be made to support these practices. This could involve initiatives such as providing financial support for traditional food vendors, promoting traditional food products, and integrating traditional food marketing practices into modern food marketing systems.

4. **Promoting Nutrition Education:** To address the issue of malnutrition, efforts should be made to promote nutrition education. This could involve initiatives such as setting up nutrition education programs in schools and communities, and promoting the consumption of nutritious foods through marketing and promotional activities.

5. **Engaging in Policy Advocacy:** To address the systemic issues that contribute to the contradictions in food marketing, efforts should be made to engage in policy advocacy. This could involve initiatives such as advocating for policies that promote food security, food safety, and nutrition, and advocating for the rights of food vendors and other food sector workers.

In the next section, we will explore some of the initiatives that have been implemented in Cartagena to address these contradictions and improve food marketing.




### Section: 2.1 Contradictions of Food Marketing in Developing Cities:

#### 2.1b Identifying Contradictions in Food Marketing

The contradictions in food marketing in developing cities are multifaceted and complex. They are often rooted in the interplay between traditional and modern food marketing practices, as well as the economic, social, cultural, and political factors that influence these practices. 

One of the most significant contradictions is the coexistence of traditional and modern food marketing practices. Traditional practices, such as street vendors and local markets, are often the primary sources of food for the urban poor. These practices are often informal and operate outside of formal regulatory frameworks. However, they are also often characterized by low productivity, limited access to technology and inputs, and vulnerability to external shocks.

On the other hand, modern food marketing practices, such as supermarkets and food delivery services, are becoming increasingly prevalent in developing cities. These practices are often formal and operate within regulatory frameworks. However, they are also often inaccessible to the urban poor due to factors such as cost and location. This creates a situation where the urban poor are often excluded from the benefits of modern food marketing practices, despite the fact that these practices can potentially provide access to a wider range of food options and potentially healthier food choices.

Another contradiction is the potential for modern food marketing practices to exacerbate food insecurity and malnutrition among the urban poor. This is because these practices often operate in ways that exclude the urban poor, who are already struggling to meet their basic food needs. This can lead to a situation where the urban poor are forced to rely on traditional food marketing practices, which may not always provide access to nutritious and safe food options.

The modernization of food markets in developing cities can also lead to the displacement of traditional food marketing practices. This can have significant implications for the livelihoods of those who rely on these practices for their income, as well as for the cultural and social significance of these practices. This creates a situation where traditional food marketing practices are often caught between the pressures of modernization and the need to maintain their cultural and social significance.

In the next section, we will explore some of the strategies that can be used to address these contradictions and promote more inclusive and sustainable food marketing practices in developing cities.

### Section: 2.1 Contradictions of Food Marketing in Developing Cities:

#### 2.1c Case Studies of Food Marketing Contradictions

To further illustrate the contradictions in food marketing in developing cities, let's examine some case studies.

#### Case Study 1: Supermarkets in Nairobi, Kenya

Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, is home to a growing middle class and a burgeoning supermarket sector. Supermarkets like Nakumatt and Uchumi have become symbols of modernity and middle-class status. However, these supermarkets are often located in affluent areas, making them inaccessible to the urban poor. This creates a situation where the urban poor are excluded from the benefits of modern food marketing practices, despite the fact that these practices can potentially provide access to a wider range of food options and potentially healthier food choices.

#### Case Study 2: Street Vendors in Mumbai, India

Mumbai, India's largest city, is home to a vast informal sector, including street vendors who provide a vital source of food for the urban poor. However, these vendors often operate in the shadows, without access to formal regulatory frameworks. This makes them vulnerable to eviction and other forms of harassment by local authorities. This creates a situation where the urban poor are often excluded from the benefits of modern food marketing practices, despite the fact that these practices can potentially provide access to a wider range of food options and potentially healthier food choices.

#### Case Study 3: Food Delivery Services in Cartagena, Colombia

Cartagena, a major city in Colombia, has seen the rise of food delivery services like Uber Eats and Rappi. These services provide convenient access to a wide range of food options, but they often cater to the urban middle class. This creates a situation where the urban poor are excluded from the benefits of modern food marketing practices, despite the fact that these practices can potentially provide access to a wider range of food options and potentially healthier food choices.

These case studies highlight the contradictions in food marketing in developing cities. They show that while modern food marketing practices can potentially provide access to a wider range of food options and potentially healthier food choices, they often exclude the urban poor, who are already struggling to meet their basic food needs. This creates a situation where the urban poor are often excluded from the benefits of modern food marketing practices, despite the fact that these practices can potentially provide access to a wider range of food options and potentially healthier food choices.




### Section: 2.2 Developing Policy to Improve Food Supply:

#### 2.2a Importance of Policy in Food Supply

Policy plays a crucial role in shaping the food supply chain in any city, particularly in the Global South. It is the backbone of food market modernization, providing a framework for the operation of markets and the distribution of food. Policy decisions can influence the availability, accessibility, and quality of food, thereby impacting food security and nutrition.

Policy is also instrumental in addressing the contradictions and challenges in food marketing in developing cities. For instance, policies can be implemented to ensure that supermarkets and other modern food retailers are located in areas accessible to the urban poor. This can be achieved through zoning regulations or incentives for supermarkets to set up in underserved areas. Similarly, policies can be put in place to protect street vendors and other informal food providers, ensuring their rights and safety.

Moreover, policy can play a key role in promoting sustainable and resilient food systems. For example, policies can be designed to encourage the production and consumption of locally grown food, thereby reducing the environmental impact of food transportation and promoting food sovereignty. Policies can also be used to promote sustainable farming practices, such as organic farming and agroecology, which can enhance the resilience of food systems to climate change and other shocks.

However, developing effective policy for food supply is not without its challenges. It requires a deep understanding of the local context, including the socio-economic conditions of the urban poor, the dynamics of the food market, and the environmental and climatic conditions of the city.

### Section: 3.2 Role of Urban Planning in Addressing Food Security:

Urban planning plays a crucial role in addressing food security in the Global South. It provides a framework for organizing and managing the physical aspects of cities, including land use, transportation, and infrastructure, to ensure the efficient and equitable provision of food. This section will explore the role of urban planning in addressing food security, with a focus on the concept of food sovereignty.

#### 3.2a Defining Food Security

Food security is a complex concept that encompasses the availability, access, and utilization of food. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defines food security as existing when "all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life". 

The four qualifications that must be met for a food secure system include physical availability, economic and physical access, appropriate utilization, and stability of the prior three elements over time. 

However, achieving food security is a significant challenge in the Global South, where about 2 billion people are food insecure. As the global population grows to 9 billion by 2050, and as diets shift to emphasize higher energy products and greater overall consumption, food systems will be subjected to even greater pressure. Climate change presents additional threats to food security, affecting crop yields, distribution of pests and diseases, weather patterns, and growing seasons around the world.

#### 3.2b The Role of Urban Planning in Addressing Food Security

Urban planning plays a crucial role in addressing food security in the Global South. It provides a framework for organizing and managing the physical aspects of cities, including land use, transportation, and infrastructure, to ensure the efficient and equitable provision of food. 

One of the key roles of urban planning in addressing food security is through the concept of food sovereignty. Food sovereignty is a concept that emphasizes the right of peoples, communities, and nations to define their own food and agriculture systems. It is a response to the failures of the current global food system, which has led to widespread food insecurity and malnutrition, particularly in the Global South. 

Food sovereignty is based on the principles of social justice, human rights, and ecological sustainability. It recognizes that food is a fundamental human right and that everyone should have access to safe, nutritious, and culturally appropriate food. It also acknowledges the importance of local and regional food systems, which can help to reduce the environmental impacts of food production and distribution.

Urban planning can support food sovereignty by promoting policies and practices that prioritize local food production, reduce food waste, and ensure equitable access to food. This can include zoning regulations that promote urban agriculture, public markets that support small-scale producers, and transportation systems that prioritize the delivery of fresh, local food.

In addition, urban planning can also play a role in addressing the impacts of climate change on food security. By incorporating climate change considerations into urban planning, cities can adapt to changing weather patterns and reduce their vulnerability to food system disruptions. This can include strategies such as green infrastructure, which can help to mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events, and urban heat island mitigation, which can help to reduce the impacts of heat waves on food production and distribution.

In conclusion, urban planning plays a crucial role in addressing food security in the Global South. By promoting food sovereignty and adapting to the impacts of climate change, urban planning can help to ensure that all people have access to safe, nutritious, and culturally appropriate food.

#### 3.2c Case Studies of Urban Planning in Food Security

To further illustrate the role of urban planning in addressing food security, let's examine some case studies from the Global South.

##### Case Study 1: The City of Bogotá, Colombia

The City of Bogotá, Colombia, has implemented a comprehensive urban planning strategy to address food security. The city has established a network of urban farms, known as "fincas urbanas," which occupy abandoned or underutilized land in urban areas. These farms not only provide fresh produce for local communities, but also create jobs and contribute to the local economy.

In addition, Bogotá has implemented a public market system that prioritizes small-scale producers, ensuring equitable access to food for all residents. The city has also established a network of community kitchens, which provide affordable, nutritious meals for low-income residents.

### Section: 3.3 Approaches to Integrating Food Systems in Urban Planning:

#### 3.3b Different Approaches to Integration

There are several approaches to integrating food systems in urban planning, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. These approaches can be broadly categorized into three types: vertical integration, star integration, and horizontal integration.

##### Vertical Integration

Vertical integration is a method of systems integration where subsystems are integrated according to their functionality by creating functional entities, often referred to as silos. The benefit of this method is that it allows for quick integration and involves only the necessary vendors, making it cheaper in the short term. However, the cost-of-ownership can be substantially higher in the long term, as new or enhanced functionality can only be implemented by adding another silo. This method does not allow for the reuse of subsystems to create new functionality.

##### Star Integration

Star integration, also known as spaghetti integration, is a process of systems integration where each system is interconnected to each of the remaining subsystems. This method is often more expensive due to the interfaces that subsystems are exporting. In cases where the subsystems are exporting heterogeneous or proprietary interfaces, the integration cost can substantially rise. Additionally, the time and costs needed to integrate the systems increase exponentially when adding additional subsystems. However, this method provides extreme flexibility in the reuse of functionality.

##### Horizontal Integration or Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)

Horizontal integration or Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) is an integration method in which a specialized subsystem is dedicated to communication between other subsystems. This allows for cutting the number of connections (interfaces) to only one per subsystem, which will connect directly to the ESB. The ESB is capable of translating the interface into another interface, allowing for cutting the costs of integration and providing extreme flexibility.

Each of these approaches has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of approach will depend on the specific context and objectives of the urban planning process. It is important for urban planners to understand these approaches and their implications in order to effectively integrate food systems into urban planning.

#### 3.3c Case Studies of Integration in Urban Planning

To further illustrate the different approaches to integrating food systems in urban planning, let's examine some case studies from the Global South.

##### Case Study 1: Vertical Integration in Cartagena, Colombia

In Cartagena, Colombia, the city government has implemented a vertical integration approach to integrating food systems into urban planning. The city has created functional entities, or silos, for different aspects of the food system, such as food production, distribution, and consumption. This approach has allowed for quick integration and has been cheaper in the short term. However, the cost-of-ownership has been higher in the long term, as new or enhanced functionality can only be implemented by adding another silo. This approach has not allowed for the reuse of subsystems to create new functionality.

##### Case Study 2: Star Integration in Durban, South Africa

In Durban, South Africa, the city government has implemented a star integration approach to integrating food systems into urban planning. Each system is interconnected to each of the remaining subsystems, creating a star-like structure. This approach has been more expensive due to the interfaces that subsystems are exporting. In cases where the subsystems are exporting heterogeneous or proprietary interfaces, the integration cost has substantially risen. The time and costs needed to integrate the systems have increased exponentially when adding additional subsystems. However, this approach has provided extreme flexibility in the reuse of functionality.

##### Case Study 3: Horizontal Integration or Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) in Mumbai, India

In Mumbai, India, the city government has implemented a horizontal integration approach to integrating food systems into urban planning. A specialized subsystem, known as an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), has been dedicated to communication between other subsystems. This approach has allowed for cutting the number of connections (interfaces) to only one per subsystem, which has connected directly to the ESB. The ESB is capable of translating the interface into another interface, allowing for cutting the costs of integration and providing extreme flexibility.

These case studies demonstrate the different approaches to integrating food systems in urban planning and their respective strengths and weaknesses. It is important for urban planners to carefully consider the context and objectives of their city when choosing an approach to integration.

### Section: 4.1 Best Practices Report on Market Efficiency Cases:

#### 4.1a Understanding Market Efficiency

Market efficiency is a crucial concept in the field of economics, particularly in the context of food systems. It refers to the ability of a market to allocate resources in the most efficient manner, ensuring that the right goods are produced and distributed to the right people at the right time. In the context of feeding cities in the Global South, understanding market efficiency is essential for identifying the most effective strategies for addressing food insecurity and malnutrition.

There are three levels of market efficiency, as defined by economist Eugene Fama: weak-form, semi-strong, and strong-form. Weak-form efficiency refers to a market where prices instantly and fully reflect all information about the past prices of securities. This means that future price movements cannot be predicted by using past prices, as past data on stock prices is of no use in predicting future stock price changes. Semi-strong efficiency, on the other hand, refers to a market where asset prices fully reflect all publicly available information. This means that only investors with additional inside information could have an advantage in the market. Any price anomalies are quickly found out and the stock market adjusts. Strong-form efficiency is the highest level of market efficiency, where asset prices fully reflect all of the public and inside information available. Therefore, no one can have an advantage in the market in predicting prices, as there is no data that would provide any additional value to the investors.

The efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) is another important concept related to market efficiency. It states that in any given time, the prices on the market already reflect all known information, and also change fast to reflect new information. This means that no one could outperform the market by using the same information that is already available to all investors, except through luck.

The random walk theory, created by Louis Bachelier, is also related to market efficiency. It states that prices in the financial markets evolve randomly. This means that identifying trends or patterns of price changes in a market can be a futile exercise, as these changes are purely random.

In the next section, we will explore some case studies that demonstrate the application of these concepts in the context of feeding cities in the Global South.

#### 4.1b Case Studies of Market Efficiency

In this section, we will delve into some case studies that demonstrate the application of market efficiency concepts in the context of feeding cities in the Global South. These case studies will provide a practical understanding of how market efficiency can be achieved in different scenarios, and the implications for food systems.

##### Case Study 1: Market Efficiency in Cartagena, Colombia

Cartagena, a major port city in Colombia, has been facing significant challenges in its food system due to rapid urbanization and population growth. However, the city has been able to achieve a certain level of market efficiency, particularly in the seafood market. The city's seafood market is known for its efficiency in allocating resources, with prices instantly reflecting changes in supply and demand. This is largely due to the strong-form efficiency of the market, where all information, including inside information, is quickly reflected in prices. This has helped to ensure that the right seafood is produced and distributed to the right people at the right time, contributing to food security in the city.

##### Case Study 2: Market Efficiency in Nairobi, Kenya

In contrast to Cartagena, Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya, has been struggling with market inefficiency in its food system. The city's food market is characterized by weak-form efficiency, where prices do not fully reflect all information about the past prices of securities. This has led to price anomalies and inefficiencies in the allocation of resources. However, the city has been making efforts to improve market efficiency, particularly through the use of technology. For instance, the Kenyan government has been implementing online computation of market equilibrium, as presented by Gao, Peysakhovich, and Kroer. This has helped to improve the efficiency of the market, particularly in terms of price discovery and allocation of resources.

##### Case Study 3: Market Efficiency in Mumbai, India

Mumbai, one of the largest cities in India, has been facing significant challenges in its food system due to rapid urbanization and population growth. However, the city has been able to achieve a certain level of market efficiency, particularly in the dairy market. The city's dairy market is known for its semi-strong efficiency, where asset prices fully reflect all publicly available information. This has helped to ensure that the right dairy products are produced and distributed to the right people at the right time, contributing to food security in the city.

These case studies highlight the importance of market efficiency in addressing food insecurity and malnutrition in the Global South. They also underscore the role of various factors, including technology, in achieving market efficiency. In the next section, we will explore the implications of these case studies for planning and field work agenda and preparation in the context of feeding cities in the Global South.

#### 4.1c Lessons Learned from Market Efficiency Cases

The case studies of market efficiency in Cartagena, Nairobi, and Mumbai provide valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities for achieving market efficiency in the Global South. These insights can be used to inform planning and field work agenda and preparation in the context of feeding cities in the Global South.

##### Lesson 1: The Role of Technology

The case of Nairobi highlights the potential of technology in improving market efficiency. The implementation of online computation of market equilibrium, as presented by Gao, Peysakhovich, and Kroer, has helped to improve the efficiency of the market, particularly in terms of price discovery and allocation of resources. This suggests that technology can play a crucial role in addressing market inefficiency in the Global South. However, it is important to note that the success of such initiatives depends on the availability of reliable data and the capacity of market actors to use technology effectively.

##### Lesson 2: The Importance of Information

The case of Cartagena underscores the importance of information in achieving market efficiency. The strong-form efficiency of the city's seafood market, where all information, including inside information, is quickly reflected in prices, has contributed to the efficient allocation of resources. This suggests that efforts to improve market efficiency should focus on enhancing the availability and dissemination of information. This can be achieved through various means, including data collection and analysis, market surveillance, and capacity building.

##### Lesson 3: The Role of Policy and Regulation

The case of Mumbai suggests that policy and regulation can play a crucial role in promoting market efficiency. The semi-strong efficiency of the city's dairy market, where asset prices fully reflect all publicly available information, has helped to ensure that the right dairy products are produced and distributed to the right people at the right time. This suggests that policy and regulation can help to create an environment conducive to market efficiency. However, it is important to ensure that such policies and regulations do not create barriers to market entry or limit competition.

In conclusion, the case studies of market efficiency in the Global South provide valuable lessons for planning and field work agenda and preparation. These lessons underscore the importance of technology, information, and policy and regulation in achieving market efficiency. They also highlight the need for a holistic approach that combines these elements to address the challenges of market inefficiency in the Global South.

### Section: 5.3 Engaging with Stakeholders for Knowledge Exchange and Collaboration:

#### 5.3a Understanding Stakeholder Engagement

Stakeholder engagement is a crucial aspect of any project, especially one as complex and multifaceted as feeding cities in the Global South. It involves the active involvement of individuals or groups who may be affected by the decisions made or have the potential to influence the implementation of those decisions. This can include community members, government officials, NGOs, and private sector entities.

The benefits of stakeholder engagement are numerous. It can help to align business practices or knowledge production with societal needs and expectations, driving long-term sustainability and shareholder value. It can also help organizations to compete in an increasingly complex and ever-changing business environment, while at the same time bringing about systemic change towards sustainable development.

In the context of corporate social responsibility (CSR), stakeholder engagement is a key part of achieving the triple bottom line. Companies engage their stakeholders in dialogue to find out what social and environmental issues matter most to them and involve stakeholders in the decision-making process. This is particularly important in the Global South, where the challenges and opportunities for action are often complex and interconnected.

Stakeholder engagement is used by mature organizations in the private and public sector, especially when they want to develop understanding and agreement around solutions for complex issues and large projects. An underlying principle of stakeholder engagement is that stakeholders have the chance to influence the decision-making process. This is differentiated from communication, which is a one-way process.

In the context of feeding cities in the Global South, knowledge exchange and collaboration are crucial for addressing the complex challenges and opportunities that exist. This section will explore some techniques that can be used for knowledge exchange and collaboration, with a focus on the use of the Multimedia Web Ontology Language (MOWL) and the Semantic Web.

##### MOWL and the Semantic Web

The Multimedia Web Ontology Language (MOWL) is an extension of the Web Ontology Language (OWL) that is used for representing knowledge in a structured and machine-readable format. MOWL is particularly useful for knowledge exchange and collaboration as it allows for the representation of complex relationships and concepts in a clear and standardized way.

The Semantic Web, on the other hand, is a vision for the future of the World Wide Web where information is structured and linked in a way that computers can easily understand and use. The Semantic Web is built on top of the existing Web and aims to enhance the usability and usefulness of the Web by creating semantic web services. These services could be useful for public search engines, knowledge management within an organization, or business applications.

##### Standards for the Semantic Web

Standardization for the Semantic Web is under the care of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The W3C has developed a number of standards for the Semantic Web, including the Semantic Web Stack, which illustrates the architecture of the Semantic Web. The collection, structuring, and recovery of linked data are enabled by technologies that provide a formal description of concepts, terms, and relationships within a given knowledge domain. These technologies are specified as W3C standards and include:

- Resource Description Framework (RDF)
- RDF Schema (RDFS)
- Web Ontology Language (OWL)
- Semantic Sensor Web (SSW)
- Rule Interchange Format (RIF)
- Web Ontology Language for Rules (WRL)
- Web Services Description Language (WSDL)
- Web Services Policy Language (WS-Policy)
- Web Services Choreography Description Language (WS-CDL)
- Web Services Business Process Execution Language (WS-BPEL)

##### Current State of Standardization

While many of these standards are well-established, there are still some that are not yet fully realized. For example, the W3C is currently working on standardizing the use of conditional probabilities in OWL. This is an area of active research and is crucial for the development of more advanced Semantic Web applications.

In the next section, we will explore some practical examples of how these techniques can be used for knowledge exchange and collaboration in the context of feeding cities in the Global South.

#### 5.3c Case Studies of Knowledge Exchange and Collaboration

In this section, we will explore some case studies that illustrate the application of knowledge exchange and collaboration techniques in the context of feeding cities in the Global South. These case studies will provide practical examples of how the techniques discussed in the previous section can be used to address the challenges and opportunities that exist in this domain.

To address these challenges, MOWL and the Semantic Web have been used to represent the city's agricultural sector in a structured and machine-readable format. This has allowed for the creation of a knowledge base that captures the city's agricultural resources, practices, and market information. This knowledge base can be used to support a range of agricultural activities, including farm planning, market analysis, and risk management.

##### Case Study 3: MOWL and the Semantic Web in Waste Management

In the city of Mumbai, India, MOWL and the Semantic Web have been used to address the challenge of managing the city's waste. The city has a large and growing population, which generates a significant amount of waste. However, the city's waste management system is not equipped to handle this volume of waste, leading to environmental pollution and health risks.

To address these challenges, MOWL and the Semantic Web have been used to represent the city's waste management system in a structured and machine-readable format. This has allowed for the creation of a knowledge base that captures the city's waste generation, collection, and disposal processes. This knowledge base can be used to support a range of waste management activities, including waste reduction, recycling, and disposal.

These case studies illustrate the potential of MOWL and the Semantic Web for addressing the challenges and opportunities that exist in the context of feeding cities in the Global South. By providing a standardized and machine-readable format for representing knowledge, these techniques can support a range of activities, from urban planning to agricultural production to waste management.

### Subsection: 6.1b Impact of Urbanization on Food Security

Urbanization has had a profound impact on food security in the Global South. As more and more people move to cities, the demand for food increases, putting pressure on already limited resources. This has led to a range of challenges for food security, including issues of access, availability, and affordability.

#### Impact of Urbanization on Food Availability

Urbanization has both positive and negative impacts on food availability. On one hand, urbanization can increase food availability by expanding the economic base of the city through production, processing, packaging, and marketing of consumable products. This results in an increase in entrepreneurial activities and the creation of jobs, as well as reducing food costs and improving quality. Urban agriculture, in particular, plays a crucial role in making food more affordable and in providing emergency supplies of food. Research has shown that urban gardens can have a median yield value of between approximately $200 and $500 (US, adjusted for inflation), contributing to the food security of urban dwellers (Bullen et al., 2005).

On the other hand, urbanization can also lead to food insecurity by putting pressure on already limited resources. As more people move to cities, the demand for food increases, leading to inflation and making food less affordable for the urban poor. This is particularly problematic in the Global South, where many urban dwellers already struggle to afford adequate food.

#### Impact of Urbanization on Food Access

Urbanization can also impact food access. As more people move to cities, there is an increased demand for food, leading to changes in food distribution systems. This can result in unequal access to food, with the urban poor often facing the greatest challenges in accessing affordable and nutritious food. Urban agriculture can help address this issue by providing a local source of food, reducing the cost of transportation and making food more accessible to urban dwellers.

#### Impact of Urbanization on Food Affordability

Urbanization can also impact food affordability. As more people move to cities, the demand for food increases, leading to inflation and making food less affordable for the urban poor. This is particularly problematic in the Global South, where many urban dwellers already struggle to afford adequate food. Urban agriculture can help address this issue by reducing the cost of food production and making food more affordable for urban dwellers.

In conclusion, urbanization has had a significant impact on food security in the Global South. While it has brought about opportunities for food production and distribution, it has also exacerbated challenges such as food insecurity and affordability. As we continue to urbanize, it is crucial to address these issues and find ways to ensure that all urban dwellers have access to affordable and nutritious food.

### Subsection: 6.1c Case Studies of Urbanization and Food Security

To further understand the impact of urbanization on food security, let's examine some case studies from the Global South.

#### Case Study 1: Cartagena, Colombia

Cartagena, a major port city in Colombia, has experienced significant urbanization in recent years. The city's population has grown from 800,000 in 1993 to over 1.2 million in 2018 (World Bank, 2018). This rapid urbanization has put pressure on the city's food resources, leading to food insecurity for many of its residents.

Despite the city's rich agricultural history, the expansion of urban areas has led to the loss of agricultural land. This has reduced the availability of locally grown food, making it more difficult for urban dwellers to access affordable and nutritious food. The city's food distribution system has also been affected, with the urban poor often facing the greatest challenges in accessing food.

However, urban agriculture has played a crucial role in addressing food insecurity in Cartagena. The city has a long tradition of urban agriculture, with many residents growing their own food in small gardens and on rooftops. This has not only helped to reduce food costs but has also provided a source of employment and income for urban dwellers.

#### Case Study 2: Nairobi, Kenya

Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, is another example of a city facing significant challenges in food security due to urbanization. The city's population has grown rapidly in recent years, from 1.9 million in 1999 to over 4.3 million in 2019 (World Bank, 2019). This rapid urbanization has put pressure on the city's food resources, leading to food insecurity for many of its residents.

The city's food distribution system has been affected by urbanization, with the urban poor often facing the greatest challenges in accessing food. The expansion of urban areas has also led to the loss of agricultural land, reducing the availability of locally grown food.

However, urban agriculture has played a crucial role in addressing food insecurity in Nairobi. The city has a vibrant urban agriculture sector, with many residents growing their own food in small gardens and on rooftops. This has not only helped to reduce food costs but has also provided a source of employment and income for urban dwellers.

These case studies highlight the complex and multifaceted impact of urbanization on food security in the Global South. While urbanization can bring about economic opportunities and improve food availability, it can also exacerbate food insecurity for the urban poor. Urban agriculture plays a crucial role in addressing these challenges, but it is not a panacea. A comprehensive approach is needed that includes policy interventions, investment in infrastructure, and support for urban agriculture.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the urbanization of cities in the Global South has brought about significant challenges and opportunities for food security. The rapid growth of urban populations has put immense pressure on the already limited food resources, leading to food insecurity for many urban dwellers. However, urbanization has also opened up opportunities for innovative solutions to address food security issues. Urban agriculture, for instance, has proven to be a viable solution in many cities, providing fresh produce for urban dwellers while also creating employment opportunities. 

Moreover, the concept of food sovereignty, which emphasizes the right of cities to determine their own food policies, has gained traction in the Global South. This approach recognizes the importance of local context and community involvement in addressing food security issues. 

However, it is important to note that addressing food security in urban areas of the Global South requires a multi-faceted approach. It involves not only increasing food production and distribution, but also addressing the underlying social, economic, and political factors that contribute to food insecurity.

## Chapter 7: Climate Change and Urbanization

### Introduction

The intersection of climate change and urbanization in the Global South presents a complex and pressing issue. As urban populations continue to grow, the impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly evident, exacerbating existing challenges and creating new ones. This chapter will delve into the intricate relationship between these two phenomena, exploring how they interact to shape the food systems of cities in the Global South.

Climate change, characterized by rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and more frequent and severe natural disasters, has profound implications for urban food systems. It affects every stage of the food chain, from production and distribution to consumption and waste management. Urbanization, on the other hand, brings about its own set of challenges and opportunities for food systems. As more people move to cities, the demand for food increases, putting pressure on already strained resources. However, urbanization also presents opportunities for innovation and efficiency in food systems.

In this chapter, we will explore these issues in depth, examining the ways in which climate change and urbanization interact to shape food systems in the Global South. We will also discuss potential strategies for mitigating the impacts of climate change and urbanization on food systems, and for building resilience in the face of these challenges.

As we navigate through this complex and critical topic, it is important to keep in mind the unique context of the Global South. The challenges and opportunities presented by climate change and urbanization are shaped by a variety of factors, including cultural norms, socio-economic conditions, and political structures. Understanding these factors is crucial for developing effective and sustainable solutions.




### Subsection: 6.2a Understanding Urban Agriculture

Urban agriculture is a crucial aspect of food security in cities, particularly in the Global South where rapid urbanization has put pressure on food resources. It is the practice of cultivating, processing, and distributing food in or around urban areas. This includes activities such as growing fresh produce, raising animals, and composting. Urban agriculture is not only a means of producing food, but also a way to improve the quality of life in cities.

#### 6.2a.1 Benefits of Urban Agriculture

Urban agriculture offers numerous benefits, both for individuals and for the city as a whole. For individuals, it provides access to fresh, nutritious food, which can be particularly important for the urban poor who may face challenges in accessing affordable and healthy food options. Urban agriculture also provides employment and income opportunities, particularly for women who often play a key role in food production.

For the city as a whole, urban agriculture can help to reduce food costs and improve food security. By producing food locally, urban agriculture reduces the need for food to be transported from distant locations, which can be costly and contribute to carbon emissions. Urban agriculture also helps to preserve agricultural land, as it allows food to be produced in urban areas where land may otherwise be underutilized or abandoned.

#### 6.2a.2 Challenges of Urban Agriculture

Despite its many benefits, urban agriculture also faces several challenges. One of the main challenges is the lack of space in urban areas. As cities continue to grow and expand, available land for urban agriculture decreases. This can make it difficult for urban farmers to find suitable locations for their activities.

Another challenge is the potential for negative impacts on the environment. Urban agriculture can lead to soil degradation, water pollution, and increased pest pressure if not managed properly. This is particularly true in intensive urban agriculture systems, where high levels of fertilizers and pesticides may be used.

#### 6.2a.3 Urban Agriculture and Food Security

Urban agriculture plays a crucial role in addressing food security in cities. By producing food locally, urban agriculture helps to ensure that urban dwellers have access to fresh, nutritious food. It also helps to reduce food costs and improve food security for the urban poor.

However, urban agriculture alone cannot solve the complex challenges of food security in cities. It must be integrated with other strategies, such as urban planning and policy, to ensure that urban agriculture is sustainable and equitable. This includes addressing issues such as land tenure, access to resources, and the potential for negative environmental impacts.

In the next section, we will explore some of the strategies and initiatives that are being implemented in cities around the world to promote sustainable and equitable urban agriculture.




### Subsection: 6.2b Role of Urban Agriculture in Food Security

Urban agriculture plays a crucial role in addressing food security in cities, particularly in the Global South. As urban populations continue to grow, the demand for food increases, putting pressure on food resources. Urban agriculture helps to meet this demand by providing a local source of fresh, nutritious food.

#### 6.2b.1 Urban Agriculture and Food Availability

Urban agriculture contributes to food availability, particularly of fresh produce, in urban areas. This is particularly important in the Global South, where access to fresh, nutritious food can be limited. By producing food locally, urban agriculture reduces the need for food to be transported from distant locations, making it more accessible to urban dwellers.

#### 6.2b.2 Urban Agriculture and Employment

Urban agriculture also provides employment and income opportunities, particularly for women who often play a key role in food production. This can help to alleviate urban poverty and improve food security. By creating jobs and providing income, urban agriculture can help to reduce chronic and emergency food insecurity.

#### 6.2b.3 Urban Agriculture and Social Well-being

In addition to its economic benefits, urban agriculture can also have a positive impact on the social and emotional well-being of individuals. Urban gardens can facilitate positive social interaction, leading to improved community health and overall well-being. Urban agriculture also helps to build community participation and pride, which can have a positive impact on the overall quality of life in urban areas.

#### 6.2b.4 Urban Agriculture and Environmental Sustainability

While urban agriculture can face challenges in terms of space and environmental impact, it also offers opportunities for environmental sustainability. By producing food locally, urban agriculture can reduce the environmental impact of food transportation. It can also help to preserve agricultural land, as it allows food to be produced in urban areas where land may otherwise be underutilized or abandoned. With proper management, urban agriculture can contribute to a more sustainable and resilient food system in cities.





### Subsection: 6.2c Case Studies of Urban Agriculture and Food Security

In this section, we will explore some case studies of urban agriculture and food security in the Global South. These case studies will provide real-world examples of the challenges and opportunities faced by urban agriculture initiatives, and how they have been addressed.

#### 6.2c.1 Collingwood Children's Farm, Melbourne, Australia

The Collingwood Children's Farm in Melbourne, Australia, is a community-based farming project that has been operating since 1978. The farm is located on 3.5 hectares of land and is managed by a non-profit organization. The farm is open to the public and provides educational programs for children and adults.

The Collingwood Children's Farm is a prime example of urban agriculture in action. The farm not only provides fresh produce for the local community but also serves as an educational resource for children and adults. The farm's educational programs focus on sustainable farming practices and food security, helping to raise awareness about the importance of urban agriculture.

#### 6.2c.2 South Central Farm, Los Angeles, USA

The South Central Farm in Los Angeles, USA, was a community garden project that operated from 1992 to 2006. The farm was located on a 14-acre site and was managed by a non-profit organization. The farm was home to over 300 individual plots, each tended by a different gardener.

The South Central Farm was a successful example of urban agriculture in a densely populated urban area. The farm not only provided fresh produce for the local community but also served as a source of employment and income for the gardeners. The farm also played a crucial role in building community cohesion and pride, as it was a shared space for all members of the community.

#### 6.2c.3 P-Patch Gardens, Seattle, USA

The P-Patch Gardens in Seattle, USA, are a network of community gardens operated by the City of Seattle. The gardens are located on vacant city-owned land and are managed by a non-profit organization. The gardens are open to the public and provide educational programs for children and adults.

The P-Patch Gardens are a great example of how urban agriculture can be integrated into the city's infrastructure. The gardens not only provide fresh produce for the local community but also serve as a source of employment and income for the gardeners. The gardens also play a crucial role in building community cohesion and pride, as they are a shared space for all members of the community.

#### 6.2c.4 Food Roof Farm, St. Louis, USA

The Food Roof Farm in St. Louis, USA, is a rooftop farm located on an abandoned industrial building. The farm is managed by a non-profit organization and is open to the public. The farm produces a variety of vegetables and herbs, which are sold at local farmers' markets.

The Food Roof Farm is a unique example of urban agriculture in action. The farm not only provides fresh produce for the local community but also serves as a model for sustainable urban development. By repurposing an abandoned building into a productive space, the Food Roof Farm demonstrates the potential for urban agriculture to revitalize urban areas.

#### 6.2c.5 Continuous Productive Landscapes, Various Locations

The concept of continuous productive landscapes (CPL) is a global initiative that aims to transform urban landscapes into productive spaces. CPL projects have been implemented in various locations around the world, including the Global South.

CPL projects involve the cultivation of vacant urban land and the creation of temporary or permanent kitchen gardens. These projects not only provide fresh produce for the local community but also serve as a source of employment and income for urban dwellers. CPL projects also play a crucial role in building community cohesion and pride, as they are a shared space for all members of the community.

In conclusion, these case studies demonstrate the diverse ways in which urban agriculture can be implemented in the Global South. Each project has its own unique challenges and opportunities, but they all share the common goal of improving food security in urban areas. By learning from these examples, we can continue to develop innovative and sustainable solutions for urban agriculture in the Global South.





### Subsection: 6.3a Importance of Policy Interventions

Policy interventions play a crucial role in addressing the challenges of urban food security in the Global South. As discussed in the previous section, the top-down approach is often used in policy implementation, where high-level policymakers set objectives and define implementation strategies. However, the success of these interventions depends on the commitment and capacity of policy implementers, who may include teachers, police officers, social workers, or private sector workers.

One example of a policy intervention is the National Maximum Speed Law passed by the US Congress in 1973. The policy objective was to reduce gasoline consumption, and one of the side effects was a reduction in freeway fatalities. This policy intervention demonstrates the potential of policy interventions to address multiple challenges simultaneously.

In the context of urban food security, policy interventions can take various forms, including regulations, incentives, and public education campaigns. For instance, policies can be implemented to regulate the prices of food items, incentivize farmers to produce more food, or educate the public about the importance of healthy eating habits.

However, the effectiveness of policy interventions depends on several factors, including the appropriateness of the chosen policy instrument, the capacity of policy implementers, and the ability of the policy to adapt to changing circumstances. Therefore, it is essential for policymakers to employ instrumental policy learning, which involves learning about the effectiveness of various policy instruments and their implementations.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the different types of policy instruments that can be used to address urban food security challenges.




### Subsection: 6.3b Steps to Develop Effective Policy Interventions

Developing effective policy interventions for urban food security in the Global South requires a systematic approach that considers the unique challenges and opportunities of the region. Here are some steps that can guide policymakers in developing effective policy interventions:

#### 1. Identify the Problem

The first step in developing any policy intervention is to clearly identify the problem. In the context of urban food security, this could involve understanding the root causes of food insecurity, such as income inequality, lack of access to affordable food, or inadequate food production. This step requires a deep understanding of the local context, including social, economic, and political factors.

#### 2. Set Objectives and Strategies

Once the problem has been identified, policymakers can set objectives and strategies for the policy intervention. These objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). The strategies should outline how these objectives will be achieved, including the use of policy instruments.

#### 3. Select Policy Instruments

As discussed in the previous section, policymakers can choose from a variety of policy instruments to address urban food security challenges. These could include regulations, incentives, or public education campaigns. The choice of policy instrument should be based on the objectives and strategies set in step 2, as well as the local context and available resources.

#### 4. Implement the Policy

The next step is to implement the policy. This involves putting the policy instruments into action and ensuring that they are being effectively implemented. This may require training and support for policy implementers, as well as ongoing monitoring and evaluation to assess the effectiveness of the policy.

#### 5. Evaluate and Adapt

Finally, policymakers should regularly evaluate the policy intervention to assess its effectiveness. This could involve collecting and analyzing data on key indicators, such as food security levels or changes in food prices. Based on this evaluation, policymakers can adapt the policy to address any issues or challenges that arise.

By following these steps, policymakers can develop effective policy interventions for urban food security in the Global South. However, it is important to note that policy interventions are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Each city and region will have its own unique challenges and opportunities, and policymakers should be prepared to adapt and adjust their interventions as needed.




### Subsection: 6.3c Case Studies of Successful Policy Interventions

In this section, we will explore some case studies of successful policy interventions for urban food security in the Global South. These case studies will provide real-world examples of how policymakers have effectively addressed the challenges of urban food security and improved food security outcomes for their communities.

#### 6.3c.1 Case Study 1: The Communities That Care (CTC) System in the United States

The Communities That Care (CTC) system is a community-based prevention system that aims to prevent youth problem behaviors and promote positive youth development. The system is based on the principles of social learning theory and social ecology theory, and it provides a framework for communities to implement evidence-based prevention programs.

The CTC system has been evaluated in a large-scale randomized controlled trial, the Communities That Care Youth Development Study (CYDS). The CYDS found that CTC communities achieved high implementation fidelity at the system and program levels when supported by training and technical assistance in CTC. This resulted in significant improvements in key leader adoption of science-based prevention, community norms against adolescent drug use, and funding for prevention. These improvements were sustained one year after the implementation phase of the trial ended.

#### 6.3c.2 Case Study 2: The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) Urban Food Security and Nutrition Programme

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has been working to improve urban food security and nutrition in the Global South through its Urban Food Security and Nutrition Programme. The programme aims to strengthen the capacity of urban populations to access and utilize food, and to reduce the prevalence of food insecurity and malnutrition.

The programme has been implemented in several cities in the Global South, including Nairobi, Kenya, and Porto Alegre, Brazil. In these cities, the programme has worked with local governments, community organizations, and other stakeholders to implement a range of interventions, including school feeding programs, community gardens, and food distribution schemes. These interventions have resulted in significant improvements in food security and nutrition outcomes for urban populations.

#### 6.3c.3 Case Study 3: The City of Curitiba's Urban Agriculture Programme

The City of Curitiba in Brazil has been a leader in urban agriculture and food security. The city has implemented a comprehensive urban agriculture program that aims to increase food production, improve food security, and promote sustainable urban development.

The program has been successful in increasing food production in the city, with urban agriculture contributing up to 20% of the city's food supply. It has also improved food security for low-income residents, particularly those living in informal settlements. The program has also contributed to the city's efforts to reduce waste and promote sustainable urban development.

These case studies demonstrate the potential of policy interventions to address urban food security challenges in the Global South. They highlight the importance of a systematic approach, including identifying the problem, setting objectives and strategies, selecting policy instruments, implementing the policy, and evaluating and adapting. They also underscore the importance of community engagement and participation, as well as the need for ongoing monitoring and evaluation.




### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the complex relationship between food security and urbanization in the Global South. We have seen how rapid urbanization has led to increased food insecurity in many cities, as well as the challenges and opportunities that this presents for action.

One of the key challenges is the need for sustainable and equitable food systems in urban areas. As more people move to cities, the demand for food increases, putting pressure on already strained resources. This can lead to food insecurity, particularly for marginalized and vulnerable populations. Additionally, urbanization can also exacerbate existing food insecurity issues, such as food waste and loss.

However, there are also opportunities for action in addressing food security and urbanization. One of these is the potential for urban agriculture, which can provide fresh and nutritious food for urban populations while also creating jobs and reducing food waste. Another opportunity is the use of technology and innovation, such as mobile apps and blockchain, to improve food distribution and reduce food loss.

It is clear that addressing food security and urbanization in the Global South requires a multifaceted approach. It is not just about increasing food production or reducing food waste, but also about creating sustainable and equitable food systems that meet the needs of all urban populations. This will require collaboration and action from various stakeholders, including governments, NGOs, and the private sector.

# Title: Feeding Cities in the Global South: Challenges and Opportunities for Action in Cartagena

## Chapter 7: Urbanization and Food Security




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the complex and intricate world of food supply chains in the Global South. The Global South, also known as the developing world, is home to a vast majority of the world's population and is facing a unique set of challenges and opportunities when it comes to food supply chains. 

The Global South is characterized by a diverse range of socio-economic, political, and environmental conditions, which have a profound impact on the functioning of food supply chains. These chains are the backbone of the food system, connecting producers, processors, distributors, and consumers. They are responsible for the production, processing, storage, and distribution of food, and play a crucial role in ensuring food security.

However, the food supply chains in the Global South are often characterized by inefficiencies, lack of infrastructure, and limited access to technology. These challenges are exacerbated by the rapid urbanization and population growth in the region, which puts additional pressure on the already strained food supply chains. 

In this chapter, we will explore the various aspects of food supply chains in the Global South, including the challenges they face and the opportunities for improvement. We will also discuss the role of different stakeholders, such as governments, businesses, and civil society, in shaping these chains. 

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the complexities of food supply chains in the Global South and the potential for action to improve their functioning. This knowledge will be crucial for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners working towards ensuring food security in the Global South.




### Section: 7.1 Understanding Food Supply Chains:

Food supply chains are complex systems that involve a series of interconnected activities and actors. They are responsible for the production, processing, storage, and distribution of food, and play a crucial role in ensuring food security. In this section, we will delve into the basics of food supply chains, exploring their structure, components, and the role they play in the food system.

#### 7.1a Basics of Food Supply Chains

Food supply chains can be broadly categorized into three main stages: production, processing, and distribution. Each of these stages involves a series of activities and actors, and is characterized by a high degree of complexity and interdependence.

##### Production

The production stage is where food is grown or raised. This includes farming, livestock production, and aquaculture. The production stage is characterized by a high degree of diversity, with a wide range of crops and livestock being produced. The production stage is also where many of the environmental impacts of food production occur, such as the use of fertilizers and pesticides, and the conversion of natural habitats into agricultural land.

##### Processing

The processing stage is where food is transformed from its raw state into a form that is suitable for consumption. This includes activities such as milling, canning, and packaging. The processing stage is where many of the nutritional and safety aspects of food are determined. For example, processing can improve the nutritional value of food by removing anti-nutrients, or it can reduce the safety of food by introducing contaminants.

##### Distribution

The distribution stage is where food is moved from the production and processing stages to the consumption stage. This includes activities such as transportation, storage, and retail. The distribution stage is where many of the economic aspects of food supply chains occur, such as pricing and marketing.

Food supply chains are not linear, but rather complex networks that involve multiple stages and actors. For example, a single food item may pass through multiple stages and actors before reaching the consumer. This complexity can create challenges for managing food supply chains, but it also creates opportunities for innovation and improvement.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into each of these stages, exploring their challenges and opportunities in more detail. We will also explore the role of different actors in food supply chains, and the strategies they use to manage the complexity and uncertainty of these systems.

#### 7.1b Challenges in Food Supply Chains

Food supply chains in the Global South face a unique set of challenges that are often exacerbated by the socio-economic, political, and environmental conditions of these regions. These challenges can be broadly categorized into three main areas: infrastructure, technology, and governance.

##### Infrastructure

The infrastructure of food supply chains in the Global South is often inadequate, leading to significant losses in food production and distribution. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), post-harvest losses in developing countries can be as high as 40% for fruits and vegetables, and 20% for cereals[^1^]. These losses are primarily due to a lack of adequate storage facilities, transportation systems, and market infrastructure. For instance, in many rural areas, farmers often lack access to reliable transportation services, making it difficult for them to bring their produce to market. Similarly, many small-scale producers lack access to formal markets, forcing them to sell their produce at low prices to middlemen who often exploit them[^2^].

##### Technology

The use of technology in food supply chains in the Global South is often limited, particularly in the areas of food processing and distribution. This is due to a lack of access to modern technology, as well as a lack of training and education in its use. For example, many small-scale producers in the Global South still use traditional farming methods, which can limit their productivity and income[^3^]. Similarly, many food processing facilities in the Global South lack access to modern processing technologies, which can limit the quality and safety of the food they produce[^4^].

##### Governance

The governance of food supply chains in the Global South is often characterized by a lack of transparency and accountability. This can lead to a lack of trust between different actors in the food supply chain, as well as a lack of incentives for investment and innovation. For instance, many small-scale producers in the Global South lack access to formal contracts or legal protections, making them vulnerable to exploitation by larger actors in the food supply chain[^5^]. Similarly, many food processing facilities in the Global South lack access to formal credit or insurance, making them vulnerable to financial risks[^6^].

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into each of these challenges, exploring their causes and potential solutions.

### Subsection: 8.1a Defining Food Waste

Food waste is a complex issue that encompasses a wide range of activities and behaviors. It is defined as the loss or disposal of food that is safe and nutritious for human consumption. This includes food that is discarded during production, processing, transportation, retail, and consumption. Food waste can occur at any stage of the food supply chain, from farm to fork.

Food waste is a global problem, but it is particularly prevalent in the Global South, where urban populations are growing rapidly and food systems are often under-resourced and fragmented. In these contexts, food waste is not only a waste of resources but also a significant contributor to environmental degradation and social inequality.

Food waste can be categorized into three main types: pre-consumer, consumer, and post-consumer waste. Pre-consumer waste occurs during the production, processing, and distribution of food. Consumer waste refers to food that is discarded by households after purchase. Post-consumer waste is food that is discarded after it has been consumed.

The extent of food waste in the Global South is difficult to quantify due to the lack of comprehensive data. However, it is estimated that between 30 and 50 percent of all food produced in these regions is wasted. This represents a significant loss of resources, including land, water, energy, and labor.

Food waste also has significant environmental impacts. It contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, as decomposing food in landfills generates methane, a potent greenhouse gas. It also leads to the overuse of resources, as food producers often overproduce to account for expected waste.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the causes of food waste in the Global South and explore potential solutions to address this issue.




#### 8.1b Impact of Food Waste on Sustainability

Food waste has a profound impact on sustainability, particularly in the Global South where resources are often scarce and the environmental and social impacts of waste are more pronounced. The environmental impact of food waste is significant, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and resource depletion. The social impact is equally significant, as food waste exacerbates food insecurity and contributes to economic losses.

#### Environmental Impact

Food waste contributes to environmental degradation in several ways. The production of food involves the use of resources such as land, water, and energy. When food is wasted, these resources are also wasted, leading to resource depletion. Furthermore, food waste that ends up in landfills decomposes anaerobically, generating methane, a potent greenhouse gas. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), food waste accounts for about 8 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.

In addition to greenhouse gas emissions, food waste also contributes to other environmental issues. For instance, the overproduction of food to account for expected waste leads to overuse of resources. This can result in soil degradation, water pollution, and energy waste. Moreover, the disposal of food waste in landfills can lead to leaching of nutrients into the groundwater, causing environmental pollution.

#### Social Impact

Food waste also has significant social impacts. In the Global South, where food insecurity is prevalent, food waste exacerbates the problem. The food that is wasted could have been used to feed the hungry. According to the FAO, about one third of the food wasted in the Global South could be spared and sent to those in need. This would not only reduce food insecurity but also contribute to poverty reduction.

Moreover, food waste contributes to economic losses. The cost of producing, processing, and distributing food that is eventually wasted is a significant economic loss. In the Global South, where resources are often scarce, these losses can have a significant impact on the economy.

#### Sustainability Challenges

The impact of food waste on sustainability presents significant challenges. The need to reduce food waste is not only about saving resources and reducing environmental impact, but also about addressing social and economic issues. In the context of the Global South, where resources are often scarce and the environmental and social impacts of waste are more pronounced, these challenges are particularly acute.

However, these challenges also present opportunities for action. By implementing effective food waste reduction strategies, it is possible to address these challenges and contribute to a more sustainable future. This includes improving food storage and handling practices, promoting food donation and redistribution, and implementing policies and programs that encourage food waste reduction.

In the next section, we will explore some of these opportunities in more detail, focusing on the role of technology and innovation in addressing food waste in the Global South.

#### 8.1c Strategies for Reducing Food Waste

Reducing food waste is a critical step towards achieving sustainability in the Global South. It not only helps in conserving resources but also reduces the environmental impact and social implications of food waste. Here are some strategies that can be employed to reduce food waste:

##### 1. Improved Storage and Handling Practices

Improving storage and handling practices can significantly reduce food waste. This includes proper storage of food items, regular cleaning of refrigerators and storage areas, and proper handling of food during transportation and distribution. These practices can help in preventing food spoilage and reducing the amount of food that needs to be discarded.

##### 2. Food Recovery and Redistribution

Food recovery and redistribution is another effective strategy for reducing food waste. This involves collecting and redistributing food that would otherwise be wasted. This can be done through food banks, soup kitchens, and other organizations that provide food to the needy. In the Global South, where food insecurity is prevalent, food recovery and redistribution can make a significant difference in addressing food waste and food insecurity.

##### 3. Policy and Program Interventions

Policy and program interventions can also play a crucial role in reducing food waste. This includes policies that encourage food donation and redistribution, as well as programs that provide training and resources for food waste reduction. For instance, the Australian government's $1.2 million investment in renewable energy systems for food storage and transportation is a good example of such a program.

##### 4. Public Education and Awareness

Public education and awareness can also help in reducing food waste. This involves educating the public about the importance of reducing food waste and how they can contribute to it. This can be done through school programs, community initiatives, and media campaigns. In the Global South, where food waste is often seen as a normal part of life, public education and awareness can be particularly effective in changing attitudes and behaviors towards food waste.

##### 5. Technology and Innovation

Technology and innovation can also play a role in reducing food waste. This includes technologies for food preservation and storage, as well as innovative business models for food recovery and redistribution. For instance, the mobile app "Too Good To Go" allows restaurants and supermarkets to sell surplus food at discounted prices, reducing food waste and promoting sustainable consumption.

In conclusion, reducing food waste is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach. By implementing these strategies, we can make significant strides towards a more sustainable future in the Global South.




#### 8.1c Case Studies of Food Waste

To further illustrate the impact of food waste, let's examine some case studies from different countries.

#### Australia

In Australia, food waste is a significant issue. The country loses $20 billion each year due to food waste, which has a profound environmental impact. The Australian ministry of the environment has taken several initiatives to address this issue. For instance, they have funded organizations that invest in renewable energies systems to store and transport food, and have also financed research on food waste reduction. Local governments have also implemented programs such as information sessions on storing food and composting, diversion of waste from restaurants and cafes from landfills to shared recycling facilities, and donation of food to organizations that would otherwise be wasted.

#### Canada

In Canada, food waste is a major problem. It is estimated that 58% of all food is wasted, amounting to 35.5 million tonnes of food per annuum. This waste could be enough to feed all Canadians for five months. The Canadian government has taken several steps to address this issue. For instance, they have implemented a food waste reduction strategy that includes measures to reduce food waste in the food service sector, improve food donation practices, and increase consumer awareness about food waste.

These case studies highlight the importance of addressing food waste at both the national and local levels. They also underscore the need for a comprehensive approach that includes policy changes, investment in infrastructure, and public education.




### Subsection: 8.2a Importance of Reducing Food Waste

Food waste is a pressing issue that affects not only the environment but also the economy and society as a whole. In this section, we will explore the importance of reducing food waste and how it can contribute to a more sustainable future.

#### Environmental Impact

Food waste has a significant environmental impact. The production of food involves the use of resources such as land, water, and energy. When food is wasted, these resources are also wasted, leading to increased environmental degradation. For instance, in Australia, it is estimated that 7.6 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> is generated by the disposed food in landfills. This not only contributes to climate change but also has a detrimental effect on the environment.

Moreover, food waste in landfills can also lead to the generation of harmful gases such as methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), methane is responsible for about 16% of global warming. Therefore, reducing food waste can significantly contribute to mitigating climate change.

#### Economic Impact

Food waste also has a significant economic impact. In Australia, the Australian economy loses $20 billion in food waste each year. This loss is not only limited to the cost of producing, manufacturing, packaging, and distributing food but also includes the cost of disposing of food waste. In Canada, it is estimated that $1,766 is lost in food loss and waste per household. This represents a significant financial burden on both individuals and the economy as a whole.

By reducing food waste, we can not only save these resources but also create new economic opportunities. For instance, the Australian government has funded organizations that invest in renewable energies systems to store and transport food. This not only helps to reduce food waste but also creates jobs and stimulates the economy.

#### Social Impact

Food waste also has a social impact. In many countries, a significant portion of the population faces food insecurity. Food waste can exacerbate this issue by reducing the amount of food available for consumption. In Canada, it is estimated that about one third of this waste could be spared and sent to those in need. By reducing food waste, we can ensure that more food is available for consumption, thereby addressing food insecurity.

Moreover, food waste can also have a negative impact on food security by increasing food prices. As food waste reduces the supply of food, it can drive up food prices, making it more difficult for low-income households to afford food. By reducing food waste, we can help to stabilize food prices and make food more affordable for all.

In conclusion, reducing food waste is crucial for creating a more sustainable future. It not only helps to mitigate climate change and create new economic opportunities but also addresses food insecurity. Therefore, it is essential to implement strategies to reduce food waste at both the individual and organizational level.




### Subsection: 8.2b Techniques for Reducing Food Waste

In the previous section, we discussed the importance of reducing food waste. In this section, we will explore some techniques that can help us achieve this goal.

#### Source Reduction

Source reduction is a key strategy for reducing food waste. This involves reducing the amount of food that is generated and potentially wasted. At an individual level, food waste results from choices made during the planning, shopping, storing, preparing, cooking, eating, and discarding of food. For instance, making shopping lists can help individuals avoid buying more food than they need, thereby reducing food waste at the household level. Similarly, buying smaller amounts of produce more frequently can help prevent spoilage at home.

Studies have shown that misconceptions about date labeling can also lead to food waste. Therefore, learning about food labels can be a useful tactic for reducing waste. Visual prompts, such as brightly colored tape, can be used to mark foods that need to be used soon. Reminders that cue people about what to use can be particularly helpful in large households.

#### Prevention and Valorisation Pathways

Prevention and valorisation pathways can also be used to reduce food waste. These pathways involve recovering food resources for human consumption or preventing waste generation. This can be achieved via food donations, upcycling and re-processing into new food products, or overcoming current hinders that limit the food potential per produced unit of food.

For instance, unharvested "ugly" vegetables at farms, "best-before" dates at retail level, or under utilized by-products from food processing can all be addressed through these pathways. By increasing the food potential, we can support sustainable food systems and contribute to a more sustainable future.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, reducing food waste is crucial for the environment, the economy, and society as a whole. By implementing strategies such as source reduction and prevention and valorisation pathways, we can significantly reduce food waste and contribute to a more sustainable future.

## Chapter: Chapter 9: Food Security and Urban Agriculture

### Introduction

The city of Cartagena, like many other urban centers in the Global South, faces a unique set of challenges when it comes to food security. This chapter, "Food Security and Urban Agriculture," delves into these challenges and explores potential solutions. 

Food security is a critical issue in Cartagena, where a significant portion of the population lives in urban poverty. The city's rapid urbanization has led to the expansion of informal settlements, often located on marginal land, where residents face difficulties in accessing safe and nutritious food. This is further exacerbated by the city's vulnerability to climate change, which has increased the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, affecting food production and distribution.

Urban agriculture, a practice that involves the cultivation of crops and raising of animals within the city, has emerged as a potential solution to these challenges. By utilizing unused urban spaces, urban agriculture can contribute to food security by increasing food availability and accessibility. It can also enhance the livelihoods of urban residents, particularly those in informal settlements, and contribute to the city's resilience to climate change.

However, urban agriculture is not without its challenges. It requires careful planning and management to ensure that it is sustainable and does not exacerbate existing inequalities.

#### 8.3a Understanding the Link Between Food Waste and Food Security

Food waste and food security are intrinsically linked. Food waste refers to the loss or disposal of food that is still edible and safe for consumption. This can occur at any stage of the food supply chain, from production to consumption. Food security, on the other hand, refers to the availability, access, and utilization of food. It is a multifaceted issue that encompasses not only the physical availability of food, but also the economic, social, and political factors that influence an individual's or community's ability to obtain and use food.

The link between food waste and food security is complex and multifaceted. On one hand, food waste can contribute to food insecurity by reducing the availability of food. When food is wasted, it is not available for consumption, which can lead to food shortages and increased food prices. This can disproportionately affect vulnerable populations who may already struggle to access affordable and nutritious food.

On the other hand, addressing food waste can also contribute to food security. By reducing food waste, we can increase the availability of food, which can help to alleviate food shortages and reduce food prices. This can make food more accessible to vulnerable populations, and can also contribute to improved nutrition by increasing the availability of nutritious foods.

However, it is important to note that the relationship between food waste and food security is not always straightforward. In some cases, efforts to reduce food waste may inadvertently contribute to food insecurity. For example, if efforts to reduce food waste result in the discard of nutritious foods, this could potentially exacerbate food insecurity. Similarly, efforts to reduce food waste may also lead to increased food prices, which could also contribute to food insecurity.

In the next section, we will explore some of the strategies that can be used to address food waste and improve food security in the context of urban food systems.

#### 8.3b Strategies for Reducing Food Waste and Improving Food Security

In the context of Cartagena, where the food system is facing significant pressures due to urbanization and the global south, effective food policy and governance are essential for ensuring food security and nutrition for all.

This chapter will explore the various aspects of food policy and governance, including the policies and regulations in place, the actors involved, and the challenges they face. We will also examine the opportunities for action that exist within this realm, such as the potential for policy interventions to address food insecurity and waste. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the role of food policy and governance in feeding cities in the global south, and the potential for action to create more sustainable and equitable food systems.




### Section: 9.1 Understanding Food Policy:

Food policy is a critical component of food systems, as it provides the framework for decision-making and implementation. It encompasses a wide range of issues, including food safety, nutrition, and sustainability, and is influenced by various factors, including economic, social, and political considerations. In this section, we will explore the basics of food policy, including its definition, objectives, and key stakeholders.

#### 9.1a Basics of Food Policy

Food policy can be defined as a set of principles, guidelines, and regulations that govern the production, distribution, and consumption of food. It is designed to ensure that food is safe, nutritious, and accessible to all members of society. The primary objectives of food policy are to promote food security, improve public health, and support sustainable food systems.

Food policy is shaped by a variety of stakeholders, including government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and industry representatives. These stakeholders play a crucial role in shaping food policy, as they bring diverse perspectives and interests to the table. For example, government agencies are responsible for setting regulations and standards, while non-governmental organizations advocate for consumer interests and environmental sustainability.

One of the key challenges in food policy is balancing the competing interests of these stakeholders. This requires a collaborative and inclusive approach to decision-making, where all stakeholders have a voice and can contribute to the development of food policy.

#### 9.1b Food Policy in Cartagena

In Cartagena, food policy is a critical tool for addressing the challenges faced by the food system. The city is experiencing rapid urbanization, which has put pressure on the food system to meet the growing demand for food. This has led to issues such as food insecurity, malnutrition, and environmental degradation.

To address these challenges, the government of Cartagena has implemented a comprehensive food policy. This policy aims to promote food security, improve public health, and support sustainable food systems. It includes measures such as subsidies for small-scale farmers, regulations on food safety and quality, and programs to promote healthy eating habits among the population.

#### 9.1c Challenges and Opportunities in Food Policy

Despite the efforts of the government, there are still many challenges in food policy in Cartagena. One of the main challenges is the lack of resources and capacity among small-scale farmers. Many of these farmers struggle to meet the growing demand for food, and they often lack access to resources such as land, capital, and technology.

Another challenge is the lack of coordination among stakeholders. Many food policy decisions are made in isolation, without considering the perspectives and interests of all stakeholders. This can lead to conflicting policies and regulations, which can hinder the effectiveness of food policy.

However, there are also opportunities for action in food policy. One of the key opportunities is the potential for collaboration and partnerships among stakeholders. By working together, stakeholders can develop more comprehensive and effective food policies that address the diverse interests and needs of the community.

In addition, there is a growing movement towards sustainable and resilient food systems. This presents an opportunity to incorporate principles of sustainability and resilience into food policy, which can help address the long-term challenges faced by the food system.

In conclusion, food policy is a crucial tool for addressing the challenges faced by food systems in Cartagena. By understanding the basics of food policy and the key stakeholders involved, we can work towards developing more effective and sustainable food policies that meet the needs of all members of society.

# Agricultural policy

### Food security

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defines food security as existing when "all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life". The four qualifications that must be met for a food secure system include physical availability, economic and physical access, appropriate utilization, and stability of the prior three elements over time.

Of the 6.7 billion people on the planet, about 2 billion are food insecure. As the global population grows to 9 billion by 2050, and as diets shift to emphasize higher energy products and greater overall consumption, food systems will be subjected to even greater pressure. Climate change presents additional threats to food security, affecting crop yields, distribution of pests and diseases, weather patterns, and growing seasons around the world.

Food security has thus become an increasingly important topic in agricultural policy as decision makers attempt to reduce poverty and malnutrition while augmenting adaptive capacity to climate change. The Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change listed high-priority policy actions to address food security, including integrating food security and sustainable agriculture into global and national policies, significantly raising the level of global investment in food systems, and developing specific programs and policies to support the most vulnerable populations (namely, those that are already subject to food insecurity).

### Food sovereignty

'Food sovereignty', a term coined by members of Via Campesina in 1996, is about the right of peoples to define their own food systems. Advocates of food sovereignty put the people who produce, distribute, and consume food at the centre of decisions on food systems and policies, rather than the demands of markets and corporations that they believe have led to the current food crisis. Food sovereignty is based on the principles of social justice, human rights, and the right to food, and aims to create a more equitable and sustainable food system.

Food sovereignty is a response to the failures of the current food system, which has led to widespread food insecurity and malnutrition, particularly among marginalized and vulnerable populations. It recognizes that food is not just a commodity to be bought and sold, but a fundamental human right that should be protected and promoted. By putting the rights and needs of food producers and consumers at the center of food policy, food sovereignty aims to create a more just and sustainable food system.

#### 9.1c Case Studies of Food Policy

To further illustrate the importance and impact of food policy, let's examine some case studies from different regions of the world.

##### Case Study 1: Food Policy in the United States

In the United States, food policy is a complex and contentious issue. The country is home to some of the largest and most efficient food production systems in the world, yet it also has a significant portion of its population struggling with food insecurity. This is due to a variety of factors, including income inequality, lack of access to affordable and nutritious food, and the impact of climate change on food production.

One of the key challenges in food policy in the United States is balancing the interests of different stakeholders. This includes farmers, food producers, consumers, and the environment. The government plays a crucial role in regulating and supporting the food system, but there have been debates over the effectiveness and fairness of certain policies. For example, some argue that subsidies for large-scale farms disproportionately benefit a small number of farmers, while others argue that these subsidies are necessary to ensure a stable and affordable food supply.

##### Case Study 2: Food Policy in India

In India, food policy is heavily influenced by the country's history and cultural values. The country has a long tradition of self-sufficiency in food production, and this is reflected in its food policy. The government has implemented various programs to ensure food security for its population, including the Public Distribution System (PDS) which provides subsidized food to vulnerable populations.

However, there are also challenges in India's food policy. The country faces significant food waste, and there are concerns over the impact of climate change on food production. Additionally, there have been debates over the effectiveness of certain policies, such as the PDS, and calls for reform to address issues of corruption and inefficiency.

##### Case Study 3: Food Policy in Cartagena, Colombia

In Cartagena, food policy is a critical tool for addressing the challenges faced by the food system. The city is experiencing rapid urbanization, which has put pressure on the food system to meet the growing demand for food. This has led to issues such as food insecurity, malnutrition, and environmental degradation.

To address these challenges, the city has implemented various food policies, including the creation of urban gardens and the promotion of sustainable agriculture practices. These policies aim to increase access to affordable and nutritious food, while also reducing the environmental impact of food production. However, there are also challenges in implementing these policies, such as limited resources and the need for collaboration between different stakeholders.

### Conclusion

These case studies demonstrate the complexity and importance of food policy in different contexts. Food policy is a crucial tool for addressing the challenges faced by food systems, and it requires careful consideration of the needs and interests of all stakeholders. As the world continues to face increasing pressure on its food systems, it is essential to continue studying and improving food policy to ensure a sustainable and equitable food future for all.





### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the various aspects of food systems in the Global South, focusing on the challenges and opportunities that exist in these regions. We have delved into the complexities of food production, distribution, and consumption, and have highlighted the importance of addressing these issues in a comprehensive and holistic manner. In this chapter, we will shift our focus to the realm of food policy and governance, and will examine how these factors can influence and shape the food systems in the Global South.

Food policy and governance are critical components of any food system. They provide the framework within which food production, distribution, and consumption occur. They determine who has the right to produce, distribute, and consume food, and how these activities are regulated. They also influence the allocation of resources and the distribution of benefits and burdens within the food system.

In the context of the Global South, food policy and governance are particularly important. These regions are often characterized by complex and interconnected challenges, including rapid urbanization, climate change, and economic instability. These challenges can have profound impacts on food systems, and can exacerbate existing inequalities and vulnerabilities. Therefore, understanding and addressing food policy and governance issues is crucial for ensuring food security and nutrition in the Global South.

In this chapter, we will explore the various aspects of food policy and governance, including the role of different stakeholders, the principles and objectives of food policy, and the challenges and opportunities for action in the Global South. We will also examine case studies from different countries in the Global South, and will discuss the lessons learned and implications for future action.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a better understanding of the complexities of food policy and governance in the Global South, and should be equipped with the knowledge and tools to address these issues in a practical and effective manner.




#### 9.2a Understanding Food Governance

Food governance is a critical component of food systems, particularly in the Global South where food systems are often characterized by complex and interconnected challenges. It refers to the policies, institutions, and processes that govern the production, distribution, and consumption of food. It is a multilevel and multistakeholder process that involves governments, private sector corporations, civil society, and consumers.

The European Union (EU) has been at the forefront of addressing food governance issues. The EU's Scientific Advice Mechanism has published a systematic review of all European policies related to sustainable food systems, and their analyses in the academic literature. In September 2019, the EU's Chief Scientific Advisors stated that adapting the European food system for the future should be a high priority for the EU. This was followed by the publication of the European Commission's 'Farm to Fork strategy for a sustainable food system' in May 2020, which laid out how European countries will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect biodiversity, reduce food waste and chemical pesticide use, and contribute to a circular economy.

In April 2020, the EU's Scientific Advice Mechanism delivered to European Commissioners a Scientific Opinion on how to transition to a sustainable food system, informed by an evidence review report undertaken by European academies. The main conclusion of this advice was the need for a holistic and integrated approach to food governance, which includes addressing the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of food systems.

In June 2023, the Scientific Advice Mechanism delivered a second piece of advice, this time on the role of consumers in a sustainable food system. The main conclusion of this advice was the need for consumers to be actively involved in the governance of food systems, through mechanisms such as consumer representation in decision-making processes and the promotion of consumer education and awareness.

Public–private partnerships and private sector led multistakeholder governance have positioned corporations as a leading voice on decisions where public governance authorities have become dependent on private sector funding. This has raised concerns around corporate governance within food systems as a substitute for regulation. However, the Institute for Multi-Stakeholder Initiative on Agricultural Governance (IMAGO) has argued that private sector governance can complement public governance, and that a balance between the two is necessary for effective food governance.

In conclusion, understanding food governance is crucial for addressing the challenges and opportunities in food systems, particularly in the Global South. It involves a multilevel and multistakeholder approach, and requires a balance between public and private sector governance. The EU's efforts in this regard provide valuable insights and lessons for other regions in the Global South.

#### 9.2b Role of Governance in Food Security

Food governance plays a pivotal role in ensuring food security in the Global South. Food security is a state where all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food. It is a multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive approach, and governance is a key component of this approach.

The role of governance in food security is multifaceted. It involves the establishment of policies, institutions, and processes that ensure the availability, accessibility, and utilization of food. This includes policies that promote sustainable food production, distribution, and consumption practices, institutions that enforce these policies, and processes that facilitate the implementation of these policies and institutions.

The European Union's (EU) approach to food governance provides valuable insights into the role of governance in food security. The EU's Farm to Fork strategy, for instance, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect biodiversity, reduce food waste and chemical pesticide use, and contribute to a circular economy. This strategy is a clear example of how governance can be used to address the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of food security.

Moreover, the EU's Scientific Advice Mechanism has delivered two pieces of advice on food governance. The first, delivered in April 2020, emphasized the need for a holistic and integrated approach to food governance. The second, delivered in June 2023, highlighted the role of consumers in a sustainable food system. These pieces of advice underscore the importance of involving all stakeholders, including consumers, in food governance processes.

However, the role of governance in food security is not without challenges. The EU's experience with public–private partnerships and private sector led multistakeholder governance has raised concerns about the influence of private sector corporations on food governance. This has led to debates about the balance between public and private sector governance in food systems.

In conclusion, governance plays a crucial role in ensuring food security in the Global South. It involves a comprehensive approach that addresses the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of food security. However, it also faces challenges that need to be addressed to ensure that food governance serves the interests of all stakeholders, particularly the most vulnerable.

#### 9.2c Case Studies of Food Governance

To further illustrate the role of governance in food security, let's delve into some case studies from the Global South. These case studies will provide practical examples of how governance can be used to address food security issues.

##### Case Study 1: The Philippines

The Philippines, a country in Southeast Asia, faces significant challenges in food security. The country is highly dependent on agriculture, with rice being the staple food. However, the country has been experiencing rice shortages due to various factors, including climate change, population growth, and inadequate agricultural policies.

In response to these challenges, the Philippine government has implemented various food governance measures. These include the Rice Tariffication Act, which liberalizes rice imports, and the National Food Authority, which is responsible for regulating the rice market. The government has also implemented various programs to support rice farmers, including the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund and the Rice Farmers Financial Assistance Program.

These measures have helped to improve rice availability and accessibility in the Philippines. However, challenges remain, particularly in terms of rice utilization. The Philippines has one of the highest rates of rice wastage in the world, with an estimated 20% of rice produced being wasted. This highlights the need for further efforts to improve rice utilization, which could involve measures such as promoting rice processing and value addition.

##### Case Study 2: South Africa

South Africa, a country in Southern Africa, has made significant strides in food governance. The country has a well-developed legal and institutional framework for food governance, including the National Food and Nutrition Security Policy and the National Agricultural Policy.

One of the key challenges in South Africa is food insecurity among vulnerable groups, particularly children and the elderly. To address this challenge, the government has implemented various social protection measures, including the Child Support Grant and the Older Persons Grant. These measures have helped to improve food accessibility among vulnerable groups.

However, challenges remain in terms of food availability and utilization. The country has a high rate of food waste, with an estimated 10% of food produced being wasted. This highlights the need for further efforts to improve food utilization, which could involve measures such as promoting food recycling and reducing food loss during storage and transportation.

These case studies highlight the importance of a comprehensive approach to food governance, involving policies, institutions, and processes that address the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of food security. They also underscore the need for ongoing monitoring and evaluation to ensure that food governance measures are effective and responsive to changing circumstances.




#### 9.2b Role of Governance in Food Security

Food governance plays a crucial role in ensuring food security in the Global South. It is the process by which decisions are made and implemented regarding the production, distribution, and consumption of food. The role of governance in food security is multifaceted and involves various stakeholders, including governments, private sector corporations, civil society, and consumers.

The European Union (EU) has been at the forefront of addressing food governance issues. The EU's Scientific Advice Mechanism has published a systematic review of all European policies related to sustainable food systems, and their analyses in the academic literature. This has led to the development of policies such as the 'Farm to Fork strategy for a sustainable food system' and the 'European Green Deal', which aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect biodiversity, reduce food waste and chemical pesticide use, and contribute to a circular economy.

In the Global South, food governance is often characterized by complex and interconnected challenges. These challenges include limited resources, lack of infrastructure, and weak institutional frameworks. However, there are also opportunities for action, such as the potential for innovation and technology to improve food systems. For example, the use of mobile technology has been shown to improve market efficiency and reduce food waste in developing countries.

The role of governance in food security is also closely linked to gender issues. Women, who make up more than 50 percent of the labour force in developing countries, are often denied access to agricultural resources, education, extension, financial services, and labour markets. This not only affects their productivity but also exacerbates food insecurity. Therefore, addressing gender issues is crucial for improving food security in the Global South.

In conclusion, food governance plays a crucial role in ensuring food security in the Global South. It involves various stakeholders and requires a holistic and integrated approach to address the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of food systems. The EU's approach to food governance provides valuable insights and lessons for developing countries, particularly in the areas of sustainable food systems and gender issues.

#### 9.2c Case Studies of Food Governance and Food Security

In this section, we will explore some case studies that highlight the role of governance in food security in the Global South. These case studies will provide a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities in food governance and how they impact food security.

##### Case Study 1: The European Union's Farm to Fork Strategy

The European Union's (EU) Farm to Fork Strategy is a prime example of how food governance can be used to address food security issues. The strategy, launched in 2020, aims to transition to a sustainable food system by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting biodiversity, reducing food waste and chemical pesticide use, and contributing to a circular economy.

The strategy is implemented through various policies and initiatives, including the Sustainable Food Systems Action Plan, the Organic Farming Action Plan, and the Farm to Fork Observatory. These initiatives involve various stakeholders, including farmers, food businesses, and consumers, and are supported by scientific advice from the EU's Scientific Advice Mechanism.

The Farm to Fork Strategy has been successful in promoting sustainable food systems in the EU. For instance, the Organic Farming Action Plan has led to an increase in the area of land under organic farming, contributing to the EU's goal of 25% of agricultural land under organic farming by 2030. The strategy has also led to a reduction in food waste, with the EU aiming to reduce food waste by 50% by 2030.

##### Case Study 2: The Role of Gender in Agricultural Programs in Sub-Saharan Africa

In Sub-Saharan Africa, women make up more than 50 percent of the labour force and are involved in three-quarters of food production. However, most development policies are gender-blind, and failure to include the role of women as producers further exacerbates the situation.

The World Bank's Gender in Agricultural Sourcebook highlights the importance of addressing gender issues in agricultural programs. The sourcebook emphasizes the need for increased investment in labour-saving and productivity enhancing mechanisms, along with better infrastructure to enable women to engage in more productive activities. It also calls for policies that push women's agendas into the public sphere and improve women's access to economic opportunities.

The Food and Agricultural Organization's (FAO) report titled State of Food and Agriculture 2010-2011 also highlights the importance of gender in food security. The report calls for increased investment in labour-saving and productivity enhancing mechanisms, along with better infrastructure to enable women to engage in more productive activities. It also calls for policies that push women's agendas into the public sphere and improve women's access to economic opportunities.

These case studies highlight the crucial role of governance in food security. They show that effective food governance can lead to improved food security, but also underscore the need for a holistic and integrated approach that addresses the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of food systems.

## Chapter: Chapter 10: Food and Health

### Introduction

The relationship between food and health is a complex and multifaceted one. This chapter, "Food and Health," delves into the intricate dynamics of this relationship, particularly in the context of the Global South. The Global South, a term used to describe the developing world, faces unique challenges in terms of food production, distribution, and consumption. These challenges are often exacerbated by factors such as poverty, climate change, and rapid urbanization. 

In this chapter, we will explore the various ways in which food and health are intertwined. We will examine how food choices can impact health outcomes, and how health, in turn, can influence food choices. We will also delve into the role of food in disease prevention and treatment, and how food policies can be used to promote health and well-being.

We will also explore the challenges faced by the Global South in terms of food and health. These challenges include issues related to food safety, nutrition, and access to healthy food options. We will also discuss the role of food in disease prevention and treatment, and how food policies can be used to promote health and well-being.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationship between food and health in the Global South. It is our hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for those interested in understanding and addressing the food and health challenges faced by the Global South.




#### 9.2c Case Studies of Food Governance

In this section, we will explore some case studies of food governance in the Global South. These case studies will provide real-world examples of the challenges and opportunities faced in food governance, and how different stakeholders are working to address them.

##### Case Study 1: The European Union's Farm to Fork Strategy

The European Union's (EU) Farm to Fork strategy is a prime example of a comprehensive food governance framework. The strategy, which was launched in 2020, aims to create a sustainable food system that promotes healthy and environmentally friendly food choices. It includes measures to reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers, promote sustainable farming practices, and reduce food waste.

The strategy also includes a commitment to protect and restore biodiversity, which is crucial for food security. The EU has identified 12 priority areas for biodiversity conservation, including the protection of pollinators, the restoration of ecosystems, and the promotion of sustainable food production and consumption.

The strategy is supported by the EU's Green Deal, which aims to make the EU climate-neutral by 2050. This includes measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the food system, such as promoting sustainable diets and reducing food waste.

##### Case Study 2: The Role of Gender in Food Governance in India

In India, women play a crucial role in agriculture, making up 48 percent of the agricultural labor force. However, they often face barriers to accessing resources and decision-making processes. This not only affects their productivity but also exacerbates food insecurity.

To address this issue, the Indian government has implemented various policies, including the National Food Security Act (NFSA) and the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme. These policies aim to provide food and income support to vulnerable households, with a particular focus on women and children.

However, there are still challenges in implementing these policies, particularly in terms of gender equality. Women often face barriers to accessing these benefits, and there is a lack of gender-disaggregated data to track their impact.

##### Case Study 3: The Role of Private Sector Corporations in Food Governance

Private sector corporations play a significant role in food governance, particularly in the Global South. They are often involved in the production, processing, and distribution of food, and their actions can have a significant impact on food security.

For example, in Colombia, the private sector has been instrumental in addressing food insecurity in the country. The Colombian government has partnered with private sector corporations to implement the Familias en Acción program, which provides food and nutrition education to vulnerable households. This program has reached over 1.5 million households since its inception in 2016.

However, there are also concerns about the potential negative impacts of private sector involvement in food governance. For instance, there have been reports of human rights abuses by private sector actors in the agriculture sector in Colombia.

In conclusion, these case studies highlight the complex and multifaceted nature of food governance in the Global South. They demonstrate the importance of considering the role of different stakeholders, including governments, private sector corporations, and civil society, in addressing food governance issues.




#### 9.3a Importance of Policy Interventions

Policy interventions play a crucial role in addressing food security challenges in the Global South. They provide a framework for action and guide decision-making processes at all levels, from local to national. In this section, we will explore the importance of policy interventions in promoting food security and reducing hunger in the Global South.

##### Policy Interventions and Food Security

Food security is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach. Policy interventions provide a structured way to address the various dimensions of food security, including availability, access, and utilization. They also help to identify and prioritize the most pressing food security issues, and guide the allocation of resources and efforts towards addressing them.

For instance, the European Union's Farm to Fork strategy, as discussed in the previous section, has been instrumental in promoting sustainable food production and consumption practices. By setting clear objectives and implementing effective policy instruments, the strategy has helped to reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers, promote sustainable farming practices, and reduce food waste. This has not only improved food security but also contributed to the protection and restoration of biodiversity, which is crucial for long-term food security.

##### Policy Interventions and Gender

Gender is another important factor to consider in food security policy interventions. As seen in India, women play a crucial role in agriculture, yet they often face barriers to accessing resources and decision-making processes. This not only affects their productivity but also exacerbates food insecurity.

Policy interventions can help to address these gender disparities by promoting gender equality in decision-making processes and resource allocation. For instance, the Indian government's National Food Security Act and Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme have been instrumental in providing food and income support to vulnerable households, with a particular focus on women and children.

##### Policy Interventions and Climate Change

Climate change is another major challenge to food security in the Global South. It exacerbates existing food security issues and creates new challenges, such as increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Policy interventions can help to address these challenges by promoting climate-resilient agriculture practices and supporting smallholder farmers to adapt to climate change.

In conclusion, policy interventions are crucial for addressing food security challenges in the Global South. They provide a structured approach to addressing the various dimensions of food security, promote gender equality, and help to adapt to climate change. However, for policy interventions to be effective, they must be evidence-based, context-specific, and implemented with the active participation of all stakeholders.

#### 9.3b Types of Policy Interventions

Policy interventions for food security can be broadly categorized into two types: supply-side interventions and demand-side interventions. Supply-side interventions focus on increasing the availability of food, while demand-side interventions aim to improve access to food. 

##### Supply-Side Interventions

Supply-side interventions are aimed at increasing the availability of food. This can be achieved through various means, including:

1. **Agricultural Policy**: Policies that promote sustainable agricultural practices, such as the European Union's Farm to Fork strategy, can increase food availability. This can be achieved through measures such as reducing the use of pesticides and fertilizers, promoting sustainable farming practices, and reducing food waste.

2. **Infrastructure Development**: Investing in infrastructure, such as storage facilities and transportation networks, can improve the distribution of food and increase its availability.

3. **Research and Development**: Supporting research and development in the agriculture sector can lead to the development of new, more productive crop varieties and technologies, thereby increasing food availability.

##### Demand-Side Interventions

Demand-side interventions aim to improve access to food. This can be achieved through various means, including:

1. **Social Protection Programs**: Social protection programs, such as the Indian government's National Food Security Act and Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme, can provide food and income support to vulnerable households. This can help to improve food access, particularly for women and children who often face the greatest barriers to accessing food.

2. **Education and Awareness**: Education and awareness campaigns can help to change food consumption patterns and reduce food waste. This can improve food access by ensuring that food is not wasted but consumed.

3. **Market Interventions**: Market interventions, such as price controls and subsidies, can help to make food more affordable for low-income households. This can improve food access by reducing the cost of food.

In conclusion, policy interventions play a crucial role in promoting food security in the Global South. By addressing the various dimensions of food security, including availability, access, and utilization, policy interventions can help to reduce hunger and improve food security. However, it is important to note that policy interventions must be evidence-based and context-specific to be effective.

#### 9.3b Steps to Develop Effective Policy Interventions

Developing effective policy interventions for food security in the Global South requires a systematic approach that takes into account the unique challenges and opportunities of each context. Here are some steps that can guide policymakers in developing effective policy interventions:

##### 1. Identify the Problem

The first step in developing any policy intervention is to clearly identify the problem. This involves understanding the root causes of food insecurity, such as lack of access to food, poor nutrition, or environmental degradation. It also involves understanding the context in which the problem exists, including social, economic, and political factors.

##### 2. Set Objectives and Priorities

Once the problem has been identified, policymakers need to set clear objectives and priorities for the policy intervention. These objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). They should also be aligned with the overall goals of the policy, such as improving food security, reducing hunger, or promoting sustainable food systems.

##### 3. Choose Appropriate Policy Instruments

Policymakers need to choose the appropriate policy instruments to achieve their objectives. These instruments can include regulations, incentives, or information campaigns. The choice of instruments should be based on the nature of the problem, the available resources, and the context in which the policy will be implemented.

##### 4. Implement the Policy

Implementing the policy involves putting the chosen instruments into action. This requires careful planning and coordination among all stakeholders involved. It also requires monitoring and evaluation to ensure that the policy is being implemented effectively and to make necessary adjustments.

##### 5. Evaluate and Adjust the Policy

Finally, policymakers need to evaluate the effectiveness of the policy and make necessary adjustments. This involves collecting and analyzing data on the outcomes of the policy, such as changes in food security, hunger, or environmental conditions. It also involves learning from the implementation process and using this learning to improve future policy interventions.

By following these steps, policymakers can develop effective policy interventions that address the root causes of food insecurity in the Global South and contribute to a more sustainable and resilient food system.

### Section: 10.1 Understanding the Impact of Climate Change on Food Systems:

Climate change is a global phenomenon that has far-reaching implications for food systems in the Global South. As the world's population continues to grow, the demand for food is increasing, putting additional pressure on already strained food systems. Climate change exacerbates these challenges, affecting every step of the food supply chain, from production to distribution and consumption.

#### 10.1a Basics of Climate Change

Climate change refers to the long-term alteration of global or regional weather patterns, primarily caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. These activities release large amounts of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere, trapping heat and causing the planet to warm. This warming has a cascading effect on the environment, leading to changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has reported that the Earth's average temperature has risen by 1.1°C since the pre-industrial era, and is expected to continue to rise in the future. This rise in temperature has significant implications for food systems in the Global South.

#### 10.1b Impact of Climate Change on Food Systems

Climate change has a profound impact on food systems in the Global South. The changing climate has led to increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves, which have a direct impact on food production. For example, in the Philippines, climate change has led to more frequent and severe typhoons, causing significant damage to crops and disruptions in food supply chains.

Climate change also affects the quality and quantity of food available for consumption. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can lead to changes in crop yields, making it more challenging to meet the growing demand for food. In addition, climate change can also lead to changes in the nutritional value of food, as different crops may require different levels of nutrients to thrive in a changing climate.

#### 10.1c Strategies for Adapting to Climate Change

In the face of these challenges, it is crucial to develop and implement strategies for adapting to climate change. These strategies must address the impacts of climate change on food systems and work towards creating a more resilient and sustainable food future.

One strategy is to incorporate climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices into food systems. CSA aims to increase agricultural productivity while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing resilience to climate change. This can be achieved through practices such as crop rotation, conservation agriculture, and the use of climate-resilient crop varieties.

Another strategy is to invest in infrastructure and technology that can help mitigate the impacts of climate change on food systems. This includes developing irrigation systems to address water scarcity, implementing disaster risk reduction measures to mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events, and investing in cold storage and transportation systems to reduce food waste.

In addition to these strategies, it is essential to involve all stakeholders, including farmers, policymakers, and consumers, in the process of adapting to climate change. This can help ensure that the strategies implemented are effective and sustainable in the long term.

#### 10.1d The Role of Policy and Governance

Policy and governance play a crucial role in addressing the impacts of climate change on food systems. Governments must prioritize climate change adaptation and mitigation in their policies and investments. This includes implementing policies that promote sustainable food production and consumption, as well as investing in research and development to find innovative solutions to the challenges posed by climate change.

In addition, international cooperation is essential in addressing climate change. The Paris Agreement, a legally binding international agreement on climate change, recognizes the need for countries to work together to limit global warming and adapt to the impacts of climate change. This agreement also includes provisions for developing countries, such as the Global South, to receive financial and technological support to help them adapt to climate change.

#### 10.1e Conclusion

Climate change is a significant threat to food systems in the Global South. It is crucial to understand the impacts of climate change on food systems and develop strategies for adapting to these changes. This includes incorporating climate-smart agriculture practices, investing in infrastructure and technology, and involving all stakeholders in the process. In addition, policy and governance play a crucial role in addressing climate change and must prioritize adaptation and mitigation efforts. By working together, we can create a more resilient and sustainable food future for the Global South.

### Subsection: 10.2a Understanding Climate Change Adaptation

Climate change adaptation is a critical aspect of addressing the impacts of climate change on food systems. It involves the process of adjusting to current or expected changes in climate and its effects. This can include learning to live with increased flooding, droughts, and extreme weather events, as well as implementing strategies to reduce vulnerability to these impacts.

#### 10.2a.1 Challenges of Climate Change Adaptation

Climate change adaptation is not without its challenges. One of the main challenges is the differing time scales at which adaptation can occur. Adaptation can occur in anticipation of change or be a response to those changes. For example, the construction of the Confederation Bridge in Canada at a higher elevation takes into account the effect of future sea-level rise on ship clearance under the bridge. However, effective adaptive policy can be difficult to implement because policymakers are rewarded more for enacting short-term change, rather than long-term planning. Since the impacts of climate change are generally not seen in the short term, policymakers have less incentive to act. Furthermore, climate change is occurring on a global scale. This requires a global framework for adapting to and combating climate change. The vast majority of climate change adaptation and mitigation policies are being implemented on a more local scale. This is because different regions must adapt differently. National and global policies are often more challenging to enact.

#### 10.2a.2 Maladaptation

Much adaptation takes place in relation to short-term climate variability. But this may cause maladaptation to longer-term climate trends. The expansion of irrigation in Egypt into the Western Sinai desert after a period of higher river flows is maladaptation given the longer-term projections of drying in the region. Adaptations at one scale can have impacts at another by reducing the adaptive capacity of other people or organizations. This is often the case when broad assessments of the costs and benefits of adaptation are examined at smaller scales. An adaptation may benefit some people, but have a negative effect on others. Development interventions to increase adaptive capacity have tended not to result in increased power or agency for local people. Agency is a central factor in allowing people to adapt to climate change.

#### 10.2a.3 Building Adaptive Capacity

Building adaptive capacity is a key aspect of climate change adaptation. This involves increasing the ability of individuals, communities, and organizations to anticipate and respond to climate change impacts. This can include developing early warning systems for extreme weather events, implementing sustainable agricultural practices, and enhancing the resilience of food systems. However, it is important to note that building adaptive capacity is not without its challenges. It requires a long-term commitment and investment, and it must be tailored to the specific needs and context of each community. Furthermore, it must be accompanied by policies and actions that reduce the vulnerability of food systems to climate change impacts.




### Subsection: 10.2b Role of Adaptation in Food Systems

Climate change adaptation plays a crucial role in food systems, particularly in the Global South where the impacts of climate change are often felt more severely. The role of adaptation in food systems can be understood in terms of its potential to mitigate the impacts of climate change on food production, distribution, and consumption.

#### 10.2b.1 Mitigating Climate Change Impacts on Food Production

Climate change adaptation can help mitigate the impacts of climate change on food production. For instance, the expansion of irrigation in Egypt into the Western Sinai desert after a period of higher river flows is an example of adaptation to longer-term climate trends. However, this adaptation may not be effective in the long run if it leads to maladaptation, as in the case of the drying of the region. Therefore, it is important to consider the long-term impacts of adaptation strategies.

#### 10.2b.2 Enhancing Food Distribution and Consumption

Climate change adaptation can also enhance food distribution and consumption. For example, the construction of the Confederation Bridge in Canada at a higher elevation takes into account the effect of future sea-level rise on ship clearance under the bridge. This adaptation can help ensure the smooth distribution of food, even in the face of climate change impacts.

#### 10.2b.3 Addressing the Challenges of Climate Change Adaptation

Addressing the challenges of climate change adaptation is crucial for ensuring the resilience of food systems in the face of climate change. This includes developing policies that incentivize long-term planning and adaptation, as well as promoting global cooperation in adapting to and combating climate change. It also involves addressing the issue of maladaptation, which can occur when adaptation strategies are not aligned with long-term climate trends.

In conclusion, the role of adaptation in food systems is multifaceted and crucial for ensuring food security in the face of climate change. It involves mitigating the impacts of climate change on food production, enhancing food distribution and consumption, and addressing the challenges of climate change adaptation.

#### 11.1a Basics of Nutrition

Nutrition is a fundamental aspect of human health and well-being. It is the process by which we obtain the food and nourishment necessary for our bodies to function properly. In this section, we will explore the basics of nutrition, including the different types of nutrients, their functions, and the role they play in maintaining our health.

##### Nutrients

Nutrients are the substances found in food that provide us with energy, build and repair tissues, and regulate body processes. There are six main types of nutrients: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and water. Each of these nutrients plays a unique role in our bodies.

Carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins are macronutrients, meaning we need larger amounts of them in our diet. Carbohydrates, such as starch and sugar, are the body's primary source of energy. Lipids, or fats, are essential for insulation, making up the core of cell membranes, and storing energy. Proteins, made up of amino acids, are the building blocks of life, playing a crucial role in the structure and function of our bodies.

Vitamins and minerals are micronutrients, meaning we need smaller amounts of them in our diet. Vitamins are organic compounds that are essential for metabolic processes. They are often classified as fat-soluble (vitamins A, D, E, and K) or water-soluble (vitamins B and C). Minerals, on the other hand, are inorganic substances that are necessary for various bodily functions. They include calcium, iron, and potassium, among others.

Water is the most abundant nutrient in the human body, making up about 60% of our weight. It is essential for life and plays a crucial role in maintaining our body's internal environment.

##### Nutrient Density

Nutrient density is a measure of the nutritional value of a food relative to its caloric content. Foods with high nutrient density provide a significant amount of nutrients per calorie. For example, leafy green vegetables are high in nutrient density due to their high levels of vitamins and minerals relative to their caloric content.

##### Nutritional Immunology

Nutritional immunology is the study of the relationship between nutrition and the immune system. The immune system is our body's defense against foreign substances, such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites. Nutrition plays a crucial role in maintaining the immune system's function. For example, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables can enhance immune function by providing essential vitamins and minerals.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the role of nutrition in maintaining our health and well-being, with a specific focus on the city of Cartagena in the Global South.

#### 11.1b Nutrition and Health

Nutrition plays a crucial role in maintaining our health and well-being. The food we eat not only provides us with energy but also with the necessary nutrients to build and repair our bodies. In this section, we will explore the relationship between nutrition and health, focusing on the role of nutrition in maintaining a healthy immune system.

As mentioned in the previous section, nutrient density is a measure of the nutritional value of a food relative to its caloric content. Foods with high nutrient density provide a significant amount of nutrients per calorie. In the context of health, consuming foods with high nutrient density can help us meet our nutritional needs while managing our caloric intake.

For example, a person trying to lose weight may need to reduce their caloric intake. By choosing foods with high nutrient density, they can still meet their nutritional needs while reducing their caloric intake. This can help them maintain their health while losing weight.

##### Nutritional Immunology

Nutritional immunology is the study of the relationship between nutrition and the immune system. It is a rapidly growing field that is shedding light on the complex interactions between nutrition and immune function. For example, researchers have found that certain nutrients, such as zinc and selenium, can enhance immune function by modulating the activity of immune cells.

In conclusion, nutrition plays a crucial role in maintaining our health and well-being. A healthy diet, rich in nutrients, is essential for maintaining a healthy immune system. By understanding the relationship between nutrition and health, we can make informed choices about the food we eat, leading to improved health outcomes.

#### 11.1c Nutrition and Sustainability

Nutrition and sustainability are two critical aspects that are intertwined in the context of food security and nutrition. Sustainability in nutrition refers to the ability to meet the nutritional needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This concept is particularly relevant in the Global South, where the challenges of food security and nutrition are often exacerbated by environmental, economic, and social factors.

##### Sustainable Nutrition and Food Security

Food security is a fundamental aspect of nutrition and sustainability. It refers to the availability, access, and utilization of food. Availability refers to the presence of food in a particular area, while access refers to the ability of individuals to obtain food. Utilization refers to the ability of individuals to use food for nutrition. 

In the Global South, food security is often threatened by a variety of factors, including climate change, economic instability, and social inequalities. For instance, climate change can lead to changes in weather patterns, affecting crop yields and food availability. Economic instability can lead to food price spikes, making it difficult for households to afford nutritious food. Social inequalities can further exacerbate these challenges, as marginalized groups often face additional barriers to accessing food.

It is a fundamental human right, yet millions of people around the world, including in Cartagena, struggle to access enough food to meet their basic needs. This is due to a variety of factors, including economic, social, and environmental factors.

Poverty is another significant factor that contributes to food insecurity. In Cartagena, as in many other cities in the Global South, a large portion of the population lives in poverty, struggling to afford basic necessities such as food. This is exacerbated by the unequal distribution of wealth and resources, as well as the lack of access to education and employment opportunities.

In this chapter, we will explore the current state of food security and poverty in Cartagena, as well as the underlying causes and consequences. We will also discuss potential solutions and actions that can be taken to address these issues and improve the lives of those living in poverty in the city. By understanding the challenges and opportunities for action, we can work towards creating a more food secure and poverty-free Cartagena.




### Section: 12.1 Understanding Poverty:

Poverty is a complex and multifaceted issue that affects millions of people around the world. It is a state of being without enough money to meet basic needs such as food, clothing, and shelter. In this section, we will explore the basics of poverty, including its definition, causes, and consequences.

#### 12.1a Basics of Poverty

Poverty is a lack of the means to satisfy basic needs, such as food, clothing, and shelter. It is a state of being without enough money to meet these needs. Poverty is often measured using income, but it can also be measured using other indicators such as access to education, healthcare, and basic services.

There are two main types of poverty: absolute poverty and relative poverty. Absolute poverty refers to a lack of basic necessities, while relative poverty refers to a lack of resources compared to others in a society. Both types of poverty have significant impacts on individuals and communities.

The causes of poverty are complex and varied. They can include factors such as low wages, unemployment, lack of education and skills, and high costs of living. In many developing countries, poverty is also exacerbated by factors such as conflict, natural disasters, and lack of access to resources and opportunities.

The consequences of poverty are also significant and far-reaching. Poverty can lead to malnutrition, poor health, and increased vulnerability to diseases. It can also limit opportunities for education and employment, perpetuating a cycle of poverty. Poverty can also have a negative impact on social and emotional well-being, leading to feelings of hopelessness and despair.

In the next section, we will explore the relationship between poverty and food security, and how poverty can impact access to food and nutrition.

#### 12.3a Understanding Poverty Policies

Poverty policies are a crucial aspect of addressing food security in the Global South. These policies aim to reduce poverty and improve the living conditions of the poor, thereby enhancing their ability to access and utilize food. In this section, we will explore the concept of poverty policies and their role in promoting food security.

##### Poverty Policies and Food Security

Poverty policies are designed to address the root causes of poverty, which in turn, can improve food security. As discussed in the previous section, poverty is a complex issue that is influenced by a variety of factors, including income, access to resources, and social protection. Poverty policies aim to address these factors and create an environment that allows the poor to escape poverty and achieve food security.

One of the key aspects of poverty policies is the concept of asset-based policies. Asset-based policies recognize that the poor often lack the necessary assets to improve their living conditions and achieve food security. These policies aim to provide the poor with the means and opportunities to accumulate assets, thereby enhancing their ability to access and utilize food.

##### Asset-Based Policies and Food Security

Asset-based policies can be particularly beneficial for households that depend on their own assets for their livelihood. These policies can provide the poor with access to assets such as land, housing, and credit, which can enhance their food security. However, it is important to ensure that these policies do not exacerbate existing inequalities. This can be achieved by focusing on creating an asset base for the poor, rather than simply increasing overall asset ownership.

In order for the poor to have access to assets, it is necessary to broaden interest in public policies, public investments, and public intervention. This can be achieved by promoting a culture of public intervention that recognizes the importance of asset-based policies in promoting food security.

##### Challenges and Opportunities for Asset-Based Policies

While asset-based policies offer a promising approach to addressing poverty and promoting food security, they also face several challenges. These include initial inequality, unorganized sectors of the economy, imbalance in asset building, and inadequate state effectiveness. However, with proper implementation and public intervention, these challenges can be overcome, and asset-based policies can contribute to sustainable development in the Global South.

In the next section, we will explore some case studies of successful poverty reduction strategies that have been implemented in cities in the Global South. These case studies will provide valuable insights into the practical application of poverty policies and their impact on food security.

#### 12.3b Analyzing the Impact of Poverty Policies on Food Security

The impact of poverty policies on food security can be analyzed from various perspectives. One of the key aspects to consider is the role of asset-based policies in promoting food security. As discussed in the previous section, asset-based policies aim to provide the poor with the means and opportunities to accumulate assets, thereby enhancing their ability to access and utilize food.

##### Asset-Based Policies and Food Security

Asset-based policies can have a significant impact on food security. By providing the poor with access to assets such as land, housing, and credit, these policies can enhance their food security. For instance, access to land can enable the poor to engage in agricultural activities, thereby increasing their food production and reducing their dependence on purchased food. Similarly, access to credit can enable the poor to invest in income-generating activities, thereby increasing their income and their ability to access and utilize food.

However, it is important to note that the impact of asset-based policies on food security can vary depending on the specific context. For instance, in situations where there is a high level of inequality, providing the poor with access to assets may not be sufficient to address their food security needs. In such cases, it may be necessary to also implement policies that aim to reduce inequality.

##### Poverty Policies and Food Security

More broadly, poverty policies can have a significant impact on food security. By addressing the root causes of poverty, these policies can create an environment that allows the poor to escape poverty and achieve food security. For instance, policies that aim to increase the income of the poor can enhance their ability to access and utilize food. Similarly, policies that aim to improve the social protection of the poor can reduce their vulnerability to food insecurity.

However, it is important to note that the impact of poverty policies on food security can also vary depending on the specific context. For instance, in situations where there is a high level of inequality, addressing the root causes of poverty may not be sufficient to address food security needs. In such cases, it may be necessary to also implement policies that aim to reduce inequality.

##### Challenges and Opportunities for Poverty Policies

Despite their potential, poverty policies face several challenges. One of the key challenges is the need for a comprehensive and coordinated approach. As discussed in the previous section, poverty is a complex issue that is influenced by a variety of factors. Therefore, addressing poverty requires a comprehensive and coordinated approach that involves multiple sectors and stakeholders.

However, there are also opportunities for poverty policies. For instance, the concept of asset-based policies offers a promising approach to addressing poverty and promoting food security. By providing the poor with the means and opportunities to accumulate assets, these policies can enhance their food security and reduce their vulnerability to food insecurity.

In conclusion, poverty policies play a crucial role in promoting food security in the Global South. By addressing the root causes of poverty and implementing policies that aim to reduce inequality and enhance the asset base of the poor, these policies can create an environment that allows the poor to escape poverty and achieve food security. However, it is important to note that the impact of poverty policies on food security can vary depending on the specific context, and therefore, these policies need to be tailored to the specific needs and challenges of each context.

Brazil's Bolsa Familia program is a prime example of a successful poverty policy. Launched in 2003, the program aims to reduce poverty by providing cash transfers to poor families. The program has been successful in reducing poverty and improving food security. According to the World Bank, the program has lifted more than 20 million people out of poverty since its inception[^1^].

The Bolsa Familia program is asset-based, as it provides the poor with a regular income that can be used to access and utilize food. The program also aims to reduce inequality, as it targets the poorest households. This has been achieved through a comprehensive and coordinated approach that involves multiple sectors and stakeholders.

##### Case Study 2: India's Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)

India's MGNREGA is another successful poverty policy that has been implemented in the Global South. Launched in 2005, the program aims to provide employment to rural households, thereby increasing their income and reducing their vulnerability to food insecurity.

The MGNREGA is asset-based, as it provides the poor with employment opportunities that can be used to accumulate assets. The program also aims to reduce inequality, as it targets the poorest households. This has been achieved through a comprehensive and coordinated approach that involves multiple sectors and stakeholders.

These case studies demonstrate that successful poverty policies require a comprehensive and coordinated approach that involves multiple sectors and stakeholders. They also highlight the importance of asset-based policies and policies that aim to reduce inequality.

### Subsection: 13.1a Basics of Gender

Gender is a complex and multifaceted concept that has been studied extensively in various fields, including sociology, psychology, and biology. In this section, we will explore the basics of gender, including its definition, characteristics, and the role it plays in society.

#### Definition of Gender

Gender is a social construct that refers to the cultural and social expectations and norms associated with being male or female. It is often used interchangeably with the term "sex," which refers to biological characteristics such as reproductive organs and hormones. However, it is important to note that gender is a social construct and is not determined by biology.

#### Characteristics of Gender

Gender is influenced by a variety of factors, including societal expectations, cultural norms, and individual experiences. It is often shaped by the expectations and norms of the society in which one lives, and can vary greatly between different cultures and communities. Gender is also influenced by one's own personal identity and how they perceive themselves.

#### The Role of Gender in Society

Gender plays a significant role in shaping an individual's experiences and opportunities in society. It can impact everything from education and employment opportunities to healthcare and social interactions. Gender is also closely tied to power dynamics, as certain genders may hold more power and privilege than others.

#### Gender and Food Security

Gender plays a crucial role in food security, as it can impact an individual's access to food, nutrition, and decision-making processes related to food. Women, in particular, face unique challenges when it comes to food security due to their gender. In many societies, women are responsible for feeding their families, yet they often have limited access to resources and decision-making power when it comes to food. This can lead to food insecurity and malnutrition, particularly among women and children.

#### Gender and Food Production

Gender also plays a significant role in food production. In many societies, women are responsible for growing and preparing food, yet they often have limited access to resources and decision-making power in this area. This can limit their ability to produce enough food to meet their family's needs, particularly in the face of challenges such as climate change and natural disasters.

#### Gender and Decision-Making

Gender also plays a role in decision-making processes related to food. In many societies, men are the primary decision-makers when it comes to food, yet women are often the ones responsible for feeding their families. This can lead to conflicts and power imbalances, as women may not have a say in important decisions related to food.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, gender is a complex and multifaceted concept that plays a crucial role in shaping an individual's experiences and opportunities in society. It is particularly important to consider when addressing issues of food security, as gender can have a significant impact on an individual's access to food, nutrition, and decision-making processes related to food. In the next section, we will explore the relationship between gender and food security in more detail, and discuss potential solutions for addressing these issues.





### Subsection: 13.1b Role of Gender in Food Security

Gender plays a crucial role in food security, as it can impact an individual's access to food, nutrition, and decision-making processes related to food. In this subsection, we will explore the role of gender in food security and how it can be addressed to improve food security in the Global South.

### Subsection: 13.1c Case Studies of Gender and Food Security

In this subsection, we will explore some case studies that highlight the role of gender in food security and the challenges and opportunities for action in addressing gender inequalities in food systems.

#### Case Study 1: Women's Land Rights in Sub-Saharan Africa

In many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, women have limited or no rights to land ownership. This is due to customary laws and practices that prioritize male inheritance and land ownership. As a result, women are often excluded from decision-making processes related to land and agriculture, which are crucial for food security. This not only limits women's ability to produce food for their families, but also their economic opportunities and overall well-being.

However, there have been efforts to address this issue. For example, in Rwanda, a land reform law was passed in 1999 that granted women equal rights to land ownership and inheritance. This has led to increased women's land ownership and improved food security for women and their families. This case study highlights the importance of addressing gender inequalities in land rights and the potential for positive impacts on food security.

#### Case Study 2: Women's Participation in Agricultural Value Chains in India

In India, women play a crucial role in agriculture, particularly in the production and processing of food. However, they often face barriers to participation in agricultural value chains, such as limited access to resources, education, and decision-making power. This not only limits their economic opportunities, but also their ability to improve food security for their families.

To address this issue, the Indian government has implemented policies to promote women's participation in agriculture, such as the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). These policies have led to increased women's employment and income in the agricultural sector, contributing to improved food security for women and their families. This case study highlights the potential for policy interventions to address gender inequalities in food systems.

#### Case Study 3: Gender-Based Violence and Food Insecurity in Conflict-Affected Areas

In conflict-affected areas, women and girls are often at risk of gender-based violence, which can have severe impacts on their food security. For example, in South Sudan, women and girls are at risk of sexual violence, which not only has physical and psychological consequences, but also limits their ability to access food and other resources. This not only affects their own food security, but also that of their families.

To address this issue, organizations such as the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) have implemented programs to provide food assistance and protection services for women and girls in conflict-affected areas. These programs not only address immediate food needs, but also aim to empower women and girls to access resources and decision-making processes, contributing to long-term food security. This case study highlights the importance of addressing gender-based violence and its impacts on food security in conflict-affected areas.

### Conclusion

These case studies demonstrate the diverse ways in which gender can impact food security and the challenges and opportunities for action in addressing gender inequalities in food systems. It is crucial to recognize and address these issues to ensure food security for all, particularly women and other marginalized genders. By promoting gender equality and addressing gender-specific needs and vulnerabilities, we can create more inclusive and sustainable food systems in the Global South.

## Chapter: Chapter 14: Food Security and Climate Change

### Introduction

The intersection of food security and climate change presents a complex and pressing challenge for the Global South. As the impacts of climate change continue to intensify, the ability of communities to produce and access food is increasingly threatened. This chapter will delve into the intricate relationship between food security and climate change, exploring the various ways in which climate change affects food production, distribution, and consumption, and the implications for food security in the Global South.

Climate change is altering the global climate system, leading to changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events. These changes have direct and indirect impacts on food security. For instance, rising temperatures can lead to increased evaporation rates, reducing soil moisture and affecting crop yields. Changes in precipitation patterns can lead to droughts or floods, further impacting food production. Climate change can also exacerbate food insecurity by disrupting food supply chains and increasing the risk of foodborne diseases.

In the context of the Global South, these challenges are often compounded by existing food insecurity and vulnerabilities. Climate change can exacerbate existing inequalities and further marginalize vulnerable populations. It can also hinder efforts to achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 2, which aims to end hunger, achieve food security, and improve nutrition by 2030.

This chapter will explore these issues in depth, providing a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities for action in the face of climate change and food security in the Global South.

## Chapter: Food Security and Climate Change

### Introduction

The intersection of food security and climate change presents a complex and pressing issue for the Global South. As the effects of climate change continue to intensify, the already challenging task of ensuring food security for the world's most vulnerable populations becomes even more daunting. This chapter will delve into the intricate relationship between food security and climate change, exploring the various ways in which these two issues intersect and the potential implications for the future.

Climate change is expected to exacerbate existing food insecurity issues in the Global South, particularly in regions already facing significant challenges such as drought, floods, and extreme weather events. These changes in climate patterns can disrupt agricultural production, reduce crop yields, and increase food prices, all of which can have a profound impact on food security. 

Moreover, climate change can also affect the nutritional quality of food. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can alter the composition of foods, affecting their nutrient content. This can have serious implications for public health, particularly for vulnerable populations who may already be facing malnutrition and dietary deficiencies.

In this chapter, we will explore these and other aspects of the food security-climate change nexus, examining the potential impacts, challenges, and opportunities for action. We will also discuss the role of various stakeholders, including governments, communities, and international organizations, in addressing these issues. 

The goal of this chapter is not only to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between food security and climate change but also to stimulate thought and action towards finding sustainable solutions to these pressing challenges. As we navigate through the uncertainties of the future, it is crucial to understand the potential implications of climate change on food security and to develop strategies to mitigate these impacts.




### Subsection: 13.3c Case Studies of Successful Gender Policies

In this section, we will explore some case studies of successful gender policies that have been implemented in different regions of the Global South. These case studies will provide real-world examples of how gender policies can be effectively implemented to address food security challenges.

#### Case Study 1: The Dominican Republic

In November 2009, the Dominican Republic became the first Latin American country to pledge to include a "gender perspective" in every information and communications technology (ICT) initiative and policy developed by the government. This was a significant step towards promoting gender equality in the region. The Dominicans chose the Gender Evaluation Methodology (GEM) as the tool to design and evaluate all public policies.

The GEM study in Chhattisgarh state in India revealed that despite the efforts to include women in local government, numerous technical problems related to the Simputers and ingrained inequalities, mean that even designated female representatives remain voiceless. This case study highlights the importance of considering gender-related inequalities in policy evaluation.

#### Case Study 2: Teacher Education Policy in India

In India, the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) has been instrumental in promoting gender equality in teacher education policy. The NCTE has implemented policies that ensure equal representation of women in teacher education institutions and promote gender sensitivity in teacher education curriculums.

A study conducted by the NCTE found that these policies have been effective in promoting gender equality in teacher education. The study found that there has been a significant increase in the number of women enrolled in teacher education institutions and a decrease in gender-based discrimination in teacher education curriculums.

#### Case Study 3: Gender Mainstreaming in Agriculture Policy in Uganda

In Uganda, the government has implemented a gender mainstreaming policy in agriculture to address the gender inequalities that exist in the sector. This policy aims to promote gender equality in resource allocation, decision-making processes, and access to information and technology.

A study conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) found that this policy has been successful in promoting gender equality in agriculture. The study found that there has been an increase in women's access to resources and decision-making processes, leading to improved food security for women and their families.

These case studies demonstrate the importance of implementing effective gender policies to address food security challenges in the Global South. They also highlight the need for ongoing monitoring and evaluation to ensure that these policies are achieving their intended goals.

Food security, as defined by the United Nations, is the condition in which all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food. It is a fundamental human right that is closely tied to health outcomes. However, in many urban areas of the Global South, food security is a significant challenge due to a variety of factors, including economic inequality, environmental degradation, and rapid urbanization.

The health implications of food security are profound. Inadequate food intake, poor diet quality, and food insecurity are associated with a range of health outcomes, including increased risk of diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, as well as negative impacts on maternal and child health. 

This chapter will explore these issues in depth, examining the current state of food security and health in urban areas of the Global South, and identifying key challenges and opportunities for improving food security and health outcomes. It will also discuss strategies for addressing these challenges, including policy recommendations, community-based initiatives, and innovative technologies.

The goal of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationship between food security and health, and to inform action towards achieving food security and improved health outcomes in urban areas of the Global South.

In this section, we will explore the different education strategies that can be used to promote food security in Cartagena.

#### 14.2a.1 Reciprocal Teaching

Reciprocal teaching is a strategy that can be used to promote food security in Cartagena. This strategy involves training students in specific and discrete strategies to prevent cognitive failure during reading. The strategy was first developed by Palincsar and Brown (1984) and involves four basic strategies: Questioning, Clarifying, Summarizing, and Predicting.

Questioning involves actively engaging with the text by asking questions about what has been read. This helps to clarify understanding and identify areas of confusion. Clarifying involves seeking answers to these questions. Summarizing involves condensing the main ideas of the text into a concise summary. Predicting involves using prior knowledge and the text's structure to make predictions about the direction of the text and the author's intent in writing.

The leader follows these four steps in this specific order:

1. Predicting: The prediction phase involves readers in actively combining their own background knowledge with what they have gathered from the text. With a narrative text, students imagine what might happen next. With an informational text, students predict what they might learn or read about in subsequent passages.

2. Questioning: The questioning phase involves students actively engaging with the text by asking questions about what has been read. This helps to clarify understanding and identify areas of confusion.

3. Clarifying: The clarifying phase involves seeking answers to these questions.

4. Summarizing: The summarizing phase involves condensing the main ideas of the text into a concise summary.

The sequence of reading, questioning, clarifying, summarizing, and predicting is then repeated with subsequent sections of text. Different reading strategies have been incorporated into the reciprocal teaching format by other practitioners. Some other reading strategies that can be used in the context of food security include:

- Visualizing: This involves creating mental images of the information being read. This can help to improve comprehension and retention of information.

- Annotating: This involves marking up the text with notes, questions, and comments. This can help to engage students with the text and make it more meaningful.

- Cooperative Learning: This involves students working together in small groups to learn and discuss the text. This can help to promote critical thinking and discussion about food security issues.

In the next section, we will explore how these education strategies can be implemented in the context of food security in Cartagena.

PBL is a student-centered pedagogy in which students learn about a subject through the experience of solving an open-ended problem. In the context of food security, PBL can be used to engage students in solving real-world problems related to food production, distribution, and consumption.

The PBL process typically involves the following steps:

1. Identifying the problem: Students are presented with a real-world problem related to food security. This could be a problem related to food production, such as how to increase crop yields in the face of climate change, or a problem related to food distribution, such as how to ensure that all members of the community have access to affordable and nutritious food.

2. Investigating the problem: Students conduct research to understand the problem in more detail. This could involve reading scientific articles, conducting experiments, or interviewing experts.

3. Developing a solution: Based on their research, students work together to develop a solution to the problem. This could involve proposing a new technology, policy, or educational program.

4. Implementing the solution: Students work together to implement their solution. This could involve building a prototype, advocating for a policy change, or teaching others about their solution.

5. Reflecting on the process: After implementing their solution, students reflect on what they have learned and how they have grown as a result of the PBL process.

PBL can be particularly effective in promoting food security because it allows students to apply their learning to real-world problems. It also encourages collaboration and problem-solving skills, which are essential for addressing complex food security issues.

## Chapter: Chapter 15: Food Security and Health

### Introduction

The city of Cartagena, located in the Caribbean coast of Colombia, is a vibrant and bustling metropolis, home to a diverse population with a rich cultural heritage. However, like many other cities in the Global South, Cartagena faces significant challenges in ensuring food security and health for its residents. This chapter, "Food Security and Health," delves into these challenges and explores potential solutions to improve the food security and health of the city's population.

Food security is a fundamental human right, yet it is a right that is often denied to the urban poor in developing countries. In Cartagena, the issue of food security is compounded by the city's rapid urbanization and the increasing demand for food. This has led to a variety of challenges, including food insecurity, malnutrition, and health issues. 

The chapter will also examine the role of health in food security. Poor health can lead to reduced food intake, which in turn can exacerbate health issues. Conversely, improved health can enhance food security by increasing the ability of individuals to access and consume food. 

In exploring these issues, the chapter will also consider the broader context of urbanization and development in Cartagena. It will examine how urbanization has impacted food security and health, and how development initiatives can be used to address these issues. 

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities related to food security and health in Cartagena. It is hoped that this understanding will inform action and policy-making to improve the food security and health of the city's population.




#### 14.3a Understanding Education Policies

Education policies play a crucial role in shaping the educational landscape of a country. They provide a framework for the organization, funding, and operation of educational institutions, including universities. These policies are often influenced by the broader societal context, including economic, political, and cultural factors.

#### 14.3a.1 Anglo-Saxon Education System

The Anglo-Saxon education system, also known as the Anglo-American education system, is characterized by a mass, partially private, and publicly inexpensive system. This system is often described as leading to a diverse range of educational opportunities, with a focus on individual choice and competition. However, it has also been criticized for its unequal distribution of resources and opportunities, particularly for disadvantaged students (Ansell, 2006).

#### 14.3a.2 Continental Education System

The Continental education system, on the other hand, is characterized by an elite, fully public, and inexpensive system. This system is often described as leading to a more uniform educational experience, with a focus on academic excellence and social mobility. However, it has also been criticized for its lack of diversity and individual choice (Ansell, 2006).

#### 14.3a.3 Scandinavian Education System

The Scandinavian education system is characterized by a mass, fully public, but highly expensive system. This system is often described as leading to a high-quality educational experience, with a focus on equity and social cohesion. However, it has also been criticized for its high costs and potential for educational inequality (Ansell, 2006).

#### 14.3a.4 Open Educational Resources (OER) Policy

Open Educational Resources (OER) policy is another important aspect of education policy. OER refers to educational materials that are freely available for anyone to use, modify, and share. OER policy aims to support the development and use of OER, with the goal of improving educational access and equity. However, there is ongoing debate about the most effective ways to implement OER policy, including the role of government policies and the impact on educational institutions (Hodgkinson-Williams & Trotter, 2010).

In the next section, we will explore the role of education policies in promoting food security in Cartagena.

#### 14.3b Role of Education Policies in Food Security

Education policies play a pivotal role in promoting food security in Cartagena. The city's food security is heavily influenced by the education policies of the country, particularly in terms of access to education, quality of education, and the inclusion of food security-related topics in the curriculum.

#### 14.3b.1 Access to Education

Access to education is a fundamental aspect of food security. Education provides individuals with the knowledge and skills needed to make informed decisions about food production, distribution, and consumption. It also helps to break the cycle of poverty and malnutrition, as educated individuals are more likely to earn higher incomes and have better access to nutritious food. The Anglo-Saxon education system, with its focus on individual choice and competition, can potentially provide more opportunities for disadvantaged students to access education, thereby improving their food security. However, the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities in this system can also exacerbate food insecurity for these students (Ansell, 2006).

#### 14.3b.2 Quality of Education

The quality of education is another crucial factor in food security. High-quality education equips individuals with the skills needed to participate in the food system, whether as producers, distributors, or consumers. It also helps to develop critical thinking skills that can be applied to address food-related issues. The Continental education system, with its focus on academic excellence and social mobility, can potentially provide high-quality education for all students, thereby improving food security. However, the lack of diversity and individual choice in this system can limit the development of these skills (Ansell, 2006).

#### 14.3b.3 Inclusion of Food Security-Related Topics in the Curriculum

The inclusion of food security-related topics in the curriculum is essential for promoting food security. These topics can help students understand the complex issues surrounding food production, distribution, and consumption, and develop strategies to address these issues. The Scandinavian education system, with its focus on equity and social cohesion, can potentially provide a supportive environment for discussing these topics. However, the high costs associated with this system can limit access to education for disadvantaged students, thereby exacerbating food insecurity (Ansell, 2006).

### Section: 15.1 Understanding Health:

Health is a fundamental aspect of human well-being and is closely tied to food security. In this section, we will explore the basics of health, including its definition and the various factors that contribute to it.

#### 15.1a Basics of Health

Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. It is a positive concept that emphasizes social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities. This definition highlights the holistic nature of health, encompassing not just physical health, but also mental and social well-being.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified five key dimensions of health: physical, mental, social, spiritual, and environmental. These dimensions are interconnected and influence each other, creating a complex web of factors that contribute to overall health.

Physical health refers to the condition of the body and its ability to function properly. It includes factors such as nutrition, exercise, and disease prevention. Mental health, on the other hand, refers to a person's emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It includes factors such as stress management, coping mechanisms, and social support.

Social health refers to a person's ability to interact with others and maintain healthy relationships. It includes factors such as social skills, communication, and empathy. Spiritual health refers to a person's sense of purpose, meaning, and values in life. It includes factors such as spiritual beliefs, meditation, and mindfulness.

Environmental health refers to the impact of the environment on a person's health. It includes factors such as air and water quality, exposure to toxins, and access to green spaces. These dimensions are not mutually exclusive and work together to influence a person's overall health.

In addition to these dimensions, there are also various factors that can impact a person's health. These include genetics, lifestyle choices, and environmental factors. Genetics play a role in determining a person's susceptibility to certain diseases and conditions. However, lifestyle choices and environmental factors can also have a significant impact on a person's health.

Lifestyle choices, such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and poor diet, can increase the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Environmental factors, such as air and water pollution, can also have a negative impact on a person's health.

In the next section, we will explore the relationship between health and food security, and how food insecurity can have a detrimental effect on a person's health.

## Chapter: Feeding Cities in the Global South: Challenges and Opportunities for Action in Cartagena

### Introduction:

In recent years, the issue of food waste has gained significant attention in the global community. As the world's population continues to grow and urbanization increases, the amount of food waste generated has become a major concern. In the Global South, where resources are often limited, food waste not only has environmental implications but also has a direct impact on food security and nutrition. This chapter will explore the challenges and opportunities for addressing food waste in the context of urban areas in the Global South, specifically in Cartagena, Colombia.

Food waste is defined as any food that is discarded or uneaten, whether it is still edible or not. It is estimated that approximately one-third of all food produced globally is wasted, amounting to about 1.3 billion tons per year. In developing countries, food waste is often a result of inadequate infrastructure and storage facilities, as well as limited access to technology and resources. However, even in developed countries, food waste is a significant issue, with an estimated 40% of all food produced being wasted.

The impact of food waste goes beyond just the amount of food that is wasted. It also has significant economic, social, and environmental implications. In terms of economics, food waste represents a loss of resources, including land, water, and labor, which are all necessary for food production. In addition, food waste can also contribute to food insecurity and malnutrition, especially in developing countries where resources are limited. From an environmental perspective, food waste contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and landfill waste, which can have long-term consequences for the environment.

In this chapter, we will explore the challenges and opportunities for addressing food waste in urban areas in the Global South. We will examine the current state of food waste in Cartagena and the factors that contribute to it. We will also discuss potential solutions and strategies for reducing food waste, including policy recommendations and community-based initiatives. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the complex issue of food waste and the importance of addressing it in the context of urban areas in the Global South.

In this section, we will explore the basics of infrastructure and its importance in addressing food security challenges in Cartagena.

#### 16.1a Basics of Infrastructure

Infrastructure can be broadly categorized into two types: hard infrastructure and soft infrastructure. Hard infrastructure refers to the physical structures and systems, such as transportation networks, storage facilities, and processing plants, that are essential for food production and distribution. Soft infrastructure, on the other hand, refers to the policies, regulations, and institutions that govern the food system.

In Cartagena, the lack of adequate infrastructure has been a major challenge in ensuring food security. The city's transportation network, for example, is inadequate and unreliable, making it difficult for farmers to transport their produce to markets. This not only leads to food waste but also limits the availability of fresh and nutritious food options for urban residents.

Moreover, the city's food storage and processing facilities are also inadequate. This is particularly problematic for perishable foods, which require proper storage and processing to prevent spoilage. The lack of these facilities not only leads to food waste but also limits the diversity of food options available in the city.

In addition to physical infrastructure, soft infrastructure is also crucial for food security. In Cartagena, the lack of clear policies and regulations has led to inefficiencies and corruption in the food system. This has resulted in limited access to resources and opportunities for small-scale farmers, who are the backbone of the city's food production.

Furthermore, the lack of strong institutions and organizations to support the food system has also been a major challenge. This has led to a lack of coordination and communication between different stakeholders, hindering the efficient and equitable distribution of food.

To address these challenges, it is essential to invest in both hard and soft infrastructure. This includes improving transportation networks, building more efficient storage and processing facilities, and implementing policies and regulations that promote fair and equitable access to resources and opportunities for all stakeholders in the food system.

In the next section, we will explore the role of technology in addressing food security challenges in Cartagena.





### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the complex relationship between food security and infrastructure in the context of Cartagena, a city in the Global South.
