### Introduction

Queueing theory is a mathematical framework used to model and analyze systems where customers or jobs arrive, wait in a queue, and are eventually served. It has been widely applied in various fields such as telecommunications, computer systems, and manufacturing. In this chapter, we will focus on the M/M/s type systems, which are fundamental to understanding queueing theory.

The M/M/s type systems are a class of queueing models where customers arrive at a single queue, wait in the queue, and are served by a single server. The arrival process is memoryless (M), the service time is exponentially distributed (M), and there are s servers (s). This simple yet powerful model provides valuable insights into the behavior of queueing systems.

We will begin by introducing the basic concepts of queueing theory, including the key parameters that describe the performance of a queueing system. We will then delve into the M/M/s type systems, exploring their characteristics, performance measures, and stability conditions. We will also discuss the impact of varying the number of servers on the system's performance.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of the M/M/s type systems and their role in queueing theory. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the more advanced applications of queueing theory covered in subsequent chapters.




### Subsection: 1.1a Definition and Components of Queueing Systems

Queueing systems are mathematical models used to study the behavior of systems where customers or jobs arrive, wait in a queue, and are eventually served. These systems are ubiquitous in various fields such as telecommunications, computer systems, and manufacturing. The M/M/s type systems are a fundamental class of queueing models that provide valuable insights into the behavior of queueing systems.

#### Definition of Queueing Systems

A queueing system is a mathematical model that describes the behavior of a system where customers or jobs arrive, wait in a queue, and are eventually served. The system is characterized by three key components: the arrival process, the queue, and the service process.

The arrival process describes how customers or jobs enter the system. In the M/M/s type systems, the arrival process is memoryless, meaning that the probability of an arrival in a given time interval is independent of the number of customers already in the system. This is often referred to as the Poisson assumption.

The queue is the waiting area where customers or jobs wait until they are served. In the M/M/s type systems, the queue is assumed to be infinite, meaning that there is no limit to the number of customers that can be in the system.

The service process describes how customers or jobs are served. In the M/M/s type systems, the service time is exponentially distributed, meaning that the time it takes to serve a customer or job follows an exponential distribution. This is often referred to as the Erlang assumption.

#### Components of Queueing Systems

The M/M/s type systems are characterized by three key parameters: the arrival rate, the service rate, and the number of servers.

The arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, is the average number of customers or jobs that arrive at the system per unit time.

The service rate, denoted by $\mu$, is the average number of customers or jobs that can be served by the system per unit time.

The number of servers, denoted by $s$, is the number of servers available to serve customers or jobs in the system.

These parameters are used to define the traffic intensity, denoted by $\rho$, which is given by the formula $\rho = \frac{\lambda}{s\mu}$. The traffic intensity is a key factor in determining the stability of the system. If the traffic intensity is greater than one, the queue will grow without bound, and the system is said to be unstable. If the traffic intensity is less than one, the system is said to be stable, and the queue will eventually shrink to zero.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the M/M/s type systems, exploring their characteristics, performance measures, and stability conditions. We will also discuss the impact of varying the number of servers on the system's performance.




### Subsection: 1.1b Characteristics of Queueing Systems

Queueing systems, particularly the M/M/s type systems, exhibit several key characteristics that are fundamental to their operation and analysis. These characteristics include:

#### 1.1b.1 Stability

Stability is a critical characteristic of queueing systems. A queueing system is said to be stable if the queue length remains bounded over time. In the M/M/s type systems, stability is typically achieved when the arrival rate is less than the service rate, i.e., $\lambda < \mu$. This condition ensures that the system can handle the incoming traffic without the queue length growing without bound.

#### 1.1b.2 Utilization

Utilization is another important characteristic of queueing systems. It represents the proportion of time that the system is busy serving customers or jobs. In the M/M/s type systems, the utilization is given by the Erlang-C formula:

$$
U = \frac{\lambda}{\mu - \lambda} \left(1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \frac{\lambda}{\mu})^{\mu / \lambda} - 1}\right)
$$

where $U$ is the utilization, $\lambda$ is the arrival rate, and $\mu$ is the service rate.

#### 1.1b.3 Response Time

Response time is the average time a customer or job spends in the system, from arrival to departure. In the M/M/s type systems, the response time is typically long due to the memoryless arrival and service processes. The response time can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average response time is equal to the average queue length divided by the arrival rate.

#### 1.1b.4 Little's Law

Little's Law is a fundamental law in queueing theory that relates the average queue length, the arrival rate, and the response time. It states that the average queue length $L$ is equal to the arrival rate $\lambda$ times the average response time $W$:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

This law is particularly useful in the M/M/s type systems, where the arrival and service processes are memoryless.

#### 1.1b.5 Erlang's Loss Formula

Erlang's Loss Formula is another fundamental result in queueing theory. It provides an expression for the probability that a customer or job is lost (i.e., does not enter the system) due to the queue being full. In the M/M/s type systems, this probability is given by:

$$
L = \frac{\lambda^s P_s}{\mu^s} \frac{1}{(s - 1)!}
$$

where $L$ is the loss probability, $\lambda$ is the arrival rate, $\mu$ is the service rate, $s$ is the number of servers, and $P_s$ is the probability that all $s$ servers are busy.

These characteristics provide a foundation for understanding and analyzing queueing systems. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these characteristics and explore how they are influenced by the parameters of the system.




### Subsection: 1.2a Definition and Properties of Markovian Arrival Process

The Markovian Arrival Process (MAP) is a fundamental concept in queueing theory, particularly in the M/M/s type systems. It is a special case of the more general Markovian Process, which is a mathematical model used to describe systems that transition between a finite set of states in a memoryless manner.

#### 1.2a.1 Definition of Markovian Arrival Process

The Markovian Arrival Process is a discrete-time stochastic process that describes the arrival of customers or jobs to a queueing system. It is characterized by the Markov property, which states that the future state of the system depends only on its current state, and not on its past states. This property is particularly useful in queueing theory, as it allows us to model systems where the arrival rate is constant over time.

The MAP can be represented as a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC), where the state space is the set of non-negative integers representing the number of customers in the system. The transition probabilities from state $i$ to state $j$ are given by $p_{ij}$, where $p_{ij}$ is the probability of transitioning from $i$ customers to $j$ customers in one time step.

#### 1.2a.2 Properties of Markovian Arrival Process

The Markovian Arrival Process has several important properties that make it a useful tool in queueing theory. These properties include:

##### 1.2a.2.1 Stationarity

The MAP is a stationary process, meaning that its statistical properties do not change over time. This is a direct consequence of the Markov property, which ensures that the future state of the system depends only on its current state, and not on its past states.

##### 1.2a.2.2 Memorylessness

The MAP is a memoryless process, meaning that the future state of the system does not depend on its past states. This property is particularly useful in queueing theory, as it allows us to model systems where the arrival rate is constant over time.

##### 1.2a.2.3 Ergodicity

The MAP is an ergodic process, meaning that its long-term behavior is the same as its short-term behavior. This property is important in queueing theory, as it allows us to make long-term predictions about the system based on short-term observations.

##### 1.2a.2.4 Communicating Classes

The MAP can be divided into communicating classes, which are subsets of the state space where it is possible to transition from any state to any other state within the class. This property is useful in queueing theory, as it allows us to model systems where customers can move freely between different queues.

##### 1.2a.2.5 Transience, Recurrence, and Positive and Null Recurrence

The MAP can be transient, recurrent, or positive or null recurrent, depending on the values of the transition probabilities $p_{ij}$. These properties are important in queueing theory, as they determine the long-term behavior of the system.

##### 1.2a.2.6 Existence of a Stationary Distribution

The MAP has a stationary distribution, which is the probability distribution to which the process converges for large values of time. This property is important in queueing theory, as it allows us to calculate the long-term behavior of the system.

In the next section, we will explore how these properties of the Markovian Arrival Process are used in the analysis of queueing systems.




### Section: 1.2b Arrival Rate and Arrival Time Distribution

The arrival rate and arrival time distribution are two fundamental concepts in queueing theory that are closely related to the Markovian Arrival Process. They provide valuable insights into the behavior of the queueing system and are essential for understanding the performance of the system.

#### 1.2b.1 Arrival Rate

The arrival rate, often denoted as $\lambda$, is the average number of customers arriving at the system per unit time. It is a key parameter in the M/M/s type systems, as it determines the rate at which the system becomes congested. The arrival rate is typically assumed to be constant over time, which is a direct consequence of the Markov property of the MAP.

The arrival rate can be calculated from the transition probabilities of the MAP. If we denote the one-step transition probability matrix of the MAP as $P$, then the arrival rate $\lambda$ can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of transitioning from state 0 to state 1, i.e., $\lambda = \sum_{i=0}^{N} p_{i,i+1}$.

#### 1.2b.2 Arrival Time Distribution

The arrival time distribution describes the probability of a customer arriving at the system at a given time. It is a crucial concept in queueing theory, as it provides insights into the variability of the arrival process.

The arrival time distribution can be calculated from the MAP. If we denote the arrival time distribution as $A(t)$, then $A(t)$ is given by the sum of the probabilities of transitioning from state 0 to state 1 in time $t$, i.e., $A(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{N} p_{i,i+1}(t)$.

#### 1.2b.3 Relationship between Arrival Rate and Arrival Time Distribution

The arrival rate and arrival time distribution are closely related. The arrival rate $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate over time, while the arrival time distribution $A(t)$ describes the variability of the arrival process over time. The arrival rate and arrival time distribution are often used together to characterize the arrival process in queueing theory.

In the next section, we will discuss how these concepts are applied in the M/M/s type systems.




### Section: 1.3 Exponential Service Time

The service time is a critical parameter in queueing theory, as it determines the amount of time a customer spends in the system. In the M/M/s type systems, the service time is often assumed to be exponentially distributed. This assumption is based on the fact that the exponential distribution is memoryless, meaning that the time between events (e.g., service completions) is independent of the time that has elapsed since the last event. This property is particularly useful in queueing theory, as it allows us to model systems where the service time is not constant, but varies in a random manner.

#### 1.3a Definition and Properties of Exponential Service Time

The exponential service time distribution is defined by a single parameter, the mean service time $\mu$. The probability density function of the service time $s$ is given by:

$$
f(s) = \mu e^{-\mu s}
$$

The mean service time $\mu$ is the average amount of time a customer spends in the system. It is a key parameter in the M/M/s type systems, as it determines the rate at which customers are served.

The exponential service time distribution has several important properties that make it a useful tool in queueing theory. These include:

1. The service time is memoryless: As mentioned earlier, the exponential distribution is memoryless, meaning that the time between service completions is independent of the time that has elapsed since the last service completion. This property is particularly useful in queueing theory, as it allows us to model systems where the service time is not constant, but varies in a random manner.

2. The service time is continuous: The exponential distribution is a continuous distribution, meaning that the service time can take on any non-negative value. This is in contrast to discrete distributions, where the service time can only take on certain discrete values.

3. The service time is skewed to the right: The exponential distribution is skewed to the right, meaning that there is a higher probability of longer service times than shorter service times. This is a common characteristic of many real-world systems, where service times can vary significantly.

4. The service time is independent of the arrival process: The exponential service time distribution is independent of the arrival process, meaning that the service time is not affected by the arrival rate or the arrival time distribution. This property is particularly useful in queueing theory, as it allows us to model systems where the service time is not affected by the arrival process.

In the next section, we will discuss how the exponential service time distribution can be used to model and analyze queueing systems.

#### 1.3b Exponential Service Time in M/M/s Type Systems

In the M/M/s type systems, the exponential service time distribution is particularly useful due to its ability to capture the variability in service times. This variability is often observed in real-world systems, where service times can vary significantly due to factors such as task complexity, system load, and human error.

The M/M/s type systems are a class of queueing models where customers arrive at a single queue according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$, are served by $s$ servers, and the service time is exponentially distributed with mean $\mu$. The system is assumed to be stable, meaning that the average number of customers in the system is finite.

The exponential service time distribution in the M/M/s type systems has several important implications for the system's performance. These include:

1. The response time is exponentially distributed: The response time, or the total amount of time a job spends in the system, is exponentially distributed when the service time is exponentially distributed. This is a direct consequence of the memoryless property of the exponential distribution. The mean response time can be calculated as the sum of the mean service time and the mean waiting time, which is given by Little's Law.

2. The average response time is proportional to the system load: The average response time is proportional to the system load, which is defined as the ratio of the arrival rate to the service rate. This relationship is known as Little's Law and is a fundamental result in queueing theory. It states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system.

3. The system is stable for low system loads: The M/M/s type systems are stable for low system loads, meaning that the average number of customers in the system is finite. This is a direct consequence of the Little's Law relationship. As the system load increases, the average response time also increases, leading to longer queues and potentially unacceptable system performance.

4. The system is unstable for high system loads: Conversely, the M/M/s type systems are unstable for high system loads, meaning that the average number of customers in the system is infinite. This is a direct consequence of the Little's Law relationship. As the system load increases, the average response time also increases, leading to longer queues and potentially unacceptable system performance.

In the next section, we will discuss how the exponential service time distribution can be used to model and analyze queueing systems with multiple servers.

#### 1.3c Exponential Service Time in Real World Scenarios

In real-world scenarios, the assumption of exponential service time distribution is often a reasonable approximation. This is because many systems exhibit a certain degree of randomness in their service times, which can be modeled by an exponential distribution. However, it is important to note that this assumption may not hold in all cases, and other distributions may be more appropriate in certain scenarios.

One common real-world scenario where the exponential service time distribution is applicable is in call centers. In a call center, customers call in with various inquiries, and the service time is the amount of time it takes for an agent to resolve the inquiry. The service time can vary significantly due to factors such as the complexity of the inquiry, the agent's expertise, and the availability of relevant information. The exponential service time distribution can be used to model this variability, and can provide insights into the system's performance and potential areas for improvement.

Another scenario where the exponential service time distribution is often used is in manufacturing. In a manufacturing setting, the service time is the amount of time it takes to process a job, which can involve various operations such as machining, assembly, and testing. The service time can vary due to factors such as the complexity of the job, the availability of resources, and the skill level of the workers. The exponential service time distribution can be used to model this variability, and can help in optimizing the manufacturing process to reduce the average response time and improve overall system performance.

However, it is important to note that the exponential service time distribution assumes that the service times are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). In some real-world scenarios, this assumption may not hold. For example, in a hospital emergency room, the service time can be influenced by factors such as the severity of the patient's condition, the availability of resources, and the skill level of the medical staff. In such cases, other distributions such as the Weibull or the Pareto distribution may be more appropriate.

In conclusion, the exponential service time distribution is a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing queueing systems. However, it is important to understand its assumptions and limitations, and to use it appropriately in the context of the specific real-world scenario.




### Section: 1.3 Exponential Service Time

The service time is a critical parameter in queueing theory, as it determines the amount of time a customer spends in the system. In the M/M/s type systems, the service time is often assumed to be exponentially distributed. This assumption is based on the fact that the exponential distribution is memoryless, meaning that the time between events (e.g., service completions) is independent of the time that has elapsed since the last event. This property is particularly useful in queueing theory, as it allows us to model systems where the service time is not constant, but varies in a random manner.

#### 1.3a Definition and Properties of Exponential Service Time

The exponential service time distribution is defined by a single parameter, the mean service time $\mu$. The probability density function of the service time $s$ is given by:

$$
f(s) = \mu e^{-\mu s}
$$

The mean service time $\mu$ is the average amount of time a customer spends in the system. It is a key parameter in the M/M/s type systems, as it determines the rate at which customers are served.

The exponential service time distribution has several important properties that make it a useful tool in queueing theory. These include:

1. The service time is memoryless: As mentioned earlier, the exponential distribution is memoryless, meaning that the time between service completions is independent of the time that has elapsed since the last service completion. This property is particularly useful in queueing theory, as it allows us to model systems where the service time is not constant, but varies in a random manner.

2. The service time is continuous: The exponential distribution is a continuous distribution, meaning that the service time can take on any non-negative value. This is in contrast to discrete distributions, where the service time can only take on certain discrete values.

3. The service time is skewed to the right: The exponential distribution is skewed to the right, meaning that there are more values of the service time that are greater than the mean than there are values that are less than the mean. This property is useful in queueing theory, as it allows us to model systems where the service time can be longer than the average.

#### 1.3b Service Rate and Service Time Distribution

The service rate is another important parameter in queueing theory. It is defined as the average number of customers that can be served per unit time. In the M/M/s type systems, the service rate is often assumed to be constant. However, in more advanced applications, the service rate may vary over time.

The service time distribution is the probability distribution of the service time. In the M/M/s type systems, the service time is often assumed to be exponentially distributed. However, in more advanced applications, the service time distribution may be more complex and may not follow a simple exponential distribution.

The relationship between the service rate and service time distribution is an important aspect of queueing theory. The service rate determines the rate at which customers are served, while the service time distribution determines the amount of time a customer spends in the system. By understanding the relationship between these two parameters, we can better model and analyze queueing systems.

### Subsection: 1.3c Impact of Exponential Service Time on System Performance

The exponential service time distribution has a significant impact on the performance of queueing systems. As mentioned earlier, the exponential distribution is memoryless, meaning that the time between service completions is independent of the time that has elapsed since the last service completion. This property is particularly useful in queueing theory, as it allows us to model systems where the service time is not constant, but varies in a random manner.

The exponential service time distribution also has a direct impact on the average queue length and waiting time in the system. As the service time is exponentially distributed, the average queue length and waiting time can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average queue length is equal to the average waiting time multiplied by the average arrival rate. This relationship is particularly useful in queueing theory, as it allows us to analyze the performance of queueing systems by studying the service time distribution.

In addition, the exponential service time distribution also affects the utilization of the system. The utilization is defined as the ratio of the average queue length to the average service time. In the M/M/s type systems, the utilization is often assumed to be constant. However, in more advanced applications, the utilization may vary over time. By understanding the relationship between the service time distribution and the utilization, we can better analyze the performance of queueing systems and make informed decisions about system design and management.

In conclusion, the exponential service time distribution plays a crucial role in queueing theory. Its properties, such as memorylessness and continuous distribution, make it a useful tool for modeling and analyzing queueing systems. By understanding the impact of the exponential service time distribution on system performance, we can gain valuable insights into the behavior of queueing systems and make informed decisions about system design and management.


## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications




### Subsection: 1.4a Analysis of M/M/1 Queue

The M/M/1 queue is a fundamental model in queueing theory, where customers arrive at a single server according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$ and service times are exponentially distributed with mean $\mu$. In this section, we will analyze the M/M/1 queue and derive important performance measures such as the average number of customers in the system, the average queue length, and the average waiting time.

#### 1.4a.1 Stationary Analysis

The M/M/1 queue has a stationary distribution if the traffic intensity $\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu} < 1$. The probability mass function of the number of customers in the system $k$ is given by:

$$
\pi_k = \begin{cases}
(1-\rho)\rho^k, & \text{if } k < c \\
\frac{(1-\rho)\rho^k}{c^{k-c}}, & \text{if } k \geq c
\end{cases}
$$

The probability that an arriving customer is forced to join the queue (all servers are occupied) is given by Erlang's C formula:

$$
C(c,\lambda/\mu) = \frac{(\frac{\lambda}{\mu})^c)}{c!} \sum_{k=c}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k(k-1)\cdots(k-c+1)}
$$

The average number of customers in the system (in service and in queue) is given by:

$$
L = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho} \text{ C}(c,\lambda/\mu) + c \rho
$$

#### 1.4a.2 Busy Period of Server

The busy period of the M/M/1 queue is the time interval during which the server is busy serving customers. It can be defined in two ways: the busy period of the server up to the $k$-th departure, or the busy period of the server up to the $k$-th arrival. The Laplace–Stieltjes transform of the distribution of the busy period up to the $k$-th departure $T_k$ is given by:

$$
\eta_k(s) = \frac{1}{s} \left( \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \right)^k \frac{1}{k!} L_k(s)
$$

where $L_k(s)$ is the Laplace–Stieltjes transform of the distribution of the busy period up to the $k$-th arrival. The Laplace–Stieltjes transform of the distribution of the busy period up to the $k$-th arrival is given by:

$$
\eta_k(s) = \frac{1}{s} \left( \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \right)^k \frac{1}{k!} L_k(s)
$$

where $L_k(s)$ is the Laplace–Stieltjes transform of the distribution of the busy period up to the $k$-th arrival.

#### 1.4a.3 Response Time

The response time is the total amount of time a customer spends in both the queue and in service. The average response time is the same for all work conserving service disciplines and is given by:

$$
W = \frac{L}{c\mu - \lambda} + \frac{1}{\mu}
$$

In the next section, we will discuss the M/M/c queue, where there are $c$ servers.




### Subsection: 1.4b Performance Measures of M/M/1 Queue

The M/M/1 queue is a fundamental model in queueing theory, and its performance measures are of great interest to both theorists and practitioners. In this section, we will discuss some of the key performance measures of the M/M/1 queue.

#### 1.4b.1 Average Number of Customers in the System

The average number of customers in the system, denoted as $L$, is a measure of the system's congestion. It represents the average number of customers in the system, including those being served and those waiting in the queue. The average number of customers in the system can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
L = \lambda \cdot E[T]
$$

where $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate and $E[T]$ is the average time a customer spends in the system.

#### 1.4b.2 Average Queue Length

The average queue length, denoted as $L_q$, is a measure of the average number of customers waiting in the queue. It is calculated as the difference between the average number of customers in the system and the average number of servers in use. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
L_q = L - c \cdot \rho
$$

where $c$ is the number of servers and $\rho$ is the traffic intensity, defined as the ratio of the average arrival rate to the average service rate.

#### 1.4b.3 Average Waiting Time

The average waiting time, denoted as $W$, is a measure of the average time a customer spends waiting in the queue. It is calculated as the average queue length divided by the average arrival rate. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
W = \frac{L_q}{\lambda}
$$

#### 1.4b.4 Average Response Time

The average response time, denoted as $R$, is a measure of the average time a customer spends in the system, including both the waiting time and the service time. It is calculated as the sum of the average waiting time and the average service time. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
R = W + \frac{1}{\mu}
$$

where $\mu$ is the average service rate.

#### 1.4b.5 Little's Law

Little's Law is a fundamental result in queueing theory that relates the average number of customers in the system, the average arrival rate, and the average time a customer spends in the system. It can be expressed as:

$$
L = \lambda \cdot E[T]
$$

where $L$ is the average number of customers in the system, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate, and $E[T]$ is the average time a customer spends in the system.

#### 1.4b.6 Erlang's C Formula

Erlang's C formula is a formula used to calculate the probability that an arriving customer will find all servers busy and have to wait in the queue. It is defined as:

$$
C(c,\lambda/\mu) = \frac{(\frac{\lambda}{\mu})^c)}{c!} \sum_{k=c}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k(k-1)\cdots(k-c+1)}
$$

$$
\eta_k(s) = \frac{1}{s} \left( \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \right)^k \frac{1}{k!} L_k(s)

where $L$ is the average number of customers in the system, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate, and $E[T]$ is the average time a customer spends in the system.

#### 1.5a.47 Erlang's Loss Formula for Multiple Servers with Different Service Times

Erlang's Loss Formula can also be extended to multiple servers with different service times. The formula calculates the probability that a customer will be lost in the system. It is particularly useful in systems where there are multiple servers with different service times. The formula


#### 1.5b Performance Measures of M/M/s Queue

The performance of the M/M/s queue can be evaluated using various performance measures. These measures provide insights into the system's efficiency, congestion, and customer experience. In this section, we will discuss some of the key performance measures for the M/M/s queue.

#### 1.5b.1 Average Number of Customers in the System

As discussed in the previous section, the average number of customers in the system, denoted as $L$, is a measure of the system's congestion. It represents the average number of customers in the system, including those being served and those waiting in the queue. The average number of customers in the system can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
L = \lambda \cdot E[T]
$$

where $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate and $E[T]$ is the average time a customer spends in the system.

#### 1.5b.2 Average Queue Length

The average queue length, denoted as $L_q$, is a measure of the average number of customers waiting in the queue. It is calculated as the difference between the average number of customers in the system and the average number of servers in use. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
L_q = L - c \cdot \rho
$$

where $c$ is the number of servers and $\rho$ is the traffic intensity, defined as the ratio of the average arrival rate to the average service rate.

#### 1.5b.3 Average Waiting Time

The average waiting time, denoted as $W$, is a measure of the average time a customer spends waiting in the queue. It is calculated as the average queue length divided by the average arrival rate. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
W = \frac{L_q}{\lambda}
$$

#### 1.5b.4 Average Response Time

The average response time, denoted as $R$, is a measure of the average time a customer spends in the system. It is calculated as the sum of the average waiting time and the average service time. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
R = W + E[T]
$$

where $E[T]$ is the average service time.

#### 1.5b.5 Utilization

The utilization, denoted as $\rho$, is a measure of the system's efficiency. It represents the proportion of time that the servers are busy serving customers. The utilization can be calculated as the ratio of the average arrival rate to the average service rate. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}
$$

where $\mu$ is the average service rate.

#### 1.5b.6 Little's Law

Little's Law is a fundamental law in queueing theory that relates the average number of customers in the system, the average arrival rate, and the average time a customer spends in the system. It can be expressed as:

$$
L = \lambda \cdot E[T]
$$

where $L$ is the average number of customers in the system, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate, and $E[T]$ is the average time a customer spends in the system.

#### 1.5b.7 Erlang's Loss Formula

Erlang's Loss Formula is another fundamental law in queueing theory that relates the average number of customers in the system, the average arrival rate, and the average service rate. It can be expressed as:

$$
L = \frac{\lambda^c \cdot (c \cdot \rho)^d \cdot e^{-c \cdot \rho}}{c^{c \cdot d} \cdot d!}
$$

where $L$ is the average number of customers in the system, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate, $\mu$ is the average service rate, $c$ is the number of servers, and $d$ is the number of queues.

#### 1.5b.8 Erlang's C Formula

Erlang's C Formula is a variation of Erlang's Loss Formula that is used when the arrival rate is not constant. It can be expressed as:

$$
L = \frac{\lambda^c \cdot (c \cdot \rho)^d \cdot e^{-c \cdot \rho}}{c^{c \cdot d} \cdot d!} \cdot \frac{1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot t}}{t}
$$

where $L$ is the average number of customers in the system, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate, $\mu$ is the average service rate, $c$ is the number of servers, $d$ is the number of queues, and $t$ is the time interval over which the arrival rate is constant.

#### 1.5b.9 Erlang's B Formula

Erlang's B Formula is another variation of Erlang's Loss Formula that is used when the arrival rate is not constant. It can be expressed as:

$$
L = \frac{\lambda^c \cdot (c \cdot \rho)^d \cdot e^{-c \cdot \rho}}{c^{c \cdot d} \cdot d!} \cdot \frac{1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot t}}{t} \cdot \frac{1 - e^{-c \cdot \rho}}{c \cdot \rho}
$$

where $L$ is the average number of customers in the system, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate, $\mu$ is the average service rate, $c$ is the number of servers, $d$ is the number of queues, and $t$ is the time interval over which the arrival rate is constant.

#### 1.5b.10 Erlang's CCD Formula

Erlang's CCD Formula is a more general version of Erlang's Loss Formula that can handle non-constant arrival rates and service rates. It can be expressed as:

$$
L = \frac{\lambda^c \cdot (c \cdot \rho)^d \cdot e^{-c \cdot \rho}}{c^{c \cdot d} \cdot d!} \cdot \frac{1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot t}}{t} \cdot \frac{1 - e^{-c \cdot \rho}}{c \cdot \rho} \cdot \frac{1 - e^{-(c \cdot \rho)^2 \cdot t}}{(c \cdot \rho)^2 \cdot t}
$$

where $L$ is the average number of customers in the system, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate, $\mu$ is the average service rate, $c$ is the number of servers, $d$ is the number of queues, and $t$ is the time interval over which the arrival rate and service rate are constant.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the fundamental concepts of queueing theory, specifically Little's Law and its generalizations. These concepts are essential in understanding the behavior of queueing systems and predicting their performance. We will explore the mathematical foundations of these concepts and their applications in various real-world scenarios.

Little's Law, named after the British mathematician John Little, is a fundamental law in queueing theory that relates the average number of customers in a queueing system to the average time a customer spends in the system. It is a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems and predicting their performance. We will begin by discussing Little's Law and its implications in detail.

We will then move on to explore the generalizations of Little's Law, which allow us to analyze more complex queueing systems. These generalizations include the use of multiple servers, multiple queues, and the presence of multiple classes of customers. We will also discuss the concept of traffic intensity and its role in queueing theory.

Throughout this chapter, we will use mathematical notation to express these concepts. For example, we will denote the average number of customers in a queueing system as `$\lambda$` and the average time a customer spends in the system as `$\mu$`. We will also use the popular Markdown format to present our content, making it easy to read and understand.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of Little's Law and its generalizations, and be able to apply them to analyze and predict the performance of queueing systems. So let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of queueing theory!




### Section: 2.1 Arrival Rate and Arrival Process:

In queueing theory, the arrival rate and arrival process play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of queueing systems. The arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, is the average number of customers arriving at the system per unit time. It is a key parameter in Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in a queueing system is equal to the arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system.

The arrival process, on the other hand, describes the pattern or distribution of arrivals at the system. It can be deterministic, where arrivals occur at fixed intervals, or stochastic, where arrivals occur randomly according to some probability distribution. The type of arrival process can significantly impact the performance of a queueing system.

#### 2.1a Definition and Calculation of Arrival Rate

The arrival rate, $\lambda$, can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
\lambda = \frac{\text{Total number of arrivals}}{\text{Total time period}}
$$

For example, if a queueing system has 100 arrivals in a time period of 10 minutes, the arrival rate would be $\lambda = \frac{100}{10} = 10$ arrivals per minute.

In some cases, the arrival rate may not be constant and can vary over time. In such cases, the arrival rate can be calculated using a more complex formula that takes into account the variation over time.

#### 2.1b Types of Arrival Processes

As mentioned earlier, the arrival process can be deterministic or stochastic. In a deterministic arrival process, arrivals occur at fixed intervals. This can be represented by a step function, where the arrival rate is constant over each time interval.

On the other hand, in a stochastic arrival process, arrivals occur randomly according to some probability distribution. This can be represented by a continuous function, where the arrival rate can vary over time. The arrival process can be further classified into two types: Poisson and non-Poisson.

##### Poisson Arrival Process

The Poisson arrival process is a special case of the stochastic arrival process. It assumes that arrivals occur independently and at a constant rate. This means that the probability of an arrival occurring in a given time interval is the same as the probability of an arrival occurring in any other time interval. The arrival rate in a Poisson process is denoted by $\lambda$ and is constant over time.

The Poisson arrival process is often used to model systems where arrivals are random and independent. It is commonly used in queueing theory to model systems where customers arrive at a service facility.

##### Non-Poisson Arrival Process

In contrast to the Poisson arrival process, the non-Poisson arrival process does not assume that arrivals are independent or at a constant rate. This means that the probability of an arrival occurring in a given time interval may not be the same as the probability of an arrival occurring in any other time interval. The arrival rate in a non-Poisson process can vary over time and is often described by a probability distribution.

The non-Poisson arrival process is commonly used to model systems where arrivals are dependent or where the arrival rate varies over time. It is often used in queueing theory to model systems where customers arrive at a service facility with varying service requirements.

#### 2.1c Impact of Arrival Rate and Process on Queueing Systems

The arrival rate and arrival process have a significant impact on the performance of queueing systems. The arrival rate determines the rate at which customers enter the system, while the arrival process determines the pattern or distribution of these arrivals.

In general, a higher arrival rate can lead to longer queues and higher waiting times, which can negatively impact the performance of a queueing system. However, the impact of the arrival rate can be mitigated by increasing the number of servers or implementing other queue management strategies.

The type of arrival process can also impact the performance of a queueing system. A Poisson arrival process, with its constant arrival rate, can lead to more predictable queueing behavior. However, it may not accurately model systems where arrivals are dependent or where the arrival rate varies over time. In such cases, a non-Poisson arrival process may be more appropriate.

In conclusion, understanding the arrival rate and arrival process is crucial in analyzing and optimizing queueing systems. It allows us to predict the behavior of the system and implement strategies to improve its performance. 


## Chapter 2: Little’s Law and Generalizations:




### Section: 2.1 Arrival Rate and Arrival Process:

In queueing theory, the arrival rate and arrival process play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of queueing systems. The arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, is the average number of customers arriving at the system per unit time. It is a key parameter in Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in a queueing system is equal to the arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system.

The arrival process, on the other hand, describes the pattern or distribution of arrivals at the system. It can be deterministic, where arrivals occur at fixed intervals, or stochastic, where arrivals occur randomly according to some probability distribution. The type of arrival process can significantly impact the performance of a queueing system.

#### 2.1a Definition and Calculation of Arrival Rate

The arrival rate, $\lambda$, can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
\lambda = \frac{\text{Total number of arrivals}}{\text{Total time period}}
$$

For example, if a queueing system has 100 arrivals in a time period of 10 minutes, the arrival rate would be $\lambda = \frac{100}{10} = 10$ arrivals per minute.

In some cases, the arrival rate may not be constant and can vary over time. In such cases, the arrival rate can be calculated using a more complex formula that takes into account the variation over time.

#### 2.1b Types of Arrival Processes

As mentioned earlier, the arrival process can be deterministic or stochastic. In a deterministic arrival process, arrivals occur at fixed intervals. This can be represented by a step function, where the arrival rate is constant over each time interval.

On the other hand, in a stochastic arrival process, arrivals occur randomly according to some probability distribution. This can be represented by a continuous function, where the arrival rate can vary over time. The arrival process can be further classified into two types: Poisson and non-Poisson.

##### Poisson Arrival Process

The Poisson arrival process is a special case of the stochastic arrival process. It is a memoryless process, meaning that the probability of an arrival at any given time is not affected by the number of arrivals that have occurred in the past. This property is known as the memoryless property and is a key characteristic of the Poisson process.

The Poisson arrival process is often used to model the arrival of customers at a service facility, such as a bank or a call center. It is also used in telecommunication networks to model the arrival of packets or messages. The Poisson process is characterized by its arrival rate, $\lambda$, and its inter-arrival time distribution, which is exponential with mean $1/\lambda$.

##### Non-Poisson Arrival Process

Non-Poisson arrival processes are those that do not follow the memoryless property of the Poisson process. These processes can be more complex and can be used to model systems where the arrival rate is not constant over time. Non-Poisson arrival processes can be further classified into two types: non-stationary and non-independent.

Non-stationary arrival processes have a varying arrival rate over time, while non-independent arrival processes have arrivals that are dependent on each other. These processes can be more challenging to analyze, but they can provide a more accurate representation of real-world systems.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of Little's Law and its generalizations, which provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between arrival rate, service rate, and queue length in queueing systems.





### Section: 2.2 Service Rate and Service Time:

In queueing theory, the service rate and service time are crucial parameters that determine the performance of a queueing system. The service rate, denoted by $\mu$, is the average number of customers that can be served by the system per unit time. It is a key parameter in Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in a queueing system is equal to the arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system.

The service time, on the other hand, is the average amount of time a customer spends in the system being served. It is a key factor in determining the efficiency of a queueing system. A shorter service time means that customers spend less time waiting in the system, leading to improved efficiency.

#### 2.2a Definition and Calculation of Service Rate

The service rate, $\mu$, can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
\mu = \frac{\text{Total number of completions}}{\text{Total time period}}
$$

For example, if a queueing system has 100 completions in a time period of 10 minutes, the service rate would be $\mu = \frac{100}{10} = 10$ completions per minute.

In some cases, the service rate may not be constant and can vary over time. In such cases, the service rate can be calculated using a more complex formula that takes into account the variation over time.

#### 2.2b Service Time Distribution

The service time distribution is the probability distribution of the service time for each customer in the system. It is an important factor in determining the performance of a queueing system. A service time distribution that is skewed towards shorter service times can significantly improve the efficiency of a queueing system.

The service time distribution can be represented by a probability density function, $f(s)$, where $s$ is the service time. The average service time, $\bar{s}$, can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
\bar{s} = \int_{0}^{\infty} s f(s) ds
$$

The service time distribution can also be represented by a cumulative distribution function, $F(s)$, where $F(s)$ is the probability that the service time is less than or equal to $s$. The average service time, $\bar{s}$, can also be calculated using the following formula:

$$
\bar{s} = \int_{0}^{\infty} s dF(s)
$$

In some cases, the service time distribution may not be known or may be complex. In such cases, the service time can be approximated using the Erlang-C formula, which is based on the assumption that the service time follows an Erlang distribution. The Erlang-C formula is given by:

$$
\bar{s} = \frac{\theta}{\mu - \lambda}
$$

where $\theta$ is the shape parameter of the Erlang distribution, $\mu$ is the service rate, and $\lambda$ is the arrival rate.

#### 2.2c Little’s Law and Service Rate

Little's Law is a fundamental result in queueing theory that relates the arrival rate, $\lambda$, the service rate, $\mu$, and the average number of customers in the system, $L$. It is given by:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

where $W$ is the average time a customer spends in the system. This law can also be expressed in terms of the service rate and the average service time, $\bar{s}$, as follows:

$$
L = \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \bar{s}
$$

This law is particularly useful in understanding the relationship between the arrival rate, service rate, and the average number of customers in the system. It allows us to calculate the average number of customers in the system if we know the arrival rate and the average service time. Conversely, it also allows us to calculate the service rate if we know the arrival rate and the average number of customers in the system.

In the next section, we will explore some advanced applications of Little's Law and service rate in queueing theory.





#### 2.2b Modeling Service Time: Exponential Distribution

The exponential distribution is a commonly used probability distribution in queueing theory to model service times. It is a continuous distribution that is often used to model the time between events in a Poisson process, where events occur independently and at a constant rate.

The exponential distribution is defined by a single parameter, $\mu$, which represents the average rate of events. In the context of queueing theory, $\mu$ can be interpreted as the average service rate.

The probability density function of the exponential distribution is given by:

$$
f(s) = \mu e^{-\mu s}
$$

where $s$ is the service time. The average service time, $\bar{s}$, can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\bar{s} = \frac{1}{\mu}
$$

The exponential distribution is often used to model service times because it has several desirable properties. First, it is memoryless, meaning that the probability of a long service time is not affected by the length of the previous service time. This is a reasonable assumption in many queueing systems, where the service time for each customer is independent of the service time for other customers.

Second, the exponential distribution is continuous, meaning that service times can take on any non-negative value. This is in contrast to other distributions, such as the Poisson distribution, which can only take on discrete values.

Finally, the exponential distribution is often a good approximation for service times that are not too skewed. If the service times are highly skewed, with a long tail of very long service times, the exponential distribution may not be a good fit. In such cases, other distributions, such as the Weibull distribution, may be more appropriate.

In the next section, we will discuss how to use the exponential distribution to model service times in queueing systems.

#### 2.2c Impact of Service Rate and Time on System Performance

The service rate and service time are two critical parameters that significantly impact the performance of a queueing system. The service rate, denoted by $\mu$, is the average number of customers that can be served per unit time. The service time, denoted by $s$, is the average time a customer spends being served.

The service rate and service time are directly related through Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system, $L$, is equal to the average arrival rate, $\lambda$, multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system, $W$. This can be expressed as:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

The service rate, $\mu$, and service time, $s$, also impact the average queue length, $L$, and the average waiting time, $W$, in the system. The average queue length, $L$, can be calculated using Little's Law as:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

The average waiting time, $W$, can be calculated using the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula as:

$$
W = \frac{\lambda}{\mu(1-\rho)}
$$

where $\rho$ is the utilization of the system, defined as the ratio of the arrival rate, $\lambda$, to the service rate, $\mu$.

The service rate and service time also impact the average queue length and waiting time in the system. As the service rate, $\mu$, increases, the average queue length, $L$, and waiting time, $W$, decrease. Similarly, as the service time, $s$, decreases, the average queue length, $L$, and waiting time, $W$, decrease.

In addition to their impact on the average queue length and waiting time, the service rate and service time also impact the variability of the queue length and waiting time in the system. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the queue length, $L$, and waiting time, $W$, can be calculated as:

$$
CV(L) = \frac{\sigma_L}{L}
$$

$$
CV(W) = \frac{\sigma_W}{W}
$$

where $\sigma_L$ and $\sigma_W$ are the standard deviations of the queue length and waiting time, respectively. The CV of the queue length and waiting time decrease as the service rate, $\mu$, and service time, $s$, increase.

In summary, the service rate and service time are key parameters that significantly impact the performance of a queueing system. Understanding their impact is crucial for designing and optimizing queueing systems.




#### 2.3a Definition and Calculation of Utilization

Utilization is a key concept in queueing theory that measures the efficiency of a system. It is defined as the ratio of the actual output to the potential output, and it is often expressed as a percentage. The formula for utilization is given by:

$$
U = \frac{A}{C} \times 100\%
$$

where $U$ is the utilization, $A$ is the actual output, and $C$ is the potential output.

The actual output, $A$, is the number of customers served during a given period. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of customers in the queue at the end of the period from the number of customers at the beginning of the period.

The potential output, $C$, is the maximum number of customers that can be served during the period. This can be calculated by dividing the total service time by the average service time. The total service time is the sum of the service times for all customers served during the period.

The utilization, $U$, is a measure of the system's efficiency. A high utilization indicates that the system is busy and efficient, while a low utilization indicates that the system is not fully utilized and may be inefficient.

In queueing theory, utilization is often used to analyze the performance of queueing systems. High utilization can lead to long queues and high waiting times, which can be undesirable in many applications. On the other hand, low utilization can indicate that the system is not fully utilized and may be wasting resources.

In the next section, we will discuss the relationship between utilization and queue length, and how changes in utilization can affect the queue length.

#### 2.3b Relationship between Utilization and Queue Length

The relationship between utilization and queue length is a fundamental concept in queueing theory. As we have seen in the previous section, utilization is a measure of the system's efficiency. It is defined as the ratio of the actual output to the potential output. The queue length, on the other hand, is a measure of the system's congestion. It is defined as the number of customers waiting in the queue.

The relationship between utilization and queue length can be understood in terms of Little's Law. Little's Law states that the average queue length, $L$, is equal to the average number of customers in the system, $L_s$, minus the average number of customers in service, $L_s - L_c$. This can be rearranged to give an expression for the average queue length in terms of the utilization, $U$, and the average service time, $S$:

$$
L = (1 - U) \times S
$$

This equation shows that the queue length is directly proportional to the utilization and the average service time. This means that as the utilization increases, the queue length also increases. Similarly, as the average service time increases, the queue length also increases.

This relationship is important because it allows us to understand how changes in utilization and service time can affect the queue length. For example, if we increase the utilization by 10%, the queue length will also increase by 10%. Similarly, if we decrease the average service time by 10%, the queue length will also decrease by 10%.

In the next section, we will discuss how to use this relationship to analyze the performance of queueing systems. We will also discuss how to optimize the utilization and service time to minimize the queue length.

#### 2.3c Impact of Utilization and Queue Length on System Performance

The impact of utilization and queue length on system performance is a critical aspect of queueing theory. As we have seen in the previous section, the queue length is directly proportional to the utilization and the average service time. This relationship allows us to understand how changes in utilization and service time can affect the queue length.

However, the impact of utilization and queue length on system performance goes beyond just the queue length. The utilization and queue length also affect the system's efficiency, customer satisfaction, and resource utilization.

High utilization can lead to long queues and high waiting times, which can be undesirable in many applications. This is because high utilization means that the system is busy and efficient, but it can also mean that the system is overloaded and customers are experiencing long wait times. This can lead to customer dissatisfaction and a decrease in customer loyalty.

On the other hand, low utilization can indicate that the system is not fully utilized and may be wasting resources. This can lead to inefficiency and a decrease in resource utilization. However, low utilization can also mean that customers are not experiencing long wait times, which can increase customer satisfaction.

The queue length also affects system performance. A high queue length can indicate that the system is congested and customers are experiencing long wait times. This can lead to customer dissatisfaction and a decrease in customer loyalty. On the other hand, a low queue length can indicate that the system is not congested and customers are experiencing short wait times. This can increase customer satisfaction and improve customer loyalty.

In the next section, we will discuss how to use Little's Law and the relationship between utilization and queue length to analyze the performance of queueing systems. We will also discuss how to optimize the utilization and queue length to improve system performance.

#### 2.4a Definition and Calculation of Little’s Law

Little's Law is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that describes the relationship between the average queue length, the average number of customers in the system, and the average time a customer spends in the system. It is named after John Little, who first formulated the law in the 1960s.

Little's Law can be stated in several equivalent forms, but the most common form is:

$$
L = L_s - L_c
$$

where $L$ is the average queue length, $L_s$ is the average number of customers in the system, and $L_c$ is the average number of customers in service.

This law can be understood in terms of the flow of customers through a queueing system. The average queue length, $L$, is the average number of customers waiting in the queue. The average number of customers in the system, $L_s$, is the average number of customers in the queue and in service. The average number of customers in service, $L_c$, is the average number of customers being served.

The difference between the average queue length and the average number of customers in service, $L - L_c$, is the average number of customers in the queue. This is because the average number of customers in service, $L_c$, includes both the customers being served and the customers waiting to be served.

Little's Law can also be expressed in terms of the average waiting time, $W$, the average service time, $S$, and the average number of customers in the system, $L_s$:

$$
L = L_s - L_c = L_s - \frac{L_s}{S} = \frac{L_s \times S}{S} - \frac{L_s}{S} = W - \frac{1}{S}
$$

This form of Little's Law shows that the average queue length, $L$, is equal to the average waiting time, $W$, minus the average service time, $S$, divided by the average service time. This relationship allows us to understand how changes in the average waiting time and service time can affect the average queue length.

In the next section, we will discuss how to use Little's Law to analyze the performance of queueing systems and how to optimize the system to minimize the queue length and waiting time.

#### 2.4b Little’s Law and Queue Length

Little's Law is a powerful tool for understanding the relationship between queue length and system performance. As we have seen in the previous section, Little's Law can be expressed as:

$$
L = L_s - L_c
$$

This equation tells us that the average queue length, $L$, is equal to the average number of customers in the system, $L_s$, minus the average number of customers in service, $L_c$. This relationship is fundamental to queueing theory and provides a basis for understanding the dynamics of queueing systems.

The average queue length, $L$, is a measure of the congestion in the system. It represents the average number of customers waiting in the queue. A high queue length can indicate that the system is overloaded and customers are experiencing long wait times. This can lead to customer dissatisfaction and a decrease in customer loyalty.

The average number of customers in the system, $L_s$, is a measure of the system's utilization. It represents the average number of customers in the queue and in service. A high utilization can lead to long queues and high waiting times, which can be undesirable in many applications. However, a high utilization can also indicate that the system is efficient and making good use of its resources.

The average number of customers in service, $L_c$, is a measure of the system's throughput. It represents the average number of customers being served. A high throughput can indicate that the system is efficient and able to handle a large number of customers. However, a high throughput can also indicate that the system is overloaded and customers are experiencing long wait times.

By understanding the relationship between queue length, system utilization, and throughput, we can gain insights into the performance of queueing systems. We can use Little's Law to analyze the system and identify areas for improvement. For example, if the queue length is high, we can increase the number of servers to reduce the average waiting time. If the system utilization is high, we can increase the service time to reduce the average queue length. By optimizing these parameters, we can improve the performance of the queueing system and enhance customer satisfaction.

In the next section, we will discuss how to use Little's Law to analyze the performance of queueing systems and how to optimize the system to minimize the queue length and waiting time.

#### 2.4c Little’s Law and System Performance

Little's Law is not only a tool for understanding the relationship between queue length and system performance, but it also provides a basis for optimizing system performance. By manipulating the equation, we can derive several important performance measures and identify areas for improvement.

The average waiting time, $W$, can be calculated from Little's Law as:

$$
W = L - \frac{L_s}{S}
$$

This equation shows that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length minus the average number of customers in service divided by the average service time. A high waiting time can indicate that the system is overloaded and customers are experiencing long wait times. This can lead to customer dissatisfaction and a decrease in customer loyalty.

The average service time, $S$, can be calculated from Little's Law as:

$$
S = \frac{L_s}{L_c}
$$

This equation shows that the average service time is equal to the average number of customers in service divided by the average number of customers in the system. A high service time can indicate that the system is inefficient and not making good use of its resources.

The average queue length, $L$, can be calculated from Little's Law as:

$$
L = L_s - L_c
$$

This equation shows that the average queue length is equal to the average number of customers in the system minus the average number of customers in service. A high queue length can indicate that the system is overloaded and customers are experiencing long wait times.

By manipulating these equations, we can derive other important performance measures, such as the average waiting time in the queue, the average waiting time in the system, and the average queue length in the system. These measures can provide valuable insights into the performance of the queueing system and help us identify areas for improvement.

In the next section, we will discuss how to use Little's Law to analyze the performance of queueing systems and how to optimize the system to minimize the queue length and waiting time.




#### 2.3b Relationship between Utilization and Queue Length

The relationship between utilization and queue length is a fundamental concept in queueing theory. As we have seen in the previous section, utilization is a measure of the system's efficiency. It is defined as the ratio of the actual output to the potential output. The queue length, on the other hand, is a measure of the system's congestion. It is defined as the number of customers waiting in the queue.

The relationship between utilization and queue length can be understood in terms of Little's Law. Little's Law states that the average queue length in a system is equal to the average waiting time multiplied by the average arrival rate. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
L = W \times \lambda
$$

where $L$ is the average queue length, $W$ is the average waiting time, and $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate.

From Little's Law, we can see that the queue length is directly proportional to the utilization. This is because the average waiting time, $W$, is inversely proportional to the utilization. As the utilization increases, the average waiting time decreases, and hence the queue length decreases. Conversely, as the utilization decreases, the average waiting time increases, and hence the queue length increases.

This relationship between utilization and queue length is crucial in understanding the performance of queueing systems. High utilization can lead to short queue lengths, indicating that the system is efficient and able to handle a high volume of customers. On the other hand, low utilization can result in long queue lengths, indicating that the system is not fully utilized and may be inefficient.

In the next section, we will explore some advanced applications of Little's Law and its generalizations.

#### 2.3c Utilization and Queue Length in Queueing Systems

In queueing systems, the relationship between utilization and queue length is a critical factor in determining the system's performance. As we have seen in the previous section, Little's Law provides a mathematical relationship between these two parameters. However, in real-world systems, the relationship between utilization and queue length can be more complex and dynamic.

One of the key factors that can influence this relationship is the type of queueing system being used. For instance, in the multi queue (MQ) cache replacement policy, the utilization and queue length can be affected by the number of LRU queues and the maximum access count for each queue. 

The MQ cache contains an "m" number of LRU queues: Q<sub>0</sub>, Q<sub>1</sub>, ..., Q<sub>"m"-1</sub>. The value of "m" represents a hierarchy based on the lifetime of all blocks in that particular queue. If "j">"i", blocks in Q<sub>"j"</sub> will have a longer lifetime than those in Q<sub>"i"</sub>. This hierarchy can affect the utilization and queue length by influencing the average waiting time, $W$, in Little's Law.

In addition to the LRU queues, there is also a history buffer Q<sub>out</sub> which maintains a list of all the Block Identifiers along with their access frequencies. When Q<sub>out</sub> is full, the oldest identifier is evicted. This can impact the queue length by affecting the number of customers waiting in the queue.

The maximum access count for each queue can also influence the relationship between utilization and queue length. If a block in queue Q"<sub>i</sub>" is accessed more than 2"<sup>i</sup>" times, this block is promoted to Q<sub>"i"+1</sub> until it is accessed more than 2<sup>"i"+1</sup> times or its lifetime expires. This can affect the average waiting time, $W$, and hence the queue length.

In conclusion, the relationship between utilization and queue length in queueing systems is complex and can be influenced by various factors. Understanding this relationship is crucial in designing and optimizing queueing systems for efficient performance. In the next section, we will explore some advanced applications of Little's Law and its generalizations.




#### 2.4a Definition and Calculation of Response Time

Response time is a critical metric in queueing theory that measures the amount of time a job spends in the system from the instant of arrival to the time it leaves the system. It is a key factor in determining the efficiency and performance of a queueing system.

The response time, $R$, can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average response time is equal to the average queue length, $L$, multiplied by the average waiting time, $W$. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
R = L \times W
$$

The average waiting time, $W$, can be calculated using the Little's Law formula:

$$
W = \frac{L}{\lambda}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate.

The average queue length, $L$, can be calculated using Little's Law formula:

$$
L = W \times \lambda
$$

The response time can also be calculated using the Little's Law formula:

$$
R = L \times W = \frac{L^2}{\lambda}
$$

In the next section, we will explore the relationship between response time and waiting time, and how they contribute to the overall performance of a queueing system.

#### 2.4b Relationship between Response Time and Waiting Time

The relationship between response time and waiting time is a fundamental concept in queueing theory. As we have seen in the previous section, response time is a measure of the total time a job spends in the system, while waiting time is the time a job spends waiting in the queue.

The response time, $R$, can be expressed as the sum of the waiting time, $W$, and the service time, $S$. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
R = W + S
$$

The service time, $S$, is the time a job spends being served. It is typically assumed to be a constant for a given job, although it can vary depending on the complexity of the job.

The waiting time, $W$, is a function of the queue length, $L$, and the arrival rate, $\lambda$. It can be calculated using Little's Law formula:

$$
W = \frac{L}{\lambda}
$$

The queue length, $L$, is a function of the arrival rate, $\lambda$, and the service rate, $\mu$. It can be calculated using Little's Law formula:

$$
L = \lambda \times W
$$

The service rate, $\mu$, is the inverse of the average service time, $S$. It can be calculated using Little's Law formula:

$$
\mu = \frac{1}{S}
$$

By combining these equations, we can express the response time, $R$, as a function of the arrival rate, $\lambda$, and the service rate, $\mu$:

$$
R = W + S = \frac{L}{\lambda} + \frac{1}{\mu}
$$

This equation shows that the response time is a function of both the arrival rate and the service rate. A high arrival rate or a low service rate can lead to long waiting times and high response times. Conversely, a low arrival rate or a high service rate can lead to short waiting times and low response times.

In the next section, we will explore how these factors contribute to the overall performance of a queueing system.

#### 2.4c Impact of Response Time and Waiting Time on System Performance

The response time and waiting time are critical metrics in queueing theory that directly impact the performance of a queueing system. As we have seen in the previous section, the response time, $R$, is the total time a job spends in the system, while the waiting time, $W$, is the time a job spends waiting in the queue.

The response time, $R$, is a key factor in determining the efficiency of a queueing system. A high response time indicates that jobs are spending a significant amount of time waiting in the queue, which can lead to delays and dissatisfaction among users. Conversely, a low response time indicates that jobs are being processed quickly, which can improve user satisfaction and system efficiency.

The waiting time, $W$, is also a critical factor in system performance. A high waiting time can lead to long queues, which can result in delays and user dissatisfaction. Conversely, a low waiting time can indicate that jobs are being processed quickly, which can improve user satisfaction and system efficiency.

The relationship between response time and waiting time is also important. As we have seen in the previous section, the response time, $R$, can be expressed as the sum of the waiting time, $W$, and the service time, $S$. This relationship shows that a high waiting time can lead to a high response time, which can negatively impact system performance.

In addition to their individual impacts, response time and waiting time also interact with each other to affect system performance. For example, a high arrival rate can increase the waiting time, $W$, which in turn can increase the response time, $R$. Similarly, a low service rate can increase the waiting time, $W$, which can also increase the response time, $R$.

In the next section, we will explore how these factors contribute to the overall performance of a queueing system. We will also discuss strategies for optimizing response time and waiting time to improve system performance.




#### 2.4b Estimating Waiting Time in Queueing Systems

Estimating waiting time in queueing systems is a crucial aspect of queueing theory. It allows us to understand the behavior of the system and make predictions about its future performance. In this section, we will explore some methods for estimating waiting time in queueing systems.

##### Little's Law

As we have seen in the previous sections, Little's Law provides a fundamental relationship between the average waiting time, $W$, the average queue length, $L$, and the average arrival rate, $\lambda$. This law can be used to estimate the waiting time in a queueing system.

The Little's Law formula for waiting time is given by:

$$
W = \frac{L}{\lambda}
$$

This formula assumes that the system is in a steady state, i.e., the system parameters do not change over time. If this assumption does not hold, the formula may not provide accurate estimates.

##### Buzen's Algorithm

Buzen's algorithm is a more sophisticated method for estimating waiting time in queueing systems. It is particularly useful for closed queueing networks with multiple service facilities and circulating customers.

The algorithm is based on the Gordon–Newell theorem, which provides a formula for the steady state probabilities of the number of customers at each service facility. These probabilities, denoted by $\mathbb P(n_1,n_2,\cdots,n_M)$, can be used to estimate the waiting time.

The formula for the waiting time, $W$, using Buzen's algorithm is given by:

$$
W = \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{i=1}^M \mu_i X_i p_{ij}
$$

where $\mu_i$ is the service rate at service facility $i$, $X_i$ is the solution to the equation $\mu_j X_j = \sum_{i=1}^M \mu_i X_i p_{ij}$ for $j=1,\ldots,M$, and $p_{ij}$ is the probability of a customer moving from service facility $i$ to service facility $j$.

##### Fork–Join Queue

The fork–join queue is a special type of queueing system where a job is served by multiple service facilities in parallel. The response time in a fork–join queue can be approximated using the formula:

$$
R = \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{i=1}^M \mu_i X_i p_{ij}
$$

where the notation is as defined above.

In the next section, we will explore some advanced applications of queueing theory, including the use of these methods for estimating waiting time in real-world systems.

In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the advanced applications of queueing theory, specifically focusing on the M/G/k and G/M/k models.

The M/G/k model is a single-server queueing system, where customers arrive according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$ and are served by a single server with service time distribution $G$.

## Chapter 3: M/G/k and G/M/k Models:




### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of queueing theory and its applications in various fields. We discussed the fundamental concepts of queues, such as arrival rate, service rate, and queue length. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the theory by exploring the distributional laws that govern the behavior of queues.

The distributional laws of queueing theory are mathematical models that describe the probability distribution of queue length, waiting time, and other queueing characteristics. These laws are essential in understanding the behavior of queues and predicting their performance under different conditions. They are also crucial in designing and optimizing queueing systems.

In this chapter, we will cover the basic distributional laws, including the Poisson distribution, the Erlang distribution, and the M/M/s queue. We will also discuss more advanced topics, such as the G/M/s queue, the M/G/s queue, and the M/M/s/K queue. These laws will be presented in a clear and concise manner, with examples and applications to help readers understand their practical implications.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of the distributional laws of queueing theory and their applications. They will also be equipped with the necessary knowledge to analyze and optimize queueing systems in various real-world scenarios. So let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of queueing theory distributional laws.




### Section: 3.1 Poisson Distribution:

The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that is widely used in queueing theory. It is named after the French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson, who first studied it in the early 19th century. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space, given that these events occur independently and at a constant rate.

#### 3.1a Definition and Properties of Poisson Distribution

The Poisson distribution is defined by a single parameter, λ, which represents the average rate of events occurring in the interval. The probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is given by:

$$
P(k;\lambda) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
$$

where k is the number of events that occur in the interval.

The Poisson distribution has several important properties that make it a useful tool in queueing theory. These properties are:

1. The mean of the Poisson distribution is equal to its variance, and both are equal to λ. This means that the distribution is symmetric around its mean.
2. The Poisson distribution is memoryless, meaning that the probability of an event occurring in a given interval is not affected by the number of events that have occurred in previous intervals. This property is particularly useful in queueing theory, where events (such as arrivals or departures) often occur independently and at a constant rate.
3. The Poisson distribution is discrete, meaning that it only takes on integer values. This is because the number of events that occur in a given interval is always a whole number.
4. The Poisson distribution is often used to approximate the binomial distribution when the number of trials is large and the probability of success is small. This is known as the Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution.

The Poisson distribution is widely used in queueing theory to model the arrival process at a queue. In particular, it is used in the M/G/1 queue, where customers arrive at a single-server queue according to a Poisson process with rate λ, and service times are arbitrary and independent. The Poisson distribution is also used in the M/M/s queue, where customers arrive at a s-server queue according to a Poisson process with rate λ, and service times are exponential with rate μ.

In the next section, we will explore the application of the Poisson distribution in queueing theory, specifically in the M/G/1 queue.

#### 3.1b Application of Poisson Distribution in Queueing Systems

The Poisson distribution is a fundamental tool in queueing theory, and it is particularly useful in the analysis of queueing systems. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of the Poisson distribution in queueing systems, specifically in the M/G/1 queue.

The M/G/1 queue is a single-server queueing system where customers arrive according to a Poisson process with rate λ and service times are arbitrary and independent. The Poisson distribution is used to model the arrival process in this queue, and it is also used to calculate the probability of various events occurring in the queue.

One of the key applications of the Poisson distribution in the M/G/1 queue is in calculating the probability of waiting. The probability of a customer waiting in the queue is given by the Erlang-C formula, which is derived from the Poisson distribution. The Erlang-C formula is given by:

$$
P_w = \frac{\lambda (\lambda A)^k}{k!} \frac{1}{\mu (\mu A)^{k+1}}
$$

where A is the average number of customers in the system, and μ is the service rate. This formula is used to calculate the probability of waiting for a customer in the queue, and it is particularly useful in systems where the arrival rate and service rate are known.

Another important application of the Poisson distribution in the M/G/1 queue is in calculating the probability of queue length. The probability of the queue length being equal to a certain value is given by the Erlang-B formula, which is also derived from the Poisson distribution. The Erlang-B formula is given by:

$$
P_L = \frac{\lambda (\lambda A)^k}{k!} \frac{1}{\mu (\mu A)^{k+1}}
$$

where L is the queue length. This formula is used to calculate the probability of the queue length being equal to a certain value, and it is particularly useful in systems where the arrival rate and service rate are known.

In addition to these applications, the Poisson distribution is also used in the M/G/1 queue to calculate the probability of various other events, such as the probability of the system being full or the probability of a customer being in service. These probabilities are all derived from the Poisson distribution and are essential tools in the analysis of queueing systems.

In the next section, we will explore the application of the Poisson distribution in another important queueing system, the M/M/s queue.

#### 3.1c Solving for Unknown Parameters in Poisson Distribution

The Poisson distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory, but it is often used with unknown parameters. In this section, we will explore how to solve for these unknown parameters in the Poisson distribution.

The Poisson distribution is defined by two parameters, the arrival rate λ and the service rate μ. These parameters are often unknown in queueing systems, and they need to be estimated from the data. The arrival rate λ can be estimated from the arrival process, while the service rate μ can be estimated from the service times.

To solve for the arrival rate λ, we can use the Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate times the average time a customer spends in the system. This can be written as:

$$
\lambda = \frac{A}{W}
$$

where A is the average number of customers in the system and W is the average time a customer spends in the system. These parameters can be estimated from the data, and the arrival rate λ can be solved for.

To solve for the service rate μ, we can use the Erlang-C formula, which we introduced in the previous section. This formula can be rearranged to solve for the service rate μ, and it is given by:

$$
\mu = \frac{\lambda (k+1)}{A}
$$

where k is the queue length. This formula can also be used to estimate the service rate μ from the data.

In addition to these methods, there are other techniques for solving for unknown parameters in the Poisson distribution. These include the method of moments, which involves equating the moments of the observed data to the moments of the Poisson distribution, and the maximum likelihood estimation, which involves maximizing the likelihood function to estimate the parameters.

In the next section, we will explore the application of the Poisson distribution in another important queueing system, the M/M/s queue.

#### 3.2a Definition and Properties of Exponential Distribution

The exponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is often used in queueing theory. It is named as such because the probability density function of the exponential distribution is exponentially decaying. The exponential distribution is commonly used to model the service times in queueing systems, and it is particularly useful in systems where the service times are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).

The exponential distribution is defined by a single parameter, β, which represents the average service time. The probability density function of the exponential distribution is given by:

$$
f(x;\beta) = \beta e^{-\beta x}
$$

where x is the service time.

The exponential distribution has several important properties that make it a useful tool in queueing theory. These properties are:

1. The mean of the exponential distribution is equal to its variance, and both are equal to 1/β. This means that the distribution is symmetric around its mean.
2. The exponential distribution is memoryless, meaning that the probability of a service time being longer than a certain value is not affected by the length of the service time that has already elapsed. This property is particularly useful in queueing systems, where service times are often independent and identically distributed.
3. The exponential distribution is often used to approximate the normal distribution when the sample size is large. This is known as the central limit theorem.
4. The exponential distribution is also used in the Poisson process, which is a fundamental concept in queueing theory. The Poisson process is used to model the arrival process in queueing systems, and it is particularly useful in systems where the arrival rate is constant over time.

In the next section, we will explore the application of the exponential distribution in queueing systems, specifically in the M/G/1 queue.

#### 3.2b Application of Exponential Distribution in Queueing Systems

The exponential distribution is a fundamental tool in queueing theory, particularly in the analysis of queueing systems. In this section, we will explore the application of the exponential distribution in queueing systems, specifically in the M/G/1 queue.

The M/G/1 queue is a single-server queueing system where customers arrive according to a Poisson process with rate λ and service times are arbitrary and independent. The exponential distribution is used to model the service times in this queue, and it is particularly useful because of its memoryless property.

The memoryless property of the exponential distribution allows us to make the assumption that the service time for the next customer is independent of the service time for the current customer. This assumption is crucial in the analysis of queueing systems, as it allows us to model the service times as i.i.d. random variables.

The exponential distribution is also used in the calculation of various performance measures in queueing systems. For example, the average queue length in the M/G/1 queue can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average queue length is equal to the average arrival rate times the average time a customer spends in the system. The average time a customer spends in the system can be calculated using the exponential distribution, as it represents the service time distribution.

Furthermore, the exponential distribution is used in the calculation of the probability of various events in queueing systems. For example, the probability of a customer waiting in the queue can be calculated using the Erlang-C formula, which is derived from the exponential distribution.

In conclusion, the exponential distribution plays a crucial role in the analysis of queueing systems. Its properties and applications make it a fundamental concept in queueing theory, and it is essential for understanding the behavior of queueing systems. In the next section, we will explore another important distribution in queueing theory, the Erlang distribution.

#### 3.2c Solving for Unknown Parameters in Exponential Distribution

The exponential distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory, but it is often used with unknown parameters. In this section, we will explore how to solve for these unknown parameters in the exponential distribution.

The exponential distribution is defined by a single parameter, β, which represents the average service time. However, in many queueing systems, this parameter is not known and needs to be estimated from the data. This can be done using the method of moments, which involves equating the moments of the observed data to the moments of the exponential distribution.

The first moment of the exponential distribution is the mean, which is equal to 1/β. Therefore, if we have a sample of service times, we can estimate the mean and use it to estimate the parameter β. This can be done using the following equation:

$$
\hat{\beta} = \frac{1}{\bar{x}}
$$

where $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean of the service times.

The second moment of the exponential distribution is the variance, which is equal to (1/β)^2. Therefore, if we have a sample of service times, we can estimate the variance and use it to estimate the parameter β. This can be done using the following equation:

$$
\hat{\beta} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\text{Var}(x)}}
$$

where $\text{Var}(x)$ is the sample variance of the service times.

In addition to the method of moments, the maximum likelihood estimation can also be used to estimate the parameter β. This involves maximizing the likelihood function, which is given by:

$$
L(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \beta e^{-\beta x_i}
$$

where $x_i$ are the observed service times and $n$ is the number of observations. The maximum likelihood estimate of β can be found by taking the derivative of the likelihood function with respect to β and setting it equal to 0.

In conclusion, the exponential distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory, but it is often used with unknown parameters. These parameters can be estimated using various methods, such as the method of moments and the maximum likelihood estimation. These estimates can then be used to analyze the performance of queueing systems and make predictions about future service times.

#### 3.1b.1 M/G/1 Queue

The M/G/1 queue is a single-server queueing system where customers arrive according to a Poisson process and service times are generally distributed. The waiting time distribution in the M/G/1 queue can be calculated using the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula, which involves the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the service time probability density function. The arrival theorem also holds in the M/G/1 queue, meaning that the arrival process is memoryless.

#### 3.1b.2 Multiple Servers

Many metrics for the M/G/k queue with "k" servers remain an open problem, though some approximations and bounds are known. The Poisson distribution is used to model the arrival process in these systems, and the arrival theorem still holds.

#### 3.1b.3 Buzen's Algorithm

Buzen's algorithm is an efficient procedure for computing the normalizing constant "G"("N") in a closed queueing network with "M" service facilities and "N" circulating customers. The algorithm uses the values of "X"<sub>"i"</sub> determined by solving the equations:

$$
\mu_j X_j = \sum_{i=1}^M \mu_i X_i p_{ij}
$$

for "j" = 1, ..., "M". The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of customers at each service facility in the network.

#### 3.1b.4 Erlang Distribution

The Erlang distribution is another important distribution in queueing theory that is closely related to the Poisson distribution. It is used to model the waiting times in queueing systems, and it is often used in conjunction with the Poisson distribution to model the arrival process. The Erlang distribution is also used in the M/G/1 queue to calculate the waiting time distribution.

In conclusion, the Poisson distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory, and it is used to model a wide range of queueing systems. Its properties and applications make it an essential concept for understanding the fundamentals of queueing theory.




### Subsection: 3.2a Definition and Properties of Exponential Distribution

The exponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is commonly used in queueing theory. It is named as such because the probability density function of the exponential distribution is always positive and has an exponential shape. The exponential distribution is often used to model the time between events in a Poisson process, where events occur independently and at a constant rate.

#### 3.2a.1 Definition of Exponential Distribution

The exponential distribution is defined by a single parameter, the rate parameter or shape parameter, denoted by $\beta$. The probability density function of the exponential distribution is given by:

$$
f(x;\beta) = \beta e^{-\beta x}
$$

where $x$ is the time between events. The exponential distribution is a continuous distribution, meaning that the possible values of $x$ are all positive real numbers.

#### 3.2a.2 Properties of Exponential Distribution

The exponential distribution has several important properties that make it useful in queueing theory. These properties include:

1. The mean of the exponential distribution is equal to $1/\beta$, and the variance is equal to $1/\beta^2$. This means that the distribution is skewed to the right, with a long tail on the positive side.
2. The exponential distribution is memoryless, meaning that the probability of an event occurring in a given interval is not affected by the time that has passed since the last event. This property is particularly useful in queueing theory, as it allows us to model systems where events occur independently and at a constant rate.
3. The exponential distribution is often used to approximate the normal distribution when the sample size is large. This is known as the central limit theorem.
4. The exponential distribution is also used in the M/G/1 queue, where it is used to model the service time distribution. The Pollaczek-Khinchine formula, which is used to calculate the waiting time distribution in the M/G/1 queue, involves the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the service time probability density function, which is the exponential distribution in this case.

In the next section, we will explore some applications of the exponential distribution in queueing systems.




#### 3.2b Application of Exponential Distribution in Queueing Systems

The exponential distribution is a fundamental tool in queueing theory, with applications in various queueing systems. In this section, we will explore some of these applications and how the exponential distribution is used to model and analyze queueing systems.

##### 3.2b.1 M/G/1 Queue

The M/G/1 queue is a single-server queueing system where customers arrive according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$ and service times are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) according to a general distribution $G$. The exponential distribution is used in this system to model the service time distribution $G$. The Pollaczek-Khinchine formula, which is used to calculate the mean and variance of the waiting time in the system, relies on the assumption that the service time distribution is exponential.

##### 3.2b.2 Buzen's Algorithm

Buzen's algorithm is an efficient procedure for computing the normalizing constant $G(N)$ in a closed queueing network with multiple service facilities and circulating customers. The algorithm relies on the assumption that the service time distribution at each service facility is exponential. The algorithm is particularly useful when the number of service facilities and circulating customers is large, as it allows for efficient computation of the steady state probabilities.

##### 3.2b.3 Erlang Distribution

The Erlang distribution is a special case of the exponential distribution that is used to model the waiting times between events in a Poisson process. The Erlang distribution is often used in queueing theory to model the traffic load in a system, which is measured in erlangs. The expected duration of incoming calls can be used in conjunction with the Erlang distribution to determine the traffic load in the system.

In conclusion, the exponential distribution plays a crucial role in queueing theory, with applications in various queueing systems. Its properties, such as the memoryless property and its ability to approximate the normal distribution, make it a versatile tool for modeling and analyzing queueing systems.

## Chapter: Little's Law

### Introduction

In the realm of queueing theory, Little's Law holds a pivotal role. Named after the British mathematician John Little, this law is a fundamental principle that describes the relationship between the average number of customers in a queueing system, the average time a customer spends in the system, and the average arrival rate of customers. 

Little's Law is a cornerstone in the analysis of queueing systems. It provides a mathematical framework that allows us to understand and predict the behavior of queueing systems under various conditions. It is a powerful tool that can be used to model and analyze a wide range of queueing systems, from simple single-server systems to complex multi-server systems.

In this chapter, we will delve into the intricacies of Little's Law. We will explore its mathematical formulation, its implications, and its applications in queueing theory. We will also discuss the assumptions and limitations of Little's Law. 

We will begin by introducing Little's Law in its simplest form, and then gradually build up to more complex versions of the law. We will also discuss how Little's Law can be used to derive other important results in queueing theory, such as the Erlang-C formula and the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of Little's Law and its role in queueing theory. You should also be able to apply Little's Law to analyze and predict the behavior of queueing systems.

So, let's embark on this journey to unravel the mysteries of Little's Law and its applications in queueing theory.




#### 3.3a Definition and Properties of Erlang Distribution

The Erlang distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is used to model the time between events in a Poisson process. It is named after the Danish mathematician Agner Krarup Erlang, who used it to model telephone call arrival patterns. The Erlang distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution, and it is often used in queueing theory to model the waiting times between events.

The Erlang distribution is defined by two parameters, $k$ and $\lambda$, where $k$ is the shape parameter and $\lambda$ is the rate parameter. The probability density function of the Erlang distribution is given by:

$$
f(x;k,\lambda) = \frac{\lambda^k x^{k-1} e^{-\lambda x}}{(k-1)!}
$$

where $x$ is the time between events.

The Erlang distribution has several important properties that make it useful in queueing theory. These properties are:

1. The mean of the Erlang distribution is equal to $k/\lambda$. This means that the average time between events is inversely proportional to the rate parameter $\lambda$.

2. The variance of the Erlang distribution is equal to $k/\lambda^2$. This means that the variability of the time between events is also inversely proportional to the rate parameter $\lambda$.

3. The Erlang distribution is memoryless. This means that the probability of an event occurring in a given interval is not affected by the time that has passed since the last event. This property is particularly useful in queueing theory, as it allows us to model systems where the arrival rate is constant over time.

4. The Erlang distribution is often used to model the waiting times between events in a Poisson process. This is because the Erlang distribution is the only continuous distribution that can be used to model the waiting times between events in a Poisson process with a known arrival rate.

5. The Erlang distribution is also used to model the traffic load in a queueing system. The expected duration of incoming calls can be used in conjunction with the Erlang distribution to determine the traffic load in the system.

In the next section, we will explore some applications of the Erlang distribution in queueing theory.

#### 3.3b Application of Erlang Distribution in Queueing Systems

The Erlang distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory, and it has numerous applications in the analysis of queueing systems. In this section, we will explore some of these applications, focusing on the Erlang distribution's use in modeling and analyzing queueing systems.

##### 3.3b.1 Modeling Queueing Systems

The Erlang distribution is often used to model queueing systems, particularly those with a constant arrival rate. This is because the Erlang distribution is memoryless, meaning that the probability of an event occurring in a given interval is not affected by the time that has passed since the last event. This property is particularly useful in queueing systems, where the arrival rate is often assumed to be constant over time.

For example, consider a single-server queueing system where customers arrive according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$. If we assume that the service time distribution is Erlang with shape parameter $k$ and rate parameter $\lambda$, then the probability of a customer waiting in the queue is given by:

$$
P(W > 0) = \frac{\lambda^k}{\lambda^k + k\lambda}
$$

This equation gives us the probability of a customer waiting in the queue, which is a key metric in the analysis of queueing systems.

##### 3.3b.2 Analyzing Queueing Systems

The Erlang distribution is also used in the analysis of queueing systems. In particular, it is used to calculate the mean and variance of the waiting time in the system, which are important metrics in the performance analysis of queueing systems.

The mean waiting time in the system, denoted by $W$, is given by:

$$
W = \frac{k}{\lambda(\lambda - k)}
$$

The variance of the waiting time, denoted by $Var(W)$, is given by:

$$
Var(W) = \frac{k(k+1)}{(\lambda - k)^2(\lambda - k - 1)}
$$

These equations allow us to calculate the mean and variance of the waiting time in the system, which are key metrics in the performance analysis of queueing systems.

##### 3.3b.3 Other Applications

The Erlang distribution has many other applications in queueing theory. For example, it is used in the analysis of queueing networks with multiple servers and circulating customers, as well as in the analysis of queueing systems with varying arrival rates. It is also used in the development of efficient algorithms for computing the normalizing constant in closed queueing networks, such as Buzen's algorithm.

In conclusion, the Erlang distribution is a fundamental tool in queueing theory, with numerous applications in the modeling and analysis of queueing systems. Its properties and applications make it an essential topic for anyone studying queueing theory.

#### 3.3c Erlang Distribution in Real World Scenarios

The Erlang distribution, named after the Danish mathematician Agner Krarup Erlang, has found widespread application in various real-world scenarios. This section will explore some of these applications, focusing on the use of the Erlang distribution in modeling and analyzing real-world systems.

##### 3.3c.1 Telecommunication Networks

One of the most common applications of the Erlang distribution is in the modeling and analysis of telecommunication networks. In these systems, the Erlang distribution is used to model the time between events, such as the arrival of a call or the completion of a call. This is particularly useful in the design and optimization of telecommunication networks, where the ability to accurately model and analyze the arrival and completion of calls is crucial.

For example, consider a telecommunication network with a constant arrival rate of calls. If we assume that the service time distribution is Erlang with shape parameter $k$ and rate parameter $\lambda$, then the probability of a call waiting in the queue is given by:

$$
P(W > 0) = \frac{\lambda^k}{\lambda^k + k\lambda}
$$

This equation allows us to calculate the probability of a call waiting in the queue, which is a key metric in the performance analysis of telecommunication networks.

##### 3.3c.2 Call Centers

The Erlang distribution is also widely used in the modeling and analysis of call centers. In these systems, the Erlang distribution is used to model the time between events, such as the arrival of a call or the completion of a call. This is particularly useful in the design and optimization of call centers, where the ability to accurately model and analyze the arrival and completion of calls is crucial.

For example, consider a call center with a constant arrival rate of calls. If we assume that the service time distribution is Erlang with shape parameter $k$ and rate parameter $\lambda$, then the probability of a call waiting in the queue is given by:

$$
P(W > 0) = \frac{\lambda^k}{\lambda^k + k\lambda}
$$

This equation allows us to calculate the probability of a call waiting in the queue, which is a key metric in the performance analysis of call centers.

##### 3.3c.3 Other Applications

The Erlang distribution has many other applications in the modeling and analysis of real-world systems. For example, it is used in the modeling and analysis of traffic flow, queueing systems in manufacturing, and even in the modeling of biological systems. The Erlang distribution's ability to accurately model and analyze the arrival and completion of events makes it a powerful tool in the analysis of a wide range of real-world systems.

The Erlang distribution is used to model the arrival rate of calls, the waiting times between calls, and the duration of calls. This allows call center managers to determine the optimal number of agents needed to handle the incoming calls, and to predict the probability of packet loss or delay. The Erlang-B and Erlang-C formulae, which are based on the Erlang distribution, are still in everyday use for traffic modeling in call centers.

##### Telecommunication Networks

The Erlang distribution is also used in telecommunication networks to model the arrival rate of calls, the waiting times between calls, and the duration of calls. This allows network engineers to determine the optimal routing of calls, and to predict the probability of packet loss or delay. The Erlang distribution is particularly useful in telecommunication networks because it can be used to model systems with a large number of users, and because it is memoryless, which means that the arrival rate of calls is constant over time.

##### Manufacturing Processes

In manufacturing processes, the Erlang distribution is used to model the arrival rate of jobs, the waiting times between jobs, and the duration of jobs. This allows manufacturing engineers to determine the optimal number of machines needed to handle the incoming jobs, and to predict the probability of packet loss or delay. The Erlang distribution is particularly useful in manufacturing processes because it can be used to model systems with a large number of jobs, and because it is memoryless, which means that the arrival rate of jobs is constant over time.

In conclusion, the Erlang distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory, and it has a wide range of applications in various types of systems. Its ability to model systems with a large number of users, its memorylessness, and its ability to predict the probability of packet loss or delay make it an essential tool for queueing theorists and practitioners.

It is used to model the arrival rate of events, the waiting times between events, and the duration of events. This allows queueing theorists to determine the optimal number of servers needed to handle the incoming events, and to predict the probability of packet loss or delay.

##### Queueing Systems

This allows network engineers to determine the optimal routing of packets, and to predict the probability of packet loss or delay. The Erlang distribution is particularly useful in network traffic analysis because it can be used to model systems with a large number of users, and because it is memoryless, which means that the arrival rate of packets is constant over time.

##### Telecommunication Networks

In telecommunication networks, the Erlang distribution is used to model the arrival rate of calls, the waiting times between calls, and the duration of calls. This allows telecommunication engineers to determine the optimal routing of calls, and to predict the probability of packet loss or delay. The Erlang distribution is particularly useful in telecommunication networks because it can be used to model systems with a large number of users, and because it is memoryless, which means that the arrival rate of calls is constant over time.

##### Manufacturing Processes

In manufacturing processes, the Erlang distribution is used to model the arrival rate of jobs, the waiting times between jobs, and the duration of jobs. This allows manufacturing engineers to determine the optimal number of machines needed to handle the incoming jobs, and to predict the probability of packet loss or delay. The Erlang distribution is particularly useful in manufacturing processes because it can be used to model systems with a large number of users, and because it is memoryless, which means that the arrival rate of jobs is constant over time.

##### Other Applications

The Erlang distribution has many other applications in queueing theory. It is used to model the age distribution of cancer incidence, the number of driver events and the time interval between them, and the cell cycle time distribution. It is also used in business economics for describing interpurchase times. The Erlang distribution is particularly useful in these applications because it can be used to model systems with a large number of users, and because it is memoryless, which means that the arrival rate of events is constant over time.




#### 3.4a Definition and Properties of Hyperexponential Distribution

The hyperexponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution whose probability density function of the random variable "X" is given by:

$$
f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \lambda_i e^{-\lambda_i x}
$$

where each "Y"<sub>"i"</sub> is an exponentially distributed random variable with rate parameter "λ"<sub>"i"</sub>, and "p"<sub>"i"</sub> is the probability that "X" will take on the form of the exponential distribution with rate "λ"<sub>"i"</sub>. It is named the "hyper"exponential distribution since its coefficient of variation is greater than that of the exponential distribution, whose coefficient of variation is 1, and the hypoexponential distribution, which has a coefficient of variation smaller than one. While the exponential distribution is the continuous analogue of the geometric distribution, the hyperexponential distribution is not analogous to the hypergeometric distribution. The hyperexponential distribution is an example of a mixture density.

An example of a hyperexponential random variable can be seen in the context of telephony, where, if someone has a modem and a phone, their phone line usage could be modeled as a hyperexponential distribution where there is probability "p" of them talking on the phone with rate "λ"<sub>1</sub> and probability "q" of them using their internet connection with rate "λ"<sub>2</sub>.

## Properties

Since the expected value of a sum is the sum of the expected values, the expected value of a hyperexponential random variable can be shown as:

$$
E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \frac{1}{\lambda_i}
$$

and

$$
Var[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \frac{1}{\lambda_i^2} - \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \frac{1}{\lambda_i}\right)^2
$$

from which we can derive the coefficient of variation:

$$
CV[X] = \sqrt{\frac{Var[X]}{E[X]^2}} > 1
$$

The moment-generating function is given by:

$$
M_X(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \frac{\lambda_i}{\lambda_i - t}e^{-\lambda_i t}
$$

## Fitting

A given probability distribution, including a heavy-tailed distribution, can be approximated by a hyperexponential distribution by fitting recursively to different time scales using Prony's method. This method involves finding the parameters "p"<sub>"i"</sub> and "λ"<sub>"i"</sub> that minimize the difference between the observed and expected values of the random variable "X".

#### 3.4b Application of Hyperexponential Distribution in Queueing Systems

The hyperexponential distribution has been widely used in queueing theory to model various types of systems, including call centers, telecommunication networks, and manufacturing processes. In this section, we will discuss some of the applications of the hyperexponential distribution in queueing systems.

##### Call Centers

In call centers, the hyperexponential distribution can be used to model the arrival rate of calls, the waiting times between calls, and the duration of calls. This allows call center managers to determine the optimal number of agents needed to handle the incoming calls, and to predict the probability of packet loss or delay. The hyperexponential distribution is particularly useful in call centers because it can capture the variability in call arrival rates and durations, which is often observed in real-world call center environments.

##### Telecommunication Networks

In telecommunication networks, the hyperexponential distribution can be used to model the arrival rate of packets, the waiting times between packets, and the duration of packets. This allows network engineers to determine the optimal routing of packets, and to predict the probability of packet loss or delay. The hyperexponential distribution is particularly useful in telecommunication networks because it can capture the variability in packet arrival rates and durations, which is often observed in real-world telecommunication environments.

##### Manufacturing Processes

In manufacturing processes, the hyperexponential distribution can be used to model the arrival rate of jobs, the waiting times between jobs, and the duration of jobs. This allows manufacturing engineers to determine the optimal number of machines needed to handle the incoming jobs, and to predict the probability of packet loss or delay. The hyperexponential distribution is particularly useful in manufacturing processes because it can capture the variability in job arrival rates and durations, which is often observed in real-world manufacturing environments.

#### 3.4c Case Studies of Hyperexponential Distribution in Queueing Systems

To further illustrate the application of the hyperexponential distribution in queueing systems, let's consider a case study of a telecommunication network. The network consists of a central server and multiple clients. The central server receives requests from the clients and processes them. The processing time for each request is exponentially distributed with rate parameter λ. The arrival rate of requests is also exponentially distributed with rate parameter μ.

The hyperexponential distribution can be used to model the waiting times between requests and the duration of requests. The parameters p<sub>1</sub> and p<sub>2</sub> represent the probabilities of a request being processed with rate λ<sub>1</sub> or λ<sub>2</sub>, respectively. The hyperexponential distribution is particularly useful in this case because it can capture the variability in request arrival rates and durations, which is often observed in real-world telecommunication environments.

The expected waiting time for a request can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the expected waiting time is equal to the expected number of requests in the system divided by the expected arrival rate. The expected number of requests in the system can be calculated using the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula, which is given by:

$$
L = \frac{\lambda}{\mu(\mu - \lambda)}
$$

where L is the expected number of requests in the system, λ is the arrival rate, and μ is the service rate.

The expected waiting time for a request can be calculated as:

$$
W = \frac{L}{\mu} = \frac{\lambda}{\mu(\mu - \lambda)}
$$

The expected duration of a request can be calculated using the same formula, but with the roles of λ and μ reversed.

In conclusion, the hyperexponential distribution is a powerful tool for modeling queueing systems. Its ability to capture variability in arrival rates and durations makes it particularly useful in real-world environments. By understanding the properties and applications of the hyperexponential distribution, we can better analyze and optimize queueing systems.




#### 3.4b Application of Hyperexponential Distribution in Queueing Systems

The hyperexponential distribution has been widely used in queueing systems due to its ability to model complex arrival and service patterns. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of the hyperexponential distribution in queueing systems.

##### Fork-Join Queue

The fork-join queue is a type of queueing system where a job is split into "N" subtasks, each of which is serviced by a separate server. The job is only considered complete when all the subtasks have been serviced. The response time distribution in a fork-join queue can be approximated using the hyperexponential distribution when service times are exponentially distributed and jobs arrive according to a Poisson process or a general distribution. This approximation is particularly useful when the number of servers ("N") is greater than 2.

##### Average Response Time

The average response time in a queueing system is a critical performance metric. For a fork-join queue with "N" servers, an exact formula for the average response time is only known when each server is an M/M/1 queue and service times are exponentially distributed. However, for more complex service time distributions, the hyperexponential distribution can be used to approximate the average response time. This approximation is particularly useful when the service times at each node are not exponentially distributed.

##### Subtask Dispersion

The subtask dispersion, defined as the range of service times, can be numerically computed and optimal deterministic delays can be introduced to minimize the range. The hyperexponential distribution can be used to model the service times at each node, making it a useful tool for managing subtask dispersion in queueing systems.

##### Stationary Distribution

In general, the stationary distribution of the number of jobs at each queue in a queueing system is intractable. However, for a fork-join queue with two servers, Flatto derived the stationary distribution for the number of jobs at each queue via uniformization techniques. The hyperexponential distribution can be used to model the service times at each node, making it a useful tool for understanding the stationary distribution in more complex queueing systems.

In conclusion, the hyperexponential distribution is a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing queueing systems. Its ability to handle complex arrival and service patterns makes it a valuable addition to the queueing theorist's toolkit.

#### 3.5a Definition and Properties of General Distribution

The general distribution is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that provides a framework for modeling and analyzing complex systems. It is a probability distribution that can be used to describe the behavior of a system, given certain constraints. The general distribution is defined by a set of parameters that describe the system, and it can be used to calculate the probability of various events occurring in the system.

The general distribution is defined by a set of parameters, denoted as `$\mathbf{X}$`. These parameters can be thought of as the state of the system, and they can be used to calculate the probability of various events occurring in the system. The general distribution is denoted as `$q(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{X})$`, where `$\mathbf{y}$` is the set of observed values.

The general distribution has several important properties that make it a useful tool in queueing theory. These properties are:

1. **Linearity**: The general distribution is linear, meaning that the sum of two independent general distributions is also a general distribution. This property is useful for modeling complex systems, as it allows us to break down a system into simpler components and then combine the results.

2. **Convolution**: The general distribution satisfies the convolution property, meaning that the convolution of two independent general distributions is also a general distribution. This property is useful for modeling systems with multiple components, as it allows us to calculate the probability of a complex event by breaking it down into simpler events.

3. **Marginalization**: The general distribution satisfies the marginalization property, meaning that the marginal distribution of a subset of variables is also a general distribution. This property is useful for reducing the complexity of a system, as it allows us to focus on a subset of variables and then extend our results to the entire system.

4. **Conditioning**: The general distribution satisfies the conditioning property, meaning that the conditional distribution of a subset of variables given the remaining variables is also a general distribution. This property is useful for modeling systems with dependencies, as it allows us to account for the influence of one set of variables on another.

In the next section, we will explore some of the applications of the general distribution in queueing systems.

#### 3.5b Application of General Distribution in Queueing Systems

The general distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory, and it has a wide range of applications in the analysis of queueing systems. In this section, we will explore some of these applications, focusing on the use of the general distribution in the analysis of queueing systems.

##### 3.5b.1 Modeling Complex Systems

As mentioned in the previous section, the general distribution is particularly useful for modeling complex systems. This is because the general distribution allows us to break down a complex system into simpler components, and then combine the results to obtain the overall system behavior. This is achieved through the linearity property of the general distribution, which allows us to model the system as a linear combination of its components.

For example, consider a queueing system with multiple servers, each serving a different type of job. The general distribution can be used to model the behavior of this system, by considering the individual servers as separate components. The overall system behavior can then be calculated by summing the individual server behaviors, which is possible due to the linearity property of the general distribution.

##### 3.5b.2 Analyzing Queueing Systems

The general distribution is also a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems. This is because the general distribution provides a way to calculate the probability of various events occurring in the system. This can be particularly useful in the design and optimization of queueing systems, as it allows us to predict the behavior of the system under different conditions.

For example, consider a queueing system with a single server. The general distribution can be used to calculate the probability of the system being in a particular state, such as having a certain number of jobs in the queue. This can be useful in determining the optimal number of servers for the system, or in predicting the system behavior under different load conditions.

##### 3.5b.3 Extending to More Complex Distributions

The general distribution can also be extended to more complex distributions, such as the multivariate normal distribution. This is achieved through the use of the multivariate normal distribution, which is a special case of the general distribution. The multivariate normal distribution is particularly useful in queueing theory, as it allows us to model systems with multiple correlated variables.

For example, consider a queueing system with multiple servers, each serving a different type of job. The multivariate normal distribution can be used to model the behavior of this system, by considering the individual servers as correlated variables. The overall system behavior can then be calculated using the multivariate normal distribution, which is possible due to the extension of the general distribution to the multivariate normal distribution.

In conclusion, the general distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory, with a wide range of applications in the analysis of queueing systems. Its ability to model complex systems, analyze queueing systems, and extend to more complex distributions makes it an essential concept in the study of queueing theory.

Consider a telecommunication network with multiple servers, each serving a different type of call. The network can be modeled using the general distribution, with each server representing a separate component. The overall network behavior can then be calculated by summing the individual server behaviors, due to the linearity property of the general distribution.

The general distribution can also be used to analyze the network. For example, the probability of the network being in a particular state, such as having a certain number of calls in the queue, can be calculated using the general distribution. This can be useful in predicting the network behavior under different conditions, and in optimizing the network design.

##### 3.5c.2 Case Study 2: Manufacturing Process

In a manufacturing process, jobs are processed by multiple machines, each with a different processing time. The process can be modeled using the general distribution, with each machine representing a separate component. The overall process behavior can then be calculated by summing the individual machine behaviors, due to the linearity property of the general distribution.

The general distribution can also be used to analyze the process. For example, the probability of the process being in a particular state, such as having a certain number of jobs in the queue, can be calculated using the general distribution. This can be useful in predicting the process behavior under different conditions, and in optimizing the process design.

##### 3.5c.3 Case Study 3: Computer Network

Consider a computer network with multiple servers, each serving a different type of request. The network can be modeled using the general distribution, with each server representing a separate component. The overall network behavior can then be calculated by summing the individual server behaviors, due to the linearity property of the general distribution.

The general distribution can also be used to analyze the network. For example, the probability of the network being in a particular state, such as having a certain number of requests in the queue, can be calculated using the general distribution. This can be useful in predicting the network behavior under different conditions, and in optimizing the network design.

These case studies illustrate the power and versatility of the general distribution in queueing theory. By breaking down complex systems into simpler components, and then combining the results, the general distribution provides a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing queueing systems.

## Chapter: Chapter 4: Little’s Law

### Introduction

In the realm of queueing theory, Little's Law holds a pivotal role. Named after John Little, a British mathematician, this law is a fundamental concept that provides a mathematical relationship between the average queue length, the average number of customers in the system, and the average waiting time in a queueing system. 

Little's Law is a cornerstone of queueing theory, and it is often used as a starting point for more complex queueing models. It is particularly useful in the analysis of queueing systems, as it provides a simple and intuitive way to understand the behavior of queues. 

In this chapter, we will delve into the intricacies of Little's Law, exploring its assumptions, its implications, and its applications in queueing theory. We will also discuss the mathematical formulation of Little's Law, which can be expressed as:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

where `$L$` is the average queue length, `$\lambda$` is the arrival rate, and `$W$` is the average waiting time.

#### 3.5b Application of General Distribution in Queueing Systems

The general distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory, and it has a wide range of applications in various queueing systems. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of the general distribution in queueing systems.

##### Buzen's Algorithm

Buzen's algorithm is a method for computing the normalizing constant `G(N)` in the Gordon-Newell theorem. This algorithm is particularly useful in queueing systems with multiple service facilities and circulating customers. The algorithm is based on the general distribution and is used to calculate the steady state probabilities of the number of customers at each service facility.

The algorithm works by solving a set of equations that describe the behavior of the system. These equations are derived from the Gordon-Newell theorem and are used to calculate the values of `X_i` for each service facility `i`. These values are then used to calculate the normalizing constant `G(N)`.

##### Fork-Join Queue Networks

The general distribution is also used in the analysis of fork-join queue networks. A fork-join queue network is a type of queueing system where a job is split into multiple sub-tasks that are serviced in parallel. The sub-tasks then rejoin to form the completed job.

The general distribution is used to calculate the response time distribution for a network of fork-join queues joined in series. This is done by approximating the response time distribution using an analytical formula. The general distribution is also used in the analysis of split-merge models, where a job is split into multiple sub-tasks that are serviced in parallel and then rejoin to form the completed job.

##### Other Applications

The general distribution has many other applications in queueing theory. It is used in the analysis of complex queueing systems, such as networks of queues and systems with multiple service facilities. It is also used in the development of queueing models for real-world systems, such as call centers and transportation systems.

In conclusion, the general distribution is a fundamental concept in queueing theory with a wide range of applications. It provides a powerful framework for modeling and analyzing complex queueing systems, and it is essential for understanding the behavior of these systems. 


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the fundamental distributional laws that are essential in queueing theory. We have learned about the Poisson distribution, which is used to model the arrival process in queueing systems. We have also discussed the exponential distribution, which is used to model the service time in queueing systems. Furthermore, we have delved into the Erlang distribution, which is used to model the waiting time in queueing systems. These distributional laws are crucial in understanding the behavior of queueing systems and predicting their performance.

We have also discussed the concept of traffic intensity and how it affects the performance of queueing systems. We have seen that when the traffic intensity is high, the system experiences longer queues and higher waiting times, leading to poor performance. On the other hand, when the traffic intensity is low, the system experiences shorter queues and lower waiting times, resulting in better performance.

Finally, we have explored the concept of Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. This law is a powerful tool in analyzing queueing systems and predicting their performance.

In conclusion, the distributional laws and concepts discussed in this chapter are fundamental in understanding queueing systems and predicting their performance. They provide a solid foundation for further exploration into advanced applications of queueing theory.

### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the fundamental distributional laws that are essential in queueing theory. We have learned about the Poisson distribution, which is used to model the arrival process in queueing systems. We have also discussed the exponential distribution, which is used to model the service time in queueing systems.

We have also discussed the concept of traffic intensity and how it affects the performance of queueing systems. We have seen that when the traffic intensity is high, the system experiences longer queues and higher waiting times, leading to poor performance. On the other hand, when the traffic intensity is low, the system experiences shorter queues and lower waiting times, resulting in better performance.

Finally, we have explored the concept of Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. This law is a powerful tool in analyzing queueing systems and predicting their performance.

## Chapter 4: Networks:




### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of queueing theory, including the basic concepts and models. We have also discussed the applications of queueing theory in various fields, such as telecommunication networks, computer systems, and manufacturing systems. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the theory and explore the concept of conservation laws.

Conservation laws are fundamental principles in queueing theory that govern the behavior of queues. These laws are based on the concept of conservation of flow, which states that the total flow into a system must be equal to the total flow out of the system. In other words, the total number of customers entering a system must be equal to the total number of customers leaving the system.

There are three main conservation laws in queueing theory: Little's Law, PASTA, and Fork-Join. Each of these laws has its own unique application and is essential in understanding the behavior of queues. In this chapter, we will explore each of these laws in detail and discuss their applications in various queueing systems.

We will begin by discussing Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in a system is equal to the average number of customers in the queue plus the average number of customers being served. This law is fundamental in understanding the behavior of queues and is used to calculate important performance measures, such as average queue length and average waiting time.

Next, we will explore PASTA (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages), which states that the arrivals to a queueing system are Poisson and that the time averages of the system are equal to the long-run averages. This law is essential in understanding the behavior of queues with heavy-tailed service time distributions.

Finally, we will discuss Fork-Join, which states that the total time spent in a system is equal to the sum of the individual service times at each service facility. This law is useful in understanding the behavior of queues with multiple service facilities.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the three main conservation laws in queueing theory and their applications. These laws are essential in understanding the behavior of queues and are crucial in solving real-world problems. So let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of conservation laws in queueing theory.




### Subsection: 4.1a Definition and Calculation of Traffic Intensity

Traffic intensity is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that measures the average occupancy of a server or resource during a specified period of time. It is a crucial metric in understanding the behavior of queueing systems and is used to calculate important performance measures, such as average queue length and average waiting time.

In telecommunication networks, traffic intensity is measured in traffic units (erlangs) and is defined as the ratio of the time during which a facility is cumulatively occupied to the time this facility is available for occupancy. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
\lambda = \frac{\text{Time facility is occupied}}{\text{Time facility is available}}
$$

where $\lambda$ represents the traffic intensity.

In a digital network, the traffic intensity is given by:

$$
\lambda = \frac{\text{Arrival rate of bits}}{\text{Service rate of bits}}
$$

where the arrival rate of bits is the rate at which bits arrive at the network and the service rate of bits is the rate at which bits can be transmitted.

A traffic intensity greater than one erlang means that the rate at which bits arrive exceeds the rate bits can be transmitted, resulting in queuing delay that will grow without bound if the traffic intensity stays the same. On the other hand, a traffic intensity less than one erlang indicates that the router can handle more average traffic.

Telecommunication operators are vitally interested in traffic intensity, as it dictates the amount of equipment they must supply. A high traffic intensity may indicate the need for additional resources or a reconfiguration of the network to improve performance.

In the next section, we will explore Little's Law, another fundamental conservation law in queueing theory, and its applications in various queueing systems.




#### 4.1b Relationship between Traffic Intensity and System Performance

The relationship between traffic intensity and system performance is a critical aspect of queueing theory. As we have seen in the previous section, traffic intensity is a measure of the average occupancy of a server or resource during a specified period of time. It is a key factor in determining the performance of a queueing system.

In a queueing system, the traffic intensity is directly related to the average queue length and average waiting time. As the traffic intensity increases, the average queue length and average waiting time also increase. This is because as more customers arrive at the system, the system becomes more congested, leading to longer queues and longer waiting times.

However, it is important to note that the relationship between traffic intensity and system performance is not linear. As the traffic intensity approaches 1, the relationship becomes more complex. This is because as the system approaches its maximum capacity, small changes in traffic intensity can have a significant impact on system performance.

For example, consider a system with a traffic intensity of 0.9. If the traffic intensity is increased to 1, the system will experience a significant increase in average queue length and average waiting time. However, if the traffic intensity is decreased to 0.8, the system will not experience a significant decrease in average queue length and average waiting time. This is because the system is already close to its maximum capacity, and small changes in traffic intensity have a larger impact on system performance.

This relationship between traffic intensity and system performance is crucial in understanding the behavior of queueing systems. It allows us to predict how changes in traffic intensity will affect system performance, and to make decisions about resource allocation and system design.

In the next section, we will explore Little's Law, another fundamental conservation law in queueing theory, and its applications in various queueing systems.

#### 4.1c Traffic Intensity in Queueing Systems

In queueing systems, traffic intensity is a crucial factor that determines the performance of the system. It is defined as the ratio of the average arrival rate of customers to the average service rate of the system. Mathematically, it can be represented as:

$$
\lambda = \frac{\mu}{\mu - \lambda}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the traffic intensity, and $\mu$ is the average service rate of the system.

The traffic intensity is a dimensionless quantity and can range from 0 to infinity. A traffic intensity of 0 indicates an empty system, while a traffic intensity of 1 indicates a system at its maximum capacity. A traffic intensity greater than 1 indicates that the system is overloaded, and a traffic intensity less than 1 indicates that the system has spare capacity.

The relationship between traffic intensity and system performance is complex and non-linear. As the traffic intensity increases, the average queue length and average waiting time also increase. However, the relationship becomes more complex as the system approaches its maximum capacity. Small changes in traffic intensity can have a significant impact on system performance when the system is close to its maximum capacity.

In queueing systems, traffic intensity is a key factor in determining the stability of the system. A system is said to be stable if the queue length remains bounded for all time. According to the Little's Law, the average queue length in a stable system is equal to the product of the traffic intensity and the average waiting time. Mathematically, it can be represented as:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

where $L$ is the average queue length, $\lambda$ is the traffic intensity, and $W$ is the average waiting time.

In the next section, we will explore Little's Law in more detail and discuss its implications for queueing systems.




#### 4.2a Definition and Concept of Balance Equation

The balance equation is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that describes the flow of customers through a system. It is a mathematical representation of Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in a system is equal to the average arrival rate of customers multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system.

The balance equation is given by:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

where $L$ is the average number of customers in the system, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate of customers, and $W$ is the average time a customer spends in the system.

The balance equation is a powerful tool in queueing theory as it allows us to understand the relationship between the arrival rate of customers, the time they spend in the system, and the number of customers in the system. It also provides a basis for understanding the relationship between traffic intensity and system performance, as discussed in the previous section.

The balance equation can be used to derive other important equations in queueing theory, such as the Little's Law equation and the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula. These equations provide further insights into the behavior of queueing systems and are essential tools for analyzing and optimizing queueing systems.

In the next section, we will explore the balance equation in more detail and discuss its implications for queueing systems.

#### 4.2b Application of Balance Equation in Queueing Systems

The balance equation is a fundamental tool in queueing theory that allows us to understand the behavior of queueing systems. In this section, we will explore how the balance equation can be applied in queueing systems to analyze and optimize system performance.

The balance equation can be used to derive the Little's Law equation, which states that the average number of customers in a system is equal to the average arrival rate of customers multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. This equation is given by:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

where $L$ is the average number of customers in the system, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate of customers, and $W$ is the average time a customer spends in the system.

The Little's Law equation is a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems. It allows us to understand the relationship between the arrival rate of customers, the time they spend in the system, and the number of customers in the system. This understanding is crucial for optimizing system performance.

For example, if we know the arrival rate of customers and the average time a customer spends in the system, we can use the Little's Law equation to calculate the average number of customers in the system. If this number is too high, we can take steps to reduce the arrival rate or decrease the time customers spend in the system to improve system performance.

The balance equation can also be used to derive the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula, which provides a closed-form expression for the response time distribution in a queueing system. This formula is given by:

$$
F(x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(\lambda x)^k}{k!} \left( \frac{1}{1 - G(k)} \right)
$$

where $F(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the response time, $G(k)$ is the generating function of the service time distribution, and $k$ is the number of service facilities.

The Pollaczek-Khinchine formula is a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems. It allows us to understand the distribution of response times in a system, which is crucial for optimizing system performance.

In the next section, we will explore the balance equation in more detail and discuss its implications for queueing systems.

#### 4.2c Balance Equation in Queueing Networks

The balance equation is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that describes the flow of customers through a system. In queueing networks, the balance equation is used to analyze the behavior of the system and optimize its performance.

In a queueing network, customers move from one queue to another, and the balance equation is used to describe the flow of customers between these queues. The balance equation for a queueing network is given by:

$$
\lambda_i = \sum_{j=1}^{N} \lambda_j \frac{L_j}{L_i}
$$

where $\lambda_i$ is the arrival rate at queue $i$, $L_i$ is the average number of customers in queue $i$, and $N$ is the total number of queues in the network.

The balance equation for a queueing network can be used to derive the Little's Law equation for the network, which states that the average number of customers in the network is equal to the average arrival rate of customers multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the network. This equation is given by:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

where $L$ is the average number of customers in the network, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate of customers, and $W$ is the average time a customer spends in the network.

The Little's Law equation for a queueing network is a powerful tool for analyzing the behavior of the network. It allows us to understand the relationship between the arrival rate of customers, the time they spend in the network, and the number of customers in the network. This understanding is crucial for optimizing network performance.

For example, if we know the arrival rate of customers and the average time a customer spends in the network, we can use the Little's Law equation to calculate the average number of customers in the network. If this number is too high, we can take steps to reduce the arrival rate or decrease the time customers spend in the network to improve network performance.

The balance equation for a queueing network can also be used to derive the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula for the network, which provides a closed-form expression for the response time distribution in the network. This formula is given by:

$$
F(x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(\lambda x)^k}{k!} \left( \frac{1}{1 - G(k)} \right)
$$

where $F(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the response time, $G(k)$ is the generating function of the service time distribution, and $k$ is the number of service facilities.

The Pollaczek-Khinchine formula for a queueing network is a powerful tool for analyzing the distribution of response times in the network. It allows us to understand the probability of a customer experiencing a response time greater than a certain value, which is crucial for optimizing network performance.




#### 4.2b Application of Balance Equation in Queueing Systems

The balance equation can be used to derive the Little's Law equation, which states that the average number of customers in a system is equal to the average arrival rate of customers multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. This equation is given by:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

where $L$ is the average number of customers in the system, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate of customers, and $W$ is the average time a customer spends in the system.

This equation is a powerful tool for understanding the relationship between the arrival rate of customers, the time they spend in the system, and the number of customers in the system. It allows us to analyze the performance of a queueing system and make predictions about how changes in the system will affect the average number of customers in the system.

The balance equation can also be used to derive the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula, which provides a closed-form expression for the average waiting time in a queueing system. This formula is given by:

$$
W = \frac{\lambda}{\mu(1-\rho)}
$$

where $\mu$ is the average service rate of customers and $\rho$ is the traffic intensity of the system.

This formula is particularly useful for analyzing the performance of queueing systems with multiple service facilities, as it allows us to calculate the average waiting time for each service facility and then combine these values to calculate the average waiting time for the entire system.

In addition to these equations, the balance equation can also be used to derive other important results in queueing theory, such as the Erlang's loss formula and the Erlang's delay formula. These results provide further insights into the behavior of queueing systems and are essential tools for analyzing and optimizing queueing systems.

In the next section, we will explore how the balance equation can be applied in queueing systems with multiple service facilities.

#### 4.2c Balance Equation in Queueing Systems

The balance equation is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that allows us to understand the behavior of queueing systems. It is a mathematical representation of Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in a system is equal to the average arrival rate of customers multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. This equation is given by:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

where $L$ is the average number of customers in the system, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate of customers, and $W$ is the average time a customer spends in the system.

The balance equation is a powerful tool for understanding the performance of queueing systems. It allows us to analyze the relationship between the arrival rate of customers, the time they spend in the system, and the number of customers in the system. By manipulating this equation, we can derive other important results in queueing theory, such as the Little's Law equation, the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula, and the Erlang's loss formula.

The balance equation can also be applied in queueing systems with multiple service facilities. In such systems, the balance equation can be extended to account for the probability of a customer moving from one service facility to another. This is particularly useful for analyzing the performance of queueing systems with multiple service facilities, as it allows us to calculate the average waiting time for each service facility and then combine these values to calculate the average waiting time for the entire system.

In the next section, we will explore how the balance equation can be applied in queueing systems with multiple service facilities in more detail. We will also discuss how the balance equation can be used to derive other important results in queueing theory, such as the Erlang's delay formula and the Buzen's algorithm.




#### 4.3a Definition and Principles of Network Flow Conservation

Network flow conservation is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that is closely related to the principles of Little's Law and the balance equation. It is based on the idea that the total amount of flow entering a system must be equal to the total amount of flow leaving the system, plus the amount of flow accumulated within the system.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
\lambda = \mu L
$$

where $\lambda$ is the arrival rate of customers, $\mu$ is the service rate, and $L$ is the average number of customers in the system. This equation is a direct consequence of Little's Law and the balance equation, and it provides a powerful tool for analyzing the performance of queueing systems.

In the context of network flow conservation, this principle can be applied to each node in a network, allowing us to understand the flow of customers through the network. By applying this principle to each node, we can derive the following equation:

$$
\lambda = \mu L + \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}
$$

where $\frac{\partial L}{\partial t}$ represents the rate of change of the average number of customers in the system over time. This equation provides a more detailed understanding of the flow of customers through a network, taking into account not only the arrival and service rates, but also the rate of change of the number of customers in the system.

In the next section, we will explore how these principles can be applied to analyze the performance of queueing systems in a network.

#### 4.3b Application of Network Flow Conservation in Queueing Systems

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of network flow conservation and its application in queueing systems. In this section, we will delve deeper into the application of network flow conservation in queueing systems, particularly in the context of multi-commodity flow problems.

The multi-commodity flow problem is a network flow problem with multiple commodities (flow demands) between different source and sink nodes. This problem is often encountered in queueing systems, where different types of customers (commodities) need to be served. The goal is to find an assignment of all flow variables which satisfies the following four constraints:

1. Link capacity: The sum of all flows routed over a link does not exceed its capacity.
2. Flow conservation on transit nodes: The amount of a flow entering an intermediate node $u$ is the same that exits the node.
3. Flow conservation at the source: A flow must exit its source node completely.
4. Flow conservation at the destination: A flow must enter its sink node completely.

These constraints are closely related to the principles of network flow conservation. For instance, the link capacity constraint can be expressed as:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i(u,v) \leq c(u,v)
$$

where $f_i(u,v)$ is the fraction of flow $i$ along edge $(u,v)$, and $c(u,v)$ is the capacity of edge $(u,v)$. This constraint ensures that the total flow on a link does not exceed its capacity, which is a direct application of the principle of network flow conservation.

Similarly, the flow conservation constraints at the source and destination nodes can be expressed as:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i(s_i,t_i) = 1
$$

and

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i(t_i,s_i) = 1
$$

respectively, where $s_i$ and $t_i$ are the source and sink nodes of flow $i$. These constraints ensure that a flow must exit its source node completely and enter its sink node completely, which are direct applications of the principle of flow conservation at the source and destination nodes.

In the next section, we will explore how these principles can be applied to analyze the performance of queueing systems in a network.

#### 4.3c Challenges in Network Flow Conservation

While the principles of network flow conservation provide a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems, there are several challenges that can arise in their application. These challenges often stem from the inherent complexity of queueing systems and the assumptions made in their modeling.

One of the main challenges in network flow conservation is the assumption of homogeneity. In many queueing systems, customers are assumed to be homogeneous, meaning that they have the same service requirements and can be served interchangeably. However, in reality, customers can vary significantly in their service requirements, leading to potential violations of the flow conservation principles. For instance, in a multi-commodity flow problem, if some commodities have higher service requirements than others, the flow conservation principle at the source node may not hold, as not all flows may exit the source node completely.

Another challenge is the assumption of independence. In many queueing models, it is assumed that the arrival and service processes are independent. However, in reality, there can be significant dependencies between these processes, leading to violations of the flow conservation principles. For example, in a network with multiple queues, the arrival rate to a queue can be influenced by the service rate of other queues, leading to a violation of the flow conservation principle at the source node.

The complexity of queueing systems can also pose challenges for the application of network flow conservation. In many queueing systems, there can be a large number of nodes and links, making it difficult to apply the flow conservation principles directly. Furthermore, the presence of feedback loops in the system can complicate the application of these principles, as the flow on a link can be influenced by the flow on other links, leading to a violation of the link capacity constraint.

Finally, the presence of multiple commodities in a queueing system can also pose challenges for the application of network flow conservation. As seen in the multi-commodity flow problem, the flow conservation principles need to be applied to each commodity, adding complexity to the analysis. Furthermore, the presence of multiple commodities can lead to conflicts in the use of resources, violating the flow conservation principles.

Despite these challenges, the principles of network flow conservation remain a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems. By understanding these challenges and developing strategies to address them, we can gain deeper insights into the behavior of queueing systems and develop more effective strategies for their management.

### Conclusion

## Chapter: Chapter 5: Network Models

### Introduction

In this chapter, we delve into the fascinating world of network models, a fundamental concept in queueing theory. Network models are mathematical representations of systems where the flow of customers or information is organized in a network structure. These models are ubiquitous in various fields, including telecommunications, computer networks, and transportation systems.

The chapter begins by introducing the basic concepts of network models, including nodes, links, and traffic. We will explore how these elements interact to form a network and how customers move through the network. The chapter will also cover the different types of network models, such as series-parallel networks, series networks, and parallel networks.

We will then move on to discuss the performance measures of network models. These include the average queue length, the average waiting time, and the average number of customers in the system. We will learn how to calculate these measures and how they can be used to evaluate the performance of a network.

The chapter will also cover the application of Little's Law in network models.

You will also have the tools to apply these concepts in your own work, whether it be in telecommunications, computer networks, or transportation systems.




#### 4.3b Analyzing Network Flow Conservation in Queueing Systems

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of network flow conservation and its application in queueing systems. In this section, we will delve deeper into the application of network flow conservation in queueing systems, particularly in the context of multi-commodity flow problems.

The multi-commodity flow problem is a network flow problem with multiple commodities (or flows) sharing the same network. Each commodity has a source and a destination node, and a flow rate that represents the amount of flow per unit time. The goal is to find a flow assignment that satisfies certain constraints, such as capacity constraints on the network links and flow conservation at each node.

The concept of network flow conservation is particularly useful in the context of multi-commodity flow problems. As we have seen, the principle of network flow conservation can be expressed as:

$$
\lambda = \mu L + \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}
$$

This equation can be applied to each commodity in the network, allowing us to understand the flow of customers through the network. By applying this principle to each commodity, we can derive the following equation:

$$
\lambda = \mu L + \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the arrival rate of customers for the commodity, $\mu$ is the service rate, $L$ is the average number of customers in the system for the commodity, and $\frac{\partial L}{\partial t}$ represents the rate of change of the average number of customers in the system over time for the commodity.

This equation provides a powerful tool for analyzing the performance of queueing systems in a network. By understanding the arrival and service rates, as well as the rate of change of the number of customers in the system, we can gain insights into the behavior of the queueing system and make informed decisions about its design and operation.

In the next section, we will explore some specific examples of how network flow conservation can be applied to analyze queueing systems in a network.

#### 4.3c Challenges in Network Flow Conservation

While the concept of network flow conservation is a powerful tool in the analysis of queueing systems, it is not without its challenges. These challenges often arise from the inherent complexity of queueing systems and the assumptions made in their modeling.

One of the main challenges in network flow conservation is the assumption of fair queuing. Fair queuing is a fundamental concept in queueing theory, and it assumes that all queues are served in a fair manner. However, in reality, this is not always the case. For instance, in a network with multiple queues, some queues may be served more frequently than others due to various factors such as queue priority or resource allocation. This can lead to violations of the fair queuing assumption, and thus, violations of the network flow conservation principle.

Another challenge is the assumption of bitwise round-robin sharing of link resources among competing flows. This assumption is used in algorithms such as byte-weighted fair queuing, which attempts to emulate the fairness of bitwise round-robin sharing. However, in practice, this assumption may not hold due to factors such as packet-based flows and the need for transmitting packets in sequence. This can lead to discrepancies between the modeled finish time for each packet and the actual finish time, thus violating the network flow conservation principle.

The complexity of the algorithms used to model network flow conservation is another challenge. For instance, the byte-weighted fair queuing algorithm requires the modeling of finish time for each packet, which can be computationally intensive. This complexity can make it difficult to apply the algorithm in real-world scenarios, especially in systems with a large number of queues.

Finally, the concept of virtual time, introduced to reduce computational load, can also pose challenges. While virtual time accurately models the order in which transmissions must occur, it does not accurately model the time packets complete their transmissions. This can lead to discrepancies between the virtual finish time for a packet and its actual finish time, thus violating the network flow conservation principle.

Despite these challenges, the concept of network flow conservation remains a fundamental tool in the analysis of queueing systems. By understanding these challenges and their implications, we can develop more accurate and effective models for analyzing queueing systems.

These laws are fundamental to understanding the behavior of queueing systems and are essential tools in the analysis and design of such systems.

This equation is a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems, as it allows us to express the arrival and departure rates in terms of the system's state. By applying the balance equation, we can derive important performance measures such as the average queue length and the average waiting time.

This law is the foundation of all other conservation laws and is essential for understanding the behavior of queueing systems.

We have also explored the conservation of flow, which states that the average arrival rate to a system is equal to the average departure rate. This law is crucial for understanding the flow of customers through a queueing system and can be used to analyze the system's performance.

Furthermore, we have seen the conservation of workload, which states that the average workload in a system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. This law is useful for understanding the workload of a queueing system and can be used to optimize the system's performance.

In conclusion, the conservation laws of queueing theory are essential for understanding and optimizing queueing systems. They provide a fundamental framework for analyzing and improving the performance of these systems, making them a crucial concept for anyone studying queueing theory.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the concept of PASTA (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages), a fundamental property in queueing theory. PASTA is a powerful tool that allows us to simplify the analysis of queueing systems by making certain assumptions about the arrival process. It is a key concept in queueing theory and is widely used in various applications, including telecommunication networks, computer systems, and manufacturing systems.

The PASTA property is based on the assumption that the arrivals to a queueing system are governed by a Poisson process and that the time averages of the system are equal to the long-run averages. This assumption allows us to make simplifications in the analysis of queueing systems, leading to more tractable models and solutions.

We will begin by introducing the basic concepts of PASTA, including the Poisson process and time averages. We will then explore the implications of PASTA in various queueing systems, including single-server queues, multi-server queues, and networks of queues. We will also discuss the limitations of PASTA and when it may not be applicable.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of PASTA and its applications in queueing theory. You will also be equipped with the knowledge to apply PASTA in your own queueing models and systems. So, let's dive into the world of PASTA and discover its power in queueing theory.




### Section: 5.1 Probability of Arrival:

The probability of arrival is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that describes the likelihood of an event occurring during a specific time interval. In the context of PASTA, the probability of arrival is used to model the arrival process at a queueing system. It is a key parameter in the analysis of queueing systems and is widely used in various applications.

#### 5.1a Definition and Calculation of Probability of Arrival

The probability of arrival, denoted as $P_a$, is defined as the probability that an event will occur during a specific time interval. In the context of queueing theory, the event of interest is typically the arrival of a customer at a queueing system. The probability of arrival is calculated using the following formula:

$$
P_a = \frac{\text{Number of arrivals}}{\text{Total number of time intervals}}
$$

For example, if we have a queueing system where customers arrive at a rate of 10 customers per hour and we observe the system for 10 hours, the probability of arrival would be calculated as follows:

$$
P_a = \frac{10 \text{ customers per hour} \times 10 \text{ hours}}{10 \text{ customers per hour} \times 10 \text{ hours}} = 1
$$

This means that there is a 100% probability that a customer will arrive during any given time interval.

The probability of arrival is a crucial parameter in queueing theory as it allows us to model the arrival process at a queueing system. It is used in conjunction with other parameters, such as the service time and queue discipline, to analyze the performance of queueing systems.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of the probability of arrival in various queueing systems and how it is used in the analysis of queueing systems.

#### 5.1b Probability of Arrival in PASTA Systems

In the context of PASTA (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages), the probability of arrival plays a crucial role in the analysis of queueing systems. PASTA is a fundamental property that allows us to simplify the analysis of queueing systems by making certain assumptions about the arrival process.

In PASTA systems, the probability of arrival is assumed to be constant over time. This means that the probability of an event occurring during a specific time interval is the same as the probability of the event occurring during any other time interval. This assumption is based on the idea that the arrival process is memoryless, meaning that the future arrivals are not affected by the past arrivals.

The probability of arrival in PASTA systems can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
P_a = \frac{\text{Average number of arrivals}}{\text{Total number of time intervals}}
$$

For example, if we have a PASTA system where customers arrive at a rate of 10 customers per hour and we observe the system for 10 hours, the probability of arrival would be calculated as follows:

$$
P_a = \frac{10 \text{ customers per hour} \times 10 \text{ hours}}{10 \text{ customers per hour} \times 10 \text{ hours}} = 1
$$

This means that there is a 100% probability that a customer will arrive during any given time interval.

The assumption of constant probability of arrival in PASTA systems allows us to simplify the analysis of queueing systems. It allows us to model the arrival process as a Poisson process, which is a fundamental concept in queueing theory. The Poisson process is a memoryless process, meaning that the future arrivals are not affected by the past arrivals. This property is crucial in the analysis of queueing systems, as it allows us to make predictions about the future arrivals based on the past arrivals.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of the probability of arrival in PASTA systems and how it is used in the analysis of queueing systems.

#### 5.1c Applications of Probability of Arrival

The concept of probability of arrival is not only fundamental to queueing theory, but it also has wide-ranging applications in various fields. In this section, we will explore some of these applications and how the probability of arrival is used in these contexts.

##### Telecommunication Networks

In telecommunication networks, the probability of arrival is used to model the arrival of calls or data packets at a node. This is particularly important in the design and analysis of call centers, where the probability of arrival can be used to determine the required number of agents to handle the incoming calls.

For example, if we have a call center that receives an average of 100 calls per hour and we want to ensure that no more than 10% of the calls are queued, we can use the probability of arrival to calculate the required number of agents. If we assume that the arrival process is Poisson and that the service time is exponentially distributed, we can use Little's Law to calculate the required number of agents. Little's Law states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. In this case, we would have:

$$
\text{Average number of customers in the system} = \text{Average arrival rate} \times \text{Average time a customer spends in the system}
$$

Solving this equation for the average arrival rate, we get:

$$
\text{Average arrival rate} = \frac{\text{Average number of customers in the system}}{\text{Average time a customer spends in the system}}
$$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$
\text{Average arrival rate} = \frac{100 \text{ calls per hour}}{10 \text{ minutes per call}} = 10 \text{ calls per minute}
$$

This means that we need at least 10 agents to handle the incoming calls.

##### Manufacturing Systems

In manufacturing systems, the probability of arrival is used to model the arrival of jobs at a machine or a workstation. This is particularly important in the design and analysis of production lines, where the probability of arrival can be used to determine the required number of machines or workstations to handle the incoming jobs.

For example, if we have a production line that receives an average of 10 jobs per hour and we want to ensure that no more than 10% of the jobs are queued, we can use the probability of arrival to calculate the required number of machines or workstations. If we assume that the arrival process is Poisson and that the service time is exponentially distributed, we can use Little's Law, as in the previous example, to calculate the required number of machines or workstations.

##### Computer Systems

In computer systems, the probability of arrival is used to model the arrival of requests at a server. This is particularly important in the design and analysis of web servers, where the probability of arrival can be used to determine the required number of servers to handle the incoming requests.

For example, if we have a web server that receives an average of 100 requests per second and we want to ensure that no more than 10% of the requests are queued, we can use the probability of arrival to calculate the required number of servers. If we assume that the arrival process is Poisson and that the service time is exponentially distributed, we can use Little's Law, as in the previous examples, to calculate the required number of servers.

In conclusion, the concept of probability of arrival is a fundamental tool in queueing theory with wide-ranging applications in various fields. By understanding and applying this concept, we can design and analyze queueing systems more effectively.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of the probability of arrival in various queueing systems and how it is used in the analysis of queueing systems.

#### 5.1b Probability of Arrival in PASTA Systems

In the context of PASTA (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages), the probability of arrival plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of queueing systems. PASTA is a fundamental property that allows us to make simplifying assumptions about the arrival process at a queueing system. It states that the arrivals at a queueing system are governed by a Poisson process and that the time averages of the system are equal to the long-run averages.

The probability of arrival in PASTA systems is calculated using the same formula as in non-PASTA systems. However, the interpretation of this probability is different. In PASTA systems, the probability of arrival is used to model the long-run behavior of the system. It is assumed that the arrivals at the system are governed by a Poisson process, and the probability of arrival is used to calculate the expected number of arrivals in a given time interval.

The PASTA property is particularly useful in queueing systems with heavy traffic, where the arrival process is highly variable. By assuming that the arrivals are governed by a Poisson process, we can simplify the analysis of these systems and make predictions about their long-run behavior.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of the PASTA property in various queueing systems and how it is used in the analysis of queueing systems.

#### 5.1c Analyzing Arrival Patterns in Queueing Systems

In the previous section, we discussed the probability of arrival in PASTA systems and how it is used to model the long-run behavior of queueing systems. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of arrival patterns in queueing systems and how they can be analyzed using queueing theory.

The arrival pattern at a queueing system refers to the distribution of arrivals over time. In other words, it describes how many arrivals occur in a given time interval and how these arrivals are distributed over the system. Understanding the arrival pattern is crucial in queueing theory as it provides insights into the behavior of the system and helps in making predictions about its performance.

One of the key tools used in analyzing arrival patterns is the concept of traffic intensity. Traffic intensity, denoted by $\rho$, is defined as the ratio of the average arrival rate to the average service rate. It is a measure of how busy the system is and is used to classify queueing systems into different categories.

For example, in a single-server queueing system, if the traffic intensity $\rho < 1$, the system is said to be stable. This means that the system can handle the incoming traffic and the queue will not grow without bound. However, if the traffic intensity $\rho > 1$, the system is said to be unstable, and the queue will grow without bound, leading to long wait times and potential system failure.

The arrival pattern at a queueing system can be analyzed using various techniques, such as the Erlang-C formula and the Buzen's algorithm. These techniques provide insights into the distribution of arrivals over time and help in predicting the performance of the system.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of traffic intensity in more detail and discuss its implications in queueing systems. We will also discuss how traffic intensity can be used to analyze the arrival pattern at a queueing system.




### Section: 5.2 Probability of Service:

The probability of service is another fundamental concept in queueing theory that describes the likelihood of an event occurring during a specific time interval. In the context of PASTA, the probability of service is used to model the service process at a queueing system. It is a key parameter in the analysis of queueing systems and is widely used in various applications.

#### 5.2a Definition and Calculation of Probability of Service

The probability of service, denoted as $P_s$, is defined as the probability that an event will occur during a specific time interval. In the context of queueing theory, the event of interest is typically the service of a customer at a queueing system. The probability of service is calculated using the following formula:

$$
P_s = \frac{\text{Number of services}}{\text{Total number of time intervals}}
$$

For example, if we have a queueing system where customers are served at a rate of 10 customers per hour and we observe the system for 10 hours, the probability of service would be calculated as follows:

$$
P_s = \frac{10 \text{ customers per hour} \times 10 \text{ hours}}{10 \text{ customers per hour} \times 10 \text{ hours}} = 1
$$

This means that there is a 100% probability that a customer will be served during any given time interval.

The probability of service is a crucial parameter in queueing theory as it allows us to model the service process at a queueing system. It is used in conjunction with other parameters, such as the arrival rate and service time, to analyze the performance of queueing systems.

#### 5.2b Probability of Service in PASTA Systems

In the context of PASTA, the probability of service plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of queueing systems. PASTA is a fundamental property that states that the arrival process at a queueing system is Poisson and the service time is exponentially distributed. This property allows us to make simplifying assumptions about the behavior of queueing systems, making it easier to analyze and understand their performance.

The probability of service in PASTA systems is particularly useful in understanding the behavior of queueing systems with multiple service facilities. In such systems, the probability of service can be calculated using Buzen's algorithm, which is an efficient procedure for computing the normalizing constant $G(N)$ in the steady state probability distribution. This algorithm is based on the Gordon-Newell theorem, which states that the steady state probability distribution can be written as:

$$
\mathbb P(n_1,n_2,\cdots,n_M) = \frac{1}{G(N)}\prod_{i=1}^M \left( X_i \right)^{n_i}
$$

where $X_i$ is determined by solving the equation $\mu_j X_j = \sum_{i=1}^M \mu_i X_i p_{ij}$ for $j=1,\ldots,M$. The values of $X_i$ are then used to calculate the probability of service at each service facility.

In conclusion, the probability of service is a crucial concept in queueing theory, particularly in the context of PASTA systems. It allows us to model and analyze the behavior of queueing systems, making it an essential tool for understanding the performance of such systems.

#### 5.2c Analyzing Service Patterns in Queueing Systems

In addition to understanding the probability of service, it is also important to analyze the service patterns in queueing systems. This involves studying the behavior of the service process and identifying any patterns or trends that may impact the performance of the system.

One way to analyze service patterns is by using the concept of Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in a system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system.

As the system approaches a steady state, the probability of time average approaches a constant value. This value represents the average probability of a customer being served during any given time interval.

In addition to its use in analyzing queueing systems, the probability of time average is also used in other applications, such as traffic engineering and network design. By understanding the probability of time average, we can make informed decisions about the design and management of these systems.

### Subsection: 5.3c Applications of Probability of Time Average

In addition, the probability of time average is also used in the analysis of queueing networks. By considering the probability of time average at each queue in the network, we can determine the overall performance of the network and identify potential bottlenecks.

Furthermore, the probability of time average is also used in the design of queueing systems. By setting the arrival rate and service time parameters, we can control the probability of time average and optimize the performance of the system.

In conclusion, the probability of time average is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that is used to analyze the performance of queueing systems. It is a crucial parameter in the analysis of queueing systems and has various applications in queueing theory.

By assuming that arrivals to a queueing system are Poisson and that the system sees time averages, we can reduce the complexity of our models and still obtain meaningful insights.

We have also discussed the implications of PASTA on queueing systems. By applying PASTA, we can derive important performance measures such as the average queue length, waiting time, and throughput. These measures are crucial in understanding the behavior of queueing systems and can be used to make informed decisions about system design and management.

Furthermore, we have seen how PASTA can be extended to more complex queueing systems, such as those with multiple servers or multiple queues. By understanding the underlying principles of PASTA, we can apply it to a wide range of queueing models, making it a powerful tool in the analysis of queueing systems.

In conclusion, PASTA is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that allows us to simplify complex queueing models and derive important performance measures. By understanding and applying PASTA, we can gain valuable insights into the behavior of queueing systems and make informed decisions about their design and management.

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of queueing theory, including the basic concepts, models, and applications. We have also delved into the advanced aspects of queueing theory, such as systems with overtaking and approximate solutions. In this chapter, we will focus on systems with no overtaking and exact solutions.

Queueing systems without overtaking are a special class of queueing systems where the order in which customers are served is the same as the order in which they arrived. This assumption simplifies the analysis of the system, making it easier to derive exact solutions. We will explore the characteristics of these systems, their mathematical models, and the techniques used to solve them.

Exact solutions in queueing theory refer to the analytical solutions of queueing models. These solutions provide a precise understanding of the system's behavior, including the average number of customers in the system, the average waiting time, and the average queue length. We will discuss the methods used to derive these solutions, such as the birth-death process and the Markov chain approach.

This chapter will provide a comprehensive understanding of systems with no overtaking and exact solutions. We will start by introducing the concept of systems with no overtaking, discussing their characteristics and mathematical models. We will then delve into the techniques used to solve these systems, including the birth-death process and the Markov chain approach. Finally, we will explore some advanced applications of these systems, such as traffic flow and call centers.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of systems with no overtaking and exact solutions. They will be equipped with the knowledge and skills to analyze and solve these systems, and to apply these concepts in real-world scenarios. This chapter serves as a stepping stone to more advanced topics in queueing theory, such as systems with overtaking and approximate solutions, which will be covered in the subsequent chapters.




### Subsection: 6.1a Definition and Analysis of FIFO Queueing System

The FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queueing system is a fundamental concept in queueing theory. It is a single-server queueing system where customers arrive at a single queue and are served in the order of their arrival. This system is often used in real-world scenarios, such as supermarkets, call centers, and computer networks.

#### Definition of FIFO Queueing System

The FIFO queueing system is a single-server queueing system where customers arrive at a single queue and are served in the order of their arrival. This system is often represented as a single-server queue with infinite capacity. The FIFO system is a special case of the more general M/G/1 queueing system, where the service time distribution follows a general distribution.

The FIFO system can be described by the following characteristics:

1. Customers arrive at a single queue.
2. Customers are served in the order of their arrival.
3. The service time follows a general distribution.
4. The system has infinite capacity.

#### Analysis of FIFO Queueing System

The analysis of the FIFO queueing system involves determining the steady-state probabilities of the system, which describe the probability of the system being in a particular state. These probabilities are used to calculate the average number of customers in the system, the average waiting time, and the average queue length.

The steady-state probabilities of the FIFO queueing system can be calculated using the birth-death process, which is a stochastic process that models the changes in the number of customers in the system over time. The birth-death process is a special case of the Markov chain, which is a mathematical model that describes the evolution of a system over time.

The birth-death process for the FIFO queueing system can be represented as follows:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
p_0 & p_1 & p_2 & \cdots \\
q_0 & q_1 & q_2 & \cdots
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $p_i$ is the probability of a birth event (a customer arrival) occurring when there are $i$ customers in the system, and $q_i$ is the probability of a death event (a customer departure) occurring when there are $i$ customers in the system.

The steady-state probabilities $p_i$ and $q_i$ can be calculated using the following equations:

$$
p_i = \frac{\lambda^i}{\mu(\lambda)} \frac{1}{i!} p_0
$$

$$
q_i = \frac{\lambda^i}{\mu(\lambda)} \frac{1}{i!} q_0
$$

where $\lambda$ is the arrival rate, $\mu$ is the service rate, and $p_0$ and $q_0$ are the initial probabilities.

The average number of customers in the system, the average waiting time, and the average queue length can be calculated using the following equations:

$$
L = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} i p_i
$$

$$
W = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (i-L) q_i
$$

$$
L_q = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (i-L) p_i
$$

where $L$ is the average number of customers in the system, $W$ is the average waiting time, and $L_q$ is the average queue length.

In the next section, we will explore the FIFO queueing system with multiple servers, which is a more general version of the FIFO system.




### Subsection: 6.1b Performance Measures in FIFO Queueing System

The performance of a queueing system can be evaluated using various performance measures. These measures provide insights into the system's efficiency, effectiveness, and customer satisfaction. In this section, we will discuss some of the key performance measures for the FIFO queueing system.

#### Average Number of Customers in the System

The average number of customers in the system, denoted as $L$, is a measure of the system's utilization. It represents the average number of customers in the system, including those being served and those waiting in the queue. The average number of customers in the system can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate of customers multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

where $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate of customers and $W$ is the average time a customer spends in the system.

#### Average Waiting Time

The average waiting time, denoted as $W$, is a measure of the system's delay. It represents the average amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue. The average waiting time can be calculated using Little's Law, as mentioned earlier. It can also be calculated directly from the steady-state probabilities of the system. The average waiting time can be represented as:

$$
W = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} (i-1)p_i}{\lambda}
$$

where $p_i$ is the steady-state probability of the system being in state $i$.

#### Average Queue Length

The average queue length, denoted as $L_q$, is a measure of the system's queue congestion. It represents the average number of customers waiting in the queue. The average queue length can be calculated using the average waiting time and the average number of customers in the system. The average queue length can be represented as:

$$
L_q = L - \lambda W
$$

where $L$ is the average number of customers in the system and $W$ is the average waiting time.

#### Utilization

The utilization, denoted as $\rho$, is a measure of the system's efficiency. It represents the proportion of time the server is busy serving customers. The utilization can be calculated using the average arrival rate of customers and the average service rate of the server. The utilization can be represented as:

$$
\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate of customers and $\mu$ is the average service rate of the server.

#### Little's Law

Little's Law is a fundamental law in queueing theory that relates the average number of customers in the system, the average arrival rate of customers, and the average time a customer spends in the system. It can be used to calculate various performance measures of the system, as mentioned earlier. Little's Law can be represented as:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

where $L$ is the average number of customers in the system, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate of customers, and $W$ is the average time a customer spends in the system.

In the next section, we will discuss how these performance measures can be used to analyze the FIFO queueing system.




#### 6.2a Definition and Analysis of LIFO Queueing System

The Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) queueing system is a type of queueing system where the last customer to arrive is the first to be served. This system is also known as the last-come-first-served (LCFS) system. The LIFO system is commonly used in real-world scenarios, such as in supermarkets, where customers are served in the reverse order of their arrival.

The LIFO system can be modeled using a discrete-time Markov chain, similar to the FIFO system. However, the transition probabilities for the LIFO system are different. The transition probabilities for the LIFO system can be represented as:

$$
p_{i,i+1} = \begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } i < N \\
0, & \text{if } i \geq N
\end{cases}
$$

where $N$ is the maximum number of customers that can be in the system. This means that a customer can only move from state $i$ to state $i+1$ if there is space in the system for the customer. If the system is full, no customer can enter the system, and the system remains in state $N$.

The LIFO system has some interesting properties that make it different from the FIFO system. For example, the LIFO system is always stable, meaning that the system will eventually reach a steady state. This is because the LIFO system ensures that the oldest customer is always served first, preventing the system from becoming unbounded.

However, the LIFO system can also be unfair to customers who arrive early. This is because the LIFO system does not guarantee that customers will be served in the order of their arrival. This can lead to long waiting times for early arrivals, which can be a disadvantage in systems where customers have different priorities.

In the next section, we will discuss the performance measures for the LIFO system and how they compare to the performance measures for the FIFO system.

#### 6.2b Performance Measures in LIFO Queueing System

The performance of a queueing system can be evaluated using various performance measures. These measures provide insights into the system's efficiency, effectiveness, and customer satisfaction. In this section, we will discuss some of the key performance measures for the LIFO queueing system.

##### Average Number of Customers in the System

The average number of customers in the system, denoted as $L$, is a measure of the system's utilization. It represents the average number of customers in the system, including those being served and those waiting in the queue. The average number of customers in the system can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate of customers multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

where $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate of customers and $W$ is the average time a customer spends in the system.

##### Average Waiting Time

The average waiting time, denoted as $W$, is a measure of the system's delay. It represents the average amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue. The average waiting time can be calculated using Little's Law, as mentioned earlier. It can also be calculated directly from the steady-state probabilities of the system. The average waiting time can be represented as:

$$
W = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} (i-1)p_i}{\lambda}
$$

where $p_i$ is the steady-state probability of the system being in state $i$.

##### Average Queue Length

The average queue length, denoted as $L_q$, is a measure of the system's queue congestion. It represents the average number of customers waiting in the queue. The average queue length can be calculated using the average waiting time and the average number of customers in the system. The average queue length can be represented as:

$$
L_q = L - \lambda W
$$

##### Fairness Index

The fairness index is a measure of the fairness of the queueing system. It represents the average waiting time of customers relative to the average waiting time of the first customer to arrive. The fairness index can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
F = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} (i-1)p_i}{\lambda}
$$

where $p_i$ is the steady-state probability of the system being in state $i$. A fairness index of 1 indicates perfect fairness, where all customers have the same waiting time. A fairness index greater than 1 indicates that some customers have a longer waiting time than others.

##### Throughput

The throughput, denoted as $X$, is a measure of the system's capacity. It represents the average number of customers that can be served per unit time. The throughput can be calculated using Little's Law, as mentioned earlier. It can also be calculated directly from the steady-state probabilities of the system. The throughput can be represented as:

$$
X = \lambda(1-p_N)
$$

where $p_N$ is the steady-state probability of the system being in state $N$, which represents the maximum number of customers in the system.

In the next section, we will discuss how these performance measures compare for the LIFO and FIFO queueing systems.

#### 6.2c LIFO Queueing System in Real World Scenarios

The Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) queueing system is a fundamental concept in queueing theory. It is a type of first-come-first-served (FCFS) system, where the last customer to arrive is the first to be served. This system is commonly used in real-world scenarios, such as in supermarkets, call centers, and computer networks.

##### Supermarkets

In supermarkets, the LIFO system is often used for checkout queues. This is because it ensures that customers who have been waiting in the queue for a long time are served first, reducing their waiting time. However, this system can also lead to long waiting times for new arrivals, especially during peak hours. This can be mitigated by having multiple checkout queues and using a round-robin system to serve customers from different queues.

##### Call Centers

In call centers, the LIFO system is used to manage incoming calls. This is because it ensures that customers who have been waiting for a long time are served first, reducing their waiting time. However, this system can also lead to long waiting times for new arrivals, especially during peak hours. This can be mitigated by having multiple call queues and using a round-robin system to serve customers from different queues.

##### Computer Networks

In computer networks, the LIFO system is used to manage packet queues. This is because it ensures that packets that have been waiting for a long time are served first, reducing their delay. However, this system can also lead to long delays for new arrivals, especially during peak hours. This can be mitigated by using a combination of LIFO and FIFO systems, where packets are served using a LIFO system until the queue is empty, and then served using a FIFO system until the queue is full.

In conclusion, the LIFO queueing system is a powerful tool for managing queues in various real-world scenarios. However, it is important to consider its potential drawbacks and use it in conjunction with other queueing systems to achieve optimal performance.




#### 6.2b Performance Measures in LIFO Queueing System

The performance of a queueing system can be evaluated using various performance measures. These measures provide a quantitative way to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the system. In this section, we will discuss the performance measures for the LIFO queueing system.

##### Average Waiting Time

The average waiting time is a measure of the time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. It is a key performance indicator for queueing systems. In the LIFO system, the average waiting time can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average waiting time. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

where $L$ is the average number of customers in the system, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate, and $W$ is the average waiting time.

##### Average Response Time

The average response time is the total time a customer spends in the system, including both the waiting time and the service time. It is a measure of the overall efficiency of the system. In the LIFO system, the average response time can be calculated using the formula:

$$
R = W + S
$$

where $R$ is the average response time, $W$ is the average waiting time, and $S$ is the average service time.

##### Throughput

The throughput is the average number of customers that can be served per unit time. It is a measure of the system's capacity. In the LIFO system, the throughput can be calculated using the formula:

$$
X = \lambda(1-P_0)
$$

where $X$ is the throughput, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate, and $P_0$ is the probability that there are no customers in the system.

##### Utilization

The utilization is the proportion of time that the system is busy serving customers. It is a measure of the system's utilization. In the LIFO system, the utilization can be calculated using the formula:

$$
U = \frac{\lambda}{M}P_0
$$

where $U$ is the utilization, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate, $M$ is the number of servers, and $P_0$ is the probability that there are no customers in the system.

##### Little's Law

Little's Law is a fundamental law in queueing theory that relates the average number of customers in the system, the average arrival rate, and the average waiting time. In the LIFO system, Little's Law can be used to calculate the average waiting time, as discussed earlier.

##### PASTA Property

The PASTA (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages) property is a key assumption in queueing theory that simplifies the analysis of queueing systems. In the LIFO system, the PASTA property can be used to simplify the calculation of performance measures, as discussed in the next section.

#### 6.2c LIFO Queueing System in Real World Scenarios

The LIFO queueing system is a fundamental concept in queueing theory and has been widely applied in various real-world scenarios. In this section, we will discuss some of these applications and how the performance measures discussed in the previous section can be used to evaluate the system's performance.

##### Supermarkets

One of the most common applications of the LIFO queueing system is in supermarkets. Customers enter the supermarket and join a queue to be served. The LIFO system ensures that customers are served in the reverse order of their arrival, which is often more efficient than the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) system. This is because the LIFO system allows the supermarket to prioritize customers who have been waiting for a longer time, reducing the average waiting time and improving customer satisfaction.

The performance measures discussed earlier can be used to evaluate the system's performance. For example, the average waiting time can be used to assess the system's efficiency. If the average waiting time is high, it may be necessary to increase the number of checkout counters or improve the checkout process to reduce the average waiting time.

##### Computer Systems

The LIFO queueing system is also used in computer systems, particularly in operating systems. For example, the Distributed Operating System (DOS) uses a variant of the LIFO system to manage memory allocation. In this system, memory is allocated to processes in the reverse order of their arrival, ensuring that processes that have been waiting for a longer time are allocated memory first.

The performance measures discussed earlier can be used to evaluate the system's performance. For example, the throughput can be used to assess the system's capacity. If the throughput is low, it may be necessary to increase the system's memory capacity or improve the memory allocation algorithm to increase the throughput.

##### Telecommunication Networks

In telecommunication networks, the LIFO queueing system is used to manage the allocation of network resources. For example, in a cellular network, the LIFO system can be used to allocate network resources to users in the reverse order of their arrival. This ensures that users who have been waiting for a longer time are allocated resources first, improving the network's fairness and efficiency.

The performance measures discussed earlier can be used to evaluate the system's performance. For example, the utilization can be used to assess the system's efficiency. If the utilization is high, it may be necessary to increase the network's capacity or improve the resource allocation algorithm to reduce the utilization.

In conclusion, the LIFO queueing system is a versatile concept that has been widely applied in various real-world scenarios. The performance measures discussed in this chapter provide a quantitative way to assess the system's performance, helping to optimize the system's efficiency and effectiveness.




#### 6.3a Definition and Analysis of Priority Queueing System

A priority queueing system is a type of queueing system where customers are served based on their priority level. Customers with higher priority levels are served before customers with lower priority levels. This system is often used in situations where certain customers require immediate attention or where there are limited resources available.

The priority queueing system can be modeled using the concept of virtual time, as discussed in the previous section. In this system, the virtual time is used to represent the priority level of each customer. Customers with higher virtual time values are served before customers with lower virtual time values.

The performance of a priority queueing system can be analyzed using the same performance measures discussed in the previous section. However, the interpretation of these measures may differ in a priority system. For example, the average waiting time may not be as important as the average response time, as customers with high priority levels may not spend much time waiting in the queue.

The priority queueing system can also be extended to handle multiple queues, each with its own priority level. This can be modeled using the concept of virtual time, where each queue has its own virtual time scale. Customers from different queues are served based on their priority level within their own queue, and the queues are served based on their priority level across all queues.

In the next section, we will discuss the performance measures for the priority queueing system in more detail.

#### 6.3b Performance Measures in Priority Queueing System

The performance of a priority queueing system can be evaluated using various performance measures. These measures provide a quantitative way to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the system. In this section, we will discuss the performance measures for the priority queueing system.

##### Average Waiting Time

The average waiting time is a measure of the time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. It is a key performance indicator for queueing systems. In the priority queueing system, the average waiting time can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average waiting time. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

where $L$ is the average number of customers in the system, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate, and $W$ is the average waiting time.

However, in a priority queueing system, the average waiting time may not be as important as the average response time, as customers with high priority levels may not spend much time waiting in the queue.

##### Average Response Time

The average response time is the total time a customer spends in the system, including both the waiting time and the service time. It is a measure of the overall efficiency of the system. In the priority queueing system, the average response time can be calculated using the formula:

$$
R = W + S
$$

where $R$ is the average response time, $W$ is the average waiting time, and $S$ is the average service time.

##### Throughput

The throughput is the average number of customers that can be served per unit time. It is a measure of the system's capacity. In the priority queueing system, the throughput can be calculated using the formula:

$$
X = \lambda(1-P_0)
$$

where $X$ is the throughput, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate, and $P_0$ is the probability that there are no customers in the system.

##### Utilization

The utilization is the proportion of time that the system is busy serving customers. It is a measure of the system's utilization. In the priority queueing system, the utilization can be calculated using the formula:

$$
U = \frac{\lambda}{C}
$$

where $U$ is the utilization, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate, and $C$ is the average service rate.

In the next section, we will discuss the performance measures for the priority queueing system in more detail.

This ensures that critical data is delivered without delay, while non-critical data can be queued and delivered when resources are available.

##### Computer Systems

In computer systems, the priority queueing system is used to manage the execution of tasks. Tasks with high priority, such as system maintenance tasks, are given preferential access to system resources. This ensures that critical tasks are completed promptly, while less urgent tasks can be queued and executed when resources are available.

##### Healthcare Systems

In healthcare systems, the priority queueing system is used to manage patient flow. Patients with urgent medical needs are given preferential access to healthcare resources, while patients with less urgent needs are queued and served when resources are available. This helps to ensure that patients with critical medical needs are treated promptly, while non-critical patients are not unduly delayed.

##### Transportation Systems

In transportation systems, the priority queueing system is used to manage the flow of vehicles. Vehicles with high priority, such as emergency vehicles, are given preferential access to roadways. This helps to ensure that emergency vehicles can reach their destinations quickly, while non-emergency vehicles are queued and allowed to travel when roadways are available.

In conclusion, the priority queueing system is a powerful tool for managing resources efficiently in a wide range of applications. Its ability to prioritize customers based on their needs and urgency makes it a valuable tool in many fields.

## Chapter: Chapter 7: Systems with Overtaking: Approximations

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of queueing theory, delving into the intricacies of queueing systems without overtaking. However, in real-world scenarios, overtaking is a common occurrence, and it is essential to understand how it affects the performance of queueing systems. This chapter, "Systems with Overtaking: Approximations," aims to bridge this gap by introducing the concept of overtaking and its implications in queueing theory.

Overtaking, in the context of queueing theory, refers to the ability of a customer to overtake another customer in the queue. This can occur when customers have different service requirements or when there are multiple servers available. The presence of overtaking adds a layer of complexity to queueing systems, making their analysis more challenging.

In this chapter, we will explore various approximations that can be used to analyze queueing systems with overtaking. These approximations are necessary because exact solutions for such systems are often difficult to obtain due to their complexity. We will discuss the assumptions behind these approximations and their implications on the performance of queueing systems.

We will also delve into the concept of overtaking probability, which is a key factor in determining the performance of queueing systems with overtaking. We will explore how this probability can be calculated and its implications on the overall performance of the system.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of how overtaking affects queueing systems and how various approximations can be used to analyze these systems. This knowledge will be invaluable in understanding and optimizing real-world queueing systems.




#### 6.3b Performance Measures in Priority Queueing System

The performance of a priority queueing system can be evaluated using various performance measures. These measures provide a quantitative way to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the system. In this section, we will discuss the performance measures for the priority queueing system.

##### Average Waiting Time

The average waiting time is a measure of the time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. In a priority queueing system, this measure is particularly important as it can indicate the fairness of the system. Customers with high priority levels should ideally have a shorter average waiting time than customers with lower priority levels. The average waiting time can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the arrival rate.

##### Average Response Time

The average response time is a measure of the total time a customer spends in the system, including both the waiting time and the service time. This measure is particularly important in systems where customers have different service requirements. The average response time can be calculated using the Little's Law formula, where the arrival rate is replaced by the arrival rate multiplied by the service time.

##### Average Queue Length

The average queue length is a measure of the number of customers waiting in the queue. This measure can be used to assess the congestion in the system. A high average queue length may indicate that the system is overloaded or that there are too many customers with high priority levels. The average queue length can be calculated using Little's Law, where the arrival rate is replaced by the arrival rate multiplied by the average waiting time.

##### Utilization

The utilization is a measure of the proportion of time that the system is busy serving customers. This measure can be used to assess the efficiency of the system. A high utilization indicates that the system is busy serving customers, while a low utilization indicates that the system has spare capacity. The utilization can be calculated using the Little's Law formula, where the arrival rate is replaced by the arrival rate multiplied by the average response time.

##### Priority Fairness

The priority fairness is a measure of the fairness of the system in serving customers with different priority levels. This measure can be used to assess the effectiveness of the system in meeting the needs of different customer groups. The priority fairness can be calculated using the Little's Law formula, where the arrival rate is replaced by the arrival rate multiplied by the average response time for each priority level.

In the next section, we will discuss how these performance measures can be used to analyze the priority queueing system.

#### 6.3c Applications of Priority Queueing System

The priority queueing system has a wide range of applications in various fields. Its ability to handle different priority levels makes it a versatile tool for managing complex systems. In this section, we will discuss some of the key applications of the priority queueing system.

##### Computer Systems

In computer systems, the priority queueing system is used to manage the execution of tasks. Each task is assigned a priority level, and the system executes tasks with higher priority levels first. This ensures that critical tasks are completed promptly, while less important tasks are handled later. The priority queueing system is also used in multitasking operating systems to manage the execution of multiple tasks simultaneously.

##### Telecommunication Networks

In telecommunication networks, the priority queueing system is used to manage the flow of data packets. Each packet is assigned a priority level, and the system transmits packets with higher priority levels first. This ensures that critical data packets, such as voice or video data, are transmitted without delay, while less important data packets are transmitted later.

##### Manufacturing Systems

In manufacturing systems, the priority queueing system is used to manage the flow of jobs through different stages of production. Each job is assigned a priority level, and the system processes jobs with higher priority levels first. This ensures that critical jobs are completed promptly, while less important jobs are handled later.

##### Healthcare Systems

In healthcare systems, the priority queueing system is used to manage patient flow. Each patient is assigned a priority level based on the urgency of their condition. The system then processes patients with higher priority levels first, ensuring that critical patients are treated promptly, while less urgent patients are handled later.

##### Traffic Management

In traffic management, the priority queueing system is used to manage the flow of vehicles through intersections. Each vehicle is assigned a priority level based on its type (e.g., emergency vehicles, public transportation, private vehicles). The system then gives priority to vehicles with higher priority levels, ensuring that emergency vehicles can pass through intersections without delay, while other vehicles are handled later.

In conclusion, the priority queueing system is a powerful tool for managing complex systems. Its ability to handle different priority levels makes it a versatile solution for a wide range of applications.

## Chapter: Chapter 7: Systems with Overtaking: Approximations

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of queueing theory, delving into the intricacies of queueing systems without overtaking. However, in real-world scenarios, overtaking is a common occurrence in queueing systems. This chapter, "Systems with Overtaking: Approximations," aims to bridge this gap by introducing the concept of overtaking in queueing systems and discussing various approximation methods to analyze these systems.

Overtaking, in queueing theory, refers to the ability of a queueing system to allow queues to overtake each other. This can occur when queues merge, or when a queue with a higher priority is allowed to overtake a queue with a lower priority. The presence of overtaking adds a layer of complexity to the analysis of queueing systems, as it can significantly impact the system's performance.

To handle this complexity, we will introduce various approximation methods. These methods are mathematical tools that allow us to approximate the behavior of queueing systems with overtaking, making them more manageable to analyze. These approximations are often based on certain assumptions about the system, which we will discuss in detail.

Throughout this chapter, we will use mathematical notation to express these concepts. For instance, we might denote the arrival rate of customers to a queueing system as $\lambda$, and the service rate as $\mu$. We will also use the concept of a random variable, denoted as $X$, to represent the time between events in the system.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of queueing systems with overtaking and be equipped with the necessary tools to analyze these systems using approximation methods. This knowledge will be invaluable in tackling more complex queueing systems in the subsequent chapters.




#### 6.4a Definition and Analysis of Round Robin Queueing System

The Round Robin Queueing System is a type of queueing system where customers are served in a cyclic manner, with each customer being served for a fixed amount of time before the next customer is served. This system is often used in situations where there are multiple customers with similar priority levels, and it ensures that each customer is served in a fair and equitable manner.

##### Definition of Round Robin Queueing System

In a Round Robin Queueing System, customers are served in a cyclic manner, with each customer being served for a fixed amount of time before the next customer is served. This fixed amount of time is known as the quantum. Once a customer's quantum expires, the next customer in the queue is served, and the process continues in this manner.

The Round Robin Queueing System can be represented mathematically as follows:

Let $N$ be the number of customers in the system, $Q$ be the quantum, and $T$ be the total service time for all customers. The average waiting time for each customer in the system can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the arrival rate. In the case of the Round Robin Queueing System, the arrival rate is equal to the number of customers served per quantum, which is $N/Q$. Therefore, the average waiting time can be calculated as:

$$
W = \frac{T}{N/Q} = QT
$$

##### Analysis of Round Robin Queueing System

The Round Robin Queueing System is a fair and efficient system for serving multiple customers with similar priority levels. However, it does have some limitations. For example, if the quantum is too small, customers may have to wait a long time before their quantum expires and they can be served. On the other hand, if the quantum is too large, customers with longer service times may be unfairly served before customers with shorter service times. Therefore, the choice of quantum size is crucial in the design of a Round Robin Queueing System.

Another important aspect to consider is the impact of the Round Robin Queueing System on the overall system performance. The Round Robin Queueing System can be analyzed using the concept of fair queuing, which aims to emulate the fairness of bitwise round-robin sharing of link resources among competing flows. This can be achieved by modeling the finish time for each packet as if they could be transmitted bitwise round-robin. The packet with the earliest finish time according to this modeling is the next selected for transmission. This approach reduces the computational load of the algorithm by introducing the concept of "virtual time", which allows for the efficient selection of packets for transmission.

In conclusion, the Round Robin Queueing System is a simple and fair system for serving multiple customers with similar priority levels. However, its performance can be further optimized by considering the impact of the quantum size and the concept of fair queuing.

#### 6.4b Performance Measures in Round Robin Queueing System

The performance of a Round Robin Queueing System can be evaluated using various performance measures. These measures provide a quantitative way to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the system. In this section, we will discuss the performance measures for the Round Robin Queueing System.

##### Average Waiting Time

The average waiting time is a measure of the time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. In a Round Robin Queueing System, this measure is particularly important as it can indicate the fairness of the system. The average waiting time can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the arrival rate. In the case of the Round Robin Queueing System, the arrival rate is equal to the number of customers served per quantum, which is $N/Q$. Therefore, the average waiting time can be calculated as:

$$
W = \frac{T}{N/Q} = QT
$$

where $T$ is the total service time for all customers.

##### Average Response Time

The average response time is a measure of the total time a customer spends in the system, including both the waiting time and the service time. This measure is particularly important in systems where customers have different service requirements. The average response time can be calculated using the Little's Law formula, where the arrival rate is replaced by the arrival rate multiplied by the service time. In the case of the Round Robin Queueing System, the service time for each customer is equal to the quantum, $Q$. Therefore, the average response time can be calculated as:

$$
R = \frac{T}{N/Q} = QT
$$

##### Average Queue Length

The average queue length is a measure of the number of customers waiting in the queue. This measure can be used to assess the congestion in the system. The average queue length can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average queue length is equal to the arrival rate multiplied by the average waiting time. In the case of the Round Robin Queueing System, the arrival rate is equal to the number of customers served per quantum, which is $N/Q$. Therefore, the average queue length can be calculated as:

$$
L = \frac{N/Q}{QT} = \frac{N}{Q^2T}
$$

##### Utilization

The utilization is a measure of the proportion of time that the system is busy serving customers. This measure can be used to assess the efficiency of the system. The utilization can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the utilization is equal to the arrival rate multiplied by the average waiting time. In the case of the Round Robin Queueing System, the arrival rate is equal to the number of customers served per quantum, which is $N/Q$. Therefore, the utilization can be calculated as:

$$
U = \frac{N/Q}{QT} = \frac{N}{Q^2T}
$$

##### Fairness Index

The fairness index is a measure of the fairness of the system. It is defined as the ratio of the maximum waiting time to the minimum waiting time. In a perfectly fair system, the fairness index would be 1. However, in a Round Robin Queueing System, the fairness index can be calculated as:

$$
F = \frac{\max(W)}{\min(W)}
$$

where $\max(W)$ and $\min(W)$ are the maximum and minimum waiting times, respectively.

#### 6.4c Case Studies in Round Robin Queueing System

In this section, we will explore some case studies that illustrate the application of the Round Robin Queueing System in real-world scenarios. These case studies will provide a deeper understanding of the system's performance and its implications in different contexts.

##### Case Study 1: Traffic Control

The Round Robin Queueing System is often used in traffic control systems to manage the flow of vehicles at intersections. In this context, the quantum is typically set to a small value, such as 100 milliseconds, to ensure that each vehicle is served in a timely manner. The performance measures discussed in the previous section can be used to evaluate the system's efficiency and fairness.

For example, the average waiting time can be used to assess the delay experienced by vehicles at the intersection. A high average waiting time may indicate that the intersection is congested and that traffic flow needs to be optimized. Similarly, the average response time can be used to assess the total time a vehicle spends at the intersection, including both the waiting time and the service time.

The average queue length can be used to assess the congestion at the intersection. A high average queue length may indicate that the intersection is overloaded and that additional capacity needs to be added. Finally, the utilization can be used to assess the efficiency of the system. A high utilization may indicate that the system is operating at its maximum capacity and that additional capacity needs to be added.

##### Case Study 2: Computer Networks

The Round Robin Queueing System is also used in computer networks to manage the flow of packets between nodes. In this context, the quantum is typically set to a small value, such as 1 millisecond, to ensure that each packet is served in a timely manner. The performance measures discussed in the previous section can be used to evaluate the system's efficiency and fairness.

For example, the average waiting time can be used to assess the delay experienced by packets in the network. A high average waiting time may indicate that the network is congested and that packet flow needs to be optimized. Similarly, the average response time can be used to assess the total time a packet spends in the network, including both the waiting time and the service time.

The average queue length can be used to assess the congestion in the network. A high average queue length may indicate that the network is overloaded and that additional capacity needs to be added. Finally, the utilization can be used to assess the efficiency of the system. A high utilization may indicate that the system is operating at its maximum capacity and that additional capacity needs to be added.




#### 6.4b Performance Measures in Round Robin Queueing System

The performance of a Round Robin Queueing System can be evaluated using various performance measures. These measures provide insights into the system's efficiency, fairness, and overall performance. In this section, we will discuss some of the key performance measures for the Round Robin Queueing System.

##### Average Waiting Time

As discussed in the previous section, the average waiting time for each customer in the system can be calculated using Little's Law. This measure is particularly important as it provides an indication of the system's efficiency. A lower average waiting time suggests that customers are being served more quickly, which can be beneficial in applications where customers have limited patience or where the system is serving a large number of customers.

##### Fairness Index

The Fairness Index is a measure of the fairness of the system. It is defined as the ratio of the maximum waiting time to the minimum waiting time. A Fairness Index of 1 indicates perfect fairness, where all customers have the same waiting time. A higher Fairness Index suggests that some customers are waiting longer than others, which may be indicative of unfairness in the system.

##### Throughput

The Throughput is a measure of the system's capacity. It is defined as the number of customers served per unit time. A higher throughput suggests that the system can handle a larger number of customers, which can be beneficial in applications where the system is serving a large number of customers.

##### Response Time

The Response Time is a measure of the time taken for a customer to be served. It is defined as the sum of the waiting time and the service time. A lower response time suggests that customers are being served more quickly, which can be beneficial in applications where customers have limited patience.

##### Little's Law

Little's Law can also be used as a performance measure. It states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the arrival rate multiplied by the average waiting time. This measure can be used to check the consistency of the system's performance measures. If the calculated average number of customers in the system does not match the actual number of customers in the system, it may indicate an error in the calculation of the performance measures.

In the next section, we will discuss how these performance measures can be used to analyze the Round Robin Queueing System.

#### 6.4c Applications of Round Robin Queueing System

##### Computer Networks

In computer networks, the Round Robin Queueing System is often used to allocate bandwidth among multiple users. Each user is assigned a quantum of bandwidth, and the system cycles through the users in a round-robin manner. This ensures that each user is given a fair share of the bandwidth, which can be particularly important in applications where multiple users are sharing a limited resource.

##### Operating Systems

In operating systems, the Round Robin Queueing System is used to schedule processes. Each process is given a quantum of CPU time, and the system cycles through the processes in a round-robin manner. This ensures that each process is given a fair share of the CPU time, which can be particularly important in applications where multiple processes are running simultaneously.

##### Telecommunication Networks

In telecommunication networks, the Round Robin Queueing System is used to allocate time slots among multiple users. Each user is assigned a quantum of time slots, and the system cycles through the users in a round-robin manner.

##### Manufacturing Systems

In manufacturing systems, the Round Robin Queueing System is used to allocate resources among multiple jobs. Each job is assigned a quantum of resources, and the system cycles through the jobs in a round-robin manner. This ensures that each job is given a fair share of the resources, which can be particularly important in applications where multiple jobs are competing for limited resources.

In conclusion, the Round Robin Queueing System is a versatile and powerful tool for managing resources in a fair and efficient manner. Its applications are vast and varied, making it a fundamental concept in the study of queueing theory.

## Chapter 7: Systems with Overtaking:




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the world of queueing theory, specifically focusing on systems with no overtaking and their asymptotic solutions. Queueing theory is a mathematical model used to study the behavior of systems where customers arrive, wait in a queue, and are eventually served. It has a wide range of applications in various fields such as telecommunication networks, computer systems, and manufacturing systems.

We will begin by introducing the concept of systems with no overtaking, also known as single-server systems. In these systems, customers cannot overtake each other in the queue, and the service time for each customer is assumed to be exponentially distributed.

### Subsection: 7.1a Definition and Analysis of Long-Run Average Queue Length

In queueing theory, the long-run average queue length is a fundamental concept that describes the average number of customers in the queue over a long period of time. It is a crucial metric for evaluating the performance of a queueing system, as it provides insight into the system's stability and efficiency.

#### Definition of Long-Run Average Queue Length

The long-run average queue length, denoted as $L$, is defined as the average number of customers in the queue over a long period of time. It is typically calculated as the ratio of the long-run average queue length to the long-run average arrival rate, denoted as $\lambda$. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
L = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}
$$

where $\mu$ is the long-run average service rate.

The long-run average queue length is a key parameter in queueing theory, as it provides a measure of the system's congestion. A higher long-run average queue length indicates a more congested system, while a lower long-run average queue length indicates a less congested system.

#### Analysis of Long-Run Average Queue Length

The long-run average queue length can be analyzed using various techniques, such as Little's Law and the Erlang's loss formula. Little's Law states that the long-run average queue length is equal to the product of the long-run average arrival rate and the average time a customer spends in the system. The Erlang's loss formula, on the other hand, provides an expression for the long-run average queue length in terms of the system's arrival rate, service rate, and utilization.

In addition to these analytical techniques, the long-run average queue length can also be estimated using simulation methods. By simulating the queueing system over a long period of time, we can obtain an estimate of the long-run average queue length. This approach can be particularly useful when the system is complex and analytical solutions are not available.

#### Applications of Long-Run Average Queue Length

The long-run average queue length has numerous applications in queueing theory. It is used to evaluate the performance of queueing systems, to design and optimize queueing systems, and to analyze the impact of changes in the system's parameters on its performance.

In the context of systems with no overtaking, the long-run average queue length is particularly important. As mentioned in the previous chapter, these systems are characterized by the absence of overtaking, which simplifies the analysis of the system's performance. The long-run average queue length, in conjunction with Little's Law and the Erlang's loss formula, provides a powerful tool for understanding and optimizing these systems.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of the long-run average queue length and explore its implications for systems with no overtaking. We will also discuss some advanced applications of this concept, such as its use in the analysis of heavy-tailed traffic and its impact on network performance.




#### 7.1b Estimating Long-Run Average Queue Length in Queueing Systems

In the previous section, we discussed the definition and analysis of the long-run average queue length. In this section, we will explore how to estimate this parameter in queueing systems.

##### Estimation Techniques

There are several techniques available for estimating the long-run average queue length in queueing systems. These include the use of Little's Law, the Erlang's loss formula, and simulation methods.

Little's Law provides a simple relationship between the long-run average queue length, arrival rate, and service rate. It states that the long-run average queue length is equal to the product of the long-run average arrival rate and the average time a customer spends in the system. This law can be used to estimate the long-run average queue length if the arrival rate and service rate are known.

The Erlang's loss formula is another useful tool for estimating the long-run average queue length. It provides an expression for the long-run average queue length in terms of the system's arrival rate, service rate, and utilization. This formula can be used to estimate the long-run average queue length if the arrival rate, service rate, and utilization are known.

Simulation methods involve running a simulation of the queueing system over a long period of time and observing the average queue length. This approach can be particularly useful when the system is complex and the arrival rate, service rate, and utilization are not known.

##### Estimation Challenges

While these estimation techniques can provide valuable insights into the long-run average queue length, they also come with certain challenges. For instance, Little's Law assumes that the arrival rate and service rate are constant, which may not always be the case in real-world systems. Similarly, the Erlang's loss formula assumes that the system is stable, which may not always be the case.

Moreover, simulation methods can be computationally intensive and may not always provide accurate results due to the inherent variability in queueing systems. Therefore, it is important to use these estimation techniques with caution and to validate their results with real-world data whenever possible.

In the next section, we will explore how to use these estimation techniques to analyze the long-run average queue length in queueing systems.

#### 7.1c Applications of Long-Run Average Queue Length

The long-run average queue length is a fundamental concept in queueing theory with wide-ranging applications. It provides a measure of the system's congestion and stability, and can be used to evaluate the performance of a queueing system. In this section, we will explore some of the key applications of the long-run average queue length.

##### Performance Evaluation

The long-run average queue length is a key metric for evaluating the performance of a queueing system. It provides a measure of the system's congestion, with a higher long-run average queue length indicating a more congested system. This can be useful for identifying potential bottlenecks and areas for improvement in the system.

Moreover, the long-run average queue length can be used to assess the stability of the system. A long-run average queue length that is significantly higher than the arrival rate may indicate that the system is unstable and at risk of queue overflow.

##### Resource Allocation

The long-run average queue length can also be used for resource allocation in queueing systems. By estimating the long-run average queue length, system administrators can make informed decisions about how to allocate resources such as processing power and memory.

For instance, if a particular service facility is contributing significantly to the long-run average queue length, it may be beneficial to allocate more resources to this facility. Conversely, if a service facility is not contributing significantly to the long-run average queue length, it may be beneficial to allocate fewer resources to this facility.

##### Queue Discipline

The long-run average queue length can also be used to evaluate different queue disciplines. A queue discipline is a set of rules for determining the order in which customers are served. Different queue disciplines can have a significant impact on the long-run average queue length, and by evaluating the long-run average queue length under different queue disciplines, system administrators can make informed decisions about which queue discipline to use.

##### System Design

Finally, the long-run average queue length can be used for system design. By estimating the long-run average queue length, system designers can make informed decisions about the number of service facilities to include in the system, the service time for each service facility, and the probability of a customer proceeding to each service facility after completing service at a particular service facility.

In conclusion, the long-run average queue length is a fundamental concept in queueing theory with wide-ranging applications. It provides a measure of the system's congestion and stability, and can be used to evaluate the performance of a queueing system, allocate resources, evaluate queue disciplines, and design systems.




#### 7.2a Definition and Analysis of Long-Run Average Waiting Time

The long-run average waiting time is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that describes the average amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue. It is a key performance metric for queueing systems, as it provides insights into the system's efficiency and customer satisfaction.

##### Definition of Long-Run Average Waiting Time

The long-run average waiting time, denoted as $W$, is defined as the average amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue. It is calculated as the ratio of the long-run average queue length, $L$, and the long-run average arrival rate, $\lambda$. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
W = \frac{L}{\lambda}
$$

##### Analysis of Long-Run Average Waiting Time

The long-run average waiting time can be analyzed using various techniques, including Little's Law, the Erlang's loss formula, and simulation methods.

Little's Law provides a simple relationship between the long-run average waiting time, arrival rate, and service rate. It states that the long-run average waiting time is equal to the product of the long-run average arrival rate and the average time a customer spends in the system. This law can be used to analyze the long-run average waiting time if the arrival rate and service rate are known.

The Erlang's loss formula provides an expression for the long-run average waiting time in terms of the system's arrival rate, service rate, and utilization. This formula can be used to analyze the long-run average waiting time if the arrival rate, service rate, and utilization are known.

Simulation methods involve running a simulation of the queueing system over a long period of time and observing the average waiting time. This approach can be particularly useful when the system is complex and the arrival rate, service rate, and utilization are not known.

##### Challenges in Estimating Long-Run Average Waiting Time

While these analysis techniques can provide valuable insights into the long-run average waiting time, they also come with certain challenges. For instance, Little's Law assumes that the arrival rate and service rate are constant, which may not always be the case in real-world systems. Similarly, the Erlang's loss formula assumes that the system is stable, which may not always be the case.

Moreover, simulation methods can be computationally intensive and may not always provide accurate results due to the inherent variability in real-world systems. Therefore, it is important to use a combination of these techniques to accurately estimate the long-run average waiting time in queueing systems.

#### 7.2b Estimating Long-Run Average Waiting Time in Queueing Systems

Estimating the long-run average waiting time in queueing systems is a crucial aspect of queueing theory. It allows us to understand the system's performance and make necessary adjustments to improve customer satisfaction. In this section, we will discuss various techniques for estimating the long-run average waiting time.

#### 7.2c Case Studies of Long-Run Average Waiting Time in Queueing Systems

In this section, we will explore some real-world case studies that illustrate the application of the concepts discussed in the previous sections. These case studies will provide a deeper understanding of the long-run average waiting time in queueing systems and how it can be estimated using various techniques.

##### Case Study 1: Telecommunication Network

Consider a telecommunication network where customers arrive at a service center to resolve their queries. The service center has a single queue and two servers. The arrival rate is 10 customers per hour, and each customer spends an average of 5 minutes in the system. The service time follows an exponential distribution with a mean of 2 minutes.

Using Little's Law, we can estimate the long-run average waiting time as follows:

$$
W = \frac{\lambda}{\mu - \lambda}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the arrival rate and $\mu$ is the service rate. Substituting the given values, we get:

$$
W = \frac{10}{2 - 10} = 50 \text{ minutes}
$$

This means that on average, a customer spends 50 minutes waiting in the queue before being served.

##### Case Study 2: Banking System

Consider a banking system with a single queue and two tellers. Customers arrive at a rate of 20 customers per hour, and each customer spends an average of 3 minutes in the system. The service time follows an exponential distribution with a mean of 1.5 minutes.

Using the Erlang's loss formula, we can estimate the long-run average waiting time as follows:

$$
W = \frac{\lambda}{\mu - \lambda} \frac{1}{1 - \frac{\lambda}{\mu}}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the arrival rate and $\mu$ is the service rate. Substituting the given values, we get:

$$
W = \frac{20}{1.5 - 20} \frac{1}{1 - \frac{20}{1.5}} = 100 \text{ minutes}
$$

This means that on average, a customer spends 100 minutes waiting in the queue before being served.

##### Case Study 3: Hospital Emergency Room

Consider a hospital emergency room with a single queue and three doctors. Patients arrive at a rate of 50 patients per hour, and each patient spends an average of 10 minutes in the system. The service time follows an exponential distribution with a mean of 5 minutes.

Using simulation methods, we can estimate the long-run average waiting time by running a simulation of the emergency room over a long period of time and observing the average waiting time. After running the simulation, we find that the average waiting time is 20 minutes.

These case studies illustrate the application of the concepts discussed in the previous sections. They also highlight the challenges in estimating the long-run average waiting time in queueing systems. In the next section, we will discuss how to address these challenges and improve the accuracy of the estimates.

##### Erlang's Loss Formula

The Erlang's loss formula provides an expression for the long-run average waiting time in terms of the system's arrival rate, service rate, and utilization. This formula can be used to estimate the long-run average waiting time if the arrival rate, service rate, and utilization are known.

##### Simulation Methods

Simulation methods involve running a simulation of the queueing system over a long period of time and observing the average waiting time. This approach can be particularly useful when the system is complex and the arrival rate, service rate, and utilization are not known.

##### Approximation Methods

In addition to the above methods, there are also various approximation methods for estimating the long-run average waiting time. These methods are particularly useful when the system is complex and the arrival rate, service rate, and utilization are not known. Some of these methods include the Buzen algorithm, the T-Rex algorithm, and the KS algorithm.

The Buzen algorithm is an approximation method for estimating the long-run average waiting time in queueing systems. It is based on the assumption that the arrival rate and service rate are constant over time. The algorithm provides an upper bound on the long-run average waiting time, which can be used to estimate the actual waiting time.

The T-Rex algorithm is another approximation method for estimating the long-run average waiting time. It is based on the assumption that the arrival rate and service rate are not constant over time, but vary according to a certain pattern. The algorithm provides a more accurate estimate of the long-run average waiting time compared to the Buzen algorithm.

The KS algorithm is a more recent approximation method for estimating the long-run average waiting time. It is based on the assumption that the arrival rate and service rate are not constant over time, but vary according to a certain distribution. The algorithm provides a more accurate estimate of the long-run average waiting time compared to the Buzen and T-Rex algorithms.

In conclusion, estimating the long-run average waiting time in queueing systems is a crucial aspect of queueing theory. It allows us to understand the system's performance and make necessary adjustments to improve it. Various methods, including Little's Law, Erlang's Loss Formula, simulation methods, and approximation methods, can be used for this purpose.

## Chapter: Chapter 8: Systems with Overtaking: Asymptotic Solutions

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored various aspects of queueing theory, from its fundamental principles to its advanced applications. We have delved into the intricacies of queueing systems, understanding how they operate, how they can be modeled, and how they can be optimized. However, all the systems we have studied so far have been of the type where overtaking is not allowed. In this chapter, we will break away from this tradition and explore systems with overtaking.

Overtaking, in the context of queueing theory, refers to the ability of a customer to overtake another customer in the queue. This is a common phenomenon in many real-world systems, such as traffic flow, telecommunication networks, and computer systems. Allowing overtaking can significantly alter the behavior of a queueing system, and understanding how to model and analyze these systems is crucial for many applications.

In this chapter, we will focus on the asymptotic solutions of queueing systems with overtaking. Asymptotic solutions are approximations that are valid when the system is operating at high utilization levels. They are particularly useful in systems where the arrival rate of customers is high and the service time is relatively short. We will explore how these solutions can be derived and how they can be used to analyze the performance of queueing systems with overtaking.

We will begin by introducing the concept of overtaking and discussing its implications for queueing systems. We will then delve into the derivation of asymptotic solutions for systems with overtaking, using techniques such as the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers. We will also discuss the limitations of these solutions and the conditions under which they are valid.

Finally, we will explore some applications of queueing systems with overtaking, demonstrating how these systems can be used to model and analyze real-world phenomena. We will also discuss some of the challenges and open issues in this area, providing a roadmap for future research.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to queueing systems with overtaking and their asymptotic solutions.

## Chapter 8: Systems with Overtaking:




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the world of priority and polling systems in queueing theory. These systems are essential in managing queues and ensuring efficient service delivery. We will explore the fundamentals of these systems, their applications, and how they can be used to optimize queueing systems.

Priority systems are a type of queueing system where certain customers are given priority over others. This can be based on various factors such as urgency, importance, or customer type. Priority systems are commonly used in emergency services, healthcare, and customer service industries.

Polling systems, on the other hand, are a type of queueing system where customers are served in a predetermined order. This can be useful in situations where there are multiple servers and each server is responsible for a specific set of customers. Polling systems are commonly used in call centers, manufacturing, and transportation industries.

We will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these systems, as well as their impact on queueing systems. By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of priority and polling systems and how they can be used to improve queueing systems. So let's dive in and explore the world of priority and polling systems in queueing theory.




### Section: 8.1 Priority Queues:

Priority queues are an essential tool in queueing theory, allowing for the efficient management of queues by giving certain customers priority over others. In this section, we will explore the definition and analysis of priority queues, including their operations and applications.

#### 8.1a Definition and Analysis of Priority Queues

A priority queue is an abstract data type that is similar to a regular queue or stack data structure. Each element in a priority queue has an associated "priority." In a priority queue, elements with high priority are served before elements with low priority. This allows for the efficient management of queues, as certain customers can be given priority based on factors such as urgency, importance, or customer type.

In addition to the basic operations of enqueue and dequeue, priority queues must also support the following operations:

- Peek: This operation returns the highest-priority element in the queue without modifying the queue. It is often implemented with a time complexity of O(1).
- Clear: This operation clears the entire queue.
- Inspect: This operation allows for the inspection of the first few highest- or lowest-priority elements in the queue.
- Merge: This operation merges two or more queues into one.
- Increment priority: This operation increments the priority of any element in the queue.

These advanced operations are crucial for the efficient management of queues and can greatly improve the performance of queueing systems.

Priority queues have a wide range of applications in various industries, including emergency services, healthcare, and customer service. In emergency services, priority queues are used to ensure that critical patients are treated first, while in healthcare, they are used to manage patient flow and ensure that urgent cases are seen first. In customer service, priority queues are used to give priority to VIP customers or those with urgent needs.

The performance of priority queues can be analyzed using queueing theory, which allows for the calculation of important metrics such as average queue length, average waiting time, and average number of customers in the system. These metrics can help in optimizing queueing systems and improving overall efficiency.

In conclusion, priority queues are a crucial tool in queueing theory, allowing for the efficient management of queues by giving certain customers priority over others. By understanding their operations and applications, we can effectively utilize priority queues to optimize queueing systems and improve overall performance.





### Subsection: 8.1b Performance Evaluation of Priority Queues

In order to fully understand the performance of priority queues, we must first define the metrics by which we will evaluate them. These metrics include the average number of elements in the queue, the average waiting time for an element, and the average number of element comparisons.

The average number of elements in the queue, denoted by $L$, is a measure of the queue's size. It is defined as the average number of elements in the queue over a given time period. This metric is important as it helps us understand the queue's capacity and how many elements can be processed at a given time.

The average waiting time for an element, denoted by $W$, is a measure of the time an element spends in the queue before being served. It is defined as the average waiting time for an element over a given time period. This metric is important as it helps us understand the queue's efficiency and how quickly elements can be processed.

The average number of element comparisons, denoted by $C$, is a measure of the number of comparisons made between elements in the queue. It is defined as the average number of comparisons made over a given time period. This metric is important as it helps us understand the queue's complexity and how much processing power is required to maintain the queue.

Using these metrics, we can evaluate the performance of priority queues and compare them to other queueing systems. By understanding the trade-offs between these metrics, we can determine the most efficient and effective queueing system for a given application.

In addition to these metrics, we can also analyze the performance of priority queues using mathematical models. These models can help us understand the behavior of the queue and make predictions about its performance in the future. By using mathematical models, we can gain a deeper understanding of the queue's behavior and make informed decisions about its design and implementation.

In conclusion, the performance evaluation of priority queues is crucial for understanding their effectiveness and efficiency. By using metrics and mathematical models, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the queue's behavior and make informed decisions about its design and implementation. 





### Subsection: 8.2a Definition and Analysis of Preemptive Scheduling in Queueing Systems

Preemptive scheduling is a type of scheduling algorithm used in queueing systems where the scheduler has the ability to interrupt a running process and switch to a higher priority process. This allows for more efficient use of resources and can improve the overall performance of the system.

In preemptive scheduling, the scheduler determines the priority of each process and assigns a time slice to each process based on its priority. The time slice is the amount of time the process is allowed to run before being interrupted. The scheduler then switches to the next highest priority process and repeats this process until all processes have been executed.

The performance of preemptive scheduling can be analyzed using mathematical models, similar to priority queues. However, in preemptive scheduling, the metrics used to evaluate the system may differ. These metrics may include the average number of context switches, the average waiting time for a process, and the average number of time slices allocated to each process.

The average number of context switches, denoted by $C_s$, is a measure of the number of times the scheduler switches between processes. It is defined as the average number of context switches over a given time period. This metric is important as it helps us understand the overhead of the scheduler and the impact of context switches on the system's performance.

The average waiting time for a process, denoted by $W_p$, is a measure of the time a process spends waiting in the ready queue before being executed. It is defined as the average waiting time for a process over a given time period. This metric is important as it helps us understand the efficiency of the scheduler and the impact of waiting on the system's performance.

The average number of time slices allocated to each process, denoted by $T_s$, is a measure of the amount of time each process is allowed to run before being interrupted. It is defined as the average number of time slices allocated to each process over a given time period. This metric is important as it helps us understand the fairness of the scheduler and the impact of time slices on the system's performance.

By analyzing these metrics, we can gain a better understanding of the performance of preemptive scheduling and make improvements to the system if necessary. Additionally, we can also compare preemptive scheduling to other scheduling algorithms, such as non-preemptive scheduling, to determine the most efficient and effective scheduling algorithm for a given system.





### Subsection: 8.2b Impact of Preemptive Scheduling on System Performance

Preemptive scheduling has a significant impact on the performance of queueing systems. By allowing the scheduler to interrupt a running process and switch to a higher priority process, preemptive scheduling can improve the overall efficiency of the system.

One of the main benefits of preemptive scheduling is its ability to reduce the average waiting time for a process. By assigning a time slice to each process based on its priority, the scheduler can ensure that high priority processes are given more time to execute, reducing their waiting time in the ready queue. This can lead to a decrease in the average waiting time for all processes, improving the overall performance of the system.

Preemptive scheduling also helps to reduce the average number of context switches. By assigning a time slice to each process, the scheduler can determine when to switch to the next highest priority process, reducing the number of unnecessary context switches. This can help to reduce the overhead of the scheduler and improve the overall efficiency of the system.

However, preemptive scheduling also has some drawbacks. The overhead of context switches can still be significant, especially in systems with a large number of processes. Additionally, the scheduler must constantly monitor and make decisions about which process to execute next, which can be a complex and time-consuming task.

In conclusion, preemptive scheduling has a significant impact on the performance of queueing systems. By reducing the average waiting time for processes and the number of context switches, preemptive scheduling can improve the overall efficiency of the system. However, it is important to carefully consider the trade-offs and potential drawbacks when implementing preemptive scheduling in a queueing system.





### Subsection: 8.3a Definition and Analysis of Non-preemptive Scheduling in Queueing Systems

Non-preemptive scheduling is a type of scheduling policy used in queueing systems where the scheduler cannot interrupt a running process and switch to a higher priority process. In this section, we will define and analyze non-preemptive scheduling in queueing systems.

#### Definition of Non-preemptive Scheduling

Non-preemptive scheduling is a type of scheduling policy where the scheduler cannot interrupt a running process and switch to a higher priority process. This means that once a process is assigned to a resource, it must finish its execution before another process can be assigned to the same resource. This is in contrast to preemptive scheduling, where the scheduler can interrupt a running process and switch to a higher priority process.

Non-preemptive scheduling is commonly used in systems where the scheduler has limited control over the resources, such as in real-time systems. In these systems, the scheduler must ensure that critical tasks are given enough time to execute, while also minimizing the overall waiting time for all tasks.

#### Analysis of Non-preemptive Scheduling

Non-preemptive scheduling can be analyzed using queueing theory, which is a mathematical framework for modeling and analyzing queueing systems. In queueing theory, the system is modeled as a series of queues, where each queue represents a resource and each process represents a job in the queue.

One of the key metrics used to evaluate non-preemptive scheduling is the average waiting time for a process. In non-preemptive scheduling, the average waiting time can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the arrival rate of processes.

Another important metric is the average response time, which is the total time a process spends in the system, including both waiting time and execution time. In non-preemptive scheduling, the average response time can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Average response time} = \text{Average waiting time} + \text{Average execution time}
$$

Non-preemptive scheduling can also be analyzed using the concept of fairness, which refers to the ability of the scheduler to allocate resources fairly among different processes. In non-preemptive scheduling, fairness can be achieved by assigning a fixed amount of time to each process, ensuring that all processes are given equal opportunities to execute.

In conclusion, non-preemptive scheduling is a type of scheduling policy used in queueing systems where the scheduler cannot interrupt a running process and switch to a higher priority process. It can be analyzed using queueing theory and is commonly used in systems where the scheduler has limited control over the resources. 





### Subsection: 8.3b Evaluating the Effectiveness of Non-preemptive Scheduling

Non-preemptive scheduling is a crucial aspect of queueing theory, and it is essential to evaluate its effectiveness in different scenarios. In this section, we will discuss some of the key factors that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of non-preemptive scheduling.

#### Average Waiting Time

As mentioned in the previous section, the average waiting time is a crucial metric for evaluating the effectiveness of non-preemptive scheduling. It is defined as the average amount of time a process spends waiting in the queue before it is assigned to a resource. In non-preemptive scheduling, the average waiting time can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the arrival rate of processes. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$
W = \frac{L}{\lambda}
$$

where $W$ is the average waiting time, $L$ is the average queue length, and $\lambda$ is the arrival rate of processes.

#### Average Response Time

Another important metric for evaluating the effectiveness of non-preemptive scheduling is the average response time. It is defined as the total amount of time a process spends in the system, including both waiting time and execution time. In non-preemptive scheduling, the average response time can be calculated using the Little's Law, as mentioned earlier. However, it is important to note that the average response time can also be calculated using the following equation:

$$
R = W + S
$$

where $R$ is the average response time, $W$ is the average waiting time, and $S$ is the average service time.

#### Fairness

Fairness is another crucial aspect to consider when evaluating the effectiveness of non-preemptive scheduling. It refers to the ability of the scheduler to allocate resources fairly among all processes. In non-preemptive scheduling, fairness can be evaluated by looking at the variation in waiting times among different processes. A scheduler that can minimize this variation is considered fair.

#### Scalability

Scalability refers to the ability of a scheduler to handle an increasing number of processes without a significant decrease in performance. In non-preemptive scheduling, scalability can be evaluated by looking at the impact of adding more processes to the system on the average waiting time and response time. A scheduler that can handle an increasing number of processes without a significant increase in waiting times is considered scalable.

#### Robustness

Robustness refers to the ability of a scheduler to handle unexpected events or changes in the system without a significant decrease in performance. In non-preemptive scheduling, robustness can be evaluated by looking at the impact of unexpected events, such as process failures or changes in arrival rates, on the average waiting time and response time. A scheduler that can handle these unexpected events without a significant increase in waiting times is considered robust.

In conclusion, evaluating the effectiveness of non-preemptive scheduling involves considering various factors, including average waiting time, average response time, fairness, scalability, and robustness. By understanding these factors and how they interact with each other, we can design and analyze non-preemptive scheduling algorithms that are efficient, fair, and robust.





### Subsection: 8.4a Definition and Analysis of Polling Systems

Polling systems are a type of scheduling system where a central device or process queries each element in a fixed sequence and allocates resources to the next element in the sequence. This continues until the first element is reached, at which time the polling cycle starts all over again. Polling systems have been used to model various real-world scenarios, such as Token Ring networks and multitasking operating systems.

#### Types of Polling Systems

There are two main types of polling systems: roll call polling and hub polling. In roll call polling, the polling device or process queries each element on a list in a fixed sequence. This type of polling is efficient when there are only a few active elements, but it can be inefficient if the overhead for the polling messages is high or there are numerous elements to be polled in each polling cycle.

On the other hand, hub polling, also referred to as token polling, is more efficient when there are multiple active elements. In this type of polling, each element polls the next element in some fixed sequence. This continues until the first element is reached, at which time the polling cycle starts all over again. Hub polling is commonly used in networks to determine which nodes want to access the network.

#### Analyzing Polling Systems

To analyze the effectiveness of polling systems, we can use the concept of Little's Law, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the arrival rate of processes. In polling systems, the arrival rate of processes can be calculated as the number of elements in the polling sequence divided by the polling cycle time. This can be represented as:

$$
\lambda = \frac{N}{T}
$$

where $N$ is the number of elements in the polling sequence and $T$ is the polling cycle time.

The average waiting time can then be calculated using Little's Law, as mentioned earlier. Additionally, the average response time can also be calculated using the following equation:

$$
R = W + S
$$

where $R$ is the average response time, $W$ is the average waiting time, and $S$ is the average service time. The average service time can be calculated as the sum of the service times for each element in the polling sequence divided by the number of elements.

In conclusion, polling systems are a type of scheduling system that can be used to allocate resources efficiently among multiple elements. By understanding the types of polling systems and using Little's Law to analyze their effectiveness, we can optimize their performance in various real-world scenarios.





### Subsection: 8.4b Performance Evaluation of Polling Systems

In order to fully understand the effectiveness of polling systems, it is important to evaluate their performance. This involves analyzing the average waiting time, queue length, and resource allocation in the system.

#### Average Waiting Time

The average waiting time in a polling system can be calculated using Little's Law, as mentioned in the previous section. This law states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the arrival rate of processes. In the context of polling systems, the arrival rate of processes can be calculated as the number of elements in the polling sequence divided by the polling cycle time. This can be represented as:

$$
\lambda = \frac{N}{T}
$$

where $N$ is the number of elements in the polling sequence and $T$ is the polling cycle time.

#### Average Queue Length

The average queue length in a polling system can be calculated using the Erlang-C formula, which is based on Little's Law. This formula states that the average queue length is equal to the arrival rate of processes multiplied by the average waiting time. This can be represented as:

$$
L = \lambda \cdot W
$$

where $L$ is the average queue length, $\lambda$ is the arrival rate of processes, and $W$ is the average waiting time.

#### Resource Allocation

In polling systems, it is important to consider the resource allocation for each element. This involves determining the amount of time that each element is allocated for resource usage. In roll call polling, each element is allocated a fixed amount of time for resource usage, while in hub polling, each element is allocated a variable amount of time based on its position in the polling sequence.

#### Performance Metrics

In addition to the average waiting time and queue length, there are other performance metrics that can be used to evaluate the performance of polling systems. These include the average resource allocation time, the average number of elements in the polling sequence, and the average polling cycle time. These metrics can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the system's performance and can be used to make improvements and optimizations.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, the performance evaluation of polling systems is crucial in understanding their effectiveness and identifying areas for improvement. By analyzing the average waiting time, queue length, and resource allocation, as well as using other performance metrics, we can gain a better understanding of the system and make necessary adjustments to optimize its performance. 


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the fundamentals of priority and polling systems in queueing theory. We have learned that priority systems allow for certain customers to be served before others, while polling systems allocate resources to customers in a fixed order. We have also discussed the advantages and disadvantages of these systems, as well as their applications in various real-world scenarios.

Priority systems are particularly useful in situations where certain customers require immediate attention, such as in emergency services or critical care units. By giving these customers priority, we can ensure that their needs are met in a timely manner. However, this can also lead to longer wait times for other customers, which may not be acceptable in certain situations.

On the other hand, polling systems are more suitable for scenarios where resources need to be allocated to a fixed number of customers in a specific order. This can be seen in systems such as call centers or computer networks, where resources need to be allocated to different customers in a fair and efficient manner. However, polling systems can also lead to longer wait times for customers if the allocated resources are not enough to meet their needs.

Overall, both priority and polling systems have their own advantages and disadvantages, and it is important to carefully consider the specific needs and constraints of a system before implementing either one. By understanding the fundamentals of these systems, we can make informed decisions and optimize their performance in various real-world applications.

## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of queueing theory, including the basic concepts, models, and applications. We have also discussed the different types of queues, such as single-server queues, multiple-server queues, and finite-capacity queues. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of queueing theory and explore the concept of multiple-server queues with multiple-class customers.

Multiple-server queues are systems where there are multiple servers available to serve customers. This type of queueing system is commonly found in many real-world scenarios, such as call centers, supermarkets, and transportation systems. In these systems, customers can be served by multiple servers simultaneously, reducing the waiting time and improving the overall efficiency of the system.

In addition to multiple servers, we will also consider multiple-class customers in this chapter. This means that customers can be classified into different categories based on their characteristics, such as priority, urgency, or type of service required. By considering multiple classes of customers, we can better understand the behavior of the queueing system and make more informed decisions.

Throughout this chapter, we will cover various topics related to multiple-server queues with multiple-class customers. We will start by discussing the basic concepts and models, such as the M/M/c queue and the M/G/c queue. We will then move on to more advanced topics, such as the impact of multiple classes on queueing systems, the use of multiple-server queues in real-world applications, and the optimization of queueing systems with multiple classes.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of multiple-server queues with multiple-class customers and be able to apply this knowledge to real-world scenarios. This chapter will serve as a foundation for further exploration of advanced queueing theory topics in the following chapters. So let's dive in and explore the world of multiple-server queues with multiple-class customers.


## Chapter 9: Multiple-Server Queues with Multiple-Class Customers:




### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the concepts of priority and polling systems in queueing theory. We have seen how these systems can be used to manage queues and prioritize certain customers or tasks over others. We have also discussed the different types of priority systems, including preemptive and non-preemptive systems, and how they can be applied in various scenarios. Additionally, we have examined the polling systems and how they can be used to allocate resources among multiple queues.

Priority and polling systems are essential tools in queueing theory, as they allow for more efficient and fair management of queues. By giving certain customers or tasks priority, we can ensure that they are served quickly and efficiently, while also ensuring that other customers or tasks are not neglected. Similarly, by using polling systems, we can allocate resources among multiple queues in a fair and efficient manner.

As we conclude this chapter, it is important to note that priority and polling systems are just two of the many advanced applications of queueing theory.

Consider a preemptive priority system with two queues, one for regular customers and one for VIP customers. The VIP customers have priority over regular customers, and the system can be preempted if a VIP customer arrives while a regular customer is being served. If a VIP customer is being served and a regular customer arrives, the VIP customer is immediately interrupted and moved to the end of the VIP queue. The regular customer is then served until completion.

We have also discussed how queueing theory can be applied to various real-world scenarios, such as traffic flow and call centers. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the world of queueing theory and explore more advanced applications.

One of the key topics covered in this chapter is the concept of multiple-server queues. In real-world scenarios, it is common to have multiple servers or service providers available to handle incoming requests. This can be seen in call centers, where there are multiple agents available to answer calls, or in traffic flow, where there are multiple lanes for vehicles to travel on. We will explore how queueing theory can be used to model and analyze these systems, taking into account the interactions between multiple servers.

Another important aspect of queueing theory is the consideration of different types of queues. In this chapter, we will discuss how queueing theory can be applied to different types of queues, such as single-server queues, multiple-server queues, and networks of queues. We will also explore how these different types of queues can be combined to create more complex systems.

Furthermore, we will also touch upon the concept of queueing networks, which are systems that consist of multiple interconnected queues. These networks can be used to model and analyze real-world systems, such as telecommunication networks and computer systems. We will discuss how queueing theory can be used to analyze the performance of these networks and identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a deeper understanding of queueing theory and its applications.

This will not only enhance our understanding of queueing theory but also provide practical insights into how it can be applied in various industries.

Priority and polling systems are essential tools in queueing theory, as they allow for more efficient and fair management of queues. By giving certain customers or tasks priority, we can ensure that they are served quickly and efficiently, while also ensuring that other customers or tasks are not neglected. Similarly, by using polling systems, we can allocate resources among multiple queues in a fair and efficient manner.

As we conclude this chapter, it is important to note that priority and polling systems are just two of the many advanced applications of queueing theory. There are many other complex systems and scenarios that can be modeled and analyzed using queueing theory, and it is up to us to continue exploring and understanding these concepts.

### Exercises

#### Exercise 1
Consider a preemptive priority system with two queues, one for regular customers and one for VIP customers. The VIP customers have priority over regular customers, and the system can be preempted if a VIP customer arrives while a regular customer is being served. If a VIP customer is being served and a regular customer arrives, the VIP customer is immediately interrupted and moved to the end of the VIP queue. The regular customer is then served until completion. If a regular customer is being served and a VIP customer arrives, the regular customer is immediately interrupted and moved to the end of the regular queue. The VIP customer is then served until completion. The service time for both types of customers follows an exponential distribution with mean 5 minutes. The arrival rate for regular customers is 10 customers per hour, while the arrival rate for VIP customers is 5 customers per hour. Determine the average waiting time for both types of customers.

#### Exercise 2
Consider a polling system with three queues, each served by a single server. The polling sequence is 1-2-3, meaning that the first server serves the first queue, then the second server serves the second queue, and finally the third server serves the third queue. This cycle repeats indefinitely. The service time for each queue follows an exponential distribution with mean 3 minutes. The arrival rate for each queue is 10 customers per hour. Determine the average waiting time for each queue.

#### Exercise 3
Consider a non-preemptive priority system with two queues, one for regular customers and one for VIP customers. The VIP customers have priority over regular customers, and the system cannot be preempted. The service time for both types of customers follows an exponential distribution with mean 5 minutes. The arrival rate for regular customers is 10 customers per hour, while the arrival rate for VIP customers is 5 customers per hour. Determine the average waiting time for both types of customers.

#### Exercise 4
Consider a polling system with four queues, each served by a single server. The polling sequence is 1-2-3-4, meaning that the first server serves the first queue, then the second server serves the second queue, and so on. This cycle repeats indefinitely. The service time for each queue follows an exponential distribution with mean 4 minutes. The arrival rate for each queue is 15 customers per hour. Determine the average waiting time for each queue.

#### Exercise 5
Consider a preemptive priority system with three queues, each served by a single server. The queues are served in the order of their arrival, with the highest priority given to the queue with the longest waiting time. The service time for each queue follows an exponential distribution with mean 6 minutes. The arrival rate for each queue is 12 customers per hour. Determine the average waiting time for each queue.


## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the basics of queueing theory, including the fundamental concepts and models. We have also discussed how queueing theory can be applied to various real-world scenarios, such as traffic flow and call centers. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the world of queueing theory and explore more advanced applications.

One of the key topics covered in this chapter is the concept of multiple-server queues. In real-world scenarios, it is common to have multiple servers or service providers available to handle incoming requests. This can be seen in call centers, where there are multiple agents available to answer calls, or in traffic flow, where there are multiple lanes for vehicles to travel on. We will explore how queueing theory can be used to model and analyze these systems, taking into account the interactions between multiple servers.

Another important aspect of queueing theory is the consideration of different types of queues. In this chapter, we will discuss how queueing theory can be applied to different types of queues, such as single-server queues, multiple-server queues, and networks of queues. We will also explore how these different types of queues can be combined to create more complex systems.

Furthermore, we will also touch upon the concept of queueing networks, which are systems that consist of multiple interconnected queues. These networks can be used to model and analyze real-world systems, such as telecommunication networks and computer systems. We will discuss how queueing theory can be used to analyze the performance of these networks and identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a deeper understanding of queueing theory and its applications. By exploring more advanced concepts and systems, we can gain a better understanding of how queueing theory can be used to model and analyze real-world scenarios. This will not only enhance our understanding of queueing theory but also provide practical insights into how it can be applied in various industries. 


## Chapter 9: Multiple-Server Queues, Queueing Networks:




### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of queueing theory, including single-server queues and multi-server queues. We have learned about the basic concepts, such as arrival rate, service rate, and queue length, and how they are used to model and analyze queueing systems. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the world of multi-server queues and explore the concept of multiserver queues.

Multiserver queues are a type of queueing system where there are multiple servers available to serve the arriving customers. This type of queueing system is commonly found in many real-world scenarios, such as call centers, supermarkets, and transportation systems. In these systems, having multiple servers can greatly improve the efficiency and reduce the waiting time for customers.

In this chapter, we will cover the various aspects of multiserver queues, including the different types of multiserver queues, their characteristics, and how to model and analyze them using queueing theory. We will also explore the advanced applications of multiserver queues, such as load balancing and resource allocation, and how they can be used to optimize queueing systems.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of multiserver queues and their applications, and be able to apply this knowledge to real-world scenarios. So let's dive into the world of multiserver queues and discover the power of queueing theory in optimizing queueing systems.




### Subsection: 9.1a Definition and Analysis of M/M/s Queueing System

The M/M/s queueing system is a type of multiserver queueing system that is commonly used to model and analyze queueing systems in various real-world scenarios. It is a special case of the M/G/s queueing system, where the service time distribution follows a general distribution. In the M/M/s queueing system, both the arrival and service processes are memoryless, meaning that the future behavior of the system is independent of its past behavior.

The M/M/s queueing system is characterized by three key parameters: the arrival rate, the service rate, and the number of servers. The arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, is the average number of customers arriving at the system per unit time. The service rate, denoted by $\mu$, is the average number of customers that can be served by each server per unit time. The number of servers, denoted by $s$, is the number of servers available to serve the arriving customers.

The M/M/s queueing system is a special case of the M/G/s queueing system, where the service time distribution follows a general distribution. In the M/M/s queueing system, both the arrival and service processes are memoryless, meaning that the future behavior of the system is independent of its past behavior. This makes the M/M/s queueing system a popular choice for modeling and analyzing queueing systems in various real-world scenarios.

The M/M/s queueing system is a stable system, meaning that the queue length and the waiting time for customers are finite. This is because the arrival rate and the service rate are both finite, and the number of servers is greater than or equal to the number of customers in the system. This ensures that the queue length and the waiting time for customers do not grow without bound.

The stationary distribution of the M/M/s queueing system is given by the probability mass function $\pi_k$, where $\pi_k$ is the probability that the system contains $k$ customers. The probability that an arriving customer is forced to join the queue (all servers are occupied) is given by Erlang's C formula, denoted by C($s$, $\lambda/\mu$). The average number of customers in the system (in service and in queue) is given by $\frac{\rho}{1-\rho} \text{ C}(s,\lambda/\mu) + c \rho$, where $\rho = \frac{\lambda}{s\mu}$.

The busy period of the M/M/s queueing system is the amount of time that a server is busy serving customers. It can refer to the time between two consecutive idle periods or the time between two consecutive busy periods. The busy period can be calculated using the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the distribution of the busy period, denoted by $\eta_k(s)$. The average busy period is given by $\frac{1}{\mu(s-\rho)}$.

The response time of the M/M/s queueing system is the total amount of time a customer spends in both the queue and in service. It is given by the sum of the waiting time in the queue and the service time. The average response time is the same for all work-conserving service disciplines and is given by $\frac{\text{ C}(s,\lambda/\mu)}{s \mu - \lambda} + \frac{1}{\mu}$.

In the next section, we will explore the customers in the first-come, first-served discipline and the processor sharing discipline in more detail. We will also discuss the response time for these disciplines and how it differs from the average response time of the M/M/s queueing system.

### Subsection: 9.1b Performance Measures in M/M/s Queueing System

The M/M/s queueing system is a fundamental concept in queueing theory, and understanding its performance measures is crucial for analyzing and optimizing queueing systems. In this section, we will discuss the key performance measures of the M/M/s queueing system, including the average queue length, the average waiting time, and the average number of customers in the system.

#### Average Queue Length

The average queue length, denoted by $L$, is a measure of the average number of customers waiting in the queue. It is a crucial performance measure as it directly impacts the customer experience and the overall efficiency of the system. The average queue length can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average queue length is equal to the average waiting time multiplied by the average arrival rate. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

where $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate and $W$ is the average waiting time.

#### Average Waiting Time

The average waiting time, denoted by $W$, is a measure of the average time a customer spends waiting in the queue. It is a key performance measure as it directly impacts the customer experience and the overall efficiency of the system. The average waiting time can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the average arrival rate. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
W = \frac{L}{\lambda}
$$

where $L$ is the average queue length and $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate.

#### Average Number of Customers in the System

The average number of customers in the system, denoted by $L_s$, is a measure of the average number of customers in the system, including those being served and those waiting in the queue. It is a crucial performance measure as it directly impacts the system's capacity and the overall efficiency of the system. The average number of customers in the system can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
L_s = \lambda W_s
$$

where $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate and $W_s$ is the average time a customer spends in the system.

In the next section, we will discuss how these performance measures can be used to analyze and optimize queueing systems.




#### 9.2a Definition and Analysis of M/G/s Queueing System

The M/G/s queueing system is a type of queueing system where customers arrive according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$, there are $s$ servers, and the service time distribution follows a general distribution $G$. This system is a generalization of the M/M/s queueing system, where the service time distribution is exponential. The M/G/s queueing system is a fundamental concept in queueing theory, and understanding its performance measures is crucial for analyzing and optimizing queueing systems.

#### Performance Measures in M/G/s Queueing System

The performance measures of the M/G/s queueing system are similar to those of the M/M/s queueing system, with some additional complexity due to the general service time distribution. The average queue length, the average waiting time, and the average number of customers in the system are all important performance measures. However, in the M/G/s queueing system, these measures are typically calculated using more complex methods than in the M/M/s queueing system.

The average queue length, denoted by $L$, can be calculated using Little's Law, as in the M/M/s queueing system. However, the average waiting time, denoted by $W$, and the average number of customers in the system, denoted by $L_s$, are typically calculated using more complex methods due to the general service time distribution.

#### Busy Period of Server

The busy period of a server in the M/G/s queueing system is the time interval during which the server is busy serving customers. It is a crucial performance measure as it directly impacts the system's capacity and the overall efficiency of the system. The busy period of a server can be calculated using the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula, which is given by:

$$
T_k = \frac{\mu_G^k}{\lambda} E_k
$$

where $T_k$ is the busy period of a server when there are $k$ customers in the system, $\mu_G$ is the mean service rate of the service time distribution $G$, $\lambda$ is the arrival rate, and $E_k$ is the Erlang's C formula, which is given by:

$$
E_k = \frac{(\lambda/\mu_G)^k)}{k!} \sum_{i=0}^{k} \frac{\mu_G^i}{(i!)^2}
$$

#### Response Time

The response time is the total amount of time a customer spends in both the queue and in service. It is a key performance measure as it directly impacts the customer experience and the overall efficiency of the system. The response time can be calculated using the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula, which is given by:

$$
R = \frac{\mu_G}{\lambda} E_1
$$

where $R$ is the response time, $\mu_G$ is the mean service rate of the service time distribution $G$, and $E_1$ is the Erlang's C formula with $k=1$.

#### Customers in First-Come, First-Served Discipline

In the first-come, first-served (FCFS) discipline, customers are served in the order of their arrival. The customer either experiences an immediate exponential service, or must wait for $k$ customers to be served before their own service, thus experiencing an Erlang distribution with shape parameter $k$ + 1. The average waiting time and the average response time in the FCFS discipline can be calculated using the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula, as discussed above.

#### Customers in Processor Sharing Discipline

In the processor sharing (PS) discipline, the service capacity of the queue is split equally between the jobs in the queue. The average waiting time and the average response time in the PS discipline can be calculated using the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula, as discussed above. However, the busy period of a server in the PS discipline is typically calculated using a more complex method, due to the sharing of service capacity between multiple customers.

In the shortest processing time first (SPTF) discipline, customers are served in the order of their shortest remaining service time. The average waiting time and the average response time in the SPTF discipline can be calculated using the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula, as discussed above. However, the busy period of a server in the SPTF discipline is typically calculated using a more complex method, due to the non-Poisson arrival process in this discipline.

#### Customers in Shortest Processing Time to Completion Discipline

In the shortest processing time to completion (SPTC) discipline, customers are served in the order of their shortest remaining service time plus the remaining service time of the customers already in service.

The byte-weighted fair queuing algorithm, for example, uses the M/G/s queueing system to emulate the fairness of bitwise round-robin sharing of link resources among competing flows. This algorithm selects the transmission order for packets by modeling the finish time for each packet as if they could be transmitted bitwise round-robin. The packet with the earliest finish time according to this modeling is the next selected for transmission.

The complexity of the algorithm is "O(log(n))", where "n" is the number of queues/flows. To reduce computational load, the concept of "virtual time" is introduced. Finish time for each packet is computed on this alternate monotonically increasing virtual timescale. While virtual time does not accurately model the time packets complete their transmissions, it does accurately model the order in which the transmissions must occur to meet the objectives of the full-featured model.

##### Telecommunication Networks

#### 9.3a Definition and Analysis of G/M/s Queueing System

The G/M/s queueing system is a type of multiserver queueing system that is commonly used in the analysis of communication networks, computer systems, and manufacturing systems. It is a generalization of the M/M/s queueing system, which assumes that the service time distribution follows an exponential distribution. In the G/M/s queueing system, the service time distribution can be any general distribution, making it a more realistic model for many real-world systems.

The G/M/s queueing system is characterized by three key parameters: the arrival rate $\lambda$, the service rate $\mu_G$, and the service time distribution $G$. The arrival rate $\lambda$ is the average number of customers arriving at the system per unit time. The service rate $\mu_G$ is the average number of customers that can be served per unit time, and it is determined by the service time distribution $G$.

##### Utilization

The utilization, denoted by $\rho$, is a measure of the system's efficiency. It is defined as the ratio of the average arrival rate to the average service rate. If the utilization is high, it indicates that the system is busy serving customers and the queue is likely to be long. If the utilization is low, it indicates that the system has spare capacity and the queue is likely to be short.

##### Little's Law

Little's Law is a fundamental law in queueing theory that relates the average queue length, the average waiting time, and the average arrival rate. It states that the average queue length is equal to the average waiting time multiplied by the average arrival rate. This law can be used to calculate any of these three measures if the other two are known.

##### Erlang-C Formula

The Erlang-C formula is used to calculate the probability that the system is full, i.e., there are no servers available to serve new arrivals. It is given by:

$$
P_f = \frac{\lambda^c}{c!} \frac{1}{\mu_G^c} \frac{1}{G(t_f)} \sum_{k=0}^{c-1} \frac{1}{k!} \frac{1}{\mu_G^k} \frac{G(t_f)}{G(t_f+k)}
$$

where $P_f$ is the probability of system fullness, $c$ is the number of servers, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate, $\mu_G$ is the mean service rate of the service time distribution, $G(t_f)$ is the service time distribution at time $t_f$, and $k$ is the number of customers in service.

#### 9.3c G/M/s Queueing System in Network Traffic

The G/M/s queueing system is a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing network traffic. In this section, we will explore how the G/M/s queueing system can be applied to network traffic, focusing on the use of the byte-weighted fair queuing algorithm and the concept of virtual time.

##### Byte-Weighted Fair Queuing Algorithm

The byte-weighted fair queuing algorithm is a type of fair queuing algorithm that attempts to emulate the fairness of bitwise round-robin sharing of link resources among competing flows. This algorithm is particularly useful in packet-based flows, where packets must be transmitted packetwise and in sequence.

The algorithm selects the transmission order for the packets by modeling the finish time for each packet as if they could be transmitted bitwise round robin. The packet with the earliest finish time according to this modeling is the next selected for transmission.

The complexity of the algorithm is "O(log(n))", where "n" is the number of queues/flows. This makes it a scalable solution for managing network traffic.

##### Virtual Time and Virtual Finish Time

To reduce computational load, the concept of "virtual time" is introduced in the G/M/s queueing system. Finish time for each packet is computed on this alternate monotonically increasing virtual timescale. While virtual time does not accurately model the time packets complete their transmissions, it does accurately model the order in which the transmissions must occur to meet the objectives of the full-featured model.

The virtual finish time for a newly queued packet is given by the sum of the virtual start time plus the packet's size. The virtual start time is the maximum between the previous virtual finish time of the same queue and the current instant.

Using virtual time, it is unnecessary to recompute the finish time for previously queued packets. Although the finish time, in absolute terms, for existing packets is potentially affected by new arrivals, finish time on the virtual time line is unchanged - the virtual time line warps with respect to real time to accommodate any new transmission.

The virtual finish time for a newly queued packet is given by the sum of the virtual start time plus the packet's size. The virtual start time is the maximum between the previous virtual finish time of the same queue and the current instant.

With a virtual finishing time of all candidate packets (i.e., the packets at the head of all non-empty flow queues) computed, fair queuing can be implemented by selecting the packet with the earliest virtual finish time for transmission. This ensures that packets are transmitted in a fair manner, giving each packet the opportunity to finish its transmission in a timely manner.

In the next section, we will explore how the G/M/s queueing system can be used to model and analyze network traffic in more detail.

#### 9.4b Performance Measures in G/G/s Queueing System

The performance of the G/G/s queueing system can be evaluated using a variety of performance measures. These measures provide a quantitative assessment of the system's efficiency, effectiveness, and reliability. In this section, we will discuss some of the most commonly used performance measures in the G/G/s queueing system.

##### Average Queue Length

The average queue length, denoted by $L$, is a measure of the average number of customers waiting in the queue. It is a key indicator of the system's efficiency. A high average queue length suggests that the system is not able to handle the incoming traffic, leading to long waiting times for customers.

The average queue length in the G/G/s queueing system can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average queue length is equal to the product of the average waiting time and the arrival rate. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

where $\lambda$ is the arrival rate and $W$ is the average waiting time.

##### Average Waiting Time

The average waiting time, denoted by $W$, is a measure of the average time a customer spends waiting in the queue. It is a key indicator of the system's effectiveness. A high average waiting time suggests that customers are not able to get served quickly, leading to dissatisfaction and potential loss of business.

The average waiting time in the G/G/s queueing system can be calculated using the Erlang-C formula, which is given by:

$$
W = \frac{\frac{1}{\mu} \left( \frac{\rho}{1-\rho} \right)^{\rho}}{\lambda}
$$

where $\mu$ is the service rate, $\rho$ is the utilization, and $\lambda$ is the arrival rate.

##### Average Number of Customers in the System

The average number of customers in the system, denoted by $L_s$, is a measure of the average number of customers in the system, including those being served and those waiting in the queue. It is a key indicator of the system's reliability. A high average number of customers in the system suggests that the system is not able to handle the incoming traffic, leading to potential system failures.

The average number of customers in the system in the G/G/s queueing system can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the product of the average waiting time and the arrival rate. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
L_s = \lambda W
$$

where $\lambda$ is the arrival rate and $W$ is the average waiting time.

##### Utilization

The utilization, denoted by $\rho$, is a measure of the system's utilization. It is the ratio of the average number of customers in the system to the average number of servers. A high utilization suggests that the system is busy, indicating that the system is efficient. However, if the utilization is too high, it can lead to long waiting times and potential system failures.

The utilization in the G/G/s queueing system can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the arrival rate and $\mu$ is the service rate.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the key challenges and open problems in the analysis of the G/G/s queueing system.

#### 9.4c Applications of G/G/s Queueing System

The G/G/s queueing system can then be used to analyze the performance of the network, including the average queue length, waiting time, and system utilization.

##### Manufacturing Systems

In manufacturing systems, the G/G/s queueing system can be used to model the flow of jobs through different stages of production. The arrival process can be modeled as a Poisson process, representing the arrival of jobs. The service time distribution can be modeled using a general distribution, such as a Weibull distribution, to represent the variable service times of different jobs. The G/G/s queueing system can then be used to analyze the performance of the manufacturing system, including the average queue length, waiting time, and system utilization.

##### Healthcare Systems

In this regime, the system is expected to be congested, and the queues are expected to be long. The Halfin-Whitt regime is particularly interesting because it allows us to understand the behavior of queueing systems when they are operating at high utilization levels.

This chapter will provide a comprehensive introduction to the Halfin-Whitt regime, from its fundamental concepts to its advanced applications. We will start by discussing the basic concepts of the Halfin-Whitt regime, including the Halfin-Whitt diffusion model and the Halfin-Whitt diffusion limit. We will then move on to discuss the applications of the Halfin-Whitt regime in various fields, including telecommunications, computer networks, and manufacturing systems. Finally, we will discuss the advanced applications of the Halfin-Whitt regime, including the use of the Halfin-Whitt regime to analyze the performance of queueing systems in the presence of heavy-tailed service time distributions and heavy-tailed arrival processes.




### Subsection: 10.1a Definition and Analysis of Heavy-Traffic Limits

In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of the Halfin-Whitt regime, a regime of heavy traffic where the system is operating at high utilization levels. In this regime, the system is expected to be congested, and the queues are expected to be long. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of heavy-traffic limits, a key concept in the analysis of queues in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

#### 10.1a Definition of Heavy-Traffic Limits

A heavy-traffic limit is a limit in which the system is operating at extremely high utilization levels, where the system is expected to be congested, and the queues are expected to be long. In other words, it is a regime where the system is operating at the verge of breakdown, and small disturbances can lead to significant changes in the system's behavior.

Mathematically, a heavy-traffic limit can be defined as a limit where the system's utilization level $\rho$ approaches 1. This can be expressed as:

$$
\lim_{\rho \to 1} \rho = 1
$$

In this limit, the system's behavior is expected to be dominated by the queues, and the queues are expected to be long and congested. This is in contrast to the light-traffic limit, where the system's utilization level is low, and the queues are expected to be short and sparse.

#### 10.1a Analysis of Heavy-Traffic Limits

The analysis of heavy-traffic limits is a complex task, as it involves studying the behavior of the system when it is operating at extremely high utilization levels. This is a regime where the system is expected to be congested, and the queues are expected to be long and congested.

One of the key tools in the analysis of heavy-traffic limits is the Halfin-Whitt diffusion model. This model provides a mathematical framework for studying the behavior of queues in the Halfin-Whitt regime. It is a stochastic process that describes the evolution of the system's queue length over time.

Another important concept in the analysis of heavy-traffic limits is the Halfin-Whitt diffusion limit. This limit is a mathematical limit in which the system's queue length approaches infinity. It is a concept that is closely related to the concept of heavy-traffic limits, as it is in this limit that the system's behavior is expected to be dominated by the queues.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of heavy-traffic limits in various fields, including telecommunications, computer networks, and manufacturing systems. We will also discuss the advanced applications of heavy-traffic limits, including the use of heavy-traffic limits to analyze the performance of queueing systems in the presence of heavy-tailed service time distributions.




#### 10.1b Understanding Queueing Systems in Heavy-Traffic Regime

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of heavy-traffic limits and discussed the mathematical definition of this regime. In this section, we will delve deeper into the characteristics and implications of queueing systems in the heavy-traffic regime.

#### 10.1b Characteristics of Queueing Systems in Heavy-Traffic Regime

Queueing systems in the heavy-traffic regime exhibit several key characteristics. These include:

1. **Long queues and high utilization levels**: As the system approaches the heavy-traffic limit, the queues become longer and the system's utilization level increases. This is a direct consequence of the system's increasing congestion as more and more customers arrive and compete for the same resources.

2. **Increased variability in queue length and waiting time**: As the system approaches the heavy-traffic limit, the variability in queue length and waiting time increases. This is due to the increased competition for resources, which leads to more frequent and larger fluctuations in queue length and waiting time.

3. **Approximation by Brownian motion**: As the system approaches the heavy-traffic limit, the waiting time in queue can be approximated by the supremum of a Brownian motion with a negative drift. This approximation is a key result of the heavy-traffic limit theorem, which we will discuss in more detail in the next section.

#### 10.1b Implications of Queueing Systems in Heavy-Traffic Regime

The characteristics of queueing systems in the heavy-traffic regime have significant implications for the system's performance and stability. These include:

1. **Increased likelihood of system breakdown**: As the system approaches the heavy-traffic limit, the increased variability in queue length and waiting time can lead to more frequent and severe system breakdowns. This is because small disturbances can have a significant impact on the system's behavior in the heavy-traffic regime.

2. **Need for advanced queue management strategies**: Due to the increased congestion and variability in the heavy-traffic regime, traditional queue management strategies may not be sufficient to maintain the system's performance. Advanced queue management strategies, such as those based on the Halfin-Whitt diffusion model, may be required to effectively manage the queues and maintain the system's stability.

3. **Potential for improved system performance**: Despite the challenges posed by the heavy-traffic regime, there is also potential for improved system performance. The increased variability in queue length and waiting time can lead to more efficient resource allocation and improved system throughput. However, achieving this potential requires a deep understanding of the system's behavior in the heavy-traffic regime and the implementation of advanced queue management strategies.

In the next section, we will discuss the heavy-traffic limit theorem, a key result in the analysis of queueing systems in the heavy-traffic regime. This theorem provides a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of queueing systems as they approach the heavy-traffic limit.

#### 10.1c Modeling Queueing Systems in Heavy-Traffic Regime

In the previous sections, we have discussed the characteristics and implications of queueing systems in the heavy-traffic regime. In this section, we will delve into the mathematical modeling of these systems, focusing on the heavy-traffic limit theorem and its implications for queueing systems.

#### 10.1c.1 Heavy-Traffic Limit Theorem

The heavy-traffic limit theorem is a key result in the analysis of queueing systems in the heavy-traffic regime. It provides a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of queueing systems as they approach the heavy-traffic limit.

The theorem is based on the concept of the heavy-traffic limit, which is defined as the limit where the system's utilization level approaches 1. In other words, as the system approaches the heavy-traffic limit, the system becomes increasingly congested, and the queues become longer.

The theorem states that as the system approaches the heavy-traffic limit, the waiting time in queue can be approximated by the supremum of a Brownian motion with a negative drift. This approximation is a direct consequence of the central limit theorem, which states that the sum of a large number of independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables is approximately normally distributed.

In the context of queueing systems, the waiting time in queue can be seen as the sum of a large number of i.i.d. random variables, each representing the time a customer spends in queue. As the system approaches the heavy-traffic limit, the number of customers in the system increases, and the waiting time in queue becomes more normally distributed. This is why the waiting time in queue can be approximated by the supremum of a Brownian motion with a negative drift.

#### 10.1c.2 Implications of the Heavy-Traffic Limit Theorem

The heavy-traffic limit theorem has significant implications for the performance and stability of queueing systems. These include:

1. **Increased variability in queue length and waiting time**: As the system approaches the heavy-traffic limit, the variability in queue length and waiting time increases. This is due to the increased competition for resources, which leads to more frequent and larger fluctuations in queue length and waiting time.

2. **Approximation by Brownian motion**: As the system approaches the heavy-traffic limit, the waiting time in queue can be approximated by the supremum of a Brownian motion with a negative drift. This approximation is a key result of the heavy-traffic limit theorem and provides a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of queueing systems in the heavy-traffic regime.

3. **Need for advanced queue management strategies**: Due to the increased variability in queue length and waiting time, traditional queue management strategies may not be sufficient to maintain the system's performance. Advanced queue management strategies, such as those based on the heavy-traffic limit theorem, may be required to effectively manage the queues and maintain the system's stability.

In the next section, we will discuss some of these advanced queue management strategies and how they can be applied in the heavy-traffic regime.

#### 10.2a Definition and Analysis of Heavy-Traffic Limits

In the previous section, we discussed the heavy-traffic limit theorem and its implications for queueing systems. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of heavy-traffic limits and their role in queueing theory.

The heavy-traffic limit is a mathematical concept that describes the behavior of queueing systems as the system's utilization level approaches 1. In other words, as the system becomes increasingly congested, the heavy-traffic limit provides a framework for understanding how the system's performance changes.

The heavy-traffic limit is defined as the limit where the system's utilization level $\rho$ approaches 1. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
\lim_{\rho \to 1} \rho = 1
$$

As the system approaches the heavy-traffic limit, the system's behavior changes dramatically. The queues become longer, and the variability in queue length and waiting time increases. This is due to the increased competition for resources, which leads to more frequent and larger fluctuations in queue length and waiting time.

The heavy-traffic limit theorem provides a mathematical framework for understanding these changes. It states that as the system approaches the heavy-traffic limit, the waiting time in queue can be approximated by the supremum of a Brownian motion with a negative drift. This approximation is a direct consequence of the central limit theorem, which states that the sum of a large number of i.i.d. random variables is approximately normally distributed.

In the context of queueing systems, the waiting time in queue can be seen as the sum of a large number of i.i.d. random variables, each representing the time a customer spends in queue. As the system approaches the heavy-traffic limit, the number of customers in the system increases, and the waiting time in queue becomes more normally distributed. This is why the waiting time in queue can be approximated by the supremum of a Brownian motion with a negative drift.

The heavy-traffic limit theorem has significant implications for the performance and stability of queueing systems. These include:

1. **Increased variability in queue length and waiting time**: As the system approaches the heavy-traffic limit, the variability in queue length and waiting time increases. This is due to the increased competition for resources, which leads to more frequent and larger fluctuations in queue length and waiting time.

2. **Approximation by Brownian motion**: As the system approaches the heavy-traffic limit, the waiting time in queue can be approximated by the supremum of a Brownian motion with a negative drift. This approximation is a key result of the heavy-traffic limit theorem and provides a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of queueing systems in the heavy-traffic regime.

3. **Need for advanced queue management strategies**: Due to the increased variability in queue length and waiting time, traditional queue management strategies may not be sufficient to maintain the system's performance. Advanced queue management strategies, such as those based on the heavy-traffic limit theorem, may be required to effectively manage the queues and maintain the system's stability.

#### 10.2b Modeling Queueing Systems in Heavy-Traffic Regime

In the previous section, we discussed the heavy-traffic limit and its implications for queueing systems. In this section, we will delve deeper into the modeling of queueing systems in the heavy-traffic regime.

The heavy-traffic regime is characterized by high utilization levels, where the system is operating at or near its maximum capacity. In this regime, the system's behavior is dominated by the queues, and the queues are long and congested. This is in contrast to the light-traffic regime, where the system's behavior is dominated by the service facilities, and the queues are short and sparse.

The modeling of queueing systems in the heavy-traffic regime is a complex task due to the high level of congestion and variability in queue length and waiting time. However, several models have been developed to address this challenge. These models are based on various assumptions and approximations, and they provide different levels of accuracy and insight into the system's behavior.

One of the most widely used models is the Halfin-Whitt diffusion model. This model is based on the assumption that the system's utilization level is close to 1, and it provides a mathematical framework for understanding the system's behavior in the heavy-traffic regime. The model is based on the concept of a diffusion process, which is a continuous-time stochastic process that describes the evolution of the system's queue length over time.

Another popular model is the Brownian motion approximation, which is based on the heavy-traffic limit theorem. This model provides a mathematical framework for approximating the waiting time in queue in the heavy-traffic regime. It is based on the central limit theorem, which states that the sum of a large number of i.i.d. random variables is approximately normally distributed. In the context of queueing systems, the waiting time in queue can be seen as the sum of a large number of i.i.d. random variables, each representing the time a customer spends in queue. As the system approaches the heavy-traffic limit, the waiting time in queue becomes more normally distributed, and it can be approximated by the supremum of a Brownian motion with a negative drift.

In addition to these models, there are also several simulation-based approaches for modeling queueing systems in the heavy-traffic regime. These approaches involve the use of computer simulations to generate data and estimate the system's performance. They are often used when the system's behavior is complex and difficult to model analytically.

In the next section, we will discuss some of these models and simulation-based approaches in more detail, and we will provide examples of their application in queueing systems.

#### 10.2c Performance Measures in Heavy-Traffic Regime

In the previous section, we discussed the modeling of queueing systems in the heavy-traffic regime. In this section, we will focus on the performance measures that are used to evaluate the system's performance in this regime.

The performance of a queueing system in the heavy-traffic regime is typically evaluated based on several key performance measures. These measures provide a quantitative assessment of the system's performance and help to identify areas for improvement.

One of the most important performance measures is the average queue length. This measure represents the average number of customers waiting in queue. In the heavy-traffic regime, the average queue length is typically large and can be a significant source of delay. Therefore, reducing the average queue length is often a key goal in improving the system's performance.

Another important performance measure is the average waiting time. This measure represents the average time a customer spends waiting in queue. In the heavy-traffic regime, the average waiting time can be very large, and it can have a significant impact on the customer experience. Therefore, reducing the average waiting time is often a key goal in improving the system's performance.

The average queue length and waiting time can be calculated using various methods, depending on the model used to represent the system. For example, in the Halfin-Whitt diffusion model, these measures can be calculated using the solution to the diffusion equation. In the Brownian motion approximation, these measures can be calculated using the central limit theorem.

In addition to these measures, there are also several other performance measures that are used in the heavy-traffic regime. These include the average queue length variance, the average waiting time variance, and the average queue length and waiting time distribution. These measures provide additional insight into the system's performance and can be used to identify specific areas for improvement.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the techniques that can be used to improve the performance of queueing systems in the heavy-traffic regime.

#### 10.2a Definition and Analysis of Fluid Limit

The fluid limit is a fundamental concept in the study of queueing systems, particularly in the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime. It provides a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of queueing systems as the system size approaches infinity. 

#### 10.2a Definition of Fluid Limit

The fluid limit of a queueing system is defined as the limit of the system's behavior as the system size approaches infinity. In other words, it is the long-term behavior of the system when the system is large enough that the effects of individual customers become negligible. 

Mathematically, the fluid limit is often defined in terms of a diffusion process. The diffusion process is a mathematical model that describes the evolution of a system over time, where the system's state at any given time is represented by a point in a multidimensional space. The fluid limit is then defined as the limit of the diffusion process as the system size approaches infinity.

#### 10.2a Analysis of Fluid Limit

The analysis of the fluid limit involves studying the properties of the diffusion process that describes the system's behavior. This includes studying the process's stationary distribution, which represents the long-term behavior of the system, and its transition probabilities, which describe the system's evolution over time.

The fluid limit is particularly useful in the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime, where it allows us to understand the behavior of queueing systems as the system size approaches infinity. This is important because in the Halfin-Whitt regime, the system's behavior can be significantly different from that in the finite-size regime. For example, in the Halfin-Whitt regime, the system's utilization level can exceed 1, leading to a phenomenon known as heavy-traffic breakdown.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the properties of the fluid limit and its implications for queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

#### 10.2b Modeling Queueing Systems using Fluid Limit

The fluid limit provides a powerful tool for modeling queueing systems, particularly in the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime. By understanding the fluid limit, we can gain insights into the long-term behavior of queueing systems as the system size approaches infinity.

##### 10.2b Modeling Queueing Systems using Fluid Limit

The fluid limit can be used to model queueing systems in several ways. One of the most common approaches is to use the fluid limit to approximate the behavior of the queueing system. This is particularly useful in the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the system's behavior can be significantly different from that in the finite-size regime.

For example, consider a queueing system with a large number of customers. In the fluid limit, the system's behavior can be approximated by a diffusion process. This diffusion process can be used to calculate the system's stationary distribution, which represents the long-term behavior of the system. By comparing the stationary distribution with the system's current state, we can gain insights into the system's future behavior.

Another approach to modeling queueing systems using the fluid limit is to use the fluid limit to study the system's transition probabilities. These probabilities describe the system's evolution over time and can be used to predict the system's future state. By studying the transition probabilities, we can gain insights into the system's long-term behavior.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the properties of the fluid limit and its implications for queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. We will also discuss how these properties can be used to model queueing systems and gain insights into their long-term behavior.

#### 10.2c Performance Measures in Fluid Limit

The fluid limit provides a powerful tool for understanding the performance of queueing systems, particularly in the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime. By studying the fluid limit, we can gain insights into the long-term behavior of queueing systems as the system size approaches infinity.

##### 10.2c Performance Measures in Fluid Limit

The fluid limit can be used to calculate several performance measures of queueing systems. These performance measures can provide valuable insights into the system's behavior and can be used to optimize the system's performance.

One of the most important performance measures is the system's utilization level. The utilization level represents the proportion of time that the system is busy serving customers. In the fluid limit, the system's utilization level can exceed 1, leading to a phenomenon known as heavy-traffic breakdown. This breakdown can be studied using the fluid limit, and can provide insights into the system's long-term behavior.

Another important performance measure is the system's queue length. The queue length represents the number of customers waiting in the queue. In the fluid limit, the queue length can be approximated by the solution of a certain differential equation. This approximation can be used to calculate the system's queue length, and can provide insights into the system's long-term behavior.

The fluid limit can also be used to calculate the system's waiting time. The waiting time represents the time that customers spend waiting in the queue. In the fluid limit, the waiting time can be approximated by the solution of a certain differential equation. This approximation can be used to calculate the system's waiting time, and can provide insights into the system's long-term behavior.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the properties of the fluid limit and its implications for queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. We will also discuss how these properties can be used to calculate performance measures of queueing systems.

#### 10.3a Definition and Analysis of Heavy-Tailed Distribution

In the context of queueing theory, the concept of heavy-tailed distribution plays a crucial role. A heavy-tailed distribution is a probability distribution that has a heavy right tail, meaning that there is a higher probability of observing extreme values compared to a distribution with a light tail. This property is particularly relevant in queueing systems, where the arrival and service times are often modeled as random variables with heavy-tailed distributions.

##### 10.3a Definition of Heavy-Tailed Distribution

A heavy-tailed distribution is a probability distribution whose right tail decreases at a slower rate than the exponential function. Mathematically, this can be expressed as follows:

$$
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{P(X > x)}{e^{-\lambda x}} = \infty
$$

where $P(X > x)$ is the probability of observing a value greater than $x$, and $\lambda$ is a positive constant. This definition implies that the probability of observing extremely large values of $X$ is significantly higher than what would be expected from an exponential distribution.

##### 10.3a Analysis of Heavy-Tailed Distribution

The presence of heavy tails in a distribution can have significant implications for queueing systems. One of the key implications is the potential for long queues and high waiting times. This is because heavy-tailed distributions often have a large variance, which can lead to large variations in arrival and service times. These variations can result in long queues and high waiting times, which can have a detrimental effect on the system's performance.

Another important implication is the potential for heavy-traffic breakdown. As mentioned in the previous section, the fluid limit can be used to study the system's utilization level and queue length. In the case of a heavy-tailed distribution, the fluid limit can exceed 1, leading to a phenomenon known as heavy-traffic breakdown. This breakdown can be studied using the fluid limit, and can provide insights into the system's long-term behavior.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the properties of heavy-tailed distributions and their implications for queueing systems. We will also discuss how these properties can be used to optimize the system's performance.

#### 10.3b Modeling Queueing Systems with Heavy-Tailed Distribution

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of heavy-tailed distribution and discussed its implications for queueing systems. In this section, we will delve deeper into the modeling of queueing systems with heavy-tailed distributions.

##### 10.3b Modeling Queueing Systems with Heavy-Tailed Distribution

The modeling of queueing systems with heavy-tailed distributions involves the use of certain mathematical tools and techniques. One such tool is the concept of the Laplace-Stieltjes transform, which is used to characterize the distribution of the queue length in a heavy-tailed system.

The Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the queue length distribution, denoted as $L(s)$, is defined as:

$$
L(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-sx} P(Q \leq x) dx
$$

where $P(Q \leq x)$ is the probability that the queue length is less than or equal to $x$. The Laplace-Stieltjes transform provides a convenient way to characterize the queue length distribution, as it allows us to express the distribution in terms of a single function $L(s)$.

Another important tool in the modeling of heavy-tailed queueing systems is the concept of the fluid limit. As we have seen in the previous section, the fluid limit can be used to study the system's utilization level and queue length. In the case of a heavy-tailed distribution, the fluid limit can exceed 1, leading to a phenomenon known as heavy-traffic breakdown. This breakdown can be studied using the fluid limit, and can provide insights into the system's long-term behavior.

In the next section, we will discuss how these tools can be used to analyze the performance of queueing systems with heavy-tailed distributions. We will also discuss how these tools can be used to optimize the system's performance.

#### 10.3c Performance Measures in Heavy-Tailed Distribution

In this section, we will discuss the performance measures in heavy-tailed distribution. These measures are crucial in understanding the behavior of queueing systems with heavy-tailed distributions.

##### 10.3c Performance Measures in Heavy-Tailed Distribution

The performance of a queueing system can be measured in terms of several key metrics. These include the average queue length, the average waiting time, and the probability of queue overflow. In the context of heavy-tailed distributions, these metrics can be particularly challenging to calculate due to the long right tail of the distribution.

The average queue length, denoted as $L$, can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average queue length is equal to the average waiting time multiplied by the average arrival rate. In the case of a heavy-tailed distribution, the average waiting time can be calculated using the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula, which is given by:

$$
W = \frac{1}{\mu - \lambda} \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{x e^{-\lambda x}}{1 - G(x)} dx
$$

where $\mu$ is the service rate, $\lambda$ is the arrival rate, and $G(x)$ is the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the service time distribution.

The probability of queue overflow, denoted as $P_{overflow}$, can be calculated using the formula:

$$

## Chapter: Chapter 11: Advanced Topics in Queueing Theory

### Introduction

Queueing theory is a fundamental discipline in the field of computer science and engineering, with applications ranging from telecommunications to computer networks. It is a mathematical model used to study the behavior of systems where customers or jobs arrive, wait in a queue, and are eventually served. In this chapter, we delve deeper into the advanced topics of queueing theory, building upon the foundational knowledge established in the previous chapters.

The chapter begins by exploring the concept of heavy-tailed distributions, a key concept in queueing theory. Heavy-tailed distributions are characterized by their long right tails, which can lead to a significant number of extremely large queue lengths. Understanding heavy-tailed distributions is crucial for modeling and analyzing queueing systems in real-world scenarios.

Next, we will discuss the concept of self-similarity, another important aspect of queueing theory. Self-similarity is a property of certain stochastic processes, including queueing systems, that allows us to make predictions about the system's behavior over long periods of time based on short-term observations.

We will also delve into the topic of queueing networks, which are systems of interconnected queues. Queueing networks are used to model a wide range of systems, from call centers to computer networks. We will explore the mathematical models used to analyze queueing networks, including the concept of traffic and the Erlang-C formula.

Finally, we will discuss the concept of queueing systems with multiple servers, which are systems where multiple servers are available to serve customers. These systems are often used to model parallel processing and parallel communication systems. We will explore the mathematical models used to analyze these systems, including the concept of utilization and the Erlang-B formula.

Throughout this chapter, we will use mathematical notation to express these concepts. For example, we might denote the arrival rate of customers to a queueing system as $\lambda$, and the service rate as $\mu$. We will also use the popular Markdown format to present this information in a clear and accessible manner.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a deeper understanding of the advanced topics in queueing theory, and be equipped with the knowledge to apply these concepts to real-world queueing systems.




#### 10.2b Modeling Queueing Systems using Fluid Limit

The fluid limit provides a powerful tool for modeling queueing systems, particularly in the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime. By understanding the long-term behavior of the system, we can make predictions about its performance and identify potential areas for improvement.

#### 10.2b Modeling Queueing Systems using Fluid Limit

The fluid limit can be used to model queueing systems in a variety of ways. One common approach is to use the fluid limit to approximate the behavior of the system in the Halfin-Whitt regime. This is particularly useful because the Halfin-Whitt regime is often where the system's behavior is most significantly different from that in the finite-size regime.

For example, consider a queueing system with a large number of service facilities and circulating customers, as described in the problem setup. The fluid limit can be used to approximate the steady state probabilities of the number of customers at each service facility, which are given by the equation

$$
\mathbb P(n_1,n_2,\cdots,n_M) = \frac{1}{\text{G}(N)}\prod_{i=1}^M \left( X_i \right)^{n_i}
$$

where $X_i$ is determined by solving the equation

$$
\mu_j X_j = \sum_{i=1}^M \mu_i X_i p_{ij}
$$

for $j=1,\ldots,M$. This allows us to approximate the behavior of the system in the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the system's utilization level can exceed 1 and heavy-traffic breakdown can occur.

Another approach to modeling queueing systems using the fluid limit is to use it to study the response time distribution for a network of fork-join queues. This can be done using an approximate formula, which can be calculated using Buzen's algorithm. This approach allows us to understand the behavior of the system in the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the system's response time distribution can be significantly different from that in the finite-size regime.

In conclusion, the fluid limit provides a powerful tool for modeling queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. By understanding the long-term behavior of the system, we can make predictions about its performance and identify potential areas for improvement.

#### 10.2c Performance Measures in Fluid Limit

The fluid limit provides a powerful tool for analyzing the performance of queueing systems, particularly in the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime. By understanding the long-term behavior of the system, we can derive important performance measures that provide insights into the system's performance.

#### 10.2c Performance Measures in Fluid Limit

One of the key performance measures in the fluid limit is the utilization level of the system. The utilization level, denoted by $\rho$, is defined as the ratio of the average arrival rate of customers to the average service rate of the system. In the Halfin-Whitt regime, the utilization level can exceed 1, leading to a phenomenon known as heavy-traffic breakdown. This is a critical point in the system's behavior, as it marks the transition from a stable system to an unstable one.

Another important performance measure is the response time distribution. The response time distribution, denoted by $F(t)$, is the probability distribution of the time a customer spends in the system. In the Halfin-Whitt regime, the response time distribution can be significantly different from that in the finite-size regime. This is due to the fact that the system's behavior is dominated by the fluid limit, which is a continuous deterministic model.

The response time distribution can be approximated using Buzen's algorithm, which is an efficient procedure for computing the normalizing constant $G(N)$ in the steady state probabilities. This algorithm is particularly useful in the context of the fluid limit, as it allows us to approximate the behavior of the system in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

In addition to these performance measures, the fluid limit also provides insights into the system's stability. The stability of the system can be proven by showing that the fluid limit is stable. This is a crucial result, as it allows us to understand the long-term behavior of the system and identify potential areas for improvement.

In conclusion, the fluid limit provides a powerful tool for analyzing the performance of queueing systems. By understanding the long-term behavior of the system, we can derive important performance measures and insights into the system's stability. This makes the fluid limit an indispensable tool for studying queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime.




#### 10.3a Definition and Analysis of Diffusion Limit

The diffusion limit is a powerful tool in queueing theory that allows us to understand the behavior of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. It is particularly useful in systems where the number of service facilities and circulating customers is large, and the system's utilization level can exceed 1.

The diffusion limit is defined as the limit of the scaled queue length process as the system size approaches infinity. Mathematically, it is given by the equation

$$
\lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \left( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_M \right)
$$

where $X_i$ is the queue length at service facility $i$, and $N$ is the total number of service facilities.

The diffusion limit is useful because it allows us to study the behavior of the system in the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the system's utilization level can exceed 1 and heavy-traffic breakdown can occur. It also allows us to understand the response time distribution for a network of fork-join queues, which can be significantly different from that in the finite-size regime.

The diffusion limit can be analyzed using the techniques of diffusion processes and Markov chains. In particular, the diffusion matrix $L$ and the new kernel $L^{(\alpha)}$ are defined as

$$
L_{i,j}=k(x_i,x_j)
$$

and

$$
L^{(\alpha)}_{i,j}=k^{(\alpha)}(x_i,x_j) = \frac{L_{i,j}}{(d(x_i) d(x_j))^{\alpha}}
$$

respectively, where $k(x_i,x_j)$ is the transition probability from $x_i$ to $x_j$, and $d(x_i)$ is the degree of vertex $x_i$. The parameter $\alpha$ plays a crucial role in the analysis of the diffusion limit, and its value can be adjusted to study the behavior of the system in different regimes.

The diffusion limit can also be used to approximate the steady state probabilities of the number of customers at each service facility, which are given by the equation

$$
\mathbb P(n_1,n_2,\cdots,n_M) = \frac{1}{\text{G}(N)}\prod_{i=1}^M \left( X_i \right)^{n_i}
$$

where $X_i$ is determined by solving the equation

$$
\mu_j X_j = \sum_{i=1}^M \mu_i X_i p_{ij}
$$

for $j=1,\ldots,M$. This allows us to approximate the behavior of the system in the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the system's utilization level can exceed 1 and heavy-traffic breakdown can occur.

In the next section, we will discuss the response time distribution for a network of fork-join queues in the context of the diffusion limit.

#### 10.3b Analysis of Diffusion Limit in Queueing Systems

The diffusion limit is a powerful tool in queueing theory that allows us to understand the behavior of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. In this section, we will delve deeper into the analysis of the diffusion limit in queueing systems.

The diffusion limit is particularly useful in systems where the number of service facilities and circulating customers is large, and the system's utilization level can exceed 1. This is often the case in many real-world systems, such as telecommunication networks, computer systems, and manufacturing systems.

The diffusion limit is defined as the limit of the scaled queue length process as the system size approaches infinity. Mathematically, it is given by the equation

$$
\lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \left( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_M \right)
$$

where $X_i$ is the queue length at service facility $i$, and $N$ is the total number of service facilities.

The diffusion limit can be analyzed using the techniques of diffusion processes and Markov chains. In particular, the diffusion matrix $L$ and the new kernel $L^{(\alpha)}$ are defined as

$$
L_{i,j}=k(x_i,x_j)
$$

and

$$
L^{(\alpha)}_{i,j}=k^{(\alpha)}(x_i,x_j) = \frac{L_{i,j}}{(d(x_i) d(x_j))^{\alpha}}
$$

respectively, where $k(x_i,x_j)$ is the transition probability from $x_i$ to $x_j$, and $d(x_i)$ is the degree of vertex $x_i$. The parameter $\alpha$ plays a crucial role in the analysis of the diffusion limit, and its value can be adjusted to study the behavior of the system in different regimes.

The diffusion limit can also be used to approximate the steady state probabilities of the number of customers at each service facility. This is particularly useful in the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the system's utilization level can exceed 1 and heavy-traffic breakdown can occur. The approximation is given by the equation

$$
\mathbb P(n_1,n_2,\cdots,n_M) = \frac{1}{\text{G}(N)}\prod_{i=1}^M \left( X_i \right)^{n_i}
$$

$$
\mu_j X_j = \sum_{i=1}^M \mu_i X_i p_{ij}
$$

for $j=1,\ldots,M$. This allows us to understand the behavior of the queueing system in the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the system's utilization level can exceed 1 and heavy-traffic breakdown can occur.

In the next section, we will discuss the response time distribution for a network of fork-join queues in the context of the diffusion limit.

#### 10.3c Applications of Diffusion Limit in Queueing Systems

The diffusion limit is a powerful tool in queueing theory that allows us to understand the behavior of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of the diffusion limit in queueing systems.

One of the key applications of the diffusion limit is in the analysis of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. As we have seen in the previous section, the diffusion limit can be used to approximate the steady state probabilities of the number of customers at each service facility. This is particularly useful in the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the system's utilization level can exceed 1 and heavy-traffic breakdown can occur.

The diffusion limit can also be used to study the response time distribution for a network of fork-join queues. This is particularly relevant in the context of the diffusion limit, as the response time distribution can be significantly different from that in the finite-size regime. By studying the response time distribution, we can gain insights into the performance of the queueing system and identify potential areas for improvement.

Another important application of the diffusion limit is in the study of queueing systems with a large number of service facilities and circulating customers. In such systems, the diffusion limit can provide a more accurate approximation of the system's behavior than the finite-size regime. This is because the diffusion limit takes into account the interactions between all service facilities and customers, while the finite-size regime only considers a finite number of facilities and customers.

The diffusion limit can also be used to study the behavior of queueing systems in the presence of heavy-traffic breakdown. This is particularly relevant in the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the system's utilization level can exceed 1 and heavy-traffic breakdown can occur. By studying the diffusion limit, we can gain insights into the conditions under which heavy-traffic breakdown occurs and how it affects the system's performance.

In conclusion, the diffusion limit is a powerful tool in queueing theory that allows us to understand the behavior of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. Its applications range from studying the response time distribution to heavy-traffic breakdown, and it is particularly useful in systems with a large number of service facilities and circulating customers.

#### 10.3b Approximating Queueing Systems using Diffusion Limit

The diffusion limit is a powerful tool for approximating queueing systems, particularly in the Halfin-Whitt regime. This approximation is based on the assumption that the system's utilization level can exceed 1, and heavy-traffic breakdown can occur. 

The diffusion limit approximation is derived from the diffusion limit equation, which is given by

$$
\lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \left( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_M \right)
$$

where $X_i$ is the queue length at service facility $i$, and $N$ is the total number of service facilities. This equation allows us to study the behavior of the system in the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the system's utilization level can exceed 1 and heavy-traffic breakdown can occur.

The diffusion limit approximation is used to approximate the steady state probabilities of the number of customers at each service facility. These probabilities are given by the equation

$$
\mathbb P(n_1,n_2,\cdots,n_M) = \frac{1}{\text{G}(N)}\prod_{i=1}^M \left( X_i \right)^{n_i}
$$

where $X_i$ is determined by solving

$$
\mu_j X_j = \sum_{i=1}^M \mu_i X_i p_{ij}\quad\text{ for }j=1,\ldots,M.
$$

The values of "X"<sub>"i"</sub> are determined by solving these equations, and the values of "p"<sub>"ij"</sub> are determined by the transition probabilities from service facility "i" to service facility "j".

The diffusion limit approximation is particularly useful in systems where the number of service facilities and circulating customers is large, and the system's utilization level can exceed 1. It allows us to understand the behavior of the system in the Halfin-Whitt regime, and to approximate the steady state probabilities of the number of customers at each service facility.

In the next section, we will discuss the diffusion limit approximation in more detail, and provide examples of its application in queueing systems.

#### 10.3c Applications of Diffusion Limit

The diffusion limit approximation has been applied to a variety of queueing systems, particularly those in the Halfin-Whitt regime. This section will discuss some of these applications, focusing on the M/M/s queue and the fork-join queue.

##### M/M/s Queue

The M/M/s queue is a single-server queueing system where customers arrive according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$ and service times are exponentially distributed with rate $\mu$. The diffusion limit approximation has been used to study the behavior of this system in the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the utilization level $\rho = \lambda/\mu$ exceeds 1.

The diffusion limit approximation allows us to approximate the steady state probabilities of the number of customers in the system, which are given by the equation

$$
\mathbb P(n) = \frac{1}{\text{G}(N)}\left( X \right)^{n}
$$

where $X$ is determined by solving the equation

$$
\mu X = \lambda
$$

and $G(N)$ is a normalizing constant. This approximation has been shown to be accurate for large values of $N$.

##### Fork-Join Queue

The fork-join queue is a network of queues where a job is split into $s$ sub-tasks, each of which is serviced at a separate service facility. The job is completed when all sub-tasks have been serviced. The diffusion limit approximation has been used to study the response time distribution in this system, which can be significantly different from that in the finite-size regime.

The diffusion limit approximation allows us to approximate the response time distribution, which is given by the equation

$$
F(t) = \frac{1}{\text{G}(N)}\sum_{n=0}^{N}\left( X_1 \right)^{n_1}\left( X_2 \right)^{n_2}\cdots\left( X_s \right)^{n_s}e^{-\mu_1n_1t}\cdots e^{-\mu_sn_s t}
$$

where $X_i$ is determined by solving the equation

$$
\mu_j X_j = \sum_{i=1}^M \mu_i X_i p_{ij}\quad\text{ for }j=1,\ldots,M.
$$

and $G(N)$ is a normalizing constant. This approximation has been shown to be accurate for large values of $N$.

In conclusion, the diffusion limit approximation is a powerful tool for approximating queueing systems, particularly in the Halfin-Whitt regime. It allows us to understand the behavior of these systems and to approximate important quantities such as the steady state probabilities and the response time distribution.

### Introduction

In the realm of queueing theory, the concept of heavy-tailed service times plays a pivotal role. This chapter, "Queueing Networks with Heavy-Tailed Service Times," delves into the intricacies of this topic, providing a comprehensive understanding of its implications and applications.

Heavy-tailed service times, as the name suggests, are service times that follow a heavy-tailed distribution. This means that the service times can be significantly longer than the mean, leading to a long-tailed distribution. This phenomenon is often observed in real-world systems, where service times can vary widely due to unpredictable factors such as system load, hardware limitations, and human error.

In the context of queueing networks, heavy-tailed service times can have profound effects on system performance. They can lead to increased variability in queue lengths, longer waiting times, and higher system utilization. Understanding these effects is crucial for designing and optimizing queueing networks.

This chapter will explore these topics in depth, providing mathematical models and analytical results to support the discussion. We will also discuss practical implications and real-world examples to illustrate the concepts. By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of heavy-tailed service times and their role in queueing networks.

Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a practitioner in the field of queueing theory, this chapter will serve as a valuable resource. It will provide you with the knowledge and tools to analyze and optimize queueing networks with heavy-tailed service times. So, let's embark on this journey of exploring the fascinating world of queueing networks with heavy-tailed service times.




#### 10.4a Definition and Analysis of Stationary Distribution

The stationary distribution of a queueing system is a probability distribution that remains constant over time, regardless of the initial state of the system. In other words, it is a distribution to which the system converges after a large number of steps. The existence and uniqueness of the stationary distribution is a fundamental concept in queueing theory, particularly in the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime.

The stationary distribution of a queueing system can be defined as the solution to the following system of equations:

$$
\pi_i = \sum_{j=1}^M \pi_j p_{ji}
$$

for all $i = 1, 2, \ldots, M$, where $\pi_i$ is the probability of being in state $i$, and $p_{ji}$ is the transition probability from state $j$ to state $i$. This system of equations represents the balance of probabilities, where the probability of being in state $i$ is equal to the sum of the probabilities of reaching state $i$ from all other states.

The existence and uniqueness of the stationary distribution is a key result in queueing theory. It is known as the Perron-Frobenius theorem, which states that if a Markov chain is irreducible and aperiodic, then it has a unique stationary distribution. In the context of queueing theory, this means that if the queueing system is large enough and the utilization level is not too high, then the system will converge to a unique stationary distribution.

The stationary distribution can be used to analyze the long-term behavior of the queueing system. For example, it can be used to calculate the average queue length, the average waiting time, and the average number of customers in the system. These quantities are important performance measures of the queueing system, and they can be used to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the system.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of the stationary distribution in the analysis of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

#### 10.4b Calculating Stationary Distribution

The calculation of the stationary distribution is a crucial step in the analysis of queueing systems. It involves solving the system of equations defined by the Perron-Frobenius theorem. This can be a challenging task, especially for large queueing systems. However, there are several methods that can be used to approximate the stationary distribution.

One such method is the diffusion limit approximation, which we discussed in the previous chapter. This approximation is particularly useful in the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the system's utilization level can exceed 1, and heavy-traffic breakdown can occur.

The diffusion limit approximation is based on the assumption that the system's utilization level can exceed 1, and heavy-traffic breakdown can occur. This approximation is derived from the diffusion limit equation, which is given by

$$
\lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \left( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_M \right)
$$

where $X_i$ is the queue length at service facility $i$, and $N$ is the total number of service facilities. This equation allows us to study the behavior of the system in the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the system's utilization level can exceed 1 and heavy-traffic breakdown can occur.

The diffusion limit approximation is used to approximate the steady state probabilities of the number of customers at each service facility. These probabilities are given by the equation

$$
\mathbb P(n_1,n_2,\cdots,n_M) = \frac{1}{\text{G}(N)}\prod_{i=1}^M \left( X_i \right)^{n_i}
$$

where $X_i$ is determined by solving

$$
\mu_j X_j = \sum_{i=1}^M \mu_i X_i p_{ij}\quad\text{ for }j=1,\ldots,M.
$$

The values of "X"<sub>"i"</sub> are determined by solving these equations, and the values of "p"<sub>"ij"</sub> are determined by the transition probabilities from service facility "i" to service facility "j".

In the next section, we will discuss the application of the stationary distribution in the analysis of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

#### 10.4c Applications of Stationary Distribution

The stationary distribution of a queueing system is a fundamental concept that has wide-ranging applications in the analysis of queueing systems. In this section, we will explore some of these applications, particularly in the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime.

One of the key applications of the stationary distribution is in the calculation of performance measures. The stationary distribution can be used to calculate the average queue length, the average waiting time, and the average number of customers in the system. These quantities are important performance measures of the queueing system, and they can be used to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the system.

For example, the average queue length can be calculated using the Little's Law, which states that the average queue length is equal to the average waiting time multiplied by the average number of customers in the system. The average waiting time and the average number of customers in the system can be calculated from the stationary distribution.

Another important application of the stationary distribution is in the analysis of the stability of the queueing system. The stationary distribution can be used to determine whether the queueing system is stable or not. A queueing system is said to be stable if the average number of customers in the system is finite. The stationary distribution can be used to calculate the average number of customers in the system, and if this average is finite, then the queueing system is stable.

The stationary distribution also has applications in the analysis of the Halfin-Whitt regime. In this regime, the system's utilization level can exceed 1, and heavy-traffic breakdown can occur. The diffusion limit approximation, which is based on the assumption that the system's utilization level can exceed 1, and heavy-traffic breakdown can occur, can be used to approximate the stationary distribution in this regime.

The diffusion limit approximation is derived from the diffusion limit equation, which is given by

$$
\lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \left( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_M \right)
$$

where $X_i$ is the queue length at service facility $i$, and $N$ is the total number of service facilities. This equation allows us to study the behavior of the system in the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the system's utilization level can exceed 1 and heavy-traffic breakdown can occur.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the analysis of the Halfin-Whitt regime and explore more advanced applications of the stationary distribution.

## Chapter: Chapter 11: Advanced Topics in Queueing Theory

### Introduction

Queueing theory is a fundamental concept in the field of computer science and telecommunications. It is a mathematical model that describes the behavior of systems where a sequence of requests or jobs arrive at a service facility and wait in a queue until they can be served. This chapter, "Advanced Topics in Queueing Theory," delves deeper into the intricacies of queueing theory, building upon the foundational knowledge established in previous chapters.

In this chapter, we will explore advanced topics such as the Halfin-Whitt diffusion model, heavy-traffic limits, and the Erlang-C formula. These topics are crucial for understanding the behavior of queueing systems under heavy loads and high utilization rates. We will also discuss the implications of these advanced concepts for the design and analysis of queueing systems.

The Halfin-Whitt diffusion model is a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems in the limit as the system size approaches infinity. It provides a framework for understanding the long-term behavior of queueing systems under heavy loads. We will explore the assumptions and implications of this model in detail.

Heavy-traffic limits are another important concept in queueing theory. They allow us to understand the behavior of queueing systems as the system utilization rate approaches 1. This is particularly relevant for systems operating at high utilization rates, where the system is close to its maximum capacity.

Finally, we will discuss the Erlang-C formula, a classic result in queueing theory that provides a formula for the probability that a system of servers can handle a certain load. This formula is still widely used in the design and analysis of queueing systems.

Throughout this chapter, we will use the powerful mathematical language of Markdown and TeX to present and explain these advanced concepts. This will allow us to present complex mathematical expressions and equations in a clear and understandable way.

#### 10.4b Estimating Stationary Distribution in Queueing Systems

The stationary distribution of a queueing system is a fundamental concept that provides insights into the long-term behavior of the system. However, in many practical scenarios, the exact values of the stationary distribution may not be known or easily computable. In such cases, it is often necessary to estimate the stationary distribution from observed data.

One common method for estimating the stationary distribution is the method of moments. This method involves equating the moments of the observed data with the moments of the stationary distribution, and solving for the unknown parameters. The resulting estimates can then be used to approximate the stationary distribution.

Another approach is the maximum likelihood estimation. This method involves maximizing the likelihood function, which is defined as the product of the probabilities of the observed data. The maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters can then be used to approximate the stationary distribution.

In the context of queueing systems, the stationary distribution can be estimated using the Buzen's algorithm. This algorithm provides an efficient procedure for computing the normalizing constant "G"("N") in the expression for the stationary distribution. The values of "X"<sub>"i"</sub> are determined by solving the equations

$$
\mu_j X_j = \sum_{i=1}^M \mu_i X_i p_{ij}\quad\text{ for }j=1,\ldots,M.
$$

Buzen's algorithm represents the first efficient procedure for computing "G"("N"). It has been widely used in the analysis of queueing systems, particularly in the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of the stationary distribution in the analysis of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

The stationary distribution can be used to calculate various performance measures of the queueing system. For instance, the average queue length, the average waiting time, and the average number of customers in the system can all be calculated from the stationary distribution. These measures provide valuable insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of the system.

##### Stability Analysis

The stationary distribution can also be used to perform stability analysis of the queueing system. The system is said to be stable if the queue length remains bounded for all time. The stationary distribution can be used to determine the critical load at which the system becomes unstable. This is particularly useful in the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the system is assumed to be large and the utilization level is not too high.

##### Model Validation

The stationary distribution can be used to validate the queueing model. If the observed data matches the predicted distribution from the model, then the model is considered to be a good fit. This can be particularly useful in the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the system is assumed to be large and the utilization level is not too high.

##### Performance Optimization

The stationary distribution can be used to optimize the performance of the queueing system. By adjusting the parameters of the system, such as the number of servers or the service time, the stationary distribution can be manipulated to improve the performance of the system. This can be particularly useful in the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the system is assumed to be large and the utilization level is not too high.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of the stationary distribution in the analysis of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

### Introduction

We have also delved into more advanced topics such as queueing networks and performance measures. In this chapter, we will build upon this knowledge and introduce the concept of open Jackson networks.

Open Jackson networks are a type of queueing network where customers can enter and exit the system at any point.

### Section: 11.1 Jackson Networks:

In the previous chapters, we have explored various types of queueing networks, including closed networks, open networks, and networks with multiple servers. In this section, we will focus on open Jackson networks, which are a type of open network where customers can enter and exit the system at any point.

#### 11.1a Definition and Analysis of Jackson Networks

Open Jackson networks are a type of queueing network where customers can enter and exit the system at any point. This makes them a powerful tool for modeling complex systems where customers can follow multiple paths and interact with multiple servers. Open Jackson networks are widely used in various fields, including telecommunication networks, computer systems, and manufacturing systems.

To analyze the behavior of open Jackson networks, we use the concept of equilibrium state probability distribution. This distribution represents the probability of finding a certain number of customers at each node in the network. In an open Jackson network of "m" M/M/1 queues, the equilibrium state probability distribution exists and is given by the product of the individual queue equilibrium distributions. This result, denoted as $\pi (k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_m) = \prod_{i=1}^{m} \pi_i(k_i)$, also holds for M/M/c model stations with "c"<sub>"i"</sub> servers at the <math>i^\text{th}</math> station, with utilization requirement <math>\rho_i < c_i</math>.

In an open network, jobs arrive from outside following a Poisson process with rate $\alpha>0$. Each arrival is independently routed to node "j" with probability $p_{0j}\ge0$ and $\sum_{j=1}^J p_{0j}=1$. Upon service completion at node "i", a job may go to another node "j" with probability $p_{ij}$ or leave the network with probability $p_{i0}=1-\sum_{j=1}^J p_{ij}$.

The overall arrival rate to node "i", $\lambda_i$, including both external arrivals and internal transitions, can be calculated using the formula $\lambda_i = \alpha p_{0i} + \sum_{j=1}^J \mu_i(x_i) (1-p_{ij})$.

To determine the equilibrium distribution of the number of jobs at each node, we use the balance equations. These equations state that the arrival rate to a node is equal to the departure rate, and can be written as $\pi(\mathbf{x}) \sum_{i=1}^J [\alpha p_{0i} +\mu_i (x_i) (1-p_{ii})] = \sum_{i=1}^J[\pi(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{e}_i) \alpha p_{0i}+\pi(\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{e}_i)\mu_i(x_i+1)p_{i0}]+\sum_{i=1}^J\sum_{j\ne i}\pi(\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{e}_i-\mathbf{e}_j)\mu_i(x_i$.

In the next section, we will explore the performance measures used to evaluate the behavior of open Jackson networks, and how to calculate these measures for different types of networks.





#### 11.1b Modeling Network Performance using Jackson Networks

In the previous section, we discussed the definition and analysis of Jackson networks. In this section, we will explore how Jackson networks can be used to model network performance.

One of the key advantages of using Jackson networks is their ability to capture the behavior of complex systems with multiple paths and interactions. This makes them particularly useful for modeling network performance, where customers can enter and exit the system at any point.

To model network performance using Jackson networks, we first need to define the network structure and the behavior of each node. This includes determining the arrival rate of customers, the service time at each node, and the probability of a customer being routed to a specific node.

Once the network structure and behavior are defined, we can use the equilibrium state probability distribution to analyze the network performance. This distribution represents the probability of finding a certain number of customers at each node in the network, and can be used to calculate important performance metrics such as average queue length, average waiting time, and average number of customers in the system.

In addition to analyzing network performance, Jackson networks can also be used for network design and optimization. By simulating different network configurations and analyzing the resulting performance metrics, we can identify areas for improvement and make design decisions to optimize network performance.

In conclusion, Jackson networks are a powerful tool for modeling network performance. Their ability to capture the behavior of complex systems and their flexibility in network design and optimization make them an essential concept for understanding queueing theory. In the next section, we will explore advanced applications of Jackson networks in various fields.





#### 11.2a Definition and Calculation of Routing Probability

Routing probability is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that describes the probability of a customer being routed to a specific node in a network. It is a crucial factor in understanding the behavior of open Jackson networks, as it determines the flow of customers through the network.

The routing probability, denoted by $P_{ij}$, is defined as the probability of a customer being routed from node $i$ to node $j$. It is a key component in the routing matrix, which is a square matrix that represents the routing behavior of the network. The routing matrix is a stochastic matrix, meaning that the sum of the probabilities in each row and column is equal to 1.

To calculate the routing probability, we can use the following formula:

$$
P_{ij} = \frac{\lambda_j}{\lambda_i + \mu_i}
$$

where $\lambda_i$ is the arrival rate of customers at node $i$ and $\mu_i$ is the service rate at node $i$.

The routing probability can also be calculated using the routing matrix, as shown below:

$$
P_{ij} = \frac{R_{ij}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n} R_{ik}}
$$

where $R_{ij}$ is the element in the $i$th row and $j$th column of the routing matrix.

The routing probability is a crucial factor in understanding the behavior of open Jackson networks. It determines the flow of customers through the network and can be used to analyze the performance of the network. By calculating the routing probability, we can determine the probability of a customer being routed to a specific node, which can help us optimize the network for better performance.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of routing probability in more detail and discuss its applications in open Jackson networks.





#### 11.2b Analyzing Routing Probability

In the previous section, we discussed the definition and calculation of routing probability in open Jackson networks. In this section, we will explore the various methods for analyzing routing probability and its implications for network performance.

One way to analyze routing probability is through the use of the routing matrix. As mentioned earlier, the routing matrix is a stochastic matrix that represents the routing behavior of the network. By examining the elements of the routing matrix, we can gain insight into the flow of customers through the network. For example, a high routing probability between two nodes may indicate a high volume of traffic between those nodes, while a low routing probability may suggest a bottleneck in the network.

Another method for analyzing routing probability is through the use of Little's Law. Little's Law states that the average number of customers in a system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. By applying Little's Law to the routing probability, we can determine the average time a customer spends at each node in the network. This information can be useful in identifying potential bottlenecks and optimizing network performance.

In addition to these methods, we can also use simulation techniques to analyze routing probability. By creating a computer model of the network and simulating the behavior of customers, we can observe the flow of customers and identify any potential issues with the routing probability. This approach allows for a more detailed analysis of the network and can provide valuable insights into the performance of the network.

It is important to note that routing probability is not a fixed value and can change over time. Factors such as changes in customer behavior, network traffic, and system failures can all impact the routing probability. Therefore, it is crucial to continuously monitor and analyze routing probability to ensure optimal network performance.

In conclusion, routing probability is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of open Jackson networks. By analyzing routing probability through various methods, we can gain valuable insights into the performance of the network and make informed decisions to optimize its performance.
