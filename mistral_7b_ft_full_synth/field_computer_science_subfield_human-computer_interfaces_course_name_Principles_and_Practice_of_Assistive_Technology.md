### Subsection: 3.1a Understanding the Needs and Perspectives of AT Users

Assistive technology (AT) users have diverse needs and perspectives that must be considered in the design process. These needs and perspectives are shaped by a variety of factors, including the user's disability, personal preferences, and the context in which the AT will be used. Understanding these needs and perspectives is crucial for designing AT that is effective, efficient, and user-friendly.

#### Disability and AT Needs

Disability is a complex concept that encompasses a wide range of physical, cognitive, and sensory impairments. Each disability presents unique challenges and needs that must be addressed in AT design. For example, a user with a physical disability may require AT that can assist with mobility or daily tasks, while a user with a cognitive disability may need AT that can support memory or decision-making.

In addition to the specific needs associated with a disability, AT users may also have unique needs related to their individual impairments. For instance, a user with a visual impairment may require AT that can enhance visual function, while a user with a hearing impairment may need AT that can support communication.

#### Personal Preferences and AT Perspectives

In addition to their disability-related needs, AT users also have personal preferences and perspectives that must be considered in the design process. These preferences and perspectives are shaped by a variety of factors, including the user's age, culture, and personal style.

For example, an older user may prefer AT that is familiar and easy to use, while a younger user may be more open to trying new technologies. Similarly, a user from a particular culture may have preferences for certain design elements or interfaces based on cultural norms and values.

#### Context of AT Use

The context in which AT will be used also plays a crucial role in understanding the needs and perspectives of AT users. This includes the physical environment in which the AT will be used, as well as the social and cultural context.

For instance, AT designed for use in a classroom may need to be compatible with the classroom technology and layout, while AT designed for use in a home may need to be easily integrated into the user's daily routines. Additionally, the social and cultural context in which the AT will be used can influence the user's perception of the AT and their willingness to use it.

In conclusion, understanding the needs and perspectives of AT users is a complex but crucial aspect of user-centered design. By considering the user's disability, personal preferences, and the context of AT use, designers can create AT that is tailored to the specific needs and preferences of the user. This not only enhances the user's quality of life, but also promotes their independence and participation in society.





### Subsection: 3.1b User-Centered Design Principles and Methods

User-centered design (UCD) is a design philosophy that focuses on the needs, wants, and limitations of the end user of the designed artifact. This approach is in contrast to use-centered design, which focuses on the goals and tasks associated with skill performance in specific work or problem domains. In the context of assistive technology (AT), UCD is particularly important as it ensures that the AT is designed to meet the specific needs and preferences of the user.

#### Principles of User-Centered Design

The principles of UCD are based on the understanding that the end user is the ultimate judge of the success or failure of a product. Therefore, the design process must be centered around the user, with their needs and preferences driving the design decisions. This involves understanding the user's goals, tasks, and context of use, as well as their physical, cognitive, and sensory abilities and limitations.

#### Methods of User-Centered Design

There are several methods that can be used to implement UCD in the design process. These include:

- **User Research:** This involves studying the potential users of the AT to understand their needs, preferences, and limitations. This can be done through surveys, interviews, observations, and user testing.

- **Prototyping:** Prototyping involves creating early versions of the AT to test and refine the design. This allows for the identification and correction of design flaws before the final product is developed.

- **Iterative Design:** Iterative design is a process of continuous improvement, where the design is refined based on user feedback and testing. This allows for the incorporation of user needs and preferences into the design process.

- **Inclusive Design:** Inclusive design is a design approach that aims to meet the needs of all potential users, including those with disabilities. This involves considering the diverse needs and preferences of users in the design process.

#### User-Centered Design in AT

In the context of AT, UCD is particularly important as it ensures that the AT is designed to meet the specific needs and preferences of the user. This is crucial as AT is often used to support individuals with disabilities in performing tasks that they would otherwise find difficult or impossible. Therefore, the design of AT must be centered around the user, with their needs and preferences driving the design decisions.

In conclusion, user-centered design is a crucial aspect of assistive technology design. It ensures that the AT is designed to meet the specific needs and preferences of the user, thereby enhancing the user's quality of life.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the principles and practices of user-centered design in the context of assistive technology.

### Subsection: 6.1a Conducting Contextual Inquiry in Wheelchair Design

Contextual inquiry (CI) is a user-centered design (UCD) research method that is part of the contextual design methodology. It is a crucial tool in the design and development of assistive technology, such as wheelchairs. In this section, we will discuss the principles and practice of conducting contextual inquiry in wheelchair design.

#### The Principles of Contextual Inquiry

Contextual inquiry defines four principles to guide the interaction:

1. The user's environment: The researcher must understand the user's environment, including their physical surroundings, social interactions, and daily routines.
2. The user's tasks: The researcher must observe the user performing their tasks and understand the challenges they face.
3. The user's goals: The researcher must understand the user's goals and objectives, both in the context of their tasks and their overall life.
4. The user's needs: The researcher must identify the user's needs and how they are currently being met or unmet.

#### Conducting a Contextual Inquiry

Before a contextual inquiry, user visits must be set up. The users selected must be doing work of interest currently, must be able to have the researcher come into their workplace (wherever it is), and should represent a wide range of different types of users. A contextual inquiry may gather data from as few as 4 users (for a single, small task) to 30 or more.

Following a contextual inquiry field interview, the method defines interpretation sessions as a way to analyze the data. In an interpretation session, 3-8 team members gather to hear the researcher re-tell the story of the interview in order. As the interview is re-told, the team add individual insights and facts as notes. They also may capture representations of the user's activities as work models (defined in the Contextual design methodology). The notes may be organized using an affinity diagram. Many teams use the contextual data to generate in-depth personas.

#### Advantages of Contextual Inquiry

Contextual inquiry offers several advantages in the design and development of assistive technology, such as wheelchairs. These include:

1. Understanding the user's needs: By observing the user in their natural environment, the researcher can gain a deep understanding of the user's needs and challenges.
2. Identifying unmet needs: Contextual inquiry can help identify needs that the user may not be able to articulate, leading to the development of innovative solutions.
3. Incorporating user feedback: By involving the user in the design process, contextual inquiry can ensure that the final product meets the user's needs and preferences.
4. Generating insights: The interpretation sessions can generate valuable insights into the user's activities, goals, and needs, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the user.

In conclusion, conducting contextual inquiry is a crucial step in the design and development of assistive technology, such as wheelchairs. By understanding the user's needs, environment, tasks, and goals, designers can create products that are tailored to the specific needs of the user, leading to improved user satisfaction and quality of life.




### Subsection: 6.1b Analyzing User Feedback for Wheelchair Improvement

After conducting a contextual inquiry, the next step is to analyze the user feedback for wheelchair improvement. This involves interpreting the data collected during the contextual inquiry and using it to inform design decisions.

#### Interpreting User Feedback

The user feedback collected during a contextual inquiry can be interpreted in various ways. One approach is to use the QUIS (Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction) to evaluate the usability of the wheelchair. The QUIS is a standardized questionnaire that measures user satisfaction with a product or system. It has been used in various studies, including one with a local PC User's Group, to compare ratings for software that is liked versus disliked, and to compare a mandatory CLS with a voluntarily chosen MDA.

The QUIS Version 5.0 was found to have a high reliability (Cronbach's alpha of .939), indicating that it is a reliable tool for evaluating user satisfaction. However, the interface issues of the online version were addressed in QUIS Version 5.5, which presented related sets of questions on the same screen and collected and stored comments online for each set of questions.

#### Using User Feedback for Wheelchair Improvement

The user feedback collected during a contextual inquiry can be used to inform design decisions for wheelchair improvement. For example, if users consistently express dissatisfaction with a particular aspect of the wheelchair, this could indicate a need for design improvement. Similarly, if users express a need for a feature that is not currently available, this could suggest a new design direction.

In addition to informing design decisions, user feedback can also be used to prioritize design improvements. For instance, if multiple users express the same issue, this could indicate a high-priority design improvement. Conversely, if only a few users express a particular issue, this could suggest a lower priority for design improvement.

In conclusion, analyzing user feedback for wheelchair improvement is a crucial step in the design process. It involves interpreting the data collected during a contextual inquiry and using it to inform design decisions. Tools like the QUIS can be useful for evaluating user satisfaction and prioritizing design improvements.




### Subsection: 6.1c Integrating User-Centered Design in Wheelchair Lab Projects

In the previous section, we discussed the importance of user feedback in wheelchair improvement. Now, we will delve into the process of integrating user-centered design in wheelchair lab projects.

#### Understanding User-Centered Design

User-centered design is a design philosophy that focuses on the needs, wants, and limitations of the end user of the designed artifact. This approach is in contrast to the use-centered design approach, which focuses on the goals and tasks associated with skill performance in specific work or problem domains.

In the context of wheelchair lab projects, user-centered design involves understanding the needs and limitations of the users of the wheelchair. This includes their physical needs, such as mobility and comfort, as well as their psychological needs, such as independence and self-esteem.

#### Integrating User-Centered Design in Wheelchair Lab Projects

Integrating user-centered design in wheelchair lab projects involves a systematic approach to understanding and addressing the needs and limitations of the users. This process can be broken down into three main steps:

1. **Understanding the Users**: This involves conducting a contextual inquiry to gain a deep understanding of the users' needs and limitations. This can be done through observation, interviews, and questionnaires.

2. **Analyzing User Feedback**: As discussed in the previous section, this involves interpreting the user feedback and using it to inform design decisions.

3. **Applying User-Centered Design in the Design Process**: This involves incorporating the user feedback into the design process. This can be done through various methods, such as brainstorming, prototyping, and testing.

By integrating user-centered design in wheelchair lab projects, we can ensure that the final product meets the needs and limitations of the users, thereby improving the quality of life for individuals with mobility impairments.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, user-centered design is a crucial aspect of wheelchair lab projects. By understanding the needs and limitations of the users and incorporating this understanding into the design process, we can create wheelchairs that are not only functional but also user-friendly.

#### 17.2a Understanding the Needs of Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that affects social communication and behavior. It is characterized by difficulties in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication, and repetitive behaviors. ASD can also cause imaginative abnormalities and can range from mild to severe, especially in sensory-motor, perceptual, and affective dimensions.

Children with ASD often struggle with self-awareness and self-acceptance. Their different thinking patterns and brain processing functions in the area of social thinking and actions may compromise their ability to understand themselves and social connections to others. About 75% of diagnosed autistics are mentally handicapped in some general way, and the other 25% diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome show average to good cognitive functioning (Understanding Autism, 2003).

Scientists at the University of Cambridge have produced evidence that self-awareness is a main problem for people with ASD. Researchers used functional magnetic resonance scans (FMRI) to measure brain activity in volunteers being asked to make judgments about their own thoughts, opinions, preferences, as well as about someone else's. One area of the brain closely examined was the ventromedial pre-frontal cortex (vMPFC) which is known to be active when people think about themselves.

A study out of Stanford University has tried to map out brain circuits with understanding self. The study found that individuals with ASD have different brain circuitry compared to typically developing individuals, which may contribute to their difficulties with self-awareness and self-acceptance.

Understanding the needs of individuals with ASD is crucial for developing effective assistive technologies. These technologies must address the unique challenges faced by individuals with ASD, including difficulties with social interaction, communication, and self-awareness. In the following sections, we will explore various assistive technologies that have been developed to address these needs.
