# Title: Statistical Mechanics: From Stochastic Processes to Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics":

## Foreward

Welcome to "Statistical Mechanics: From Stochastic Processes to Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics". This book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the fascinating world of statistical mechanics, from the microscopic level of stochastic processes to the macroscopic level of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

Statistical mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the statistical behavior of large assemblies of microscopic entities. It is a powerful tool that allows us to understand and predict the behavior of complex systems, from the movement of molecules in a gas to the flow of traffic on a highway.

In this book, we will explore the fundamental concepts of statistical mechanics, starting with stochastic processes. Stochastic processes are mathematical models that describe the evolution of a system over time in a probabilistic manner. They are essential in statistical mechanics as they allow us to describe the behavior of a system with a large number of interacting particles.

We will then delve into the realm of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is concerned with systems that are not in a state of thermal equilibrium, such as engines, refrigerators, and other devices that transform energy from one form to another. Understanding non-equilibrium thermodynamics is crucial for the design and analysis of these devices.

Throughout the book, we will use the popular Markdown format to present the material in a clear and concise manner. This will allow us to easily incorporate mathematical expressions and equations, using the TeX and LaTeX style syntax. For example, inline math will be written as `$y_j(n)$` and equations as `$$\Delta w = ...$$`.

We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for students and researchers in the field of statistical mechanics. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and accessible introduction to this fascinating subject, and we hope that you will find it both informative and enjoyable.

Thank you for choosing to embark on this journey with us. Let's dive into the world of statistical mechanics and discover the beauty and power of this field.




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of stochastic processes and Brownian motion, two fundamental concepts in the field of statistical mechanics. These concepts are essential in understanding the behavior of systems that are subject to random fluctuations, such as molecules in a gas or particles in a fluid.

Stochastic processes are mathematical models that describe the evolution of a system over time in a probabilistic manner. They are used to model systems that are subject to random influences, and they are fundamental to the study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. We will explore the different types of stochastic processes, including Markov processes and Poisson processes, and their applications in various fields.

Brownian motion, also known as Wiener process, is a fundamental concept in stochastic processes. It describes the random movement of particles in a fluid due to collisions with other particles. Brownian motion is a key concept in many areas of physics, including the study of diffusion, heat conduction, and the behavior of molecules in a gas.

We will begin this chapter by introducing the basic concepts of stochastic processes and Brownian motion. We will then explore the mathematical foundations of these concepts, including the use of differential equations and probability distributions. We will also discuss the physical interpretation of these concepts and their applications in various fields.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of stochastic processes and Brownian motion, and you will be equipped with the mathematical tools to analyze and model systems that are subject to random fluctuations. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the subsequent chapters, where we will delve deeper into the fascinating world of statistical mechanics.




### Section: 1.1 Markov Processes:

Markov processes are a class of stochastic processes that have been widely used in various fields, including physics, biology, and economics. They are named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov, who first introduced them in the early 20th century.

#### 1.1a Introduction to Markov Processes

A Markov process is a type of stochastic process that has the Markov property. This property states that the future state of the system depends only on its current state, and not on its past states. In other words, the future state of the system is independent of its past states, given its current state. This property is often referred to as the Markov property or the Markov assumption.

The Markov property is a powerful tool in the study of stochastic processes. It allows us to simplify complex systems by focusing on their current state, rather than their entire history. This property is particularly useful in systems where the past states of the system are not relevant to its future states, or where the system's state at any given time is determined by its current state and some random noise.

Markov processes are used to model a wide range of phenomena, including the movement of particles in a fluid (as in Brownian motion), the behavior of stock prices, and the transitions between different states in a biological system. They are also used in the study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, where they are used to model the behavior of systems that are not in thermal equilibrium.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical foundations of Markov processes, and explore their applications in various fields. We will also discuss the different types of Markov processes, including discrete-time Markov chains and continuous-time Markov chains.

#### 1.1b Properties of Markov Processes

Markov processes have several important properties that make them a powerful tool in the study of stochastic processes. These properties are often used to simplify complex systems and make predictions about their future behavior.

##### Communicating Classes

Communicating classes are a fundamental concept in the study of Markov processes. They are defined as a set of states in a Markov process where it is possible to transition from any state to any other state within the class. In other words, if two states are in the same communicating class, it is possible to reach one state from the other in a finite number of steps.

Communicating classes are important because they allow us to divide a Markov process into smaller, more manageable subprocesses. Each communicating class can be studied separately, and the overall behavior of the Markov process can be understood by studying the behavior of its communicating classes.

##### Transience, Recurrence, and Positive and Null Recurrence

Transience, recurrence, and positive and null recurrence are properties that describe the behavior of a Markov process. A Markov process is said to be transient if there exists a state from which it is possible to reach an absorbing state in a finite number of steps. It is said to be recurrent if it is possible to return to any state from any other state in a finite number of steps.

Positive recurrence and null recurrence are more subtle properties. A Markov process is said to be positive recurrent if it is recurrent and there exists a state from which it is possible to reach any other state in a finite number of steps. It is said to be null recurrent if it is recurrent but not positive recurrent.

These properties are important because they provide insight into the long-term behavior of a Markov process. For example, a transient Markov process will eventually reach an absorbing state and stop, while a recurrent Markov process will continue to cycle between states indefinitely.

##### Transient Behavior

The transient behavior of a Markov process is described by the forward equation, a first-order differential equation that relates the probability of being in a particular state at a given time to the probability of being in that state at an earlier time. The solution to this equation is given by a matrix exponential, which can be used to calculate the probability of being in a particular state at any given time.

In the case of a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) on a state space {1,2}, the general Q matrix is given by

$$
Q = \begin{pmatrix}
\alpha & \beta \\
\gamma & \delta
\end{pmatrix}
$$

where $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $\delta$ are positive constants. The forward equation for this CTMC is given by

$$
\frac{d}{dt} P(t) = QP(t)
$$

where $P(t)$ is the matrix of probabilities. The solution to this equation is given by the matrix exponential

$$
P(t) = e^{Qt}
$$

However, direct solutions can be complicated to compute for larger matrices. The fact that $Q$ is the generator for a semigroup of matrices is used to solve these equations.

##### Stationary Distribution

The stationary distribution for an irreducible recurrent CTMC is the probability distribution to which the process converges for large values of $t$. This distribution is important because it provides insight into the long-term behavior of the Markov process.

In the case of a two-state process, the stationary distribution is given by

$$
\pi = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\beta}{\alpha + \beta} \\
\frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

As $t \to \infty$, the distribution $P(t)$ converges to $\pi$. This property is important because it allows us to predict the long-term behavior of a Markov process.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical foundations of Markov processes, and explore their applications in various fields. We will also discuss the different types of Markov processes, including discrete-time Markov chains and continuous-time Markov chains.

#### 1.1c Applications of Markov Processes

Markov processes have a wide range of applications in various fields, including physics, biology, economics, and computer science. In this section, we will explore some of these applications, focusing on their use in modeling and predicting the behavior of systems.

##### Physics

In physics, Markov processes are used to model the behavior of systems that exhibit randomness. For example, they are used to model the movement of particles in a fluid, the behavior of quantum systems, and the evolution of the universe. The Markov property, which states that the future state of the system depends only on its current state, is particularly useful in these applications.

##### Biology

In biology, Markov processes are used to model the behavior of biological systems, such as the spread of diseases, the evolution of species, and the behavior of neural networks. The communicating classes of a Markov process are particularly useful in these applications, as they allow us to divide a complex system into smaller, more manageable subsystems.

##### Economics

In economics, Markov processes are used to model the behavior of economic systems, such as stock prices, interest rates, and economic growth. The transient and recurrence properties of Markov processes are particularly useful in these applications, as they provide insight into the long-term behavior of these systems.

##### Computer Science

In computer science, Markov processes are used to model the behavior of algorithms, such as random walks and graph traversals. The Markov property is particularly useful in these applications, as it allows us to simplify complex algorithms and make predictions about their behavior.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical foundations of Markov processes, and explore their applications in various fields. We will also discuss the different types of Markov processes, including discrete-time Markov chains and continuous-time Markov chains.

#### 1.1b Properties of Markov Processes

Markov processes have several important properties that make them a powerful tool in the study of stochastic processes. These properties include:

1. The Markov property: As mentioned earlier, the Markov property is the defining characteristic of Markov processes. It states that the future state of the system depends only on its current state, and not on its past states.

2. Stationarity: A Markov process is said to be stationary if its statistical properties do not change over time. In other words, the process is time-invariant. This property is useful in many applications, as it allows us to make predictions about the future state of the system based on its current state.

3. Ergodicity: An ergodic Markov process is one where the statistical properties of the process are the same as the statistical properties of a single realization of the process. In other words, the process is deterministic in the long run. This property is useful in many applications, as it allows us to make long-term predictions about the behavior of the system.

4. Communication: A Markov process is said to be communicating if it is possible to transition from any state to any other state in a finite number of steps. This property is useful in many applications, as it allows us to model systems where it is possible to move from one state to another.

5. Transience: A Markov process is said to be transient if there exists a state from which it is impossible to return to. This property is useful in many applications, as it allows us to model systems where it is possible to get stuck in a certain state.

6. Recurrence: A Markov process is said to be recurrent if it is possible to return to any state from any other state in a finite number of steps. This property is useful in many applications, as it allows us to model systems where it is possible to return to a certain state.

7. Persistence: A Markov process is said to be persistent if there exists a state from which it is possible to reach any other state in a finite number of steps. This property is useful in many applications, as it allows us to model systems where it is possible to reach any state from a certain state.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of Markov processes in various fields, including physics, biology, and economics. We will also discuss the different types of Markov processes, including discrete-time Markov chains and continuous-time Markov chains.

#### 1.1c Applications of Markov Processes

Markov processes have a wide range of applications in various fields, including physics, biology, economics, and computer science. In this section, we will explore some of these applications in more detail.

1. Physics: In physics, Markov processes are used to model the behavior of systems that are not in thermal equilibrium. For example, they can be used to model the movement of particles in a fluid, where the future state of the system depends only on its current state, and not on its past states. This is known as Brownian motion.

2. Biology: In biology, Markov processes are used to model the transitions between different states in a biological system. For example, they can be used to model the transitions between different DNA sequences, or the transitions between different states in a cell cycle.

3. Economics: In economics, Markov processes are used to model the behavior of stock prices. The Markov property allows us to make predictions about the future state of the stock price based on its current state, without having to consider its past states.

4. Computer Science: In computer science, Markov processes are used in a variety of applications, including natural language processing, machine learning, and data compression. For example, they can be used to model the behavior of a language, or to compress data by predicting future states based on current states.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical foundations of Markov processes, and explore their applications in various fields in more detail. We will also discuss the different types of Markov processes, including discrete-time Markov chains and continuous-time Markov chains.

1. The Markov property: As mentioned earlier, the Markov property is a fundamental property of Markov processes. It states that the future state of the system depends only on its current state, and not on its past states.

This property is important in the study of Markov processes, as it allows us to make predictions about the future state of the system based on its current state.

3. Communicating classes: Communicating classes are a concept in Markov processes that helps us understand the behavior of the process. A communicating class is a set of states in the process where it is possible to transition from one state to another. This property is important in understanding the structure of the process and predicting its behavior.

4. Transience, recurrence, and positive and null recurrence: These properties describe the behavior of a Markov process over time. Transience refers to a process where the probability of returning to a particular state is less than 1. Recurrence refers to a process where the probability of returning to a particular state is 1. Positive recurrence refers to a process where the expected time until return to a particular state is finite. Null recurrence refers to a process where the expected time until return to a particular state is infinite.

5. Time-homogeneous process: A time-homogeneous process is a Markov process where the transition probabilities between states do not change over time. This property is important in understanding the behavior of the process over time.

In the next section, we will explore these properties in more detail and discuss their implications for the study of Markov processes.

#### 1.1c Stationary and Time-Homogeneous Processes

In the previous section, we discussed the properties of Markov processes, including the Markov property, stationarity, communicating classes, and transience, recurrence, and positive and null recurrence. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concepts of stationary and time-homogeneous processes.

A stationary process is one where the probability distribution of the process does not change over time. In other words, the process is in a state of equilibrium. This property is important in the study of Markov processes, as it allows us to make predictions about the future state of the system based on its current state.

A time-homogeneous process is a Markov process where the transition probabilities between states do not change over time. This property is important in understanding the behavior of the process over time. In a time-homogeneous process, the transition probabilities between states are constant, and the process is said to be memoryless.

Let's consider a simple example of a time-homogeneous process. Suppose we have a Markov process on the state space {1,2}. The general "Q" matrix for such a process is the following 2 × 2 matrix with "α","β" > 0:

$$
Q = \begin{pmatrix}
\alpha & \beta \\
\beta & \alpha
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The forward matrix P("t") satisfies the forward equation, a first-order differential equation where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to "t". The solution to this equation is given by a matrix exponential:

$$
P(t) = e^{Qt}
$$

However, direct solutions are complicated to compute for larger matrices. The fact that "Q" is the generator for a semigroup of matrices is used.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of a stationary distribution for an irreducible recurrent CTMC. We will see that for large values of "t", the distribution tends to a certain value, which is the stationary distribution. This distribution is important in understanding the long-term behavior of the process.




### Subsection: 1.1d Examples of Markov Processes

Markov processes are a fundamental concept in stochastic processes and have a wide range of applications in various fields. In this section, we will explore some examples of Markov processes to gain a deeper understanding of their properties and applications.

#### 1.1d.1 Random Walk

One of the most well-known examples of a Markov process is the random walk. A random walk is a process where a particle moves randomly in a one-dimensional space. The probability of moving left or right at each step is equal, and the particle's position at any given time is only dependent on its previous position. This process can be represented as a Markov chain, where the state space is the set of all possible positions of the particle, and the transition probabilities are equal for all states.

#### 1.1d.2 Brownian Motion

Brownian motion is another important example of a Markov process. It is a continuous-time process where a particle moves randomly in a two-dimensional space. The particle's position at any given time is only dependent on its previous position, and the probability of moving in any direction is equal. Brownian motion is used to model the random movement of particles in a fluid, and it is a key concept in the study of diffusion processes.

#### 1.1d.3 Hidden Markov Model

A hidden Markov model (HMM) is a type of Markov process where the state of the system is not directly observable, but can be inferred from the output of the system. HMMs have a wide range of applications, including speech recognition, natural language processing, and image processing. In an HMM, the state space represents the possible states of the system, and the output space represents the possible outputs of the system. The transition probabilities between states are determined by the system's dynamics, while the output probabilities are determined by the system's output function.

#### 1.1d.4 Markov Chain Monte Carlo

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a method for sampling from a probability distribution. It uses a Markov chain to generate a sequence of samples, where each sample is dependent only on the previous sample. This allows for efficient sampling from complex probability distributions, making it a powerful tool in statistics and machine learning.

#### 1.1d.5 Continuous-Time Markov Chain

A continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) is a type of Markov process where the state transitions occur continuously over time. CTMCs are used to model systems with continuous state spaces, such as the movement of a particle in a continuous space. The transition probabilities in a CTMC are determined by a generator matrix, which describes the rate of transition between states.

In conclusion, Markov processes have a wide range of applications and are used to model various phenomena in different fields. By studying these examples, we can gain a deeper understanding of the properties and applications of Markov processes. 





### Subsection: 1.1e Continuous-Time Markov Chains

Continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) are a type of Markov process that evolve continuously over time. They are used to model systems where the state of the system can change at any point in time, and the future state of the system is only dependent on its current state. CTMCs have a wide range of applications, including queueing theory, population genetics, and chemical reactions.

#### 1.1e.1 Definition and Properties

A continuous-time Markov chain is a stochastic process that satisfies the Markov property, where the future state of the system is only dependent on its current state. This means that the probability of transitioning from one state to another is independent of the path taken to reach the current state. In other words, the future state of the system is memoryless.

CTMCs have several important properties, including:

- Stationarity: The probability of being in a particular state at any given time is independent of the starting state.
- Communication: For any two states, there exists a path of states that connects them.
- Transience: A CTMC is said to be transient if there exists a state that can only be reached a finite number of times.
- Recurrence: A CTMC is said to be recurrent if there exists a state that can be reached an infinite number of times.
- Positive and null recurrence: A CTMC is said to be positive recurrent if there exists a state that can be reached an infinite number of times with a positive probability. It is said to be null recurrent if there exists a state that can be reached an infinite number of times with a probability of 0.
- Communicating class: A communicating class is a set of states where it is possible to reach any state within the class from any other state within the class.

#### 1.1e.2 Kolmogorov Equations

The Kolmogorov equations, also known as the forward and backward equations, are used to calculate the transition probabilities of a CTMC. The forward equation is used to calculate the probability of transitioning from one state to another in a given time interval, while the backward equation is used to calculate the probability of being in a particular state at a given time, given that the system started in a different state.

The Kolmogorov equations are given by:

$$
\frac{\partial p(x,t)}{\partial t} = \sum_{y} q(x,y)p(y,t) - \delta(x,t)p(x,t)
$$

$$
\frac{\partial p(x,t)}{\partial t} = \sum_{y} q(y,x)p(x,t) - \delta(x,t)p(x,t)
$$

where $p(x,t)$ is the probability of being in state $x$ at time $t$, $q(x,y)$ is the transition probability from state $x$ to state $y$, and $\delta(x,t)$ is the Kronecker delta function.

#### 1.1e.3 Applications of Continuous-Time Markov Chains

CTMCs have a wide range of applications in various fields. In queueing theory, they are used to model the behavior of queues, such as the M/M/s queue. In population genetics, they are used to model the evolution of a population over time. In chemical reactions, they are used to model the rates of chemical reactions.

In the next section, we will explore some examples of continuous-time Markov chains to gain a deeper understanding of their properties and applications.





### Subsection: 1.2a Probability Distributions

Probability distributions are mathematical functions that describe the likelihood of different outcomes in a random variable. They are essential in statistical mechanics as they allow us to quantify the probability of different events occurring in a system. In this section, we will discuss the concept of probability distributions and their role in statistical mechanics.

#### 1.2a.1 Definition and Properties

A probability distribution is a function that assigns probabilities to different outcomes in a random variable. It is denoted by $P(x)$, where $x$ is the outcome of the random variable. The probability distribution must satisfy the following properties:

- Non-negativity: For all values of $x$, $P(x) \geq 0$.
- Normalization: The total probability of all possible outcomes must be equal to 1, i.e. $\sum_{x} P(x) = 1$.
- Additivity: If $A$ and $B$ are two mutually exclusive events, then the probability of either $A$ or $B$ occurring is equal to the sum of their individual probabilities, i.e. $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$.

#### 1.2a.2 Types of Probability Distributions

There are various types of probability distributions, each with its own unique properties and applications. Some of the most commonly used types of probability distributions in statistical mechanics include:

- Bernoulli distribution: This distribution is used to model binary outcomes, where the probability of either outcome is constant.
- Binomial distribution: This distribution is used to model the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials.
- Normal distribution: This distribution is used to model continuous variables with a bell-shaped curve.
- Poisson distribution: This distribution is used to model the number of occurrences of an event in a fixed interval of time or space.

#### 1.2a.3 Probability Density Functions

In addition to probability distributions, we also have probability density functions (PDFs) and probability mass functions (PMFs). These functions are used to describe the probability of different outcomes in a random variable. The PDF is used for continuous variables, while the PMF is used for discrete variables.

The PDF is defined as $f(x) = \frac{dP(x)}{dx}$, where $P(x)$ is the probability distribution function. The PMF is defined as $p(x) = P(X = x)$, where $X$ is a discrete random variable.

#### 1.2a.4 Transitions and Probability Distributions

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of transitions in Markov processes. These transitions are governed by probability distributions, which describe the likelihood of moving from one state to another. In the case of a Markov process, the transition probability distribution is determined by the transition matrix $M$.

The transition probability distribution is defined as $P(x_j|x_i) = \frac{M_{ij}}{\sum_{j} M_{ij}}$, where $x_i$ and $x_j$ are two states in the Markov process. This distribution satisfies the properties of a probability distribution, as discussed earlier.

#### 1.2a.5 Applications of Probability Distributions

Probability distributions have a wide range of applications in statistical mechanics. They are used to model and analyze various physical phenomena, such as the behavior of particles in a gas, the movement of a Brownian particle, and the distribution of energy levels in a system.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of Brownian motion, a fundamental concept in statistical mechanics that is governed by a probability distribution.





### Subsection: 1.2b Transition Probabilities

In the previous section, we discussed probability distributions and their properties. In this section, we will focus on transition probabilities, which are an essential concept in stochastic processes and Markov chains.

#### 1.2b.1 Definition and Properties

A transition probability is the probability of moving from one state to another in a single step. It is denoted by $p_{ij}$, where $i$ and $j$ are the initial and final states, respectively. The transition probabilities must satisfy the following properties:

- Non-negativity: For all values of $i$ and $j$, $p_{ij} \geq 0$.
- Normalization: The sum of transition probabilities from state $i$ to all other states must be equal to 1, i.e. $\sum_{j \neq i} p_{ij} = 1$.
- Markov property: The transition probability from state $i$ to state $j$ only depends on the current state $i$, and not on the previous states.

#### 1.2b.2 Transition Matrix

The transition probabilities can be organized into a matrix, known as the transition matrix $P$. The element $p_{ij}$ in row $i$ and column $j$ of the matrix represents the transition probability from state $i$ to state $j$.

### Subsection: 1.2c Conditional Probabilities

Conditional probabilities are a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. They are used to describe the probability of an event occurring under the condition that another event has already occurred. In the context of stochastic processes and Markov chains, conditional probabilities play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of the system.

#### 1.2c.1 Definition and Properties

A conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring under the condition that another event has already occurred. It is denoted by $p(A|B)$, where $A$ and $B$ are events. The conditional probability must satisfy the following properties:

- Non-negativity: For all values of $A$ and $B$, $p(A|B) \geq 0$.
- Normalization: If $B$ is certain to occur, i.e., $p(B) = 1$, then $p(A|B) = p(A)$.
- Chain rule: If $A$, $B$, and $C$ are events, then $p(A|B) = p(A|C)p(C|B)$.
- Bayes' theorem: If $A$ and $B$ are events, then $p(A|B) = \frac{p(B|A)p(A)}{p(B)}$.

#### 1.2c.2 Conditional Expectation

The conditional expectation of a random variable $X$ given an event $B$ is the expected value of $X$ under the condition that $B$ has occurred. It is denoted by $E[X|B]$. The conditional expectation satisfies the following properties:

- Linearity: For any random variables $X$ and $Y$, and any constants $a$ and $b$, $E[aX + bY|B] = aE[X|B] + bE[Y|B]$.
- Conditional expectation is a function of the conditioning event: For any random variable $X$ and event $B$, $E[X|B] = g(B)$, where $g$ is a function of $B$.
- Conditional expectation is a martingale: For any events $A$ and $B$, $E[E[X|B]|A] = E[X|A]$.

#### 1.2c.3 Conditional Variance

The conditional variance of a random variable $X$ given an event $B$ is the variance of $X$ under the condition that $B$ has occurred. It is denoted by $Var[X|B]$. The conditional variance satisfies the following properties:

- Conditional variance is a function of the conditioning event: For any random variable $X$ and event $B$, $Var[X|B] = h(B)$, where $h$ is a function of $B$.
- Conditional variance is a martingale: For any events $A$ and $B$, $E[Var[X|B]|A] = Var[X|A]$.

#### 1.2c.4 Conditional Probability Density Function

The conditional probability density function (PDF) of a random variable $X$ given an event $B$ is the PDF of $X$ under the condition that $B$ has occurred. It is denoted by $f_X(x|B)$. The conditional PDF satisfies the following properties:

- Non-negativity: For all values of $x$ and $B$, $f_X(x|B) \geq 0$.
- Normalization: If $B$ is certain to occur, i.e., $p(B) = 1$, then $f_X(x|B) = f_X(x)$.
- Chain rule: If $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are random variables, and $B$ is the event that $X = x$, $Y = y$, and $Z = z$, then $f_X(x|B) = f_X(x|Y=y, Z=z)f_Y(y|B)f_Z(z|B)$.
- Bayes' theorem: If $X$ and $B$ are random variables, and $B$ is the event that $X = x$, then $f_X(x|B) = \frac{f_B(b|X=x)f_X(x)}{f_B(b)}$.

- Normalization: If $B$ is certain to occur, i.e., $p(B) = 1$, then $F_X(x|B) = F_X(x)$.
- Chain rule: If $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are random variables, and $B$ is the event that $X = x$, $Y = y$, and $Z = z$, then $F_X(x|B) = F_X(x|Y=y, Z=z)F_Y(y|B)F_Z(z|B)$.
- Bayes' theorem: If $X$ and $B$ are random variables, and $B$ is the event that $X = x$, then $F_X(x|B) = \frac{F_B(b|X=x)F_X(x)}{F_B(b)}$.




### Subsection: 1.2d Chapman-Kolmogorov Equation for Discrete-Time Processes

The Chapman-Kolmogorov equation is a fundamental result in the theory of Markov chains. It provides a method to calculate the transition probabilities of a Markov chain at any time in the future, given the transition probabilities at the present time. This equation is named after the British mathematician Ronald Aylmer Fisher, the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov, and the British statistician and computer scientist Alan V. Sloan.

#### 1.2d.1 Definition and Properties

The Chapman-Kolmogorov equation is a recursive equation that describes the evolution of the transition probabilities of a Markov chain. It is defined as follows:

$$
p_{ij}(n+1) = \sum_{k=1}^{S} p_{ik}(n) p_{kj}(1)
$$

where $p_{ij}(n)$ is the transition probability from state $i$ to state $j$ in $n$ steps, and $p_{kj}(1)$ is the one-step transition probability from state $k$ to state $j$. The equation states that the transition probability from state $i$ to state $j$ in $n+1$ steps is equal to the sum of the transition probabilities from state $i$ to all possible intermediate states $k$ in $n$ steps, multiplied by the one-step transition probability from state $k$ to state $j$.

The Chapman-Kolmogorov equation has several important properties:

- It is a recursive equation, meaning that it can be used to calculate the transition probabilities at any time in the future, given the transition probabilities at the present time.
- It is a Markov chain, meaning that the future state of the system depends only on its current state, and not on its past states.
- It is a continuous-time Markov chain, meaning that the system can change state at any time, and the time between state changes is exponentially distributed.

#### 1.2d.2 Applications in Stochastic Processes

The Chapman-Kolmogorov equation has many applications in the study of stochastic processes. It is used to model the behavior of systems that change state over time in a random manner, such as the movement of particles in a fluid, the switching of a computer between different tasks, or the evolution of a population of organisms.

In the context of Brownian motion, the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation can be used to calculate the transition probabilities of the Brownian motion process at any time in the future, given the transition probabilities at the present time. This is particularly useful in the study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, where Brownian motion plays a crucial role in the transport of particles and energy.

### Subsection: 1.2e Forward and Backward Equations

The forward and backward equations are two fundamental concepts in the study of stochastic processes. They provide a mathematical framework for understanding the evolution of a system over time, and are particularly useful in the study of Markov chains.

#### 1.2e.1 Definition and Properties

The forward equation is a differential equation that describes the evolution of the probability density function of a stochastic process over time. It is defined as follows:

$$
\frac{\partial p(x,t)}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}[v(x)p(x,t)] + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}[D(x)p(x,t)]
$$

where $p(x,t)$ is the probability density function of the process, $v(x)$ is the drift term, and $D(x)$ is the diffusion term. The forward equation states that the rate of change of the probability density function is equal to the negative of the derivative of the drift term, plus the second derivative of the diffusion term.

The backward equation, on the other hand, is a differential equation that describes the evolution of the probability density function of a stochastic process in the reverse direction. It is defined as follows:

$$
\frac{\partial p(x,t)}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}[v(x)p(x,t)] - \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}[D(x)p(x,t)]
$$

where $p(x,t)$ is the probability density function of the process, $v(x)$ is the drift term, and $D(x)$ is the diffusion term. The backward equation states that the rate of change of the probability density function is equal to the negative of the derivative of the drift term, minus the second derivative of the diffusion term.

Both the forward and backward equations are used to model the behavior of systems that change state over time, and are particularly useful in the study of Markov chains. They provide a mathematical framework for understanding the evolution of a system over time, and are particularly useful in the study of stochastic processes.

#### 1.2e.2 Applications in Stochastic Processes

The forward and backward equations have many applications in the study of stochastic processes. They are used to model the behavior of systems that change state over time, and are particularly useful in the study of Markov chains.

The forward equation is used to model the evolution of a system over time, while the backward equation is used to model the evolution of a system in the reverse direction. Both equations are used to study the behavior of systems that change state over time, and are particularly useful in the study of Markov chains.

In the context of Markov chains, the forward and backward equations are used to calculate the transition probabilities between different states. The forward equation is used to calculate the transition probabilities from one state to another, while the backward equation is used to calculate the transition probabilities from another state to the first state.

The forward and backward equations are also used in the study of Brownian motion, a fundamental concept in the study of stochastic processes. Brownian motion is a random walk that is used to model the behavior of a system that changes state over time. The forward and backward equations are used to calculate the transition probabilities between different states in a Brownian motion.

In conclusion, the forward and backward equations are two fundamental concepts in the study of stochastic processes. They provide a mathematical framework for understanding the evolution of a system over time, and are particularly useful in the study of Markov chains and Brownian motion.

#### 1.3a.1 Definition

The transition probability matrix, denoted as $P$, is a square matrix of size $n \times n$, where $n$ is the number of states in the Markov chain.

In other words, $p_{ij}$ is the probability of moving from state $i$ to state $j$ in one step.

4. The transition probability matrix is a positive matrix, meaning that all of its elements are non-negative. This property ensures that the Markov chain is aperiodic, meaning that it does not repeat its pattern after a certain number of steps.

5. The transition probability matrix is a diagonalizable matrix, meaning that it can be written as the product of a diagonal matrix and its inverse. This property is useful in calculating the long-term behavior of the Markov chain.

In the next section, we will explore how the transition probability matrix is used to calculate the probability of future states given the current state.

### Subsection: 1.3c Ergodicity and Detailed Balance

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of the stationary distribution in Markov chains. In this section, we will explore the concepts of ergodicity and detailed balance, which are closely related to the stationary distribution.

#### 1.3c.1 Ergodicity

Ergodicity is a fundamental concept in the study of dynamical systems, including Markov chains. It refers to the property of a system where the long-term behavior of the system is independent of the initial conditions. In other words, the system is said to be ergodic if the stationary distribution is the only invariant measure of the system.

In the context of Markov chains, ergodicity ensures that the system will eventually reach the stationary distribution from any initial state. This property is crucial in understanding the long-term behavior of the system.

#### 1.3c.2 Detailed Balance

Detailed balance is a condition that ensures the ergodicity of a Markov chain. It states that for every pair of states $i$ and $j$, the transition probability from $i$ to $j$ is equal to the transition probability from $j$ to $i$. In other words, the system is said to be in detailed balance if the following equation holds:

$$
p_{ij} = p_{ji}
$$

where $p_{ij}$ is the transition probability from state $i$ to state $j$.

Detailed balance ensures that the system is reversible, meaning that the system can be run in reverse without changing the overall probability distribution. This property is crucial in ensuring the ergodicity of the system.

#### 1.3c.3 Relationship between Ergodicity and Detailed Balance

Ergodicity and detailed balance are closely related. In fact, detailed balance is a necessary condition for ergodicity. If a Markov chain satisfies detailed balance, then it is also ergodic. However, the converse is not always true. Some Markov chains may be ergodic without satisfying detailed balance.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, which is closely related to the concepts of ergodicity and detailed balance.




### Subsection: 1.3d Reversible and Irreversible Processes

In the previous sections, we have discussed the concepts of ergodicity and detailed balance, which are crucial in understanding the long-term behavior of Markov chains. In this section, we will explore the concepts of reversible and irreversible processes, which are closely related to ergodicity and detailed balance.

#### 1.3d.1 Reversible Processes

A reversible process is a process that can be run in reverse without changing the overall probability distribution. In other words, the system is said to be in a reversible process if the system can be run in reverse without changing the overall probability distribution. This property is crucial in ensuring the ergodicity of the system.

In the context of Markov chains, a reversible process is a process where the transition probability from $i$ to $j$ is equal to the transition probability from $j$ to $i$. This is equivalent to the detailed balance condition, which we discussed in the previous section.

#### 1.3d.2 Irreversible Processes

An irreversible process is a process that cannot be run in reverse without changing the overall probability distribution. In other words, the system is said to be in an irreversible process if the system cannot be run in reverse without changing the overall probability distribution. This property is crucial in understanding the long-term behavior of the system.

In the context of Markov chains, an irreversible process is a process where the transition probability from $i$ to $j$ is not equal to the transition probability from $j$ to $i$. This is equivalent to the detailed balance condition not holding, which we discussed in the previous section.

#### 1.3d.3 Relationship between Reversible and Irreversible Processes

Reversible and irreversible processes are closely related. In fact, irreversible processes can be seen as a special case of reversible processes. If a Markov chain satisfies detailed balance, then it is also in a reversible process. However, if the detailed balance condition does not hold, then the process is irreversible.

Understanding the concepts of reversible and irreversible processes is crucial in understanding the long-term behavior of Markov chains. These concepts are closely related to the concepts of ergodicity and detailed balance, which we discussed in the previous sections. In the next section, we will explore the concept of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, which is a fundamental concept in statistical mechanics.

## Chapter: Statistical Mechanics: From Stochastic Processes to Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we explored the fundamental concepts of statistical mechanics, including the Boltzmann distribution and the concept of entropy. We also discussed the role of stochastic processes in statistical mechanics, and how they can be used to model and understand complex systems. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of stochastic processes and explore the concept of Markov chains.

Markov chains are a type of stochastic process that have been widely used in various fields, including physics, biology, and economics. They are a mathematical model that describes the evolution of a system over time, where the future state of the system is determined by its current state. This makes Markov chains a powerful tool for studying systems that exhibit memoryless behavior, where the future state of the system is independent of its past states.

In this chapter, we will first introduce the concept of Markov chains and discuss their properties. We will then explore how Markov chains can be used to model and analyze various systems, including physical systems, biological processes, and economic systems. We will also discuss the concept of equilibrium in Markov chains and how it relates to the concept of entropy.

Finally, we will touch upon the topic of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, which is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in equilibrium. We will discuss how Markov chains can be used to study non-equilibrium systems and how they can provide insights into the behavior of these systems.

Overall, this chapter will provide a comprehensive understanding of Markov chains and their applications in statistical mechanics. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid foundation in Markov chains and be able to apply them to various real-world problems.

### Subsection: 1.4a Introduction to Detailed Balance

Detailed balance is a fundamental concept in statistical mechanics that plays a crucial role in understanding the long-term behavior of Markov chains. It is closely related to the concepts of reversible and irreversible processes, which we discussed in the previous section.

#### 1.4a.1 Definition of Detailed Balance

Detailed balance is a condition that is satisfied when the transition probability from $i$ to $j$ is equal to the transition probability from $j$ to $i$. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
p_{ij} = p_{ji}
$$

where $p_{ij}$ is the transition probability from state $i$ to state $j$.

#### 1.4a.2 Detailed Balance and Reversible Processes

As we saw in the previous section, a reversible process is a process where the transition probability from $i$ to $j$ is equal to the transition probability from $j$ to $i$. This is equivalent to the detailed balance condition. In other words, a reversible process is a process that satisfies detailed balance.

#### 1.4a.3 Detailed Balance and Irreversible Processes

On the other hand, an irreversible process is a process where the transition probability from $i$ to $j$ is not equal to the transition probability from $j$ to $i$. This is equivalent to the detailed balance condition not holding. In other words, an irreversible process is a process that does not satisfy detailed balance.

#### 1.4a.4 Detailed Balance and Markov Chains

Detailed balance is a crucial concept in understanding the long-term behavior of Markov chains. In fact, it is one of the key conditions that ensures the ergodicity of the system. If a Markov chain satisfies detailed balance, then it is also in a reversible process. This means that the system can be run in reverse without changing the overall probability distribution.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of detailed balance in more detail and discuss its applications in various fields.




#### 1.4b Detailed Balance Condition

The detailed balance condition is a fundamental concept in statistical mechanics that is closely related to the concepts of reversible and irreversible processes. It is a condition that is satisfied when the transition probability from one state to another is equal to the transition probability from the other state to the first. This condition is crucial in understanding the long-term behavior of Markov chains and is one of the key conditions that ensures the ergodicity of the system.

#### 1.4b.1 Definition of Detailed Balance Condition

The detailed balance condition can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
p_{ij} = p_{ji}
$$

where $p_{ij}$ is the transition probability from state $i$ to state $j$. This condition states that the transition probability from $i$ to $j$ is equal to the transition probability from $j$ to $i$.

#### 1.4b.2 Detailed Balance Condition and Reversible Processes

As we saw in the previous section, a reversible process is a process where the transition probability from $i$ to $j$ is equal to the transition probability from $j$ to $i$. This is equivalent to the detailed balance condition. In other words, a reversible process is a process that satisfies the detailed balance condition.

#### 1.4b.3 Detailed Balance Condition and Irreversible Processes

On the other hand, an irreversible process is a process where the transition probability from $i$ to $j$ is not equal to the transition probability from $j$ to $i$. This is equivalent to the detailed balance condition not holding. In other words, an irreversible process is a process that does not satisfy the detailed balance condition.

#### 1.4b.4 Detailed Balance Condition and Markov Chains

The detailed balance condition is a crucial concept in understanding the long-term behavior of Markov chains. In fact, it is one of the key conditions that ensures the ergodicity of the system. If a Markov chain satisfies the detailed balance condition, then it is also in a reversible process. This means that the system can be run in reverse without changing the overall probability distribution. This property is known as time-reversibility and is a fundamental concept in statistical mechanics.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of the detailed balance condition in more detail and discuss its applications in various fields.

#### 1.4b.5 Detailed Balance Condition and Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics

The detailed balance condition is not only crucial in understanding the long-term behavior of Markov chains, but it also plays a significant role in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. In these systems, the detailed balance condition is not satisfied, and the system exhibits a directional flow of energy.

The detailed balance condition can be expressed in terms of the entropy production rate, which is a key concept in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The entropy production rate, denoted by $\dot{S}$, is given by:

$$
\dot{S} = \sum_{i,j} p_{ij} \ln \frac{p_{ij}}{p_{ji}}
$$

where $p_{ij}$ and $p_{ji}$ are the transition probabilities from state $i$ to state $j$ and from state $j$ to state $i$, respectively. The detailed balance condition can then be written as $\dot{S} = 0$, which states that the entropy production rate is zero. This condition is satisfied in equilibrium systems, where the system is in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium and the transition probabilities from one state to another are equal.

In non-equilibrium systems, the detailed balance condition is not satisfied, and the entropy production rate is non-zero. This means that the system is not in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium and exhibits a directional flow of energy. The detailed balance condition and the concept of entropy production rate are crucial in understanding the behavior of non-equilibrium systems and are fundamental concepts in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of the detailed balance condition and the concept of entropy production rate in more detail and discuss their applications in various fields.




#### 1.4c Equilibrium and Non-equilibrium Systems

In the previous sections, we have discussed the detailed balance condition and its relationship with reversible and irreversible processes. Now, let's explore the concept of equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems in the context of stochastic processes and Brownian motion.

#### 1.4c.1 Equilibrium Systems

An equilibrium system is a system that has reached a steady state, where the probabilities of being in different states do not change over time. In other words, the system has reached a state of balance, where the rates of forward and backward transitions are equal. This is equivalent to saying that the system satisfies the detailed balance condition.

Mathematically, an equilibrium system can be represented as:

$$
p_{ij} = p_{ji}
$$

where $p_{ij}$ is the transition probability from state $i$ to state $j$. This condition states that the transition probability from $i$ to $j$ is equal to the transition probability from $j$ to $i$.

#### 1.4c.2 Non-equilibrium Systems

On the other hand, a non-equilibrium system is a system that is not in a steady state. This means that the probabilities of being in different states change over time, and the rates of forward and backward transitions are not equal. This is equivalent to saying that the system does not satisfy the detailed balance condition.

Mathematically, a non-equilibrium system can be represented as:

$$
p_{ij} \neq p_{ji}
$$

where $p_{ij}$ is the transition probability from state $i$ to state $j$. This condition states that the transition probability from $i$ to $j$ is not equal to the transition probability from $j$ to $i$.

#### 1.4c.3 Equilibrium and Non-equilibrium in Stochastic Processes

In the context of stochastic processes, an equilibrium system is a system where the transition probabilities from one state to another are equal in both directions. This means that the system is in a steady state, and the probabilities of being in different states do not change over time.

On the other hand, a non-equilibrium system is a system where the transition probabilities from one state to another are not equal in both directions. This means that the system is not in a steady state, and the probabilities of being in different states change over time.

#### 1.4c.4 Equilibrium and Non-equilibrium in Brownian Motion

In the context of Brownian motion, an equilibrium system is a system where the transition probabilities from one state to another are equal in both directions. This means that the system is in a steady state, and the probabilities of being in different states do not change over time.

On the other hand, a non-equilibrium system is a system where the transition probabilities from one state to another are not equal in both directions. This means that the system is not in a steady state, and the probabilities of being in different states change over time.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and its applications in understanding the behavior of non-equilibrium systems.

In the previous sections, we have discussed the concept of detailed balance in the context of stochastic processes and Brownian motion. Now, let's explore how this concept applies to chemical kinetics.

#### 1.4d.1 Detailed Balance in Chemical Reactions

Chemical reactions can be represented as a series of elementary steps, each of which involves the transformation of reactants into products. The rate of these reactions is governed by the law of mass action, which states that the rate of a chemical reaction is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants, each raised to a power equal to its stoichiometric coefficient in the balanced chemical equation.

The detailed balance condition can be applied to these reactions by considering the transition probabilities between the different states represented by the reactants and products. If these transition probabilities are equal in both directions, the system is in a state of equilibrium, and the rates of the forward and backward reactions are equal. This is equivalent to saying that the system satisfies the detailed balance condition.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$
p_{ij} = p_{ji}
$$

where $p_{ij}$ is the transition probability from state $i$ (representing the reactants) to state $j$ (representing the products). This condition states that the transition probability from $i$ to $j$ is equal to the transition probability from $j$ to $i$.

#### 1.4d.2 Non-equilibrium in Chemical Reactions

On the other hand, if the transition probabilities between the different states are not equal, the system is not in a state of equilibrium, and the rates of the forward and backward reactions are not equal. This is equivalent to saying that the system does not satisfy the detailed balance condition.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$
p_{ij} \neq p_{ji}
$$

where $p_{ij}$ is the transition probability from state $i$ (representing the reactants) to state $j$ (representing the products). This condition states that the transition probability from $i$ to $j$ is not equal to the transition probability from $j$ to $i$.

#### 1.4d.3 Detailed Balance and Chemical Equilibrium

The concept of detailed balance is closely related to the concept of chemical equilibrium. In chemical equilibrium, the rates of the forward and backward reactions are equal, and the system is in a state of balance. This is equivalent to saying that the system satisfies the detailed balance condition.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$
p_{ij} = p_{ji}
$$

where $p_{ij}$ is the transition probability from state $i$ (representing the reactants) to state $j$ (representing the products). This condition states that the transition probability from $i$ to $j$ is equal to the transition probability from $j$ to $i$.

In the next section, we will explore how the concept of detailed balance can be applied to non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of stochastic processes and how they are used to model random phenomena. We also discussed the importance of understanding these processes in the context of statistical mechanics. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the world of statistical mechanics by exploring master equations.

Master equations are mathematical equations that describe the evolution of a system over time. They are used to model a wide range of physical phenomena, from the behavior of particles in a gas to the dynamics of biological systems. In the context of statistical mechanics, master equations are particularly useful as they allow us to study the behavior of a system at the microscopic level, providing insights into the macroscopic properties of the system.

In this chapter, we will begin by discussing the basics of master equations, including their definition and the different types of master equations. We will then explore the applications of master equations in various fields, including physics, biology, and economics. We will also discuss the limitations and challenges of using master equations, and how these can be addressed.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of master equations and their role in statistical mechanics. They will also have gained insights into the power and versatility of master equations in modeling and understanding complex systems. So let us embark on this journey of exploring master equations and their applications.




### Section: 2.1 Motivation and Derivation:

The master equation is a fundamental concept in statistical mechanics, providing a mathematical framework for understanding the evolution of a system over time. It is particularly useful in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, where the system is not in a state of thermal equilibrium and the traditional laws of thermodynamics may not apply.

#### 2.1a Introduction to Master Equations

The master equation is a differential equation that describes the change in probability of a system over time. It is based on the principle of conservation of probability, which states that the total probability of all possible states of a system must remain constant over time. This principle is fundamental to the understanding of stochastic processes and non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

The master equation is derived from the Kolmogorov forward equation, which describes the evolution of a probability distribution over time. The Kolmogorov forward equation is a partial differential equation, but in the case of a discrete system, it can be reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations known as the master equation.

The master equation is particularly useful in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, where the system is not in a state of thermal equilibrium and the traditional laws of thermodynamics may not apply. In these cases, the master equation can provide insights into the behavior of the system and help us understand the underlying physical processes.

The master equation is also closely related to the concept of stochastic processes. A stochastic process is a mathematical model that describes the evolution of a system over time in a probabilistic manner. The master equation can be seen as a special case of a stochastic process, where the system is described by a finite set of states and the transition probabilities between these states are given by the master equation.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the derivation of the master equation and its applications in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. We will also explore the concept of stochastic processes and how they relate to the master equation.

#### 2.1b Derivation of Master Equations

The master equation is derived from the Kolmogorov forward equation, which describes the evolution of a probability distribution over time. The Kolmogorov forward equation is a partial differential equation, but in the case of a discrete system, it can be reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations known as the master equation.

The Kolmogorov forward equation is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial P}{\partial t} = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} \left( a_i P \right) + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} \left( b_{ij} P \right)
$$

where $P$ is the probability distribution, $x_i$ are the state variables, $a_i$ are the drift terms, and $b_{ij}$ are the diffusion terms.

In the case of a discrete system, the Kolmogorov forward equation can be simplified to a set of ordinary differential equations known as the master equation. The master equation is given by:

$$
\frac{dP_i}{dt} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \left( a_{ij} P_j - a_{ji} P_i \right) + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j,k=1}^{n} \left( b_{ijk} P_k - b_{kij} P_i \right)
$$

where $P_i$ is the probability of state $i$, and $a_{ij}$, $b_{ijk}$, and $b_{kij}$ are the transition probabilities from state $j$ to state $i$, state $k$ to state $i$, and state $i$ to state $k$, respectively.

The master equation provides a mathematical description of the evolution of a system over time, and it is particularly useful in non-equilibrium thermodynamics where the system is not in a state of thermal equilibrium. In the next section, we will explore the applications of the master equation in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

#### 2.1c Applications of Master Equations

The master equation is a powerful tool in statistical mechanics, providing a mathematical framework for understanding the evolution of a system over time. It is particularly useful in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, where the system is not in a state of thermal equilibrium. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of the master equation in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

One of the key applications of the master equation is in the study of chemical reactions. The master equation can be used to model the evolution of a chemical system over time, taking into account the rates of reaction and the probabilities of transition between different states. This allows us to understand the dynamics of chemical reactions and predict their behavior over time.

Another important application of the master equation is in the study of biological systems. The master equation can be used to model the evolution of a biological system over time, taking into account the rates of growth, death, and transition between different states. This allows us to understand the dynamics of biological systems and predict their behavior over time.

The master equation is also used in the study of non-equilibrium phase transitions. In these systems, the system is not in a state of thermal equilibrium, and the traditional laws of thermodynamics may not apply. The master equation can provide insights into the behavior of these systems and help us understand the underlying physical processes.

In addition to these applications, the master equation is also used in the study of stochastic processes. A stochastic process is a mathematical model that describes the evolution of a system over time in a probabilistic manner. The master equation can be seen as a special case of a stochastic process, where the system is described by a finite set of states and the transition probabilities between these states are given by the master equation.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the applications of the master equation in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, exploring some specific examples and case studies.




#### 2.1b Derivation of Master Equation

The master equation is a fundamental equation in statistical mechanics that describes the evolution of a system over time. It is derived from the Kolmogorov forward equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes the evolution of a probability distribution over time. In the case of a discrete system, the Kolmogorov forward equation can be reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations known as the master equation.

The master equation is given by:

$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = \sum_{i} \frac{\partial}{\partial P} \left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} \right) = \sum_{i} \frac{\partial}{\partial P} \left( \sum_{j} W_{ij} P_{j} - \delta_{ij} \right) = \sum_{i} \sum_{j} \frac{\partial}{\partial P} \left( W_{ij} P_{j} \right) - \delta_{ij}
$$

where $P$ is the probability distribution, $W_{ij}$ is the transition probability from state $i$ to state $j$, and $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta function.

The master equation can be further simplified by introducing the transition matrix $M$, where $M_{ij} = W_{ij} P_{j}$. The master equation then becomes:

$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = \sum_{i} \sum_{j} \frac{\partial}{\partial P} \left( M_{ij} P_{j} \right) - \delta_{ij}
$$

This equation describes the change in probability distribution over time due to transitions between different states. The first term on the right-hand side represents the increase in probability due to transitions to state $i$, while the second term represents the decrease in probability due to transitions from state $i$.

The master equation is a powerful tool in statistical mechanics, providing a mathematical framework for understanding the evolution of a system over time. It is particularly useful in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, where the system is not in a state of thermal equilibrium and the traditional laws of thermodynamics may not apply. In these cases, the master equation can provide insights into the behavior of the system and help us understand the underlying physical processes.

#### 2.1c Applications of Master Equations

The master equation is a versatile tool in statistical mechanics, with applications ranging from simple physical systems to complex biological processes. In this section, we will explore some of these applications, focusing on the use of master equations in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

##### Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in a state of thermal equilibrium. These systems are often driven by external forces, such as a heat source or a chemical reaction, and their behavior can be described using the master equation.

One of the key concepts in non-equilibrium thermodynamics is the concept of entropy production. The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of a closed system can only increase over time. In non-equilibrium systems, this increase in entropy is often due to irreversible processes, such as heat conduction or chemical reactions.

The master equation can be used to calculate the entropy production in a non-equilibrium system. This is done by considering the transition matrix $M$ as a matrix of transition rates, where $M_{ij} = \Gamma_{ij} P_{j}$, and $\Gamma_{ij}$ is the transition rate from state $i$ to state $j$. The entropy production is then given by:

$$
\frac{dS}{dt} = \sum_{i} \sum_{j} \Gamma_{ij} P_{j} \ln \left( \frac{\Gamma_{ij} P_{j}}{\Gamma_{ji} P_{i}} \right)
$$

where $S$ is the entropy, and $P_{i}$ and $P_{j}$ are the probabilities of states $i$ and $j$, respectively.

##### Biological Processes

Master equations are also used in the study of biological processes, such as gene expression and protein folding. These processes are often stochastic, with the probability of a particular outcome depending on the current state of the system.

For example, consider a gene expression process with two states, "on" and "off". The transition rates from "off" to "on" and from "on" to "off" are given by $\Gamma_{off \rightarrow on}$ and $\Gamma_{on \rightarrow off}$, respectively. The master equation for this system is:

$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = \Gamma_{off \rightarrow on} P_{off} - \Gamma_{on \rightarrow off} P_{on}
$$

where $P_{off}$ and $P_{on}$ are the probabilities of the "off" and "on" states, respectively.

This equation can be used to calculate the probability of the system being in the "on" state at a given time, and to study the effects of different transition rates on the behavior of the system.

In conclusion, the master equation is a powerful tool in statistical mechanics, with applications ranging from non-equilibrium thermodynamics to biological processes. Its ability to describe the evolution of a system over time makes it an essential tool in the study of complex systems.




#### 2.1c Fokker-Planck Equation from Master Equation

The Fokker-Planck equation is a partial differential equation that describes the evolution of a probability distribution in space and time. It is a fundamental equation in statistical mechanics, particularly in the study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The Fokker-Planck equation is derived from the master equation, which we have previously discussed.

The Fokker-Planck equation is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial P}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \mu(x,t) P(x,t) \right) + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \left( D(x,t) P(x,t) \right)
$$

where $P(x,t)$ is the probability distribution, $\mu(x,t)$ is the drift term, and $D(x,t)$ is the diffusion coefficient. The drift term represents the average change in position of a particle over time, while the diffusion coefficient represents the random fluctuations in position due to collisions with other particles.

The Fokker-Planck equation can be derived from the master equation by considering a one-dimensional system with a continuous state space. The master equation in this case becomes:

$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \mu(x,t) P(x,t) \right) - \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( D(x,t) \frac{\partial P(x,t)}{\partial x} \right)
$$

where $P(x,t)$ is the probability distribution, $\mu(x,t)$ is the drift term, and $D(x,t)$ is the diffusion coefficient. The first term on the right-hand side represents the increase in probability due to the drift term, while the second term represents the decrease in probability due to the diffusion term.

The Fokker-Planck equation is a powerful tool in statistical mechanics, providing a mathematical framework for understanding the evolution of a system over time. It is particularly useful in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, where the system is not in a state of thermal equilibrium and the traditional laws of thermodynamics may not apply. In these cases, the Fokker-Planck equation can provide insights into the behavior of the system and help us understand the dynamics of non-equilibrium systems.




#### 2.1d Examples of Master Equations

In the previous sections, we have discussed the derivation of the master equation and its applications in statistical mechanics. In this section, we will explore some specific examples of master equations and their applications in various fields.

##### Example 1: Brownian Motion

Brownian motion is a fundamental stochastic process that describes the random movement of particles in a fluid. The master equation for Brownian motion is given by:

$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \mu(x,t) P(x,t) \right) - \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \left( D(x,t) P(x,t) \right)
$$

where $P(x,t)$ is the probability distribution, $\mu(x,t)$ is the drift term, and $D(x,t)$ is the diffusion coefficient. The drift term represents the average change in position of a particle over time, while the diffusion coefficient represents the random fluctuations in position due to collisions with other particles.

The master equation for Brownian motion can be used to derive the Fokker-Planck equation, which describes the evolution of the probability distribution of a Brownian particle. This equation is fundamental in the study of Brownian motion and has many applications in fields such as physics, biology, and finance.

##### Example 2: Quantum Mechanics

The master equation also has applications in quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, the master equation is used to describe the evolution of a quantum system over time. The master equation for a quantum system is given by:

$$
\frac{d\rho}{dt} = -\frac{i}{\hbar} \left[ H, \rho \right] + \sum_{k} \gamma_k \left( L_k \rho L_k^\dagger - \frac{1}{2} \left\{ L_k^\dagger L_k, \rho \right\} \right)
$$

where $\rho$ is the density matrix, $H$ is the Hamiltonian, $L_k$ are the Lindblad operators, and $\gamma_k$ are the decay rates. This equation describes the evolution of the density matrix due to the Hamiltonian and the Lindblad operators, which represent the dissipation and noise in the system.

The master equation in quantum mechanics is used to derive the Schrödinger equation, which describes the evolution of a quantum system over time. This equation is fundamental in the study of quantum mechanics and has many applications in fields such as quantum computing and quantum information theory.

##### Example 3: Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics

The master equation also has applications in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the master equation is used to describe the evolution of a system out of equilibrium. The master equation for a non-equilibrium system is given by:

$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \mu(x,t) P(x,t) \right) - \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \left( D(x,t) P(x,t) \right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \mu'(x,t) P(x,t) \right) - \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \left( D'(x,t) P(x,t) \right)
$$

where $P(x,t)$ is the probability distribution, $\mu(x,t)$ and $\mu'(x,t)$ are the drift terms, and $D(x,t)$ and $D'(x,t)$ are the diffusion coefficients. The first two terms represent the evolution of the system in equilibrium, while the last two terms represent the evolution of the system out of equilibrium.

The master equation for non-equilibrium thermodynamics can be used to derive the non-equilibrium Fokker-Planck equation, which describes the evolution of the probability distribution of a system out of equilibrium. This equation is fundamental in the study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and has many applications in fields such as biology, economics, and environmental science.

In conclusion, the master equation is a powerful tool in statistical mechanics, with applications in various fields such as Brownian motion, quantum mechanics, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Its ability to describe the evolution of a system over time makes it a fundamental concept in statistical mechanics and a key component in the study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.




#### 2.2a Introduction to Mean First Passage Time

The mean first passage time (MFPT) is a fundamental concept in the study of stochastic processes. It is defined as the average time taken by a particle to travel from one point to another in a given stochastic process. In the context of master equations, the MFPT plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of a system over time.

The MFPT is particularly useful in the study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, where it provides insights into the efficiency of energy transfer and the rate of irreversible processes. It is also a key parameter in the study of diffusion processes, where it helps to understand the rate at which particles spread out in a medium.

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of the Fokker-Planck equation and its role in estimating the mean sojourn time of a particle diffusing in a bounded domain. The Fokker-Planck equation is a partial differential equation that describes the evolution of the probability density function of a particle in a medium. It is a key tool in the study of diffusion processes and is closely related to the concept of the MFPT.

The MFPT can be calculated from the Fokker-Planck equation using the method of characteristics. This involves solving the Fokker-Planck equation along a characteristic curve, which represents the path of a particle in the medium. The MFPT is then given by the time taken for the particle to travel along this curve from the initial point to the final point.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of the MFPT and explore its applications in various fields. We will also discuss the method of characteristics in more detail and how it can be used to calculate the MFPT.

#### 2.2b Calculating Mean First Passage Time

The calculation of the mean first passage time (MFPT) involves solving the Fokker-Planck equation along a characteristic curve. This curve represents the path of a particle in the medium, and the MFPT is given by the time taken for the particle to travel along this curve from the initial point to the final point.

The Fokker-Planck equation is a partial differential equation that describes the evolution of the probability density function of a particle in a medium. It is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} p_{\varepsilon}(x,t) = D \Delta p_{\varepsilon}(x,t)-\frac{1}{\gamma}\nabla ( p_\varepsilon (x,t) F(x))
$$

where $p_{\varepsilon}(x,t)$ is the probability density function, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $\gamma$ is the damping coefficient, and $F(x)$ is the force field acting on the particle.

The MFPT, denoted as $T(x_0, x)$, is defined as the average time taken by a particle starting at position $x_0$ to reach position $x$. It can be calculated using the method of characteristics, which involves solving the Fokker-Planck equation along a characteristic curve.

The characteristic curve is given by the equation:

$$
\frac{dx}{D} = \frac{dt}{\gamma} - \frac{F(x)}{D}
$$

Solving this equation along the characteristic curve, we get the MFPT as:

$$
T(x_0, x) = \int_{x_0}^{x} \frac{1}{D} \exp\left(\frac{\gamma}{D} \int_{x_0}^{x} F(y) dy\right) dx
$$

This equation gives the MFPT as a function of the initial and final positions of the particle. It is important to note that the MFPT depends on the force field $F(x)$ acting on the particle. This means that the MFPT can be used to study the efficiency of energy transfer and the rate of irreversible processes in a system.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of the MFPT in various fields, including non-equilibrium thermodynamics and diffusion processes. We will also discuss the limitations of the MFPT and potential future research directions.

#### 2.2c Applications of Mean First Passage Time

The mean first passage time (MFPT) is a powerful tool in the study of stochastic processes and non-equilibrium thermodynamics. It has a wide range of applications, including in the study of diffusion processes, the efficiency of energy transfer, and the rate of irreversible processes. In this section, we will explore some of these applications in more detail.

##### Diffusion Processes

The MFPT is particularly useful in the study of diffusion processes. In these processes, particles diffuse through a medium, and the MFPT gives the average time taken for a particle to travel from one point to another. This can be useful in understanding the rate at which particles spread out in a medium, which is a key parameter in many physical and biological systems.

For example, in the study of heat conduction, the MFPT can be used to understand how heat diffuses through a material. Similarly, in the study of population genetics, the MFPT can be used to understand how genetic information diffuses through a population.

##### Efficiency of Energy Transfer

The MFPT also plays a crucial role in the study of the efficiency of energy transfer. In non-equilibrium thermodynamics, energy is often transferred from one system to another, and the MFPT can be used to understand the rate at which this energy transfer occurs.

For example, in the study of heat engines, the MFPT can be used to understand how quickly heat is transferred from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir. Similarly, in the study of chemical reactions, the MFPT can be used to understand how quickly energy is transferred from the reactants to the products.

##### Rate of Irreversible Processes

Finally, the MFPT is also useful in the study of the rate of irreversible processes. In these processes, the system evolves from an initial state to a final state, and the MFPT gives the average time taken for this evolution.

For example, in the study of protein folding, the MFPT can be used to understand how quickly a protein folds from its unfolded state to its folded state. Similarly, in the study of phase transitions, the MFPT can be used to understand how quickly a system transitions from one phase to another.

In conclusion, the mean first passage time is a powerful tool in the study of stochastic processes and non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Its applications are wide-ranging and include the study of diffusion processes, the efficiency of energy transfer, and the rate of irreversible processes. In the next section, we will discuss some potential future research directions for the study of the MFPT.

The Fokker-Planck equation is a partial differential equation that describes the evolution of the probability density function of a particle in a medium. It is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} p_{\varepsilon}(x,t) = D \Delta p_{\varepsilon}(x,t)-\frac{1}{\gamma}\nabla ( p_\varepsilon (x) F(x))
$$

where $p_{\varepsilon}(x,t)$ is the probability density function of the particle, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $\gamma$ is the damping coefficient, and $F(x)$ is the force acting on the particle.

The MFPT, denoted as $T$, is calculated by integrating the probability density function along the characteristic curve. This can be done using the method of characteristics, which involves solving the Fokker-Planck equation along the characteristic curve. The MFPT is then given by:

$$
T = \int_{0}^{T} p_{\varepsilon}(x,t) dt
$$

where $T$ is the time taken for the particle to travel from the initial point to the final point along the characteristic curve.

The MFPT is a crucial parameter in the study of diffusion processes. It provides insights into the efficiency of energy transfer and the rate of irreversible processes.

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of stochastic processes and their role in statistical mechanics. We explored how these processes can be used to model and understand the behavior of systems that involve randomness. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the world of stochastic processes and introduce the Fokker-Planck equations.

The Fokker-Planck equations are a set of partial differential equations that describe the evolution of a probability distribution in space and time. They are named after the Dutch mathematician Adriaan Fokker and the German physicist Max Planck, who first derived them in the early 20th century. The Fokker-Planck equations are fundamental to the study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, as they provide a mathematical framework for understanding how systems evolve over time when they are not in equilibrium.

In this chapter, we will explore the derivation of the Fokker-Planck equations and their applications in various fields.

The Fokker-Planck equations are a set of partial differential equations that describe the evolution of a probability distribution in space and time. They are named after the Dutch mathematician Adriaan Fokker and the German physicist Max Planck, who first derived them in the early 20th century. The Fokker-Planck equations are fundamental to the study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, as they provide a mathematical framework for understanding how systems evolve over time when they are not in equilibrium.

In this section, we will explore the motivation behind the Fokker-Planck equations and their role in statistical mechanics. We will also discuss the physical interpretation of these equations and how they can be used to understand the behavior of systems that involve randomness.

#### 3.1a Introduction to Fokker-Planck Equations

The Fokker-Planck equations are a set of partial differential equations that describe the evolution of a probability distribution in space and time. They are derived from the Liouville equation, which describes the evolution of a system of particles in phase space. The Fokker-Planck equations are a simplified version of the Liouville equation, which is more suitable for systems that involve randomness.

The Fokker-Planck equations are used to describe the evolution of a probability distribution in space and time. This distribution represents the probability of finding a particle at a particular position and time. The equations are based on the assumption that the system is in a state of non-equilibrium, meaning that the distribution of particles is not uniform.

The physical interpretation of the Fokker-Planck equations is that they describe the diffusion of particles in space and time. This diffusion is driven by random forces, which cause the particles to move and spread out. The Fokker-Planck equations provide a mathematical description of this diffusion process, allowing us to understand how the distribution of particles evolves over time.

In the next section, we will explore the derivation of the Fokker-Planck equations and their applications in various fields.

#### 3.1a Introduction to Fokker-Planck Equations

The Fokker-Planck equations are a set of partial differential equations that describe the evolution of a probability distribution in space and time. They are derived from the Liouville equation, which describes the evolution of a system of particles in phase space. The Fokker-Planck equations are a simplified version of the Liouville equation, which is more suitable for systems that involve randomness.

The Fokker-Planck equations are used to describe the evolution of a probability distribution in space and time. This distribution represents the probability of finding a particle at a particular position and time. The equations are based on the assumption that the system is in a state of non-equilibrium, meaning that the distribution of particles is not uniform.

The physical interpretation of the Fokker-Planck equations is that they describe the diffusion of particles in space and time. This diffusion is driven by random forces, which cause the particles to move and spread out. The Fokker-Planck equations provide a mathematical description of this diffusion process, allowing us to understand how the distribution of particles changes over time.

#### 3.1b Derivation of Fokker-Planck Equations

The Fokker-Planck equations can be derived from the Liouville equation, which describes the evolution of a system of particles in phase space. The Liouville equation is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x} \right)
$$

where $\rho$ is the probability density and $x$ is the position of a particle. The Fokker-Planck equations are derived by making the assumption that the system is in a state of non-equilibrium, meaning that the distribution of particles is not uniform. This allows us to simplify the Liouville equation to:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x} \right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x} \right)
$$

This equation can be further simplified by introducing the concept of a diffusion coefficient, $D$, which describes the rate at which particles diffuse through space. The Fokker-Planck equations can then be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x} \right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x} \right) + D\frac{\partial^2 \rho}{\partial x^2}
$$

This equation describes the evolution of the probability density over time, taking into account the diffusion of particles through space. It is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of systems that involve randomness, and is widely used in various fields such as physics, biology, and economics.

#### 3.1c Applications of Fokker-Planck Equations

The Fokker-Planck equations have a wide range of applications in various fields. In physics, they are used to describe the behavior of particles in a non-equilibrium system, such as in the study of diffusion processes. In biology, they are used to model the movement of cells and other biological particles. In economics, they are used to understand the behavior of markets and the diffusion of information.

One of the most important applications of the Fokker-Planck equations is in the study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In this field, the equations are used to understand the behavior of systems that are not in a state of thermal equilibrium, such as in chemical reactions and other irreversible processes.

In addition to their applications in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the Fokker-Planck equations also have applications in other areas of statistical mechanics. For example, they are used to study the behavior of systems with long-range correlations, such as in the study of phase transitions and critical phenomena.

Overall, the Fokker-Planck equations are a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of systems that involve randomness. Their applications are vast and continue to be explored in various fields, making them an essential concept in the study of statistical mechanics.





#### 3.1c Examples of Fokker-Planck Equations

In this subsection, we will explore some examples of Fokker-Planck equations and their applications in statistical mechanics. These examples will help us gain a deeper understanding of the Fokker-Planck equations and their role in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

##### Example 1: Brownian Motion

One of the most well-known examples of Fokker-Planck equations is in the study of Brownian motion. Brownian motion is a random walk where particles move in a random direction, with a mean displacement of zero. The Fokker-Planck equation for Brownian motion is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $p$ is the probability density, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $x$ is the position of the particle. This equation describes the evolution of the probability density of the particles as they move randomly in space.

##### Example 2: Non-equilibrium Steady State

Another important application of Fokker-Planck equations is in the study of non-equilibrium steady states. In these systems, the distribution of particles is not uniform, and the system is driven by external forces. The Fokker-Planck equation for non-equilibrium steady states is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( v p \right) + D \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $v$ is the velocity of the particles. This equation describes the evolution of the probability density of the particles as they move under the influence of external forces and random forces.

##### Example 3: Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics

Fokker-Planck equations also have applications in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In these systems, the distribution of particles is not uniform, and the system is driven by external forces and heat. The Fokker-Planck equation for non-equilibrium thermodynamics is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( v p \right) + D \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{1}{T} \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} \right)
$$

where $T$ is the temperature of the system. This equation describes the evolution of the probability density of the particles as they move under the influence of external forces, random forces, and thermal fluctuations.

These examples demonstrate the versatility of Fokker-Planck equations in describing the evolution of probability distributions in various non-equilibrium systems. By understanding these examples, we can gain a deeper understanding of the Fokker-Planck equations and their role in statistical mechanics.

## Chapter 4: Non-equilibrium Statistical Mechanics:




### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamental concepts of statistical mechanics, including stochastic processes and equilibrium thermodynamics. We have seen how these concepts provide a statistical description of physical systems, allowing us to understand the behavior of large ensembles of particles. However, many real-world systems are not in equilibrium, and their behavior cannot be fully captured by the principles of equilibrium thermodynamics. This is where non-equilibrium thermodynamics comes into play.

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of statistical mechanics that deals with systems that are not in equilibrium. These systems can be driven out of equilibrium by external forces, such as a constant energy input or a gradient in some property. The study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics is crucial for understanding a wide range of phenomena, from the operation of engines and refrigerators to the behavior of biological systems.

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. We will start by introducing the concept of non-equilibrium and discussing the principles that govern the behavior of non-equilibrium systems. We will then explore the mathematical formalism of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, including the concepts of entropy production and the second law of thermodynamics. We will also discuss the role of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in various physical and biological systems.

This chapter will provide a comprehensive introduction to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, equipping readers with the necessary tools to understand and analyze non-equilibrium systems. We will also discuss the implications of non-equilibrium thermodynamics for our understanding of the universe, and how it challenges our traditional notions of thermodynamics. So, let's embark on this exciting journey into the world of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.




### Subsection: 4.1a Nonequilibrium Steady States

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamental concepts of statistical mechanics, including stochastic processes and equilibrium thermodynamics. We have seen how these concepts provide a statistical description of physical systems, allowing us to understand the behavior of large ensembles of particles. However, many real-world systems are not in equilibrium, and their behavior cannot be fully captured by the principles of equilibrium thermodynamics. This is where non-equilibrium thermodynamics comes into play.

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of statistical mechanics that deals with systems that are not in equilibrium. These systems can be driven out of equilibrium by external forces, such as a constant energy input or a gradient in some property. The study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics is crucial for understanding a wide range of phenomena, from the operation of engines and refrigerators to the behavior of biological systems.

In this section, we will delve into the fascinating world of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. We will start by introducing the concept of non-equilibrium and discussing the principles that govern the behavior of non-equilibrium systems. We will then explore the mathematical formalism of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, including the concepts of entropy production and the second law of thermodynamics. We will also discuss the role of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in various physical and biological systems.

#### 4.1a.1 Non-equilibrium Steady States

One of the key concepts in non-equilibrium thermodynamics is the concept of non-equilibrium steady states (NESS). A NESS is a state of a non-equilibrium system where the system's properties do not change over time. In other words, the system is in a steady state, but it is not in equilibrium. This concept is crucial for understanding the behavior of many real-world systems, such as engines and refrigerators, which operate in a non-equilibrium steady state.

The mathematical description of a NESS is given by the non-equilibrium steady state condition, which states that the rate of change of the system's properties is zero. Mathematically, this can be written as:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \langle A \rangle = 0
$$

where $\langle A \rangle$ is the average value of the observable $A$ in the system. This condition ensures that the system's properties do not change over time, which is the defining characteristic of a NESS.

#### 4.1a.2 Entropy Production

Another key concept in non-equilibrium thermodynamics is the concept of entropy production. In equilibrium thermodynamics, the second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of a closed system can only increase over time. However, in non-equilibrium systems, the second law takes a more general form, which includes the concept of entropy production.

Entropy production is a measure of the irreversibility of a process. In a reversible process, the entropy remains constant. However, in a non-equilibrium system, the entropy can increase due to irreversible processes. The rate of entropy production is given by the equation:

$$
\rho T \frac{Ds}{Dt} = \nabla\cdot(\kappa\nabla T) + \frac{\mu\overset{\rightharpoonup}{v}\cdot\nabla\overset{\rightharpoonup}{v}}{T} + \frac{\zeta(\nabla\cdot\overset{\rightharpoonup}{v})^2}{T}
$$

where $\rho$ is the density, $T$ is the temperature, $s$ is the entropy, $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity, $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, $\overset{\rightharpoonup}{v}$ is the velocity vector, and $\zeta$ is the second coefficient of viscosity.

#### 4.1a.3 Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics in Various Systems

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of various physical and biological systems. For example, in engines and refrigerators, the system operates in a non-equilibrium steady state, and the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics are used to analyze the efficiency of these systems.

In biological systems, non-equilibrium thermodynamics is used to understand the behavior of cells and organisms. For example, the human body operates in a non-equilibrium steady state, and the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics are used to understand the metabolic processes that occur in the body.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical formalism of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and explore the concept of entropy production in more detail.




#### 4.1b Linear Response Theory

Linear Response Theory (LRT) is a powerful tool in non-equilibrium thermodynamics that allows us to understand the response of a system to small perturbations. It is based on the assumption that the system's response to a perturbation is linear, and that the system is in a steady state. This assumption is often valid for small perturbations, and it allows us to derive important results about the system's behavior.

##### 4.1b.1 The Linear Response Equation

The central result of Linear Response Theory is the linear response equation, which describes the response of a system to a perturbation. The equation is given by:

$$
\delta \phi = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \chi(t) \delta F(t) dt
$$

where $\delta \phi$ is the response of the system, $\chi(t)$ is the response function, and $\delta F(t)$ is the perturbation. The response function $\chi(t)$ is a measure of the system's sensitivity to perturbations, and it is often called the susceptibility.

The linear response equation can be used to calculate the response of the system to any perturbation, not just small perturbations. However, for large perturbations, the assumption of linearity may not be valid, and the equation may not provide an accurate description of the system's behavior.

##### 4.1b.2 The Response Function

The response function $\chi(t)$ is a key quantity in Linear Response Theory. It describes the system's response to a perturbation as a function of time. The response function is often complex, and it can provide valuable insights into the system's behavior.

The response function can be calculated from the system's response to a unit impulse. If the system's response to a unit impulse is $\phi(t)$, then the response function is given by:

$$
\chi(t) = \frac{d\phi(t)}{dF}
$$

where $F$ is the perturbation. This equation shows that the response function is the derivative of the system's response to the perturbation.

##### 4.1b.3 The Linear Response Equation in Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics

In non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the linear response equation takes on a slightly different form. The equation is given by:

$$
\delta \phi = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \chi(t) \delta F(t) dt + \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \chi_I(t) \delta F_I(t) dt
$$

where $\chi_I(t)$ is the response function for the system in non-equilibrium, and $\delta F_I(t)$ is the perturbation in non-equilibrium. This equation shows that the response of the system in non-equilibrium is the sum of the response to the perturbation in equilibrium, and the response to the perturbation in non-equilibrium.

The linear response equation in non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of systems that are driven out of equilibrium. It allows us to calculate the response of the system to perturbations, and to understand the system's behavior in the presence of these perturbations.

#### 4.1c Fluctuation Theorems

Fluctuation theorems are a set of mathematical results that describe the fluctuations in a system's behavior around its average. They are fundamental to the understanding of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, as they provide a way to quantify the deviations from equilibrium that are inherent in non-equilibrium systems.

##### 4.1c.1 The Fluctuation Theorem

The fluctuation theorem is a mathematical result that describes the fluctuations in a system's behavior around its average. It is given by:

$$
\langle \delta \phi^2 \rangle = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \chi(t) \delta F(t) dt \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \chi(t') \delta F(t') dt'
$$

where $\langle \delta \phi^2 \rangle$ is the average squared deviation of the system's response, $\chi(t)$ is the response function, and $\delta F(t)$ is the perturbation. This equation shows that the average squared deviation of the system's response is equal to the product of the response function and the perturbation.

##### 4.1c.2 The Fluctuation Theorem in Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics

In non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the fluctuation theorem takes on a slightly different form. The theorem is given by:

$$
\langle \delta \phi^2 \rangle = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \chi(t) \delta F(t) dt \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \chi(t') \delta F(t') dt' + \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \chi_I(t) \delta F_I(t) dt \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \chi_I(t') \delta F_I(t') dt'
$$

where $\chi_I(t)$ is the response function for the system in non-equilibrium, and $\delta F_I(t)$ is the perturbation in non-equilibrium. This equation shows that the average squared deviation of the system's response in non-equilibrium is the sum of the average squared deviation in equilibrium, and the average squared deviation in non-equilibrium.

The fluctuation theorem provides a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of non-equilibrium systems. It allows us to quantify the deviations from equilibrium, and to understand the system's behavior in the presence of these deviations.

#### 4.1d Non-equilibrium Steady States

Non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) are a fundamental concept in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. They represent a state of a system where the system's properties do not change over time, despite the system being driven out of equilibrium by external forces. This concept is crucial for understanding the behavior of many real-world systems, from engines and refrigerators to biological systems.

##### 4.1d.1 Definition of Non-equilibrium Steady States

A non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of a system is a state of the system where the system's properties do not change over time, despite the system being driven out of equilibrium by external forces. In other words, the system is in a steady state, but it is not in equilibrium. This is in contrast to an equilibrium state, where the system's properties do not change over time, and the system is in equilibrium with its environment.

##### 4.1d.2 Properties of Non-equilibrium Steady States

Non-equilibrium steady states have several important properties. These include:

1. **Stability:** A NESS is a stable state of the system. This means that if the system is perturbed from the NESS, it will tend to return to the NESS.

2. **Irreversibility:** The evolution of a system from an initial state to a NESS is irreversible. This is a direct consequence of the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time.

3. **Fluctuations:** A NESS is characterized by fluctuations in the system's properties. These fluctuations are a manifestation of the system's non-equilibrium nature.

##### 4.1d.3 Non-equilibrium Steady States in Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics

In non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the concept of a NESS is particularly important. This is because non-equilibrium thermodynamics deals with systems that are driven out of equilibrium by external forces. The study of NESS provides a framework for understanding the behavior of these systems.

The study of NESS involves the use of various mathematical tools, including the fluctuation theorem and the linear response equation. These tools allow us to quantify the deviations from equilibrium, and to understand the system's behavior in the presence of these deviations.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical tools used in the study of NESS, and we will explore how these tools can be used to understand the behavior of non-equilibrium systems.




#### 4.1c Onsager Reciprocity Relations

The Onsager Reciprocity Relations are a set of fundamental equations in non-equilibrium thermodynamics that describe the relationship between the flux and the force in a system. They were first derived by Lars Onsager in the 1930s, and they have since become a cornerstone of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

##### 4.1c.1 The Onsager Reciprocity Relations

The Onsager Reciprocity Relations are given by:

$$
J_i = \sum_j L_{ij} F_j
$$

where $J_i$ is the flux of the $i$-th component, $F_j$ is the force on the $j$-th component, and $L_{ij}$ is the Onsager coefficient. The Onsager coefficients are symmetric, i.e., $L_{ij} = L_{ji}$, and they satisfy the Onsager reciprocity relation:

$$
L_{ij} = L_{ji}
$$

This relation ensures that the system is in a steady state, i.e., the flux of the $i$-th component is equal to the flux of the $j$-th component.

##### 4.1c.2 The Onsager Coefficients

The Onsager coefficients $L_{ij}$ are a measure of the system's response to a perturbation. They describe the relationship between the flux and the force in the system, and they can provide valuable insights into the system's behavior.

The Onsager coefficients can be calculated from the system's response to a unit impulse. If the system's response to a unit impulse is $\phi(t)$, then the Onsager coefficient is given by:

$$
L_{ij} = \frac{d\phi(t)}{dF}
$$

where $F$ is the perturbation. This equation shows that the Onsager coefficient is the derivative of the system's response to the perturbation.

##### 4.1c.3 The Onsager Reciprocity Relations in Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics

The Onsager Reciprocity Relations are particularly useful in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, where the system is not in a state of thermal equilibrium. In these cases, the system's response to a perturbation can be complex and non-linear, and the Onsager Reciprocity Relations provide a powerful tool for understanding this behavior.

The Onsager Reciprocity Relations can also be used to derive the linear response equation, which describes the system's response to a small perturbation. This is done by linearizing the Onsager Reciprocity Relations around a steady state, and the resulting equation is given by:

$$
J_i = \sum_j L_{ij} F_j + O(F^2)
$$

where $O(F^2)$ denotes terms of order $F^2$ and higher. This equation is the linear response equation, and it provides a linear approximation of the system's response to a perturbation.

In conclusion, the Onsager Reciprocity Relations are a powerful tool in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, providing a deep understanding of the system's behavior and a powerful tool for deriving important results.




#### 4.1d Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem

The Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) is a fundamental principle in non-equilibrium thermodynamics that describes the relationship between the fluctuations in a system and the dissipation of energy. It was first proposed by Onsager in the 1930s, and it has since become a cornerstone of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

##### 4.1d.1 The Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem

The Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem is given by:

$$
\langle \delta x(t) \delta x(t') \rangle = \frac{k_B T}{m} \int_0^\infty \frac{\sin[(t-t')\omega]}{\omega} \coth\left(\frac{\hbar\omega}{2k_B T}\right) d\omega
$$

where $\langle \delta x(t) \delta x(t') \rangle$ is the autocorrelation function of the system, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature, $m$ is the mass of the system, and $\omega$ is the frequency. The autocorrelation function describes the correlation between the system's fluctuations at different times, and it is a measure of the system's memory.

The FDT states that the autocorrelation function of a system is proportional to the dissipation function, which describes the dissipation of energy in the system. This relationship is known as the fluctuation-dissipation relation.

##### 4.1d.2 The Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem in Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics

In non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the FDT is particularly useful. It provides a way to understand the behavior of a system that is not in a state of thermal equilibrium. In these cases, the system's response to a perturbation can be complex and non-linear, and the FDT provides a powerful tool for understanding this behavior.

The FDT can be used to calculate the autocorrelation function of a system, which can then be used to calculate the system's response to a perturbation. This is done by integrating the autocorrelation function over the frequency range of interest.

The FDT is a powerful tool in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and it has been used to study a wide range of systems, from simple mechanical systems to complex biological systems. It provides a deep understanding of the relationship between fluctuations and dissipation, and it is a fundamental concept in the field of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.




#### 4.2a Entropy Production in Continuous Systems

In the previous section, we discussed the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT), a fundamental principle in non-equilibrium thermodynamics that describes the relationship between the fluctuations in a system and the dissipation of energy. In this section, we will explore the concept of entropy production in continuous systems, which is another important aspect of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

#### 4.2a.1 Entropy Production

Entropy production is a key concept in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. It is a measure of the irreversibility of a process, and it is closely related to the concept of dissipation. In a closed system, the total entropy can only increase or remain constant. This is known as the second law of thermodynamics.

The equation for entropy production is given by:

$$
\rho T \frac{Ds}{Dt} = \nabla\cdot(\kappa\nabla T) + \frac{\mu}{2}\left( \frac{\partial v_{i}}{\partial x_{j}} + \frac{\partial v_{j}}{\partial x_{i}} - \frac{2}{3}\delta_{ij}\nabla\cdot {\bf v} \right)^{2} + \zeta(\nabla \cdot {\bf v})^{2}
$$

where $\rho$ is the density, $T$ is the temperature, $s$ is the entropy, $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity, $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$ are the components of the velocity vector, $x_{i}$ and $x_{j}$ are the spatial coordinates, $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta, and $\zeta$ is the second coefficient of viscosity.

This equation describes how entropy is produced in a continuous system due to heat conduction and viscous forces. In the case where thermal conduction and viscous forces are absent, the equation for entropy production collapses to $Ds/Dt=0$, showing that ideal fluid flow is isentropic.

#### 4.2a.2 Entropy Production in Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics

In non-equilibrium thermodynamics, entropy production is a key concept. It is a measure of the irreversibility of a process, and it is closely related to the concept of dissipation. In a closed system, the total entropy can only increase or remain constant. This is known as the second law of thermodynamics.

The equation for entropy production in non-equilibrium thermodynamics is given by:

$$
\rho T \frac{Ds}{Dt} = \nabla\cdot(\kappa\nabla T) + \frac{\mu}{2}\left( \frac{\partial v_{i}}{\partial x_{j}} + \frac{\partial v_{j}}{\partial x_{i}} - \frac{2}{3}\delta_{ij}\nabla\cdot {\bf v} \right)^{2} + \zeta(\nabla \cdot {\bf v})^{2}
$$

This equation describes how entropy is produced in a continuous system due to heat conduction and viscous forces. In the case where thermal conduction and viscic

$$

This equation describes how entropy is produced in a continuous system due to heat conduction and viscous forces. In the case where thermal conduction and viscic

#### 4.2b Entropy Production in Discrete Systems

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of entropy production in continuous systems. In this section, we will explore the concept of entropy production in discrete systems, specifically in the context of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

#### 4.2b.1 Entropy Production in Discrete Systems

In discrete systems, entropy production is a measure of the irreversibility of a process, similar to continuous systems. However, the equation for entropy production in discrete systems is slightly different. It is given by:

$$
\Delta S = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{T_i} \Delta E_i
$$

where $\Delta S$ is the change in entropy, $T_i$ is the temperature at point $i$, and $\Delta E_i$ is the change in energy at point $i$.

This equation describes how entropy is produced in a discrete system due to changes in energy at different points in the system. It is important to note that this equation assumes that the system is in a steady state, meaning that the total energy and entropy of the system do not change over time.

#### 4.2b.2 Entropy Production in Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics

In non-equilibrium thermodynamics, entropy production is a key concept. It is a measure of the irreversibility of a process, and it is closely related to the concept of dissipation. In a closed system, the total entropy can only increase or remain constant. This is known as the second law of thermodynamics.

The equation for entropy production in non-equilibrium thermodynamics is given by:

$$
\rho T \frac{Ds}{Dt} = \nabla\cdot(\kappa\nabla T) + \frac{\mu}{2}\left( \frac{\partial v_{i}}{\partial x_{j}} + \frac{\partial v_{j}}{\partial x_{i}} - \frac{2}{3}\delta_{ij}\nabla\cdot {\bf v} \right)^{2} + \zeta(\nabla \cdot {\bf v})^{2}
$$

where $\rho$ is the density, $T$ is the temperature, $s$ is the entropy, $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity, $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$ are the components of the velocity vector, $x_{i}$ and $x_{j}$ are the spatial coordinates, $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta, and $\zeta$ is the second coefficient of viscosity.

This equation describes how entropy is produced in a non-equilibrium system due to heat conduction and viscous forces. In the case where thermal conduction and viscous forces are absent, the equation for entropy production collapses to $Ds/Dt=0$, showing that ideal fluid flow is isentropic.

#### 4.2b.3 Entropy Production in Discrete Systems with Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics

In discrete systems with non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the concept of entropy production is particularly important. It allows us to understand the irreversibility of processes and the dissipation of energy in these systems. By studying the equation for entropy production in discrete systems with non-equilibrium thermodynamics, we can gain a deeper understanding of the behavior of these systems and their response to external forces.




#### 4.2c Fluctuation Theorems

The fluctuation theorem (FT) is a fundamental concept in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. It provides a generalization of the second law of thermodynamics that includes as a special case the conventional second law. The FT is also closely related to the concept of entropy production and dissipation.

#### 4.2c.1 The Fluctuation Theorem

The fluctuation theorem can be stated as follows:

$$
\frac{\langle e^{-\Delta S/kT} \rangle}{\langle e^{-\Delta S/kT} \rangle_{\text{eq}}} = e^{\Delta S/kT}
$$

where $\langle \cdots \rangle$ denotes an average over all possible trajectories, $\Delta S$ is the change in entropy, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and the subscript "eq" denotes an average over all possible trajectories at equilibrium.

This theorem implies the second law inequality, which states that the average value of $e^{-\Delta S/kT}$ over all possible trajectories is always less than or equal to 1. This inequality is a direct consequence of the FT and provides a mathematical expression of the second law of thermodynamics.

#### 4.2c.2 The Non-Equilibrium Partition Identity

The non-equilibrium partition identity is another important concept in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. It can be stated as follows:

$$
\frac{\langle e^{-\Delta S/kT} \rangle}{\langle e^{-\Delta S/kT} \rangle_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{\langle e^{-\Delta S/kT} \rangle_{\text{eq}}}{\langle e^{-\Delta S/kT} \rangle_{\text{eq}}}
$$

This identity is a direct consequence of the FT and provides a mathematical expression of the non-equilibrium partition identity. It is important to note that the left-hand side of this equation is always greater than or equal to 1, while the right-hand side is always equal to 1. This inequality is a direct consequence of the FT and provides a mathematical expression of the non-equilibrium partition identity.

#### 4.2c.3 The Green-Kubo Relations

The Green-Kubo relations are a set of equations that relate the transport coefficients of a system to the fluctuations in the system. They are derived from the FT and are closely related to the concept of entropy production and dissipation. The Green-Kubo relations are given by:

$$
\kappa = \frac{1}{3kT}\langle \delta \dot{Q} \delta \dot{Q} \rangle
$$

$$
\mu = \frac{1}{15kT}\langle \delta \dot{Q} \delta \dot{Q} \rangle
$$

$$
\zeta = \frac{1}{15kT}\langle \delta \dot{Q} \delta \dot{Q} \rangle
$$

where $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity, $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, $\zeta$ is the bulk viscosity, and $\delta \dot{Q}$ is the fluctuation in the heat flux.

These equations show how the transport coefficients of a system can be calculated from the fluctuations in the system. They are important in non-equilibrium thermodynamics as they provide a way to measure the transport coefficients of a system.

#### 4.2c.4 The Jarzynski Equality

The Jarzynski equality is a special case of the FT that deals with the statistics of work in adiabatic processes. It can be stated as follows:

$$
\langle e^{-\Delta W/kT} \rangle = e^{-\Delta F/kT}
$$

where $\Delta W$ is the change in work, $\Delta F$ is the change in free energy, and the average is taken over all possible trajectories.

This equality shows how the work done on a system can be related to the change in free energy of the system. It is important in non-equilibrium thermodynamics as it provides a way to measure the free energy of a system.

#### 4.2c.5 The Reverse Fluctuation Theorem

The reverse fluctuation theorem (RFT) is a generalization of the FT that deals with the statistics of work in non-adiabatic processes. It can be stated as follows:

$$
\frac{\langle e^{-\Delta S/kT} \rangle}{\langle e^{-\Delta S/kT} \rangle_{\text{eq}}} = e^{-\Delta S/kT}
$$

where $\Delta S$ is the change in entropy, and the average is taken over all possible trajectories.

This theorem is a direct consequence of the RFT and provides a mathematical expression of the second law of thermodynamics. It is important in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics as it provides a way to measure the entropy production of a system.

#### 4.2c.6 The Jarzynski Equality for Non-Equilibrium Transitions

The Jarzynski equality can also be extended to non-equilibrium transitions between two different equilibrium states. In this case, the equality takes the form:

$$

#### 4.2d Jarzynski Equality

The Jarzynski equality is a fundamental result in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics that provides a connection between the work done on a system during a non-equilibrium process and the free energy difference between the initial and final states. It is named after the physicist Wojciech H. Zurek, who first derived it in 1996.

#### 4.2d.1 Statement of the Jarzynski Equality

The Jarzynski equality can be stated as follows:

$$
\langle e^{-\beta \Delta W} \rangle = e^{-\beta \Delta F}
$$

where $\langle \cdots \rangle$ denotes an average over all possible trajectories, $\beta = 1/kT$ is the inverse temperature, $\Delta W$ is the work done on the system during the non-equilibrium process, and $\Delta F$ is the free energy difference between the initial and final states.

This equality implies that the average value of $e^{-\beta \Delta W}$ over all possible trajectories is equal to $e^{-\beta \Delta F}$. This result is a direct consequence of the Jarzynski equality and provides a mathematical expression of the Jarzynski equality.

#### 4.2d.2 The Jarzynski Equality and Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics

The Jarzynski equality is a powerful tool in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. It allows us to calculate the free energy difference between two states by measuring the work done on the system during a non-equilibrium process. This is particularly useful in situations where the system is not in thermal equilibrium, and traditional thermodynamic methods are not applicable.

The Jarzynski equality also provides a deeper understanding of the second law of thermodynamics. The second law states that the total entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time. The Jarzynski equality can be used to show that this is equivalent to the statement that the average value of $e^{-\beta \Delta W}$ over all possible trajectories is always less than or equal to 1. This result is a direct consequence of the Jarzynski equality and provides a mathematical expression of the second law of thermodynamics.

#### 4.2d.3 The Jarzynski Equality and Fluctuation Theorems

The Jarzynski equality is closely related to the fluctuation theorem (FT). The FT provides a generalization of the second law of thermodynamics that includes as a special case the conventional second law. The Jarzynski equality can be seen as a specific case of the FT, where the work done on the system during a non-equilibrium process is considered.

The Jarzynski equality also provides a connection between the Jarzynski equality and the non-equilibrium partition identity. The non-equilibrium partition identity is another important concept in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. It can be stated as follows:

$$
\frac{\langle e^{-\Delta S/kT} \rangle}{\langle e^{-\Delta S/kT} \rangle_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{\langle e^{-\Delta S/kT} \rangle_{\text{eq}}}{\langle e^{-\Delta S/kT} \rangle_{\text{eq}}}
$$

This identity is a direct consequence of the Jarzynski equality and provides a mathematical expression of the non-equilibrium partition identity. It is important to note that the left-hand side of this equation is always greater than or equal to 1, while the right-hand side is always equal to 1. This inequality is a direct consequence of the Jarzynski equality and provides a mathematical expression of the non-equilibrium partition identity.

#### 4.2d.4 The Jarzynski Equality and Green-Kubo Relations

The Jarzynski equality is also closely related to the Green-Kubo relations. The Green-Kubo relations are a set of equations that relate the transport coefficients of a system to the work done on the system during a non-equilibrium process. The Jarzynski equality can be seen as a specific case of the Green-Kubo relations, where the work done on the system during a non-equilibrium process is considered.

#### 4.3a Nonequilibrium Critical Phenomena

In the previous sections, we have discussed the Jarzynski equality and its implications for non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Now, we will delve into the concept of nonequilibrium critical phenomena, which is a key aspect of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

#### 4.3a.1 Definition of Nonequilibrium Critical Phenomena

Nonequilibrium critical phenomena refer to the behavior of a system at the critical point of a phase transition, when the system is driven by an external force. This is in contrast to equilibrium critical phenomena, which occur when the system is at rest at the critical point.

In nonequilibrium critical phenomena, the system is driven by an external force, which can be a constant force or a variable force. The external force can be applied in various ways, such as a constant electric field, a constant magnetic field, or a variable temperature gradient. The behavior of the system at the critical point under these external forces is of particular interest in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

#### 4.3a.2 Nonequilibrium Critical Phenomena and Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics

The study of nonequilibrium critical phenomena is closely related to non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In non-equilibrium thermodynamics, we are concerned with the behavior of a system when it is driven by an external force. The external force can cause the system to deviate from equilibrium, and the study of nonequilibrium critical phenomena allows us to understand how the system behaves at the critical point under these conditions.

The Jarzynski equality, which we discussed in the previous section, is particularly useful in the study of nonequilibrium critical phenomena. By measuring the work done on the system during a non-equilibrium process, we can calculate the free energy difference between the initial and final states. This can provide valuable insights into the behavior of the system at the critical point.

#### 4.3a.3 Nonequilibrium Critical Phenomena and Self-Organized Criticality

Another important aspect of nonequilibrium critical phenomena is their connection to self-organized criticality (SOC). SOC is a phenomenon where a system spontaneously organizes itself into a critical state, without any external control. This phenomenon has been observed in various systems, including sandpiles, neural networks, and biological systems.

The study of nonequilibrium critical phenomena can provide insights into the mechanisms of SOC. For example, the BTW model, a simple model of a sandpile, exhibits SOC when driven by an external force. The study of the critical behavior of the BTW model under different external forces can provide insights into the mechanisms of SOC.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of self-organized criticality and its implications for non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the principles of thermodynamics in equilibrium systems. However, many real-world systems operate under non-equilibrium conditions. This chapter, "Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics," delves into the fascinating world of these systems. 

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. These systems are often driven by external forces or inputs, and their behavior can be quite complex. The principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics are crucial for understanding and predicting the behavior of these systems.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental concepts of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, including the concepts of entropy production, irreversibility, and the second law of thermodynamics. We will also discuss the mathematical formulations that describe these concepts, such as the equation for entropy production and the second law of thermodynamics.

We will also delve into the practical applications of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, such as in the analysis of heat engines, refrigeration cycles, and other energy conversion systems. We will also discuss the role of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in the study of biological systems and other complex systems.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, from the fundamental principles to the practical applications. By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and be able to apply these principles to analyze and predict the behavior of non-equilibrium systems.

So, let's embark on this exciting journey into the world of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

#### 4.3c Examples of Nonequilibrium Phase Transitions

In the previous sections, we have discussed the concept of dynamic phase transitions and its relevance to non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Now, we will explore some specific examples of nonequilibrium phase transitions.

#### 4.3c.1 Ferromagnetic Transition

One of the most well-known examples of a nonequilibrium phase transition is the ferromagnetic transition. In this transition, a material changes from a paramagnetic phase (where the magnetic moments of the atoms are randomly oriented) to a ferromagnetic phase (where the magnetic moments are aligned in a specific direction). This transition can be induced by an external magnetic field, which aligns the magnetic moments of the atoms in a specific direction.

The behavior of the system during this transition can be studied using the Jarzynski equality. By measuring the work done on the system during the transition, we can calculate the free energy difference between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases. This can provide valuable insights into the behavior of the system as it transitions from one phase to another under the influence of the external magnetic field.

#### 4.3c.2 Superconducting Transition

Another example of a nonequilibrium phase transition is the superconducting transition. In this transition, a material changes from a normal conducting phase (where the electrical resistance is finite) to a superconducting phase (where the electrical resistance is zero). This transition can be induced by an external electric field, which can drive the system from the normal conducting phase to the superconducting phase.

The behavior of the system during this transition can also be studied using the Jarzynski equality. By measuring the work done on the system during the transition, we can calculate the free energy difference between the normal conducting and superconducting phases. This can provide valuable insights into the behavior of the system as it transitions from one phase to another under the influence of the external electric field.

#### 4.3c.3 Glass Transition

The glass transition is another example of a nonequilibrium phase transition. In this transition, a liquid changes from a liquid phase (where the molecules are in constant motion) to a glass phase (where the molecules are in a disordered, non-crystalline state). This transition can be induced by a rapid cooling of the liquid, which can prevent the molecules from rearranging into a crystalline structure.

The behavior of the system during this transition can be studied using the Jarzynski equality. By measuring the work done on the system during the transition, we can calculate the free energy difference between the liquid and glass phases. This can provide valuable insights into the behavior of the system as it transitions from one phase to another under the influence of the rapid cooling.

In conclusion, these examples of nonequilibrium phase transitions demonstrate the importance of studying the behavior of a system as it transitions from one phase to another under the influence of external forces. The Jarzynski equality provides a powerful tool for analyzing these transitions and understanding the underlying thermodynamics.

## Chapter: Chapter 5: Information Theory

### Introduction

In this chapter, we delve into the fascinating world of Information Theory, a branch of mathematics that deals with the quantification, storage, and communication of information. Information Theory is a field that has found its applications in a wide range of disciplines, from computer science to neuroscience, and from communication engineering to economics. It provides a mathematical framework for understanding how information is processed and transmitted, and how it can be optimized for efficient communication and decision-making.

The concept of information, while intuitive, is not always easy to quantify. Information Theory provides a rigorous mathematical framework for doing so. It introduces the concept of entropy, a measure of the uncertainty or randomness of a system, and the concept of information gain, a measure of the amount of information that can be gained from a system. These concepts are fundamental to understanding how information is processed and transmitted.

In this chapter, we will explore these concepts in depth, and discuss their implications for non-equilibrium thermodynamics. We will also discuss the concept of channel capacity, a measure of the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a communication channel. This concept is particularly relevant to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, as it provides a way of understanding how information can be transmitted in a system that is not in equilibrium.

We will also discuss the concept of Shannon's source coding theorem, a fundamental result in Information Theory that provides a lower bound on the rate at which information can be transmitted from a source. This theorem is particularly relevant to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, as it provides a way of understanding how information can be compressed and transmitted efficiently in a system that is not in equilibrium.

Finally, we will discuss the concept of Bayesian decision theory, a branch of Information Theory that deals with decision-making under uncertainty. This concept is particularly relevant to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, as it provides a way of understanding how decisions can be made in a system that is not in equilibrium.

In summary, this chapter will provide a comprehensive introduction to Information Theory, and discuss its implications for non-equilibrium thermodynamics. It will provide the mathematical tools and concepts needed to understand how information is processed and transmitted in a system that is not in equilibrium.

It allows us to predict the behavior of fluids, control their dynamics, and even design new systems. In this section, we will explore the fundamental principles of hydrodynamics, starting with the basic concepts of fluid flow and pressure.

#### Fluid Flow

Fluid flow is the movement of a fluid (liquid or gas) in a particular direction. It is a complex phenomenon that involves the interaction of many particles. In hydrodynamics, we often describe the flow of a fluid using the Navier-Stokes equations, which are a set of partial differential equations that describe the motion of viscous fluid substances.

The Navier-Stokes equations are given by:

$$
\rho \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v} \right) = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \rho \mathbf{g}
$$

where $\rho$ is the fluid density, $\mathbf{v}$ is the fluid velocity, $p$ is the pressure, $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and $\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration.

These equations describe how the fluid velocity changes over time and space due to the pressure gradient, viscous forces, and gravitational forces. They are fundamental to the study of fluid flow and are used in a wide range of applications, from designing hydraulic systems to predicting the behavior of blood in the human body.

#### Pressure

Pressure is a fundamental concept in hydrodynamics. It is defined as the force per unit area and is a key factor in determining the direction and speed of fluid flow. In a fluid at rest, the pressure is the same in all directions. However, when a fluid is in motion, the pressure can vary in different directions.

The pressure in a fluid is related to the fluid density and velocity by the Bernoulli equation, which is given by:

$$
p + \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + \rho gh = \text{constant}
$$

where $p$ is the pressure, $\rho$ is the fluid density, $v$ is the fluid velocity, $g$ is the gravitational acceleration, and $h$ is the height above a reference point.

This equation states that the sum of the pressure, the kinetic energy per unit volume, and the potential energy per unit volume is constant along a streamline in a fluid at rest. This principle is fundamental to many applications, such as the design of hydraulic systems and the prediction of the behavior of fluids in pipes.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the principles of hydrodynamics, exploring concepts such as entropy production, the equation of heat transfer, and the equation for specific entropy production. We will also discuss the application of these concepts in various fields, such as the measurement of heat transfer and air flow in a domestic refrigerator, the harmonic analysis of regenerators, and the physics of glaciers.




#### 5.1b Navier-Stokes Equations

The Navier-Stokes equations are a set of partial differential equations that describe the motion of viscous fluid substances. They are named after Claude-Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes, who first formulated them in the early 19th century. The equations are given by:

$$
\rho \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v} \right) = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \rho \mathbf{g}
$$

The Navier-Stokes equations are fundamental to the study of fluid flow and are used in a wide range of applications, from designing hydraulic systems to predicting the behavior of blood in the human body. They describe how the fluid velocity changes over time and space due to the pressure gradient, viscous forces, and gravitational forces.

The equations can be used to model a variety of fluid flows, from the flow of blood in the human body to the flow of air over an aircraft wing. They can also be used to study the behavior of complex systems, such as the global climate.

In the context of statistical mechanics, the Navier-Stokes equations are used to describe the collective behavior of a large number of particles, such as molecules in a gas or atoms in a liquid. They provide a mathematical description of how these particles interact and move, and how their behavior is influenced by factors such as pressure and viscosity.

#### 5.1c Hydrodynamics in Non-equilibrium Systems

In the previous sections, we have discussed the Navier-Stokes equations and their applications in various fields. However, these equations are primarily used to describe fluid flow in equilibrium systems. In this section, we will explore how these equations can be extended to non-equilibrium systems, and how they can be used to describe the behavior of fluids in these systems.

Non-equilibrium systems are characterized by the presence of a driving force that causes the system to deviate from its equilibrium state. In the context of fluid flow, this driving force can be due to a pressure gradient, a gravitational field, or an external force. The Navier-Stokes equations can be modified to account for these driving forces, resulting in the non-equilibrium Navier-Stokes equations.

The non-equilibrium Navier-Stokes equations are given by:

$$
\rho \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v} \right) = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \rho \mathbf{g} + \mathbf{F}
$$

where $\mathbf{F}$ is the driving force. This force can be due to a pressure gradient, a gravitational field, or an external force, and is given by:

$$
\mathbf{F} = -\nabla p_e + \rho \mathbf{g} + \mathbf{F}_e
$$

where $p_e$ is the external pressure, $\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration, and $\mathbf{F}_e$ is the external force.

These systems are often characterized by the presence of irreversible processes, such as heat conduction and viscous flow. The study of these systems involves understanding how energy is transferred and transformed, and how entropy is produced.

The Navier-Stokes equations can be modified to account for non-equilibrium conditions. For instance, the equation for entropy production can be added to the system. This equation is given by:

$$

Hydrodynamics in non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a crucial area of study that combines the principles of fluid dynamics with the concepts of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. This field is particularly relevant in the study of heat transfer and entropy production, where the Navier-Stokes equations play a crucial role.

The Navier-Stokes equations, as we have seen, describe the motion of viscous fluid substances. However, in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, these equations often need to be modified to account for non-equilibrium conditions. One such modification is the inclusion of the equation for entropy production.

The equation for entropy production is given by:

$$
\rho T \frac{Ds}{Dt} = \nabla\cdot(\kappa\nabla T) + \frac{\mu\overset{\rightharpoonup}{S}^2}{\rho}
$$

where $T$ is the temperature, $s$ is the entropy, $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity, $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and $\overset{\rightharpoonup}{S}$ is the rate of strain tensor.

This equation describes how entropy is produced in a fluid system due to heat conduction and viscous flow. It is a key component in the study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and hydrodynamics.

In the context of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the Navier-Stokes equations can be used to describe the motion of fluid substances under non-equilibrium conditions. This is particularly useful in the study of heat transfer and entropy production, where the equations can be used to model the behavior of fluid systems under non-equilibrium conditions.

#### 5.1d Boundary Conditions and Boundary Layers

In the previous sections, we have discussed the Euler equations and the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the motion of inviscid and viscous fluids, respectively. These equations are fundamental to the study of fluid dynamics and are used in a wide range of applications. However, in many practical situations, these equations are not sufficient to fully describe the behavior of a fluid system. This is because they do not account for the effects of boundaries, which can significantly influence the behavior of a fluid.

In this section, we will discuss the concept of boundary conditions and boundary layers, which are essential for understanding the behavior of fluids near boundaries. We will also discuss how these concepts are applied in the context of Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH).

#### Boundary Conditions in SPH

In SPH, boundary conditions are used to model the behavior of a fluid near a boundary. This is necessary because the SPH convolution, which is used to calculate the interactions between particles, can only be accurately calculated if the particles are sufficiently far apart. If a particle is closer than $h$ to a boundary, the integral support is truncated, and the convolution is split into two integrals.

The first integral, denoted as $A(\boldsymbol{r})$, is calculated over the compact support ball $\Omega(\boldsymbol{r})$ centered at $\boldsymbol{r}$, with radius $h$. The second integral, denoted as $B(\boldsymbol{r})$, is calculated over the part of the compact support outside the computational domain, $B(\boldsymbol{r}) - \Omega(\boldsymbol{r})$.

The boundary conditions in SPH are based on approximating the second integral on the right-hand side. This is done by neglecting the integral, which is a popular approach when free-surface is considered in monophase simulations. This approach is simple but can lead to inconsistencies in the calculations.

#### Boundary Layers in SPH

In addition to boundary conditions, boundary layers are also important in SPH. A boundary layer is a region near a boundary where the behavior of the fluid is significantly influenced by the boundary. In SPH, the boundary layer is defined as the region where the convolution is split into two integrals.

The boundary layer is crucial for accurately modeling the behavior of a fluid near a boundary. It allows us to account for the effects of the boundary on the fluid, which is necessary for a complete description of the fluid system.

In the next section, we will discuss how these concepts of boundary conditions and boundary layers are applied in the context of light scattering, another important aspect of statistical mechanics.




#### 5.1e Application: Poiseuille Flow

Poiseuille flow, also known as laminar flow, is a type of flow that occurs in a pipe or channel when the fluid is incompressible and the flow is steady. It is named after the French physicist Jean Louis Marie Poiseuille, who first described the flow in 1833. Poiseuille flow is characterized by smooth, parallel layers of fluid that slide past one another.

##### Poiseuille Flow in Circular Pipes

The simplest case of Poiseuille flow is in a circular pipe. The velocity profile of the fluid in a circular pipe under Poiseuille flow is given by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:

$$
u(r) = \frac{1}{4\mu} \left( \frac{P}{l} \right) r(R^2 - r^2)
$$

where $u(r)$ is the velocity of the fluid at a radial distance $r$ from the center of the pipe, $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, $P$ is the pressure difference between the two ends of the pipe, $l$ is the length of the pipe, and $R$ is the radius of the pipe.

The volume flow rate $Q$ is given by:

$$
Q = \frac{\pi R^4 P}{8\mu l}
$$

##### Poiseuille Flow in Non-Circular Pipes

Poiseuille flow can also occur in non-circular pipes, such as rectangular channels, tubes with equilateral triangular cross-section, right-angled isosceles triangles, and tubes with elliptical cross-section. The velocity and volume flow rate in these cases are given by more complex equations, which involve sums over Bessel functions and trigonometric functions. These equations are derived from the Hagen-Poiseuille equation by considering the boundary conditions at the walls of the pipe.

For example, in a rectangular channel of height $h$ and width $w$, the velocity profile is given by:

$$
u(y,z) = \frac{G}{2\mu} y(h-y) - \frac{4Gh^2}{\pi^3 \mu} \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(2n-1)^3} \frac{\sinh(\beta_n z) + \sinh [\beta_n (l-z)]}{\sinh (\beta_n l)} \sin (\beta_n y)
$$

where $G$ is the constant pressure gradient, $l$ is the length of the channel, and $\beta_n$ is defined as $\beta_n = \frac{(2n-1)\pi}{h}$.

The volume flow rate is given by:

$$
Q = \frac{Gh^3l}{12\mu} - \frac{16 G h^4}{\pi^5 \mu} \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(2n-1)^5} \frac{\cosh(\beta_n l) - 1}{\sinh(\beta_n l)}
$$

These equations show that the velocity and volume flow rate in Poiseuille flow depend on the geometry of the pipe and the pressure gradient. They also show that the flow is parabolic, with the maximum velocity occurring at the center of the pipe and the minimum velocity occurring at the walls. This is a key feature of Poiseuille flow and is what distinguishes it from turbulent flow, which is characterized by chaotic, swirling motions.

In the next section, we will discuss how Poiseuille flow can be used to model the flow of light in optical fibers, a topic that is of great importance in modern telecommunications.




#### 5.2a Introduction to Light Scattering

Light scattering is a fundamental phenomenon in the interaction of light with matter. It is a process by which light is deflected from its original path due to interaction with particles in the medium. The study of light scattering is crucial in various fields, including physics, biology, and materials science. In this section, we will introduce the concept of light scattering and discuss its applications in statistical mechanics.

Light scattering can be classified into two main categories: elastic and inelastic scattering. Elastic scattering, also known as Rayleigh scattering, occurs when the scattered light has the same energy as the incident light. This type of scattering is responsible for the blue color of the sky and the white color of clouds. Inelastic scattering, on the other hand, involves a change in the energy of the scattered light. This type of scattering is responsible for phenomena such as Raman scattering and Brillouin light scattering.

The scattering of light can be described mathematically using the scattering matrix, or scattering matrix, which relates the incident and scattered light fields. The scattering matrix is a complex quantity that depends on the properties of the medium and the wavelength of the light. It can be used to calculate the scattering cross-section, which is a measure of the probability of scattering.

In the context of statistical mechanics, light scattering plays a crucial role in the study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The scattering of light can provide valuable information about the dynamics of the system, including the velocity distribution of the particles and the temperature of the system. This information can be used to study the transport properties of the system, such as the conductivity and the viscosity.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the theory of light scattering and its applications in statistical mechanics. We will discuss the scattering of light in different types of media, including gases, liquids, and solids. We will also explore the use of light scattering in the study of phase transitions and the behavior of complex systems.

#### 5.2b Rayleigh Scattering

Rayleigh scattering is a type of elastic scattering that occurs when light interacts with particles that are much smaller than its wavelength. This type of scattering is named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first derived the mathematical expression for the scattering cross-section in 1871.

The Rayleigh scattering cross-section is given by the equation:

$$
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\right)^4\left(\frac{a^3}{\lambda}\right)^2P_2(\cos\theta)
$$

where $\sigma$ is the scattering cross-section, $\Omega$ is the solid angle, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light, $a$ is the radius of the particles, $\theta$ is the scattering angle, and $P_2(\cos\theta)$ is the second-order Legendre polynomial.

The Rayleigh scattering cross-section is proportional to the cube of the particle size and the fourth power of the wavelength. This means that smaller particles and shorter wavelengths result in a larger scattering cross-section. This is why the sky appears blue: the shorter blue wavelengths are scattered more than the longer red wavelengths, making the sky appear blue.

Rayleigh scattering is also responsible for the white color of clouds. When sunlight passes through a cloud, it is scattered in all directions. The smaller water droplets in the cloud scatter the shorter blue and green wavelengths more than the longer red wavelengths, making the cloud appear white.

In the context of statistical mechanics, Rayleigh scattering is used to study the dynamics of particle systems. By analyzing the scattered light, we can infer information about the size and velocity distribution of the particles. This can be used to study phase transitions and the behavior of complex systems.

In the next section, we will discuss another type of light scattering, Raman scattering, and its applications in statistical mechanics.

#### 5.2c Raman Scattering

Raman scattering is a type of inelastic scattering that occurs when light interacts with molecules. This type of scattering is named after the Indian physicist C. V. Raman, who first observed it in 1928. Raman scattering provides valuable information about the molecular structure and dynamics of a system, making it a powerful tool in the study of statistical mechanics.

The Raman scattering process involves the interaction of light with the vibrational modes of the molecules. When a photon of light interacts with a molecule, it can either lose or gain energy, depending on whether the molecule is in an excited state or not. This results in a shift in the frequency of the scattered light, which can be measured to determine the energy of the vibrational modes of the molecules.

The Raman scattering cross-section is given by the equation:

$$
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\right)^4\left(\frac{a^3}{\lambda}\right)^2P_2(\cos\theta)
$$

where $\sigma$ is the scattering cross-section, $\Omega$ is the solid angle, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light, $a$ is the radius of the particles, $\theta$ is the scattering angle, and $P_2(\cos\theta)$ is the second-order Legendre polynomial.

The Raman scattering cross-section is proportional to the cube of the particle size and the fourth power of the wavelength, similar to Rayleigh scattering. However, in Raman scattering, the scattered light is shifted in frequency, providing information about the vibrational modes of the molecules.

In the context of statistical mechanics, Raman scattering is used to study the dynamics of molecular systems. By analyzing the scattered light, we can infer information about the energy levels and transitions of the molecules, providing insights into the thermodynamics and kinetics of the system.

In the next section, we will discuss another type of light scattering, Brillouin light scattering, and its applications in statistical mechanics.

#### 5.2d Brillouin Scattering

Brillouin scattering, named after the French physicist Léon Brillouin, is a type of light scattering that occurs when light interacts with a density gradient in a medium. This phenomenon is particularly relevant in the study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, as it provides a means to probe the dynamics of density fluctuations in a system.

The Brillouin scattering process involves the interaction of light with the collective density fluctuations in a medium. When a photon of light interacts with a density fluctuation, it can either lose or gain energy, depending on whether the density fluctuation is in an excited state or not. This results in a shift in the frequency of the scattered light, which can be measured to determine the energy of the density fluctuations.

The Brillouin scattering cross-section is given by the equation:

$$
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\right)^4\left(\frac{a^3}{\lambda}\right)^2P_2(\cos\theta)
$$

where $\sigma$ is the scattering cross-section, $\Omega$ is the solid angle, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light, $a$ is the radius of the particles, $\theta$ is the scattering angle, and $P_2(\cos\theta)$ is the second-order Legendre polynomial.

The Brillouin scattering cross-section is proportional to the cube of the particle size and the fourth power of the wavelength, similar to Rayleigh and Raman scattering. However, in Brillouin scattering, the scattered light is shifted in frequency, providing information about the density fluctuations in the medium.

In the context of statistical mechanics, Brillouin scattering is used to study the dynamics of density fluctuations in a system. By analyzing the scattered light, we can infer information about the energy levels and transitions of the density fluctuations, providing insights into the thermodynamics and kinetics of the system.

In the next section, we will discuss another type of light scattering, Brillouin light scattering, and its applications in statistical mechanics.

#### 5.2e Application: Light Scattering in Colloidal Suspensions

Light scattering is a powerful tool in the study of colloidal suspensions, providing insights into the size, shape, and interactions of particles in a system. In this section, we will explore the application of light scattering in the study of colloidal suspensions, focusing on the specific case of polystyrene latex spheres in water.

Polystyrene latex spheres are commonly used in colloidal systems due to their well-defined size and shape. The scattering of light from these particles can be analyzed using the Mie theory, which provides a mathematical description of the scattering process. The Mie theory is particularly useful for particles that are much larger than the wavelength of the light, which is the case for polystyrene latex spheres.

The Mie theory predicts that the scattering pattern of polystyrene latex spheres will exhibit a series of peaks and valleys, corresponding to the constructive and destructive interference of light. These peaks and valleys can be observed in the experimental scattering patterns, providing a means to determine the size and shape of the particles.

The Mie theory also predicts that the scattering intensity will increase with the fourth power of the particle size. This prediction is confirmed by the experimental data, demonstrating the utility of light scattering in the study of colloidal systems.

In addition to providing information about the size and shape of particles, light scattering can also be used to study the interactions between particles in a colloidal suspension. For example, the scattering intensity can be used to measure the distance between particles, providing insights into the forces acting between them.

In the context of statistical mechanics, light scattering is used to study the dynamics of colloidal systems. By analyzing the scattering patterns and intensities, we can infer information about the energy levels and transitions of the particles, providing insights into the thermodynamics and kinetics of the system.

In the next section, we will discuss another application of light scattering in statistical mechanics: the study of light scattering in non-equilibrium systems.

## Chapter: Chapter 6: Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics

### Introduction

In the realm of statistical mechanics, the concept of equilibrium is a fundamental one. It is a state where all the macroscopic properties of a system are time-invariant. However, in many real-world scenarios, systems are often found to be in a state of non-equilibrium. This chapter, "Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics," delves into the fascinating world of non-equilibrium systems and their unique characteristics.

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. These systems are often driven by external forces or inputs, and their properties can change over time. This is in contrast to equilibrium thermodynamics, where the system's properties are assumed to be constant.

In this chapter, we will explore the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, starting with the basic concepts and gradually moving on to more complex topics. We will discuss the laws of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, such as the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of an isolated system always increases over time. We will also delve into the concept of entropy production, a key concept in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

We will also explore the mathematical models used to describe non-equilibrium systems. These models often involve partial differential equations, such as the heat equation and the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the transport of heat and momentum, respectively.

Finally, we will discuss the applications of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in various fields, such as fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and chemical reactions. We will see how the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics can be used to understand and predict the behavior of these systems.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, equipping readers with the knowledge and tools to understand and analyze non-equilibrium systems. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in a related field, we hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource in your journey through the fascinating world of statistical mechanics.




#### 5.2b Rayleigh Scattering

Rayleigh scattering is a type of elastic scattering that occurs when the scattered light has the same energy as the incident light. It is named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first derived the mathematical expression for the scattering of light by small particles in 1871. Rayleigh scattering is responsible for the blue color of the sky and the white color of clouds, as the particles in the atmosphere (such as molecules and dust) are much smaller than the wavelength of visible light.

The intensity of Rayleigh scattered light is given by the equation:

$$
I(\theta) = \frac{I_0}{R^2} \frac{d^2}{2\pi} \left(\frac{n}{n_0}\right)^2 \frac{1 + \cos^2(\theta)}{2}
$$

where $I_0$ is the intensity of the incident light, $R$ is the distance from the scattering particle, $d$ is the diameter of the particle, $n$ is the refractive index of the particle, $n_0$ is the refractive index of the medium, and $\theta$ is the scattering angle.

From this equation, we can see that the intensity of Rayleigh scattered light is directly proportional to the diameter of the particle and the square of the refractive index. This means that larger particles and particles with a higher refractive index will scatter more light. Additionally, the intensity of Rayleigh scattered light is maximum in the forward direction (when $\theta = 0$) and decreases as the scattering angle increases.

Rayleigh scattering is a fundamental concept in statistical mechanics, as it provides a way to study the properties of a system by observing the scattering of light. For example, the intensity of Rayleigh scattered light can be used to determine the size and refractive index of particles in a system, which can then be used to study the dynamics of the system.

In the next section, we will discuss another type of light scattering, Mie scattering, which occurs when the particles are larger than the wavelength of the incident light.

#### 5.2c Mie Scattering

Mie scattering is another type of light scattering that occurs when the particles are larger than the wavelength of the incident light. It is named after the German physicist Gustav Mie, who first derived the mathematical expression for the scattering of light by large particles in 1908. Mie scattering is responsible for the white color of clouds, as the particles in the atmosphere (such as water droplets and ice crystals) are typically larger than the wavelength of visible light.

The intensity of Mie scattered light is given by the equation:

$$
I(\theta) = \frac{I_0}{R^2} \frac{d^2}{2\pi} \left(\frac{n}{n_0}\right)^2 \frac{1 + \cos^2(\theta)}{2} \frac{1}{k^2} \sum_{l=1}^{\infty} (2l+1) e^{i\delta_l} P_l(\cos(\theta))
$$

where $I_0$ is the intensity of the incident light, $R$ is the distance from the scattering particle, $d$ is the diameter of the particle, $n$ is the refractive index of the particle, $n_0$ is the refractive index of the medium, $k$ is the wave number, $l$ is the angular momentum quantum number, $\delta_l$ is the phase shift for the $l$th angular momentum state, and $P_l(\cos(\theta))$ is the Legendre polynomial of degree $l$.

From this equation, we can see that the intensity of Mie scattered light is directly proportional to the diameter of the particle and the square of the refractive index, similar to Rayleigh scattering. However, unlike Rayleigh scattering, the intensity of Mie scattered light is not maximum in the forward direction. Instead, the intensity of Mie scattered light is maximum at a scattering angle of $\pi/2$, and decreases as the scattering angle increases.

Mie scattering is a crucial concept in statistical mechanics, as it provides a way to study the properties of a system by observing the scattering of light. For example, the intensity of Mie scattered light can be used to determine the size and refractive index of particles in a system, which can then be used to study the dynamics of the system.

In the next section, we will discuss the applications of light scattering in statistical mechanics, including the study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and the behavior of fluids.

## Chapter: Chapter 6: Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics

### Introduction

In the realm of statistical mechanics, the concept of equilibrium is a fundamental one. It is a state where all the macroscopic properties of a system are time-independent, and the system is in a steady state. However, in many real-world scenarios, systems are often found to be in a non-equilibrium state. This chapter, "Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics," delves into the fascinating world of these non-equilibrium systems and their unique properties.

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. These systems are often driven by external forces or inputs, and their properties can change over time. The study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics is crucial in understanding and predicting the behavior of many real-world systems, from engines and refrigerators to biological systems and the universe itself.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, starting with the concept of non-equilibrium and its implications. We will then delve into the mathematical formalism of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, including the equations of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and the concept of entropy production. We will also discuss the concept of irreversibility in non-equilibrium systems and its implications for the second law of thermodynamics.

We will also explore the concept of non-equilibrium steady states, where a system is in a state of non-equilibrium but its properties do not change over time. We will discuss the conditions under which a system can reach a non-equilibrium steady state and the properties of these states.

Finally, we will discuss some of the applications of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, including the study of heat engines, refrigerators, and biological systems. We will also discuss the concept of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, which combines the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics with the principles of statistical mechanics.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, equipping readers with the knowledge and tools to understand and analyze non-equilibrium systems. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional, we hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource in your journey to understand the fascinating world of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.




#### 5.2c Mie Scattering

Mie scattering is a type of elastic scattering that occurs when the scattered light has the same energy as the incident light. It is named after the Austrian physicist Christian Mie, who first derived the mathematical expression for the scattering of light by spherical particles in 1908. Mie scattering is responsible for the white color of clouds, as the particles in the atmosphere (such as water droplets and ice crystals) are larger than the wavelength of visible light.

The intensity of Mie scattered light is given by the equation:

$$
I(\theta) = \frac{I_0}{R^2} \frac{d^2}{2\pi} \left(\frac{n}{n_0}\right)^2 \frac{1 + \cos^2(\theta)}{2}
$$

where $I_0$ is the intensity of the incident light, $R$ is the distance from the scattering particle, $d$ is the diameter of the particle, $n$ is the refractive index of the particle, $n_0$ is the refractive index of the medium, and $\theta$ is the scattering angle.

From this equation, we can see that the intensity of Mie scattered light is directly proportional to the diameter of the particle and the square of the refractive index. This means that larger particles and particles with a higher refractive index will scatter more light. Additionally, the intensity of Mie scattered light is maximum in the forward direction (when $\theta = 0$) and decreases as the scattering angle increases.

Mie scattering is a fundamental concept in statistical mechanics, as it provides a way to study the properties of a system by observing the scattering of light. For example, the intensity of Mie scattered light can be used to determine the size and refractive index of particles in a system, which can then be used to study the dynamics of the system.

In the next section, we will discuss another type of light scattering, Raman scattering, which occurs when the scattered light has a different energy than the incident light.

#### 5.2d Raman Scattering

Raman scattering is a type of inelastic scattering that occurs when the scattered light has a different energy than the incident light. It is named after the Indian physicist C. V. Raman, who first observed this phenomenon in 1928. Raman scattering is responsible for the color of gemstones, as it is the mechanism by which light is scattered by the molecules in the crystal structure.

The intensity of Raman scattered light is given by the equation:

$$
I(\omega) = \frac{I_0}{R^2} \frac{d^2}{2\pi} \left(\frac{n}{n_0}\right)^2 \frac{1 + \cos^2(\theta)}{2}
$$

where $I_0$ is the intensity of the incident light, $R$ is the distance from the scattering particle, $d$ is the diameter of the particle, $n$ is the refractive index of the particle, $n_0$ is the refractive index of the medium, $\omega$ is the frequency of the scattered light, and $\theta$ is the scattering angle.

From this equation, we can see that the intensity of Raman scattered light is directly proportional to the diameter of the particle and the square of the refractive index. This means that larger particles and particles with a higher refractive index will scatter more light. Additionally, the intensity of Raman scattered light is maximum in the forward direction (when $\theta = 0$) and decreases as the scattering angle increases.

Raman scattering is a fundamental concept in statistical mechanics, as it provides a way to study the properties of a system by observing the scattering of light. For example, the intensity of Raman scattered light can be used to determine the size and refractive index of particles in a system, which can then be used to study the dynamics of the system.

In the next section, we will discuss another type of light scattering, Brillouin scattering, which occurs when the scattered light has a different frequency than the incident light.

#### 5.2e Brillouin Scattering

Brillouin scattering is a type of light scattering that occurs when the scattered light has a different frequency than the incident light. It is named after the French physicist Léon Brillouin, who first described this phenomenon in 1921. Brillouin scattering is responsible for the blue color of the sky, as it is the mechanism by which light is scattered by the molecules in the atmosphere.

The intensity of Brillouin scattered light is given by the equation:

$$
I(\omega) = \frac{I_0}{R^2} \frac{d^2}{2\pi} \left(\frac{n}{n_0}\right)^2 \frac{1 + \cos^2(\theta)}{2}
$$

where $I_0$ is the intensity of the incident light, $R$ is the distance from the scattering particle, $d$ is the diameter of the particle, $n$ is the refractive index of the particle, $n_0$ is the refractive index of the medium, $\omega$ is the frequency of the scattered light, and $\theta$ is the scattering angle.

From this equation, we can see that the intensity of Brillouin scattered light is directly proportional to the diameter of the particle and the square of the refractive index. This means that larger particles and particles with a higher refractive index will scatter more light. Additionally, the intensity of Brillouin scattered light is maximum in the forward direction (when $\theta = 0$) and decreases as the scattering angle increases.

Brillouin scattering is a fundamental concept in statistical mechanics, as it provides a way to study the properties of a system by observing the scattering of light. For example, the intensity of Brillouin scattered light can be used to determine the size and refractive index of particles in a system, which can then be used to study the dynamics of the system.

In the next section, we will discuss another type of light scattering, Rayleigh scattering, which occurs when the scattered light has the same frequency as the incident light.

#### 5.2f Light Scattering in Non-equilibrium Systems

In the previous sections, we have discussed various types of light scattering, including Rayleigh, Mie, Raman, and Brillouin scattering. These types of scattering occur in equilibrium systems, where the particles are in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding medium. However, in many practical applications, we encounter non-equilibrium systems where the particles are not in thermal equilibrium. In this section, we will discuss how light scattering occurs in non-equilibrium systems.

Non-equilibrium systems are characterized by the presence of a driving force that causes the particles to move and interact with each other in a non-uniform manner. This driving force can be due to an external field, such as an electric or magnetic field, or it can be due to internal forces, such as thermal fluctuations. In non-equilibrium systems, the particles are not in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding medium, and their distribution in space and momentum is not uniform.

The scattering of light in non-equilibrium systems is governed by the same principles as in equilibrium systems. However, the intensity of the scattered light can be significantly different due to the non-uniform distribution of particles. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the number of particles that are scattered, which in turn depends on the distribution of particles in space and momentum.

In non-equilibrium systems, the distribution of particles in space and momentum is often described by a non-equilibrium distribution function, which takes into account the driving force and the interactions between the particles. The scattering of light can then be calculated using the non-equilibrium distribution function, taking into account the scattering cross-section for each type of scattering.

For example, in a non-equilibrium system with a driving force, the scattering cross-section for Rayleigh scattering can be modified to account for the non-uniform distribution of particles. The scattering cross-section for Rayleigh scattering is proportional to the sixth power of the size of the particles, which in turn depends on the distribution of particles in size. In a non-equilibrium system, the distribution of particles in size can be different from the equilibrium distribution, leading to a different scattering cross-section.

In conclusion, the scattering of light in non-equilibrium systems is governed by the same principles as in equilibrium systems, but the intensity of the scattered light can be significantly different due to the non-uniform distribution of particles. The scattering cross-section for each type of scattering can be modified to account for the non-equilibrium distribution of particles, providing a powerful tool for studying non-equilibrium systems.

## Chapter: Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics

### Introduction

In the realm of statistical mechanics, the study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a fascinating and complex field. This chapter, Chapter 6, delves into the intricacies of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, providing a comprehensive understanding of the principles and applications of this field.

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. In contrast to equilibrium thermodynamics, where the system is in a steady state with no net change over time, non-equilibrium thermodynamics deals with systems that are constantly changing and evolving. This is often the case in real-world applications, where systems are subjected to external forces and influences that keep them in a state of flux.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental concepts of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, including the principles of entropy production, irreversibility, and the second law of thermodynamics. We will also delve into the mathematical formulations that describe these concepts, such as the equation for entropy production and the second law of thermodynamics.

We will also discuss the applications of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in various fields, including physics, engineering, and biology. This will provide a practical perspective on the concepts discussed, demonstrating their relevance and utility in real-world scenarios.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive and accessible introduction to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, suitable for both students and researchers in the field. It is our hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for those seeking to deepen their understanding of this fascinating field.




#### 5.2d Raman Scattering

Raman scattering is a type of inelastic scattering that occurs when the scattered light has a different energy than the incident light. It is named after the Indian physicist C. V. Raman, who first observed this phenomenon in 1928. Raman scattering is responsible for the yellow color of many gemstones, as it is a common mechanism for the interaction of light with matter.

The intensity of Raman scattered light is given by the equation:

$$
I(\omega) = \frac{I_0}{R^2} \frac{d^2}{2\pi} \left(\frac{n}{n_0}\right)^2 \frac{1 + \cos^2(\theta)}{2}
$$

where $I_0$ is the intensity of the incident light, $R$ is the distance from the scattering particle, $d$ is the diameter of the particle, $n$ is the refractive index of the particle, $n_0$ is the refractive index of the medium, and $\omega$ is the frequency of the scattered light.

From this equation, we can see that the intensity of Raman scattered light is directly proportional to the diameter of the particle and the square of the refractive index. This means that larger particles and particles with a higher refractive index will scatter more light. Additionally, the intensity of Raman scattered light is maximum in the forward direction (when $\theta = 0$) and decreases as the scattering angle increases.

Raman scattering is a fundamental concept in statistical mechanics, as it provides a way to study the properties of a system by observing the scattering of light. For example, the intensity of Raman scattered light can be used to determine the size and refractive index of particles in a system, which can then be used to study the dynamics of the system.

In the next section, we will discuss another type of light scattering, Brillouin scattering, which occurs due to the interaction between light and acoustic phonons in a medium.




#### 5.2e Applications of Light Scattering

Light scattering has a wide range of applications in various fields, including physics, chemistry, and biology. In this section, we will discuss some of the key applications of light scattering, with a focus on its use in studying the properties of particles and systems.

##### Particle Size Distribution

One of the most common applications of light scattering is in determining the size distribution of particles. This is done by analyzing the intensity of scattered light as a function of the scattering angle. The intensity of scattered light is directly proportional to the size of the particles, and the scattering angle provides information about the shape of the particles. By analyzing the intensity and angle of scattered light, we can determine the size and shape of particles in a system.

##### Refractive Index Measurement

Light scattering can also be used to measure the refractive index of a system. The refractive index is a measure of how much a medium slows down the speed of light. By analyzing the intensity of scattered light, we can determine the refractive index of a system, which can provide valuable information about the properties of the system.

##### Dynamic Light Scattering

Dynamic light scattering (DLS) is a technique that measures the fluctuations in the intensity of scattered light over time. This technique is particularly useful for studying the dynamics of systems, such as the motion of particles in a fluid. By analyzing the fluctuations in the intensity of scattered light, we can determine the diffusion coefficient of particles, which provides information about their mobility and interactions with the surrounding medium.

##### Raman Scattering

Raman scattering is a type of light scattering that occurs when the scattered light has a different energy than the incident light. This phenomenon is particularly useful for studying the vibrational modes of molecules. By analyzing the frequency shift of the scattered light, we can determine the vibrational modes of molecules, which can provide valuable information about their chemical bonds and interactions.

##### Brillouin Scattering

Brillouin scattering is another type of light scattering that occurs due to the interaction between light and acoustic phonons in a medium. This phenomenon is particularly useful for studying the properties of phonons, such as their group velocity and attenuation. By analyzing the frequency shift and intensity of Brillouin scattered light, we can determine the properties of phonons, which can provide valuable information about the mechanical properties of a system.

In conclusion, light scattering is a powerful tool for studying the properties of particles and systems. Its applications range from determining particle size and refractive index to studying the dynamics of systems and the properties of phonons. As we continue to develop and refine our understanding of light scattering, we can expect to see even more exciting applications in the future.

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamental concepts of statistical mechanics, including stochastic processes and equilibrium thermodynamics. We have seen how these concepts are used to describe the behavior of systems at equilibrium, where the system's properties are time-independent. However, many real-world systems are not at equilibrium, and their properties can change over time. This is where the concept of time correlation functions comes into play.

Time correlation functions are mathematical tools that allow us to describe the temporal evolution of a system's properties. They provide a way to quantify the relationship between the system's properties at different points in time. This is particularly useful in non-equilibrium systems, where the system's properties can change rapidly and unpredictably.

In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the concept of time correlation functions. We will explore their properties, how they are calculated, and how they can be used to describe the behavior of non-equilibrium systems. We will also discuss the relationship between time correlation functions and other important concepts in statistical mechanics, such as response functions and fluctuation-dissipation theorems.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of time correlation functions and their role in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. You will also have the tools to calculate and interpret time correlation functions for a variety of systems. So let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of time correlation functions.




### Subsection: 6.1a Definition and Properties

Time correlation functions are mathematical tools that describe the relationship between the properties of a system at different points in time. They are particularly useful in non-equilibrium systems, where the system's properties can change rapidly and unpredictably. In this section, we will define time correlation functions and discuss their properties.

#### Definition of Time Correlation Functions

A time correlation function $C(t)$ is a function that describes the correlation between the properties of a system at time $t$ and at time $0$. It is defined as:

$$
C(t) = \langle A(t)A(0) \rangle
$$

where $A(t)$ is a random variable representing the property of the system at time $t$, and $\langle \cdot \rangle$ denotes the average over all possible realizations of the system.

The time correlation function provides a measure of the similarity between the system's properties at different points in time. A positive value of $C(t)$ indicates that the system's properties are correlated, meaning that changes in the system's properties at time $t$ are likely to be accompanied by changes at time $0$. A negative value of $C(t)$ indicates that the system's properties are anti-correlated, meaning that changes in the system's properties at time $t$ are likely to be accompanied by changes in the opposite direction at time $0$. A value of $C(t) = 0$ indicates that the system's properties are uncorrelated, meaning that changes in the system's properties at time $t$ are not likely to be accompanied by changes at time $0$.

#### Properties of Time Correlation Functions

Time correlation functions have several important properties that make them useful in statistical mechanics. These properties include:

1. **Symmetry:** The time correlation function is symmetric, meaning that $C(t) = C(-t)$. This property is a consequence of the assumption that the system is time-invariant.

2. **Causality:** The time correlation function is causal, meaning that $C(t) = 0$ for $t < 0$. This property is a consequence of the assumption that the system's properties at time $t$ cannot depend on its properties at time $t' > t$.

3. **Stationarity:** The time correlation function is stationary, meaning that $C(t) = C(t + \tau)$ for all $t$ and $\tau$. This property is a consequence of the assumption that the system's properties do not change over time.

4. **Normalization:** The time correlation function is normalized, meaning that $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} C(t) dt = 1$. This property is a consequence of the assumption that the system's properties are bounded.

5. **Positivity:** The time correlation function is positive, meaning that $C(t) \geq 0$ for all $t$. This property is a consequence of the assumption that the system's properties are real.

In the next section, we will discuss how to calculate time correlation functions for different types of systems.




### Subsection: 6.1b Time Correlation Functions in Equilibrium Systems

In the previous section, we discussed the definition and properties of time correlation functions. In this section, we will focus on time correlation functions in equilibrium systems.

#### Equilibrium Behavior of Time Correlation Functions

In equilibrium systems, the time correlation function $C(t)$ approaches a steady-state value as $t$ goes to infinity. This steady-state value, denoted as $\lim_{t \to \infty} C(t)$, is a measure of the long-term correlation between the system's properties at different points in time.

To understand $\lim_{t \to \infty} C(t)$, we can consider the discrete Laplace operator $L$ and its kernel. The kernel of $L$ determines the equilibrium state of the system, and it can be shown that for a given initial condition $c(0)$, the time correlation function $\phi(t)$ converges to the same value at each vertex of the graph. This convergence is a result of the heat diffusion process, where energy is spread out evenly throughout the system.

#### Generalizations of Time Correlation Functions

The concept of time correlation functions can be extended to non-equilibrium systems and continuous-time systems. In these cases, the time correlation function may not approach a steady-state value, and the system's properties may change rapidly and unpredictably. However, the basic principles of time correlation functions remain the same, and they can still provide valuable insights into the behavior of these systems.

In the next section, we will discuss some specific examples of time correlation functions in equilibrium systems, including the heat diffusion process and the extended Kalman filter.




### Subsection: 6.1c Time Correlation Functions in Nonequilibrium Systems

In the previous sections, we have discussed time correlation functions in equilibrium systems. However, many real-world systems are non-equilibrium, and it is essential to understand how time correlation functions behave in these systems. In this section, we will explore the properties of time correlation functions in non-equilibrium systems.

#### Non-equilibrium Behavior of Time Correlation Functions

In non-equilibrium systems, the time correlation function $C(t)$ does not approach a steady-state value as $t$ goes to infinity. Instead, it oscillates around a mean value, and the amplitude of these oscillations can provide valuable insights into the system's behavior.

To understand this behavior, let's consider the discrete Laplace operator $L$ and its kernel in a non-equilibrium system. The kernel of $L$ determines the equilibrium state of the system, and it can be shown that for a given initial condition $c(0)$, the time correlation function $\phi(t)$ does not converge to the same value at each vertex of the graph. This is because the system is not in a steady state, and the energy distribution is constantly changing.

#### Generalizations of Time Correlation Functions

The concept of time correlation functions can be extended to non-equilibrium systems and continuous-time systems. In these cases, the time correlation function may not oscillate around a mean value, and the system's properties may change rapidly and unpredictably. However, the basic principles of time correlation functions remain the same, and they can still provide valuable insights into the behavior of these systems.

In the next section, we will discuss some specific examples of time correlation functions in non-equilibrium systems, including the heat diffusion process and the extended Kalman filter.




### Subsection: 6.2a Linear Response Theory

Linear Response Theory (LRT) is a powerful tool in statistical mechanics that allows us to understand the response of a system to small perturbations. It is based on the assumption that the system is linear and that the perturbations are small enough that the system remains in its linear regime. In this section, we will introduce the basic concepts of LRT and discuss its applications in non-equilibrium systems.

#### The Basic Concepts of Linear Response Theory

The central concept of LRT is the response function, which describes the change in a system's output due to a small change in its input. The response function is typically denoted as $G(t)$, and it is the Fourier transform of the response function $G(\omega)$ that is most commonly used in practice.

The response function is defined as the ratio of the output to the input in the frequency domain:

$$
G(\omega) = \frac{Y(\omega)}{U(\omega)}
$$

where $Y(\omega)$ and $U(\omega)$ are the Fourier transforms of the output and input signals, respectively.

The response function can also be expressed in terms of the time correlation functions of the input and output signals:

$$
G(\omega) = \frac{S_{YU}(\omega)}{S_{UU}(\omega)}
$$

where $S_{YU}(\omega)$ and $S_{UU}(\omega)$ are the cross-spectral density and power spectral density of the output and input signals, respectively.

#### Applications of Linear Response Theory in Non-equilibrium Systems

In non-equilibrium systems, the response function can provide valuable insights into the system's behavior. For example, in the heat diffusion process, the response function can be used to study the propagation of heat waves and the system's response to external perturbations.

Another important application of LRT in non-equilibrium systems is in the extended Kalman filter. The extended Kalman filter is a generalization of the Kalman filter that is used to estimate the state of a non-linear system. The response function plays a crucial role in the extended Kalman filter, as it allows us to calculate the system's response to small perturbations and update the state estimate accordingly.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the applications of LRT in non-equilibrium systems and discuss some specific examples.





### Subsection: 6.2b Dynamic Structure Factor

The dynamic structure factor (DSF) is a fundamental concept in condensed matter physics that describes the correlation between the density fluctuations of a system. It is a generalization of the static structure factor, which describes the correlation between the density fluctuations at a fixed time. The DSF provides valuable insights into the dynamics of a system, including its response to external perturbations and its collective modes of oscillation.

#### Definition and Calculation of the Dynamic Structure Factor

The DSF, denoted as $S(\vec{k},\omega)$, is defined as the Fourier transform of the intermediate scattering function $F(\vec{k},t)$, which is the spatial Fourier transform of the van Hove function $G(\vec{r},t)$. The intermediate scattering function can be measured experimentally using neutron spin echo spectroscopy, and it is given by:

$$
F(\vec{k},t) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i,j} e^{i\vec{k}\cdot(\vec{r}_i(t)-\vec{r}_j(0))}
$$

where $N$ is the number of particles, $\vec{r}_i(t)$ is the position of particle $i$ at time $t$, and the sum is over all particles $i$ and $j$.

The DSF can be calculated from the intermediate scattering function as:

$$
S(\vec{k},\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(\vec{k},t) e^{i\omega t} dt
$$

#### Applications of the Dynamic Structure Factor

The DSF has a wide range of applications in condensed matter physics. It is used to study the collective modes of oscillation in a system, such as phonons and plasmons. It is also used to investigate the response of a system to external perturbations, such as an applied electric field or a change in temperature.

In addition, the DSF is a key tool in the study of phase transitions. It can provide insights into the critical behavior of a system near a phase transition, including the appearance of new collective modes and the modification of existing ones.

#### The Dynamic Structure Factor and the Extended Kalman Filter

The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is a powerful tool for estimating the state of a non-linear system. It is based on the linear response theory and uses the DSF to estimate the state of the system. The EKF is particularly useful in non-equilibrium systems, where the state of the system can change rapidly and unpredictably.

The EKF uses the DSF to calculate the response of the system to external perturbations. This allows it to estimate the state of the system at a future time, based on its current state and the expected perturbations. The EKF is widely used in a variety of fields, including control systems, robotics, and economics.

#### Conclusion

The dynamic structure factor is a powerful tool in condensed matter physics, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of a system. Its applications range from the study of collective modes to the investigation of phase transitions and the estimation of the state of a system in non-equilibrium conditions. The extended Kalman filter, based on the linear response theory, is a key application of the DSF in non-linear systems.




### Subsection: 6.2c Time Correlation Functions in Soft Matter

Soft matter systems, such as colloidal suspensions, polymers, and biological systems, are characterized by their complex and often non-equilibrium behavior. The study of these systems requires a deep understanding of the dynamics of the constituent particles and their interactions. Time correlation functions, particularly the dynamic structure factor, play a crucial role in this study.

#### The Extended Kalman Filter and Soft Matter Systems

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is a powerful tool for state estimation in non-linear systems. It is particularly useful in the study of soft matter systems, which often exhibit non-linear behavior.

The EKF operates by linearizing the system around the current estimate, and then applying the standard Kalman filter. The linearization is performed using the first-order Taylor series expansion. The EKF also includes a correction term to account for the non-linearity of the system.

The EKF can be used to estimate the state of a soft matter system, including the positions and velocities of the constituent particles. This can be particularly useful in the study of complex systems where direct measurement of the state is difficult or impossible.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the application of the EKF in soft matter systems.

### Section: 7.2 50%:

#### 7.2a Stochastic Processes and Brownian Motion

In this section, we will delve into the fascinating world of stochastic processes and Brownian motion, two fundamental concepts in statistical mechanics. 

#### Stochastic Processes

A stochastic process is a mathematical model that describes the evolution of a system over time in a probabilistic manner. It is a powerful tool for modeling systems that exhibit randomness or uncertainty. Stochastic processes are used in a wide range of fields, including physics, economics, and engineering.

In the context of statistical mechanics, stochastic processes are used to model the behavior of systems at the microscopic level. For instance, the motion of particles in a gas can be modeled using a stochastic process. This allows us to make predictions about the macroscopic behavior of the system, such as the temperature and pressure of the gas.

#### Brownian Motion

Brownian motion, also known as a Wiener process, is a fundamental stochastic process in statistical mechanics. It is used to model the random motion of particles in a fluid. The process was first described by the botanist Robert Brown in 1827, who observed the random motion of pollen particles in water.

In the context of statistical mechanics, Brownian motion is used to model the random motion of particles in a gas. This is particularly useful in the study of diffusion, a process by which particles spread out from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.

The mathematical description of Brownian motion is given by the Langevin equation, which relates the velocity of a particle to the forces acting on it. The equation is given by:

$$
m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\gamma\frac{dx}{dt} + F(t)
$$

where $m$ is the mass of the particle, $\gamma$ is the damping coefficient, and $F(t)$ is a random force.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of stochastic processes and Brownian motion in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

#### 7.2b Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. In these systems, energy is not evenly distributed, and there are gradients of energy, temperature, and other properties. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is particularly relevant in statistical mechanics, as it allows us to understand how systems evolve from one state to another, and how they respond to external perturbations.

##### Non-equilibrium Ensemble

In equilibrium thermodynamics, the ensemble of systems is in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. However, in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the ensemble of systems is not in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. This is because the systems are subjected to external forces or fields that cause them to deviate from equilibrium. The non-equilibrium ensemble is characterized by the presence of non-zero currents and gradients.

The non-equilibrium ensemble is described by the non-equilibrium distribution function, which is a generalization of the Fermi-Dirac distribution function. The non-equilibrium distribution function takes into account the effects of external forces and fields on the distribution of particles in the system.

##### Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics and statistical mechanics are closely related. Statistical mechanics provides a microscopic description of thermodynamics, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics extends this description to systems that are not in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium.

In non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the laws of thermodynamics are generalized to account for the non-equilibrium state of the system. For instance, the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the change in internal energy of a system is equal to the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system, is generalized to account for the non-equilibrium state of the system.

##### Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics and Brownian Motion

Brownian motion plays a crucial role in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. It is used to model the random motion of particles in a fluid, and it is used to describe the diffusion of particles in a system. Brownian motion is also used to model the behavior of systems that are not in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the applications of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and Brownian motion in statistical mechanics.

#### 7.2c Course Assessment

#### 7.2b Master Equations

The master equation is a fundamental equation in the study of stochastic processes. It describes the evolution of the probability distribution of a system over time. In the context of statistical mechanics, the master equation is used to describe the evolution of the probability distribution of a system from one microstate to another.

The master equation is a balance equation that describes the change in the probability of a system being in a particular state. It is given by:

$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = \sum_{i} W_{i}P_{i} - \sum_{i} W_{i}P_{i}
$$

where $P_{i}$ is the probability of the system being in state $i$, $W_{i}$ is the transition rate from state $i$ to state $j$, and the sum is over all states $i$ and $j$.

The master equation is a powerful tool in statistical mechanics as it allows us to calculate the probability of a system being in a particular state at any given time. This is particularly useful in the study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, where the system is not in a state of thermal equilibrium.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of the master equation in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

#### 7.2c Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in a state of thermal equilibrium. In these systems, the energy distribution is not uniform, and there are gradients in the energy, temperature, and other thermodynamic quantities. This is in contrast to equilibrium thermodynamics, where the system is in a state of thermal equilibrium, and the energy distribution is uniform.

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is particularly relevant in the study of systems that are driven by external forces, such as in chemical reactions, biological processes, and electronic devices. These systems are often far from equilibrium, and their behavior cannot be fully described by the laws of equilibrium thermodynamics.

The master equation, as discussed in the previous section, is a fundamental tool in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. It allows us to calculate the probability of a system being in a particular state at any given time, even when the system is not in a state of thermal equilibrium.

In the context of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the master equation can be used to describe the evolution of the probability distribution of a system under the influence of external forces. This is particularly useful in the study of non-equilibrium steady states, where the system is driven by external forces but has reached a steady state.

The master equation can also be used to describe the transition from equilibrium to non-equilibrium. This is particularly relevant in the study of phase transitions, where the system transitions from a state of thermal equilibrium to a state of non-equilibrium.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of the master equation in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, focusing on the study of non-equilibrium steady states and phase transitions.




#### 7.2c Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a crucial aspect of statistical mechanics, particularly in the study of systems that are driven by external forces. These systems are often far from equilibrium, and their behavior cannot be fully described by the laws of equilibrium thermodynamics. In this section, we will explore the concept of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and its applications in statistical mechanics.

#### 7.2c.1 Non-equilibrium Ensemble

The non-equilibrium ensemble is a statistical mechanical ensemble that describes systems that are not in a state of thermal equilibrium. Unlike the canonical ensemble, which describes systems in thermal equilibrium, the non-equilibrium ensemble allows us to study systems that are driven by external forces.

The non-equilibrium ensemble is defined by the distribution of probabilities over the microstates of the system. This distribution is determined by the external forces acting on the system and the initial conditions of the system. The non-equilibrium ensemble allows us to calculate the average values of various quantities, such as energy, temperature, and entropy, in the system.

#### 7.2c.2 Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics and the Master Equation

The master equation, as discussed in the previous section, is a powerful tool in statistical mechanics. It allows us to calculate the probability of a system being in a particular state at any given time. In the context of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the master equation can be used to describe the evolution of the probability distribution of a system over time.

The master equation in non-equilibrium thermodynamics is given by:

$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = \sum_{i} W_{i}P_{i} - \sum_{i} W_{i}P_{i}
$$

where $P_{i}$ is the probability of the system being in state $i$, $W_{i}$ is the transition rate from state $i$ to state $j$, and the sum is over all states $i$ and $j$.

#### 7.2c.3 Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics and the Fokker–Planck Equations

The Fokker–Planck equations are a set of partial differential equations that describe the evolution of the probability density of a system over time. In the context of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the Fokker–Planck equations can be used to describe the evolution of the probability density of a system driven by external forces.

The Fokker–Planck equations are given by:

$$
\frac{\partial P}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(D\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}\right) - \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\mu\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}\right)
$$

where $P$ is the probability density, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $\mu$ is the drift term.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in various fields, including chemical reactions, biological processes, and electronic devices.




#### 7.2d Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in a state of thermal equilibrium. These systems are often driven by external forces and are characterized by a continuous exchange of energy and matter with their surroundings. The study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics is crucial in understanding the behavior of systems that are far from equilibrium, such as living organisms, chemical reactions, and technological processes.

#### 7.2d.1 Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics and the Second Law

The second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time, is a fundamental principle in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In non-equilibrium systems, the second law can be expressed as the inequality:

$$
\frac{dS}{dt} \geq \frac{1}{T}\nabla\cdot(\kappa\nabla T)
$$

where $S$ is the entropy, $T$ is the temperature, and $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity. This inequality represents the irreversible increase in entropy in non-equilibrium systems.

#### 7.2d.2 Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics and the Onsager Reciprocal Relations

The Onsager reciprocal relations are a set of equations that describe the behavior of non-equilibrium systems. These equations relate the fluxes and forces in a system and are given by:

$$
J_{i} = L_{ij}X_{j}
$$

where $J_{i}$ is the flux of the $i$-th component, $L_{ij}$ is the Onsager matrix, and $X_{j}$ is the force in the $j$-th direction. The Onsager matrix is symmetric, reflecting the principle of microscopic reversibility.

#### 7.2d.3 Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics and the Prigogine-Defay Ratio

The Prigogine-Defay ratio, also known as the dissipation function, is a measure of the irreversibility of a process. It is defined as:

$$
\Phi = \frac{\dot{S}}{k_{B}T}
$$

where $\dot{S}$ is the rate of entropy production and $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant. The Prigogine-Defay ratio is always positive in non-equilibrium systems, reflecting the irreversible nature of these systems.

#### 7.2d.4 Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics and the Extended Kalman Filter

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is a powerful tool in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. It is used to estimate the state of a system based on noisy measurements. The EKF is particularly useful in non-equilibrium systems, where the state of the system can change rapidly and unpredictably. The EKF is given by:

$$
\dot{\hat{x}}(t) = f(\hat{x}(t),u(t))+K(z(t)-h(\hat{x}(t)))\\
\dot{P}(t) = F(t)P(t)+P(t)F(t)^{T}-K(t)H(t)P(t)+Q(t)\\
K(t) = P(t)H(t)^{T}R(t)^{-1}\\
F(t) = \left . \frac{\partial f}{\partial x } \right \vert _{\hat{x}(t),u(t)}\\
H(t) = \left . \frac{\partial h}{\partial x } \right \vert _{\hat{x}(t)}
$$

where $\hat{x}(t)$ is the estimate of the state, $u(t)$ is the control input, $z(t)$ is the measurement, $P(t)$ is the state covariance, $K(t)$ is the Kalman gain, $F(t)$ is the Jacobian of the system model, $H(t)$ is the Jacobian of the measurement model, $Q(t)$ is the process noise covariance, and $R(t)$ is the measurement noise covariance.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in various fields, including biology, chemistry, and engineering.




#### 7.2e Hydrodynamics and Light Scattering

Hydrodynamics is a branch of fluid mechanics that deals with the study of fluid flow, particularly in relation to the forces acting on the fluid. It is a fundamental concept in statistical mechanics, as it provides a framework for understanding the behavior of fluids at different scales. In this section, we will explore the role of hydrodynamics in light scattering, a phenomenon that is crucial in many areas of physics, including optics, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics.

#### 7.2e.1 Hydrodynamics and Light Scattering

Light scattering is a process by which light is deflected from its original path due to interaction with matter. In the context of hydrodynamics, light scattering can provide valuable insights into the behavior of fluids. For instance, the scattering of light can reveal the velocity distribution of particles in a fluid, which is a key parameter in hydrodynamics.

The scattering of light can be described by the Boltzmann equation, a fundamental equation in statistical mechanics that describes the evolution of a distribution function. The Boltzmann equation can be used to derive the Fokker–Planck equation, which describes the evolution of the probability distribution of a particle in a fluid. This equation is particularly useful in the study of light scattering, as it provides a mathematical framework for understanding the scattering process.

#### 7.2e.2 Hydrodynamics and the Boltzmann Equation

The Boltzmann equation is a fundamental equation in statistical mechanics that describes the evolution of a distribution function. It is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \vec{v} \cdot \nabla f = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\right)_{\text{coll}}
$$

where $f$ is the distribution function, $\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the particles, and the right-hand side represents the collision term, which accounts for the interactions between particles.

The Boltzmann equation can be used to derive the Fokker–Planck equation, which describes the evolution of the probability distribution of a particle in a fluid. This equation is particularly useful in the study of light scattering, as it provides a mathematical framework for understanding the scattering process.

#### 7.2e.3 Hydrodynamics and the Fokker–Planck Equation

The Fokker–Planck equation is a partial differential equation that describes the evolution of the probability distribution of a particle in a fluid. It is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial P}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot \left( \frac{\vec{p}}{m} P \right) + \frac{1}{k_B T} \nabla \cdot \left( \frac{\vec{p}}{m} \cdot \nabla P \right)
$$

where $P$ is the probability distribution, $\vec{p}$ is the momentum of the particle, $m$ is the mass of the particle, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature.

The Fokker–Planck equation is particularly useful in the study of light scattering, as it provides a mathematical framework for understanding the scattering process. It allows us to calculate the scattering cross-section, which is a measure of the probability of scattering.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the role of hydrodynamics in light scattering, exploring concepts such as the scattering matrix and the scattering amplitude.




#### 7.2f Time Correlation Functions

Time correlation functions play a crucial role in statistical mechanics, particularly in the study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. They provide a mathematical framework for understanding the temporal evolution of systems that are not in thermal equilibrium. In this section, we will explore the concept of time correlation functions and their significance in statistical mechanics.

#### 7.2f.1 Definition and Properties of Time Correlation Functions

A time correlation function is a function that describes the correlation between two events at different times. In statistical mechanics, these events often represent the state of a system at different points in time. The time correlation function is typically denoted as $C(t)$, where $t$ is the time difference between the two events.

The time correlation function has several important properties. First, it is symmetric, meaning that $C(t) = C(-t)$. This property reflects the fact that the correlation between two events at different times is the same as the correlation between the same events at the same time but in reverse order.

Second, the time correlation function is causal, meaning that $C(t) = 0$ for $t < 0$. This property reflects the fact that the state of a system at a future time cannot affect the state of the system at a past time.

Third, the time correlation function is positive definite, meaning that $C(t) \geq 0$ for all $t$. This property reflects the fact that the correlation between two events at different times can never be negative.

#### 7.2f.2 Time Correlation Functions and Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics

In non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the time correlation function is used to describe the temporal evolution of a system that is not in thermal equilibrium. The time correlation function can be used to derive the equations of motion for the system, which describe how the system evolves over time.

The time correlation function is also used to define the entropy production rate, which is a key quantity in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The entropy production rate is given by:

$$
\dot{S} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} C(t) \dot{S}(t) dt
$$

where $\dot{S}(t)$ is the entropy production rate at time $t$. This equation shows that the entropy production rate is determined by the time correlation function and the entropy production rate at different times.

#### 7.2f.3 Time Correlation Functions and Stochastic Processes

In the context of stochastic processes, the time correlation function is used to describe the temporal evolution of a random variable. The time correlation function can be used to derive the autocorrelation function, which describes the correlation between the random variable at different times.

The time correlation function is also used to define the power spectral density, which is a key quantity in the analysis of stochastic processes. The power spectral density is given by:

$$
S(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} C(t) e^{-i\omega t} dt
$$

where $S(\omega)$ is the power spectral density at frequency $\omega$. This equation shows that the power spectral density is determined by the time correlation function and the complex exponential at different frequencies.

In conclusion, time correlation functions play a crucial role in statistical mechanics, particularly in the study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and stochastic processes. They provide a mathematical framework for understanding the temporal evolution of systems and random variables, and they are used to derive key quantities such as the entropy production rate and the power spectral density.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the fundamental concepts of statistical mechanics, from stochastic processes to non-equilibrium thermodynamics. We have delved into the principles of statistical mechanics, which is a branch of physics that deals with the statistical behavior of large assemblies of microscopic entities. We have also discussed the concept of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, which is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium.

We have seen how statistical mechanics provides a bridge between the microscopic world of atoms and molecules and the macroscopic world of everyday objects and phenomena. We have also learned how non-equilibrium thermodynamics allows us to understand and predict the behavior of systems that are not in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, such as living organisms and chemical reactions.

The concepts of stochastic processes and non-equilibrium thermodynamics are fundamental to many areas of physics, including condensed matter physics, biophysics, and environmental science. By understanding these concepts, we can gain a deeper understanding of the physical world and develop more accurate models and theories to describe and predict the behavior of physical systems.

This field has been instrumental in providing a microscopic understanding of macroscopic phenomena, from the behavior of gases to the properties of solids.

$$

where $P(E)$ is the probability of a system having energy $E$, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature, and $Z$ is the partition function.

### Section: 8.1 Introduction to Statistical Mechanics:

Statistical mechanics is a branch of physics that uses statistical methods and probability theory to explain the behavior of large assemblies of microscopic entities. It is a powerful tool that allows us to understand the macroscopic world from the microscopic perspective. In this section, we will introduce the basic concepts of statistical mechanics, including the Boltzmann distribution and the concept of entropy.

#### 8.1a Basic Concepts

The fundamental concept of statistical mechanics is the Boltzmann distribution, named after the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann. The Boltzmann distribution is a probability distribution that describes the distribution of particles in a system. It is given by the equation:

$$
P(E) = \frac{e^{-E/kT}}{Z}
$$

where $P(E)$ is the probability of a system having energy $E$, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature, and $Z$ is the partition function. The partition function is a normalization factor that ensures that the total probability is 1.

The Boltzmann distribution is a key concept in statistical mechanics as it allows us to calculate the average values of various quantities in a system. For example, the average energy of a system can be calculated using the Boltzmann distribution.

Another important concept in statistical mechanics is entropy. Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system. It is defined as the sum of the entropies of all the microstates of a system. The entropy of a microstate is given by the equation:

$$
S = k \ln W
$$

where $S$ is the entropy, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $W$ is the number of microstates.

Entropy plays a crucial role in statistical mechanics as it is directly related to the probability of a system. A system with high entropy has a high probability of being in a particular state, while a system with low entropy has a low probability.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into these concepts and explore their applications in various fields.

#### 8.1b Stochastic Processes

Stochastic processes are mathematical models that describe the evolution of a system over time in a probabilistic manner. They are a fundamental concept in statistical mechanics as they provide a framework for understanding the behavior of systems that involve randomness.

There are several types of stochastic processes, including Markov processes, Poisson processes, and Brownian motion. Each of these processes has its own unique properties and applications.

Markov processes are a type of stochastic process that have a memory of only one time step. This means that the future state of the system depends only on its current state, and not on its past states. This property is known as the Markov property. Markov processes are used to model systems that exhibit memoryless behavior, such as the movement of particles in a gas.

Poisson processes are a type of stochastic process that describe the occurrence of events in a continuous time interval. The events are assumed to be independent and occur at a constant rate. Poisson processes are used to model systems that involve a large number of independent events, such as the arrival of customers at a store.

Brownian motion is a type of stochastic process that describes the random movement of particles in a fluid. It is used to model the behavior of particles in a gas or the movement of stock prices.

In the next section, we will explore how these stochastic processes are used in statistical mechanics to model and understand the behavior of various systems.

#### 8.1c Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. In contrast to equilibrium thermodynamics, which is concerned with systems at constant temperature and pressure, non-equilibrium thermodynamics deals with systems that are subject to external forces and fluxes.

The fundamental concept in non-equilibrium thermodynamics is the concept of entropy production. In a system at equilibrium, the entropy is constant. However, in a non-equilibrium system, the entropy can increase due to irreversible processes. The increase in entropy is associated with a flow of energy, and is described by the equation:

$$
\rho T \frac{Ds}{Dt} = \nabla\cdot(\kappa\nabla T) + \frac{\mu\overset{\rightharpoonup}{v}\cdot\nabla\overset{\rightharpoonup}{v}}{2} + \zeta(\nabla\cdot\overset{\rightharpoonup}{v})^2
$$

where $\rho$ is the density, $T$ is the temperature, $s$ is the entropy, $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity, $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, $\overset{\rightharpoonup}{v}$ is the velocity vector, and $\zeta$ is the second coefficient of viscosity.

The first term on the right-hand side represents the heat conduction, the second term represents the viscous forces, and the third term represents the volume expansion or compression.

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is used to study a wide range of phenomena, including heat conduction, viscous flow, and chemical reactions. It is also used in the study of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, which is concerned with systems that are not in a state of thermal equilibrium.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and its applications in various fields.

$$
P(E) = \frac{e^{-E/kT}}{Z}
$$

where $P(E)$ is the probability of a system having energy $E$, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature, and $Z$ is the partition function. The partition function is a normalization factor that ensures that the total probability is 1.

The Boltzmann distribution is a key concept in statistical mechanics as it allows us to calculate the average values of various quantities in a system. For example, the average energy of a system can be calculated using the Boltzmann distribution.

Another important concept in statistical mechanics is entropy. Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system. It is defined as the sum of the entropies of all the microstates of a system. The entropy of a microstate is given by the equation:

$$
S = k \ln W
$$

where $S$ is the entropy, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $W$ is the number of microstates.

Entropy plays a crucial role in statistical mechanics as it is directly related to the probability of a system. A system with high entropy has a high probability of being in a particular state, while a system with low entropy has a low probability. This is because entropy is a measure of the number of possible states that a system can be in. The more possible states a system can be in, the higher its entropy, and the higher its probability of being in a particular state.

#### 8.1b Microstates and Macrostates

In statistical mechanics, a microstate is a specific configuration of a system that the system may occupy with a certain probability. In contrast, a macrostate refers to the overall properties of a system, such as its energy, volume, and number of particles.

A macrostate is characterized by a probability distribution of possible microstates. This distribution describes the probability of finding the system in a particular microstate. In the thermodynamic limit, the microstates visited by a macroscopic system during its fluctuations all have the same macroscopic properties.

The concept of microstates and macrostates is crucial in statistical mechanics as it allows us to understand the behavior of large assemblies of particles. By considering the probability distribution of microstates, we can calculate the average values of various quantities in a system, such as energy and entropy. This allows us to make predictions about the behavior of the system at the macroscopic level.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of state complexity, which is a measure of the complexity of a system's microstates. We will also discuss the role of state complexity in statistical mechanics and its implications for the behavior of complex systems.

## Training

The units in the Boltzmann machine are divided into 'visible' units, V, and 'hidden' units, H. The visible units are those that receive information from the 'environment', i.e. the training set is a set of binary vectors over the set V. The distribution over the training set is denoted <math>P^{+}(V)</math>.
The distribution over global states converges as the Boltzmann machine reaches thermal equilibrium. We denote this distribution, after we marginalize it over the hidden units, as <math>P^{-}(V)</math>.

Our goal is to approximate the "real" distribution <math>P^{+}(V)</math> using the <math>P^{-}(V)</math> produced by the machine. The similarity of the two distributions is measured by the Kullback–Leibler divergence, <math>G</math>:

where the sum is over all the possible states of <math>V</math>. <math>G</math> is a function of the weights, since they determine the energy of a state, and the energy determines <math>P^{-}(v)</math>, as promised by the Boltzmann distribution. A gradient descent algorithm over <math>G</math>, changes a given weight, <math>w_{ij}</math> by subtracting the partial derivative of <math>G</math> with respect to the weight.

Boltzmann machine training involves two alternating phases. One is the "positive" phase where the visible units' states are clamped to a particular binary state vector sampled from the training set (according to <math>P^{+}</math>). The other is the "negative" phase where the network is allowed to run freely, i.e. only the input nodes have their state determined by external data, but the output nodes are allowed to float. The gradient with respect to a given weight, <math>w_{ij}</math>, is given by the equation:

where:

This result follows from the fact that at thermal equilibrium the probability <math>P^{-}(s)</math> of any global state <math>s</math> when the network is free-running is given by the Boltzmann distribution.

### Subsection: 8.2a Internal Energy

The internal energy of a system is a fundamental concept in statistical mechanics. It is defined as the sum of the individual energies of all the particles in the system. In other words, it is the total energy contained within the system. The internal energy is denoted by the symbol $U$ and is measured in units of energy, such as joules (J) or ergs (erg).

The internal energy of a system can be calculated using the following equation:

### Subsection: 8.2d Helmholtz Free Energy

The Helmholtz free energy is another fundamental concept in statistical mechanics that combines the concepts of enthalpy and entropy. It is named after Hermann von Helmholtz, who first introduced it in his 1882 paper "On the Second Law of Thermodynamics". The Helmholtz free energy is a key quantity in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, providing a measure of the maximum reversible work that a system can perform at constant temperature and volume.

The Helmholtz free energy ($F$) of a system can be defined as:

$$
F = H - TS
$$

where $H$ is the enthalpy, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $S$ is the entropy of the system. This equation assumes that the system is in a constant volume.

### Subsection: 8.2e Entropy

Entropy is a fundamental concept in statistical mechanics that quantifies the disorder or randomness of a system. It is named after the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time. The concept of entropy is closely related to the concepts of information and complexity, and it plays a crucial role in the calculation of other thermodynamic quantities, such as the Gibbs free energy and the Helmholtz free energy.

The entropy ($S$) of a system can be defined as:

$$
S = -k_B \sum_{i=1}^{W} p_i \ln p_i
$$

where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $W$ is the number of microstates available to the system, and $p_i$ is the probability of the $i$th microstate. This equation assumes that the system is in a constant volume and that the microstates are equally probable.

### Subsection: 8.2f Chemical Potential

The chemical potential is a fundamental concept in statistical mechanics that quantifies the change in the total energy of a system when an additional particle is added, keeping the volume and entropy constant. It is named after the Gibbs phase rule, which states that the number of degrees of freedom in a system is equal to the number of components minus the number of phases plus two. The chemical potential plays a crucial role in the calculation of other thermodynamic quantities, such as the Gibbs free energy and the Helmholtz free energy.

The chemical potential ($\mu$) of a system can be defined as:

\mu = \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial N}\right)_{T,V}
$$

where $F$ is the Helmholtz free energy, $N$ is the number of particles in the system, and the subscript $T,V$ indicates that the partial derivative is taken at constant temperature and volume.

The chemical potential of a system can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
\mu = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} m_i v_i^2 + PV - TS
$$

where $N$ is the number of particles in the system, $m_i$ is the mass of the $i$th particle, and $v_i$ is the velocity of the $i$th particle. This equation assumes that the particles are non-interacting and that their velocities are distributed according to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

### Subsection: 8.2g Onsager Reciprocal Relations

The Onsager reciprocal relations are a set of equations that describe the relationship between the thermodynamic forces and fluxes in a system. They are named after the Norwegian-American physicist Lars Onsager, who first derived them in the 1930s. The Onsager reciprocal relations play a crucial role in the calculation of other thermodynamic quantities, such as the Gibbs free energy and the Helmholtz free energy.

The Onsager reciprocal relations can be expressed as:

$$
J_i = \sum_{j=1}^{N} L_{ij} X_j
$$

where $J_i$ is the flux of the $i$th thermodynamic variable, $L_{ij}$ is the Onsager coefficient, and $X_j$ is the thermodynamic force of the $j$th variable. The Onsager coefficients are symmetric, i.e., $L_{ij} = L_{ji}$, and they satisfy the Onsager reciprocal relations, i.e., $L_{ij} X_j = L_{ji} X_i$.

The Onsager reciprocal relations can be used to calculate the Onsager coefficients, which are crucial for the calculation of the Gibbs free energy and the Helmholtz free energy. The Onsager coefficients can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
L_{ij} = \frac{\partial J_i}{\partial X_j}
$$

where $J_i$ is the flux of the $i$th thermodynamic variable, and $X_j$ is the thermodynamic force of the $j$th variable. This equation assumes that the system is in a constant volume and that the fluxes and forces are small.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of Onsager reciprocal relations and its relationship with the Gibbs free energy and the Helmholtz free energy.

### Subsection: 8.2h Fluctuation Theorem

The Fluctuation Theorem is a fundamental concept in statistical mechanics that describes the relationship between the fluctuations in a system and the average value of a certain quantity. It is named after the French mathematician Joseph Fourier, who first introduced the concept of fluctuation in the 19th century. The Fluctuation Theorem plays a crucial role in the calculation of other thermodynamic quantities, such as the Gibbs free energy and the Helmholtz free energy.

The Fluctuation Theorem can be expressed as:

$$
\langle \delta X^2 \rangle = \frac{k_B T}{m} \int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-m\omega^2/2k_B T}}{1-e^{-m\omega^2/k_B T}} d\omega
$$

where $\langle \delta X^2 \rangle$ is the mean square fluctuation of the $X$ variable, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $m$ is the mass of the particle, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency. The integral is taken over all positive frequencies.

The Fluctuation Theorem can be used to calculate the mean square fluctuation of a certain quantity, which is crucial for the calculation of the Gibbs free energy and the Helmholtz free energy. The mean square fluctuation can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
\langle \delta X^2 \rangle = \frac{k_B T}{m} \int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-m\omega^2/2k_B T}}{1-e^{-m\omega^2/k_B T}} d\omega
$$

where $X$ is the quantity of interest, and the integral is taken over all positive frequencies. This equation assumes that the system is in a constant volume and that the fluctuations are small.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of Fluctuation Theorem and its relationship with the Gibbs free energy and the Helmholtz free energy.

It is named after the Polish physicist Wojciech Jarzynski, who first introduced the concept in the 1990s. The Jarzynski Equality plays a crucial role in the calculation of other thermodynamic quantities, such as the Gibbs free energy and the Helmholtz free energy.

The Jarzynski Equality can be expressed as:

$$
\langle e^{-\beta \Delta W} \rangle = e^{-\beta \Delta F}
$$

where $\langle e^{-\beta \Delta W} \rangle$ is the average of the exponential of the work done on the system, $\beta$ is the inverse temperature, $\Delta W$ is the change in the work done on the system, and $\Delta F$ is the change in the free energy of the system.

The Jarzynski Equality can be used to calculate the change in the free energy of a system, which is crucial for the calculation of the Gibbs free energy and the Helmholtz free energy. The change in the free energy can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
\Delta F = -T \Delta S
$$

where $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\Delta S$ is the change in the entropy of the system. This equation assumes that the system is in a constant volume and that the change in the entropy is small.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of Jarzynski Equality and its relationship with the Gibbs free energy and the Helmholtz free energy.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of statistical mechanics, a branch of physics that combines the principles of probability and statistics with the laws of thermodynamics. This field has been instrumental in providing a microscopic understanding of macroscopic phenomena, from the behavior of gases to the properties of solids.

We will begin by exploring the concept of stochastic processes, which are mathematical models used to describe systems that evolve in a probabilistic manner. These processes are fundamental to statistical mechanics as they allow us to describe the behavior of a large number of particles in a system. We will discuss the properties of stochastic processes, such as Markov processes and Gaussian processes, and how they are used to model physical systems.

Next, we will move on to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in a state of thermal equilibrium. This is a crucial aspect of statistical mechanics as it allows us to understand how systems evolve over time and how they respond to external stimuli. We will discuss concepts such as entropy production and the second law of thermodynamics in the context of non-equilibrium systems.

Finally, we will explore the concept of thermodynamic potentials, which are key quantities in statistical mechanics that provide a measure of the energy and entropy of a system. We will discuss the Gibbs free energy, the Helmholtz free energy, and the internal energy, and how they are used to calculate the properties of a system.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to statistical mechanics, from stochastic processes to non-equilibrium thermodynamics. By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of the principles and concepts of statistical mechanics and be able to apply them to a wide range of physical systems.




### Section: 8.2 Thermodynamic Potentials:

Thermodynamic potentials are fundamental quantities in statistical mechanics that provide a measure of the energy and entropy of a system. They are crucial in understanding the behavior of systems that are not in a state of thermal equilibrium, which is the focus of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

#### 8.2a Entropy

Entropy is a key concept in statistical mechanics, particularly in the context of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. It is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system, and is often associated with the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time.

The entropy of a system can be calculated using the Boltzmann equation, which relates the entropy `$S$` of a system to the number of microstates `$\Omega$` available to the system:

$$
S = k_B \ln \Omega
$$

where `$k_B$` is the Boltzmann constant. This equation shows that entropy is directly proportional to the number of microstates available to the system, and thus to the system's disorder.

In the context of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the entropy production is a key quantity. It is defined as the rate at which entropy is produced in a system, and is given by the equation:

$$
\rho T \frac{Ds}{Dt} = \nabla\cdot(\kappa\nabla T) + \frac{\mu\overset{\rightharpoonup}{v}\cdot\nabla\overset{\rightharpoonup}{v}}{2} + \zeta(\nabla\cdot\overset{\rightharpoonup}{v})^2
$$

where `$\rho$` is the density, `$T$` is the temperature, `$s$` is the entropy, `$\kappa$` is the thermal conductivity, `$\mu$` is the dynamic viscosity, `$\overset{\rightharpoonup}{v}$` is the velocity vector, and `$\zeta$` is the second coefficient of viscosity.

The first term on the right-hand side represents heat conduction, the second term represents viscous forces, and the third term represents volume expansion or compression. The equation shows that entropy production is related to heat conduction, viscous forces, and volume expansion or compression.

In the next section, we will discuss another important thermodynamic potential, the Gibbs free energy, and its role in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

#### 8.2b Gibbs Free Energy

The Gibbs free energy (G) is another fundamental thermodynamic potential that plays a crucial role in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Named after the American scientist Josiah Willard Gibbs, it is a thermodynamic potential that measures the maximum reversible work that a system can perform at constant temperature and pressure.

The Gibbs free energy is defined as:

$$
G = H - TS
$$

where `$H$` is the enthalpy, `$T$` is the temperature, and `$S$` is the entropy of the system. This equation shows that the Gibbs free energy is the difference between the enthalpy, which is a measure of the total energy of the system, and the product of the temperature and entropy, which is a measure of the disorder or randomness of the system.

In the context of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the Gibbs free energy is particularly important because it provides a measure of the maximum work that can be performed by a system without violating the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time.

The Gibbs free energy is also crucial in the minimization of energy, which is a key concept in statistical mechanics. At equilibrium, at a specified temperature and pressure, and with no external forces, the Gibbs free energy is at a minimum. This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\min_{N_j} G = \sum_j \mu_j N_j - TS
$$

where `$\mu_j$` is the chemical potential of molecular species `$j$`, and `$N_j$` is the amount of molecular species `$j$`. This equation shows that the Gibbs free energy is minimized when the chemical potentials of the molecular species are equal to the temperature times the entropy.

In the next section, we will discuss another important thermodynamic potential, the Helmholtz free energy, and its role in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

#### 8.2c Helmholtz Free Energy

The Helmholtz free energy (F) is a thermodynamic potential that measures the maximum reversible work that a system can perform at constant temperature and volume. Named after the German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz, it is a key concept in non-equilibrium thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.

The Helmholtz free energy is defined as:

$$
F = U - TS
$$

where `$U$` is the internal energy, `$T$` is the temperature, and `$S$` is the entropy of the system. This equation shows that the Helmholtz free energy is the difference between the internal energy, which is a measure of the total energy of the system, and the product of the temperature and entropy, which is a measure of the disorder or randomness of the system.

In the context of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the Helmholtz free energy is particularly important because it provides a measure of the maximum work that can be performed by a system without violating the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time.

The Helmholtz free energy is also crucial in the minimization of energy, which is a key concept in statistical mechanics. At equilibrium, at a specified temperature and volume, and with no external forces, the Helmholtz free energy is at a minimum. This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\min_{N_j} F = \sum_j \mu_j N_j - TS
$$

where `$\mu_j$` is the chemical potential of molecular species `$j$`, and `$N_j$` is the amount of molecular species `$j$`. This equation shows that the Helmholtz free energy is minimized when the chemical potentials of the molecular species are equal to the temperature times the entropy.

In the next section, we will discuss another important thermodynamic potential, the Gibbs free energy, and its role in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

#### 8.2d Onsager's Reciprocal Relations

Onsager's reciprocal relations are a set of fundamental principles in non-equilibrium thermodynamics that describe the relationship between the thermodynamic forces and the resulting fluxes in a system. Named after the Norwegian-American physicist Lars Onsager, these relations are crucial in understanding the behavior of systems that are not in thermal equilibrium.

Onsager's reciprocal relations can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\dot{\phi}_i = \sum_j L_{ij} \dot{\psi}_j
$$

where `$\dot{\phi}_i$` and `$\dot{\psi}_j$` are the fluxes and forces, respectively, `$L_{ij}$` is the Onsager matrix, and the sum is over all components `$i$` and `$j$`. This equation shows that the flux of a quantity `$i$` is proportional to the force of a quantity `$j$`, with the proportionality constant given by the Onsager coefficient `$L_{ij}$`.

The Onsager matrix is a symmetric matrix, which means that the Onsager coefficients satisfy the reciprocal relation:

$$
L_{ij} = L_{ji}
$$

This symmetry of the Onsager matrix is a direct consequence of the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time. It ensures that the system evolves in a way that minimizes the increase in entropy, which is a key principle in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

Onsager's reciprocal relations have been widely used in various fields, including chemical reactions, phase transitions, and biological systems. They provide a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of systems that are not in thermal equilibrium, and for predicting the response of these systems to external forces.

In the next section, we will discuss another important concept in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the concept of entropy production, and its relationship with Onsager's reciprocal relations.




### Section: 8.3 Phase Transitions:

Phase transitions are fundamental to the study of statistical mechanics, as they provide a clear example of a system transitioning from one state to another. These transitions are often associated with changes in the system's macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure, and volume.

#### 8.3a First Order Phase Transitions

First-order phase transitions are characterized by a discontinuity in the system's macroscopic properties. These transitions are often associated with the formation of new phases, such as the transition from liquid to gas in a boiling process.

The Landau theory provides a mathematical framework for understanding first-order phase transitions. This theory is based on the concept of an order parameter, which is a quantity that characterizes the state of the system. For example, in a liquid-gas transition, the order parameter could be the density of the liquid.

The Landau theory can be applied to both symmetric and asymmetric systems. In the symmetric case, the system has a symmetry and the energy is invariant when the order parameter changes sign. The free energy functional in this case can be written as:

$$
F(\eta) = A(T)\eta^2 + \frac{B(T)}{2}\eta^4 + \frac{C(T)}{6}\eta^6
$$

where `$A(T)$`, `$B(T)$`, and `$C(T)$` are coefficients that depend on the temperature. The coefficients `$A(T)$` and `$C(T)$` are positive, while `$B(T)$` can be either positive or negative.

For temperatures above the critical temperature `$T_c$`, the free energy is concave upward for all values of the order parameter, and the equilibrium solution is `$\eta = 0$`. However, for temperatures below `$T_c$`, the free energy has a minimum at some non-zero value of the order parameter, indicating the formation of a new phase.

In the next section, we will discuss second-order phase transitions, which are characterized by a continuous change in the system's macroscopic properties.

#### 8.3b Second Order Phase Transitions

Second-order phase transitions are characterized by a continuous change in the system's macroscopic properties. Unlike first-order transitions, there is no discontinuity in the system's properties, but rather a smooth change. These transitions are often associated with the formation of new phases, such as the transition from liquid to gas in a boiling process.

The Landau theory can also be applied to second-order phase transitions. However, in this case, the system is not symmetric under a change in sign of the order parameter. The free energy functional in this case can be written as:

$$
F(\eta) = A(T)\eta^2 + \frac{B(T)}{2}\eta^4 + \frac{C(T)}{6}\eta^6
$$

where `$A(T)$`, `$B(T)$`, and `$C(T)$` are coefficients that depend on the temperature. The coefficients `$A(T)$` and `$C(T)$` are positive, while `$B(T)$` is negative.

For temperatures above the critical temperature `$T_c$`, the free energy is concave upward for all values of the order parameter, and the equilibrium solution is `$\eta = 0$`. However, for temperatures below `$T_c$`, the free energy has a minimum at some non-zero value of the order parameter, indicating the formation of a new phase.

The second derivative of the free energy with respect to the order parameter, `$\frac{d^2F}{d\eta^2}$`, is negative for temperatures below `$T_c$`, indicating a continuous change in the system's properties. This is in contrast to first-order transitions, where the second derivative is positive for temperatures below the critical temperature.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of phase space and its role in statistical mechanics.

#### 8.3c Critical Phenomena

Critical phenomena are the physical properties of a system at the critical point of a phase transition. These properties are often characterized by power laws, which describe the behavior of the system as it approaches the critical point. The critical point is the temperature at which the system undergoes a phase transition, and it is often associated with the formation of new phases.

The critical point can be determined by analyzing the behavior of the free energy functional near the critical temperature. For the Landau theory, the critical point is determined by the condition `$B(T_c) = 0$`. This condition leads to the critical exponents, which describe the behavior of the system near the critical point.

The critical exponents are often used to classify different types of phase transitions. For example, the Ising model, which describes the behavior of a ferromagnet, exhibits a second-order phase transition. The critical exponents for the Ising model are `$\alpha = 0$`, `$\beta = \frac{1}{2}$`, `$\gamma = 1$`, and `$\delta = 3$`. These exponents are used to classify the Ising model as a member of the universality class of two-dimensional systems.

The critical exponents can also be used to classify different types of critical phenomena. For example, the critical exponents for the Ising model are different from those for the three-dimensional XY model, which describes the behavior of a superfluid. The critical exponents for the three-dimensional XY model are `$\alpha = 0$`, `$\beta = \frac{1}{2}$`, `$\gamma = 1$`, and `$\delta = 3$`. These exponents are used to classify the three-dimensional XY model as a member of the universality class of three-dimensional systems.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of phase space and its role in statistical mechanics.

#### 8.3d Phase Diagrams

Phase diagrams are graphical representations of the conditions under which different phases of a substance can exist. They are useful tools for understanding the behavior of a system near the critical point of a phase transition. In this section, we will discuss the phase diagrams for the Ising model and the three-dimensional XY model.

The phase diagram for the Ising model is shown in Figure 1. The critical point is located at `$T_c = 0$` and `$h = 0$`, where the system undergoes a second-order phase transition from a ferromagnetic phase to a paramagnetic phase. The critical exponents for the Ising model are `$\alpha = 0$`, `$\beta = \frac{1}{2}$`, `$\gamma = 1$`, and `$\delta = 3$`. These exponents are used to classify the Ising model as a member of the universality class of two-dimensional systems.

The phase diagram for the three-dimensional XY model is shown in Figure 2. The critical point is located at `$T_c = 0$` and `$h = 0$`, where the system undergoes a second-order phase transition from a superfluid phase to a normal phase. The critical exponents for the three-dimensional XY model are `$\alpha = 0$`, `$\beta = \frac{1}{2}$`, `$\gamma = 1$`, and `$\delta = 3$`. These exponents are used to classify the three-dimensional XY model as a member of the universality class of three-dimensional systems.

The phase diagrams for the Ising model and the three-dimensional XY model are similar, with the critical point located at `$T_c = 0$` and `$h = 0$`. However, the critical exponents for the two models are different, reflecting the different physical properties of the two systems. The Ising model describes the behavior of a ferromagnet, while the three-dimensional XY model describes the behavior of a superfluid.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of phase space and its role in statistical mechanics.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the fascinating world of statistical mechanics, exploring the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of large ensembles of particles. We have seen how these principles can be applied to understand the macroscopic properties of systems, such as temperature, pressure, and entropy, in terms of the microscopic behavior of individual particles.

We have also examined the concept of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, which allows us to describe the behavior of systems that are not in a state of thermal equilibrium. This is particularly important in many real-world applications, where systems are often driven by external forces and do not have time to reach a state of equilibrium.

The mathematical tools and concepts introduced in this chapter, such as the Boltzmann distribution and the H-theorem, provide a powerful framework for understanding the behavior of complex systems. However, it is important to remember that these are just models, and while they can provide valuable insights, they are not perfect representations of the real world.

In the next chapter, we will continue our exploration of statistical mechanics, focusing on the concept of phase space and its role in understanding the behavior of systems.

## Chapter: Chapter 9: Entropy Production

### Introduction

In the realm of thermodynamics, entropy is a fundamental concept that quantifies the disorder or randomness of a system. It is often associated with the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time. This chapter, "Entropy Production," delves into the intricacies of entropy production, a crucial aspect of statistical mechanics.

Entropy production is a key concept in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, which deals with systems that are not in a state of thermal equilibrium. In such systems, entropy production is a measure of the irreversibility of processes. It is a concept that is closely tied to the concept of heat transfer and the second law of thermodynamics.

In this chapter, we will explore the mathematical formulation of entropy production, which is often expressed in terms of the heat conduction equation. We will also discuss the physical interpretation of entropy production, and how it relates to the concept of irreversibility in thermodynamic processes.

We will also delve into the concept of entropy production in the context of statistical mechanics, where it is often associated with the concept of information gain. This aspect of entropy production is particularly relevant in the field of information theory, where it is used to quantify the amount of information gained from a random variable.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of entropy production, its mathematical formulation, physical interpretation, and its relevance in statistical mechanics. By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of entropy production and its role in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.




#### 8.3b Second Order Phase Transitions

Second-order phase transitions are characterized by a continuous change in the system's macroscopic properties. Unlike first-order transitions, there is no discontinuity in the system's properties, but rather a smooth change. This is often associated with a change in the system's symmetry, such as the transition from a ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic state in a magnetic system.

The Landau theory can also be applied to second-order phase transitions, but with some modifications. The order parameter in this case is still a quantity that characterizes the state of the system, but it does not change sign as in the first-order case. The free energy functional for a second-order transition can be written as:

$$
F(\eta) = A(T)\eta^2 + \frac{B(T)}{2}\eta^4
$$

where `$A(T)$` and `$B(T)$` are coefficients that depend on the temperature. The coefficients `$A(T)$` and `$B(T)$` are positive, and the free energy is concave upward for all values of the order parameter.

The critical temperature `$T_c$` for a second-order transition is determined by the condition `$B(T_c) = 0$`. Below this temperature, the free energy has a minimum at some non-zero value of the order parameter, indicating the formation of a new phase.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of phase coexistence and its implications for phase transitions.

#### 8.3c Critical Phenomena

Critical phenomena are the physical properties of a system at the critical point of a phase transition. At this point, the system is at the boundary between two phases, and the system's properties exhibit a power-law behavior. This behavior is in contrast to the exponential behavior observed in systems far from the critical point.

The critical point is characterized by the divergence of certain physical quantities, such as the correlation length and the susceptibility. These quantities are related to the fluctuations in the system, and their divergence at the critical point is a manifestation of the system's instability.

The critical exponents, denoted by $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $\delta$, are used to describe the behavior of these quantities near the critical point. The critical exponents are defined as follows:

$$
\alpha = \lim_{T \to T_c} \frac{\partial \ln \chi}{\partial T}, \quad \beta = \lim_{T \to T_c} \frac{\partial \ln M}{\partial T}, \quad \gamma = \lim_{T \to T_c} \frac{\partial \ln \chi}{\partial h}, \quad \delta = \lim_{T \to T_c} \frac{\partial \ln M}{\partial h}
$$

where $\chi$ is the susceptibility, $M$ is the magnetization, and $h$ is the magnetic field.

The critical exponents are universal, meaning they are independent of the specific details of the system, such as the microscopic interactions between the system's constituents. This universality is a consequence of the system's symmetry at the critical point.

The critical exponents for the Ising model, a simple model of a ferromagnet, are given by:

$$
\alpha = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \beta = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \gamma = 1, \quad \delta = 3
$$

These values are in agreement with experimental observations for many ferromagnetic systems.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of phase coexistence and its implications for phase transitions.

#### 8.3d Phase Transitions in Non-equilibrium Systems

Phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems are a fascinating area of study in statistical mechanics. These systems are often driven by external forces, such as electric or magnetic fields, and can exhibit a variety of interesting behaviors.

One of the key concepts in understanding phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems is the concept of a driving force. This force can be represented as a gradient in the system's chemical potential, $\mu$. The driving force can cause a system to evolve from one phase to another, leading to a phase transition.

The Landau theory, which we have discussed in previous sections, can also be applied to non-equilibrium systems. However, in these systems, the order parameter can change sign, leading to a first-order phase transition. The free energy functional for a non-equilibrium system can be written as:

$$
F(\eta) = A(T)\eta^2 + \frac{B(T)}{2}\eta^4 + \frac{C(T)}{6}\eta^6 + \mu \eta
$$

where $A(T)$, $B(T)$, and $C(T)$ are coefficients that depend on the temperature, and $\mu$ is the chemical potential. The coefficients $A(T)$ and $C(T)$ are positive, while $B(T)$ can be either positive or negative.

The critical temperature $T_c$ for a non-equilibrium phase transition is determined by the condition $B(T_c) = 0$. Below this temperature, the free energy has a minimum at some non-zero value of the order parameter, indicating the formation of a new phase.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of phase coexistence and its implications for phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems.

#### 8.3e Phase Transitions in Non-equilibrium Systems

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems. We discussed how the driving force, represented by the gradient in the system's chemical potential, can cause a system to evolve from one phase to another. In this section, we will delve deeper into the topic and discuss the specific case of a non-equilibrium Ising model.

The Ising model is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism, named after the German physicist Ernst Ising. It is a simple model that can be used to describe a variety of physical systems, including phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems.

The non-equilibrium Ising model is a generalization of the equilibrium Ising model. In the non-equilibrium model, the system is driven by an external magnetic field, which can cause the system to evolve from one phase to another.

The Hamiltonian of the non-equilibrium Ising model can be written as:

$$
H = -\sum_{i,j} J_{ij} \sigma_i \sigma_j - h \sum_i \sigma_i
$$

where $J_{ij}$ is the interaction energy between spins $i$ and $j$, $h$ is the external magnetic field, and $\sigma_i$ is the spin of particle $i$.

The non-equilibrium Ising model can exhibit a variety of interesting behaviors, including phase transitions and critical phenomena. These behaviors can be studied using the techniques of statistical mechanics, such as the Landau theory and the concept of a driving force.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of phase coexistence and its implications for phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems.

#### 8.3f Phase Transitions in Non-equilibrium Systems

In this section, we will explore the phase transitions that can occur in non-equilibrium systems, focusing on the case of the non-equilibrium Ising model.

The phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems are often studied using the Landau theory, which provides a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of the system near the critical point. The Landau theory is based on the concept of an order parameter, which characterizes the state of the system. In the case of the non-equilibrium Ising model, the order parameter is the magnetization $M$, which is defined as:

$$
M = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i \sigma_i
$$

where $N$ is the total number of particles in the system.

The Landau theory predicts that the system will undergo a phase transition when the order parameter $M$ becomes non-zero. This transition is characterized by a divergence of the correlation length, which is a measure of the spatial extent of the system's fluctuations.

In the case of the non-equilibrium Ising model, the phase transition can be triggered by the external magnetic field $h$. As the field is increased, the system can evolve from a disordered phase (where the spins are randomly oriented) to an ordered phase (where the spins are aligned with the field). This transition can be studied using the techniques of statistical mechanics, such as the Landau theory and the concept of a driving force.

We introduced the concept of a driving force, represented by the external magnetic field $h$, which can cause the system to evolve from one phase to another. In this section, we will explore the phase transitions that can occur in non-equilibrium systems, focusing on the case of the non-equilibrium Ising model.

The phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems are often studied using the Landau theory, which provides a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of the system near the critical point. The Landau theory is based on the concept of an order parameter, which characterizes the state of the system. In the case of the non-equilibrium Ising model, the order parameter is the magnetization $M$, which is defined as:

$$
M = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i \sigma_i
$$

where $N$ is the total number of particles in the system.

The Landau theory predicts that the system will undergo a phase transition when the order parameter $M$ becomes non-zero. This transition is characterized by a divergence of the correlation length, which is a measure of the spatial extent of the system's fluctuations.

In the case of the non-equilibrium Ising model, the phase transition can be triggered by the external magnetic field $h$. As the field is increased, the system can evolve from a disordered phase (where the spins are randomly oriented) to an ordered phase (where the spins are aligned with the field). This transition can be studied using the techniques of statistical mechanics, such as the Landau theory and the concept of a driving force.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of phase coexistence and its implications for phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems.
