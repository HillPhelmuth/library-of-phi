### Subsection 1.1a Historical Overview

The evolution of international relations has been shaped by various factors, including technological advancements, political ideologies, and global power dynamics. In this section, we will provide a historical overview of international relations, focusing on the key events and developments that have shaped the field.

#### Ancient and Medieval Times

The origins of international relations can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where trade and diplomacy were essential for economic and political survival. The ancient Greeks, for example, had a well-developed system of diplomacy, with the concept of "xenia" or guest-friendship, which governed relations between city-states. The Romans also had a complex system of diplomacy, with the concept of "foedus" or treaty, which was used to establish alliances and agreements between different states.

During the Middle Ages, the rise of feudalism and the decline of the Roman Empire led to a fragmentation of political power, with various city-states and kingdoms vying for control. This period saw the rise of the Crusades, which were a series of religious wars aimed at reclaiming the Holy Land from the Muslims. These wars had significant implications for international relations, as they led to the establishment of new political entities and the expansion of trade routes.

#### Modern Times

The modern era of international relations began with the rise of nation-states and the decline of feudalism. The Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 marked a significant turning point, as it established the principle of sovereignty and non-intervention in the affairs of other states. This led to the development of the Westphalian system of international relations, which is still the basis of modern international law.

The 18th and 19th centuries saw the rise of colonialism and imperialism, with European powers expanding their influence and establishing colonies around the world. This led to the development of the concept of "spheres of influence," where European powers would compete for control over specific regions. The United States emerged as a major player in international relations during this period, with its expansionist policies and the acquisition of territories such as Alaska and Hawaii.

#### The 20th Century and Beyond

The 20th century saw significant changes in international relations, with the rise of totalitarian regimes, World Wars, and the Cold War. The League of Nations, established after World War I, was the first international organization aimed at promoting peace and cooperation among nations. However, it was largely ineffective and was replaced by the United Nations after World War II.

The Cold War, which lasted from 1945 to 1991, was a period of intense political and military competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. This period saw the development of nuclear weapons and the arms race between the two superpowers, leading to the concept of mutually assured destruction (MAD) and the threat of global annihilation.

The end of the Cold War marked a significant shift in international relations, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise of new global powers such as China and India. The 21st century has also seen the rise of non-state actors, such as terrorist organizations, and the increasing importance of cyber warfare in international conflicts.

In conclusion, the evolution of international relations has been shaped by various factors, including technological advancements, political ideologies, and global power dynamics. The historical overview provided in this section highlights the key events and developments that have shaped the field and sets the stage for a deeper exploration of international relations in the following sections.

These concepts and theories provide a framework for understanding the complex dynamics of international relations and help us make sense of the behavior of states in the global arena.

#### Sovereignty

Sovereignty is a fundamental concept in international relations, which refers to the supreme authority of a state over its territory and people. It is a key principle of the Westphalian system and is recognized by international law. Sovereignty is often used to justify non-intervention in the affairs of other states, as it is seen as a violation of a state's sovereignty. However, there are exceptions to this principle, such as in cases of humanitarian intervention or when a state poses a threat to international peace and security.

#### Realism

Realism is a theoretical approach to international relations that emphasizes the role of power and security in shaping state behavior. It is based on the assumption that states are rational actors who seek to maximize their power and security in a competitive and anarchic international system. Realists argue that states are primarily motivated by self-interest and that power is the ultimate determinant of international relations.

#### Liberalism

Liberalism is another theoretical approach to international relations that emphasizes the role of cooperation and interdependence in shaping state behavior. It is based on the assumption that states are interdependent and that cooperation is necessary for mutual benefit. Liberals argue that states are primarily motivated by self-interest, but also by ideology and norms. They also believe in the importance of international institutions and agreements in promoting stability and cooperation among states.

#### Constructivism

Constructivism is a theoretical approach to international relations that emphasizes the role of ideas and norms in shaping state behavior. It is based on the assumption that states are not just rational actors, but also social constructs shaped by their interactions with other states and international institutions. Constructivists argue that ideas and norms can have a significant impact on state behavior and can even shape the interests and identities of states.

#### Postmodernism

Postmodernism is a theoretical approach to international relations that challenges traditional assumptions and theories. It rejects the idea of a single, objective reality and instead emphasizes the role of language and discourse in shaping our understanding of the world. Postmodernists argue that international relations is not just about power and security, but also about identity, culture, and ideology. They also challenge the traditional focus on states and instead emphasize the role of non-state actors in international relations.

#### Critical Theory

Critical theory is a theoretical approach to international relations that focuses on the power dynamics and inequalities in the global system. It is based on the assumption that the current international system is dominated by Western powers and that this system perpetuates injustices and inequalities. Critical theorists argue for a more equitable and just international system, and advocate for the inclusion of marginalized voices in international relations.

#### Post Carbon Institute

The Post Carbon Institute is a non-profit organization that focuses on building community resilience in the face of complex challenges. Their online course, "Think Resilience," provides a framework for understanding the complex challenges facing society and offers strategies for building community resilience. The institute also offers resources and tools for individuals and communities to take action towards a more sustainable and resilient future.

### Subsection 1.3b Impact of Cyberspace on International Relations Theories

The rise of cyberspace has had a significant impact on international relations theories. As the cyber domain becomes increasingly important in global politics, traditional theories of international relations must adapt to account for the unique characteristics and challenges of cyberspace. In this section, we will explore the impact of cyberspace on three major international relations theories: realism, liberalism, and constructivism.

#### Realism and Cyberspace

Realism, a theory that emphasizes the role of power and security in international relations, has traditionally been applied to the physical world. However, with the rise of cyberspace, realism must now also consider the power dynamics and security threats in this virtual domain. The concept of cyberpower, as defined in the National Defense University Press book, aligns with realist principles of power and influence. The book's policy recommendations also reflect a realist approach, emphasizing the need for a strong military presence in cyberspace.

However, realism may struggle to fully account for the complexities of cyberspace. The blurred lines between state actors and non-state actors in this domain challenge traditional notions of power and influence. Additionally, the rapid pace of technological advancements and the constantly evolving nature of cyberspace make it difficult for realism to provide a comprehensive understanding of this domain.

#### Liberalism and Cyberspace

Liberalism, a theory that emphasizes the role of cooperation and interdependence in international relations, has also been impacted by the rise of cyberspace. The concept of cyber interdependence, where states are increasingly reliant on each other for cyber services and infrastructure, aligns with liberal principles of interdependence and cooperation. The liberal approach to cyberspace also emphasizes the need for international cooperation and agreements to address cyber threats and promote cyber stability.

However, liberalism may struggle to fully account for the challenges of cyberspace. The lack of clear boundaries and regulations in this domain make it difficult for liberalism to provide a comprehensive understanding of cyber threats and solutions. Additionally, the unequal distribution of cyber resources and capabilities among states challenges the liberal principle of equal cooperation.

#### Constructivism and Cyberspace

Constructivism, a theory that emphasizes the role of ideas and identities in international relations, has also been impacted by the rise of cyberspace. The concept of cyber identity, where states and actors are shaped by their interactions in cyberspace, aligns with constructivist principles of social construction. The rise of cyber norms and regulations also reflects constructivist ideas of social construction and the role of ideas in shaping international relations.

However, constructivism may struggle to fully account for the challenges of cyberspace. The rapid pace of technological advancements and the constantly evolving nature of cyberspace make it difficult for constructivism to provide a comprehensive understanding of this domain. Additionally, the lack of clear boundaries and regulations in cyberspace challenge the constructivist principle of social construction.

In conclusion, the rise of cyberspace has had a significant impact on international relations theories. While each theory has its strengths and limitations in accounting for cyberspace, a combination of these theories may provide a more comprehensive understanding of this complex domain. As cyberspace continues to evolve and shape global politics, it is crucial for international relations scholars to continue exploring and adapting these theories to account for the unique challenges and opportunities of this domain.

### Subsection: 4.4a Role of Multilateral Efforts in Cyber Governance

Multilateral efforts have played a crucial role in cyber governance, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by cyber threats and promoting cyber cooperation. These efforts have been driven by the need for a coordinated approach to address the complex and interconnected nature of cyber threats.

#### The Need for Multilateral Efforts

The Internet, with its open, distributed, interconnected, participatory, and bottom-up processes, is a prime example of multi-stakeholder participation in governance. However, the unique design and composition of the Internet have also led to challenges in governance. The Internet is not entirely rule-free or law-free, and it is not a different universe to external legal constraints. However, the ways in which the Internet was designed have both allowed and disallowed specific types of behavior online, meaning that the actions that led to the creation of the Internet were already acts of governance (albeit most likely unintended).

The Internet requires non-traditional forms of governance, particularly governance forms that encourage the participation of more stakeholders in addition to governments. This is because the Internet is inherently multi-stakeholder, with features that match multi-stakeholder participation in specific regard to its open, distributed, interconnected, participatory, and bottom-up processes.

#### Multilateral Efforts in Cyber Governance

Multilateral efforts in cyber governance have been driven by the need for a coordinated approach to address the complex and interconnected nature of cyber threats. These efforts have been particularly focused on promoting cyber cooperation and addressing the challenges posed by cyber threats.

One of the key multilateral efforts in cyber governance is the Global Commission on Internet Governance (GCIG). The GCIG was launched in 2014 by two think tanks, the Canadian Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI) and UK-based think tank Chatham House. The GCIG is an independent body that brings together key stakeholders from the public and private sectors to make recommendations about the future of global internet governance.

The GCIG has been instrumental in promoting cyber cooperation and addressing the challenges posed by cyber threats. It has been particularly focused on promoting the principles of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, which is the first international treaty to address cybercrime. The GCIG has also been instrumental in promoting the principles of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which provides a comprehensive overview of the international law applicable to cyber warfare.

In conclusion, multilateral efforts have played a crucial role in cyber governance, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by cyber threats and promoting cyber cooperation. These efforts have been driven by the need for a coordinated approach to address the complex and interconnected nature of cyber threats.




### Subsection: 4.4b Impact of Multilateral Efforts on Cybersecurity

Multilateral efforts in cyber governance have had a significant impact on cybersecurity. These efforts have been instrumental in promoting cyber cooperation and addressing the challenges posed by cyber threats.

Multilateral efforts have been crucial in promoting cyber cooperation among different stakeholders. The International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber Threats (IMPACT), for instance, serves as a key platform for governments, industry, and academia to enhance their capabilities in dealing with cyber threats. With a total of 152 countries now formally part of the ITU-IMPACT coalition, and with strong support from industry giants, partners from academia and international organizations, IMPACT is the largest cybersecurity alliance of its kind.

IMPACT's operational home is in Cyberjaya, Malaysia, and it serves as the operational home of ITU's Global Cybersecurity Agenda (GCA). This alliance offers ITU's Member States with access to expertise, facilities, and resources to effectively address cyber threats, as well as assisting United Nations agencies in protecting their ICT infrastructures.

#### Addressing Cyber Threats

Multilateral efforts have also been instrumental in addressing cyber threats. The IMPACT initiative, for instance, was first announced by the fifth prime minister of Malaysia during the closing ceremony of the 15th World Congress on Information Technology (WCIT) 2006, held in the Austin, Texas, United States. Initially, IMPACT was known as the 'International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber-Terrorism'. However, following feedback from member governments and the international advisory board (IAB) during IMPACT's official launch at the World Cyber Security Summit 2008 (WCSS), the words "cyber-terrorism" were removed from the name.

The IMPACT initiative has been instrumental in promoting cyber cooperation and addressing the challenges posed by cyber threats. It has also been instrumental in promoting a coordinated approach to cyber governance, which is crucial in addressing the complex and interconnected nature of cyber threats.

#### The Need for Multilateral Efforts

The Internet, with its open, distributed, interconnected, participatory, and bottom-up processes, is a prime example of multi-stakeholder participation in governance. However, the unique design and composition of the Internet have also led to challenges in governance. The Internet requires non-traditional forms of governance, particularly governance forms that encourage the participation of more stakeholders in addition to governments.

### Subsection: 4.4c Case Studies of Multilateral Efforts in Cyber Governance

#### The Global Commission on Internet Governance

The Global Commission on Internet Governance (GCIG) is a prime example of a multilateral effort in cyber governance. Launched in January 2014 by two think tanks, the Canadian Centre for International Governance Innovation and UK-based Chatham House, the GCIG is chaired by Carl Bildt. The Commission's research advisory network, led by Laura DeNardis, produces original research on Internet Governance topics such as the dark web, cybersecurity, and internet freedom.

One of the notable research publications of the GCIG is "Who Runs the Internet? The Global Multi-stakeholder Model of Internet Governance" (January 2017). This research describes a "multistakeholder" framework wherein the management of the global Internet architecture is in the hands of a cluster of international stakeholders such as industry, academic, and non-governmental actors. This research has been instrumental in promoting the concept of multistakeholder governance in cyber issues.

#### The Evolution of Multi-stakeholder Participation

The concept of multi-stakeholder participation and governance mechanisms may be a 'rather recent invention', but it has a longer tradition as an 'organizing principle and political practice'. Such approaches are far from unique to Internet governance; with claims of their application and use especially prevalent in topics with cross-border or international relevance. Examples include labor relations, environmental protection, finance, human rights, and sustainable development.

Where the Internet is concerned, multi-stakeholder participation in its governance seems to possibly be both intrinsic – and more complicated – than in many other instances of multi-stakeholder participation. The Internet's global nature, its complex architecture, and the diverse interests of its users make it a unique case. However, the principles of multi-stakeholder participation and governance have been instrumental in promoting cyber cooperation and addressing the challenges posed by cyber threats.

#### The International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber Threats (IMPACT)

The International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber Threats (IMPACT) is another prime example of a multilateral effort in cyber governance. With a total of 152 countries now formally part of the ITU-IMPACT coalition, and with strong support from industry partners, IMPACT serves as a key platform for governments, industry, and academia to enhance their capabilities in dealing with cyber threats.

IMPACT's operational home is in Cyberjaya, Malaysia, and it serves as the operational home of ITU's Global Cybersecurity Agenda (GCA). This alliance offers ITU's Member States with access to expertise, facilities, and resources to effectively address cyber threats, as well as assisting United Nations agencies in protecting their ICT infrastructures.

In conclusion, multilateral efforts in cyber governance have been instrumental in promoting cyber cooperation and addressing the challenges posed by cyber threats. The Global Commission on Internet Governance, the International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber Threats, and the concept of multi-stakeholder participation and governance are prime examples of these efforts.

### Conclusion

# Global Commission on Internet Governance

The Global Commission on Internet Governance, chaired by Carl Bildt and launched by two think tanks, the Canadian Centre for International Governance Innovation and UK-based Chatham House, was formed in January 2014 to make recommendations about the future of global internet governance. It is also considered one of the international initiatives that facilitate effective cooperation between relevant international actors, particularly according to the principles of internet governance. 

## Activities

The Commission's research advisory network, led by Laura DeNardis, produces original research on Internet Governance topics such as the dark web, cybersecurity, and internet freedom. For instance, a research published in January 2017 entitled "Who Runs the Internet? The Global Multi-stakeholder Model of Internet Governance" described a "multistakeholder" framework wherein the management of the global Internet architecture is in the hands of a cluster of international stakeholders such as industry, academic and non-governmental actors. There is a criticism from some countries against the current attempts at a multistakeholder process that cite how these appear to be led by Western nations # Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace

## Other publications

In addition to the "Norm to Protect the Public Core" and the seven subsequent norms, the GCSC has published several other documents.

### Definition of the Public Core, to which the Norm Applies

Early in the process of defining the "Norm to Protect the Public Core" the effort was divided into two working groups, one, principally diplomatic, to specify what actions should be precluded; the other, involving subject-matter experts, to specify which infrastructures were deemed most worthy of protection. This latter working group specified a survey of cybersecurity experts, delegated implementation of the survey to Packet Clearing House, and integrated its results to form the definition of the public core. The public core is defined as the critical infrastructure that is essential for the functioning of the global internet architecture. This includes the physical infrastructure such as cables and servers, as well as the software and protocols that enable the internet to function. The public core is also considered to be the backbone of the internet, with all other networks and systems relying on it for connectivity and services. The definition of the public core is crucial for the implementation of the "Norm to Protect the Public Core", as it determines the scope of protection and the actions that are considered to be within the norm. The definition also highlights the importance of protecting the public core from cyber threats and attacks, as any disruption or damage to the public core can have a cascading effect on the entire internet architecture.

### Subsection: 5.1b Challenges Faced by International Institutions in Cyber Governance

International institutions play a crucial role in cyber governance, providing a framework for cooperation and coordination among states. However, these institutions face numerous challenges in their efforts to regulate and manage cyber activities. In this section, we will explore some of the key challenges faced by international institutions in cyber governance.

#### Sovereign States and Private Order

One of the main challenges faced by international institutions in cyber governance is the issue of sovereign states and private order. The traditional Westphalian model of state sovereignty, which emphasizes the supremacy of the state within its borders, has been challenged by the transborder nature of cyber activities. This has led to debates about the extent to which states can regulate and control cyber activities within their borders, and the role of international institutions in this regard.

Moreover, the role of private actors in cyber governance has also become a significant issue. Private companies and organizations play a crucial role in the development and management of the Internet, and their actions can have significant implications for cyber governance. However, these private actors are not subject to the same regulations and oversight as states, creating challenges for international institutions in regulating and managing cyber activities.

#### Ad Hoc Arrangements

Another challenge faced by international institutions in cyber governance is the prevalence of ad hoc arrangements. The rapid pace of technological advancements and the constantly evolving nature of cyber threats have led to the development of ad hoc arrangements for addressing specific cyber issues. These arrangements are often temporary and informal, making it challenging for international institutions to establish a comprehensive and coordinated approach to cyber governance.

#### Case Studies

To further illustrate these challenges, let us examine two case studies: the Global Commission on Internet Governance and the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace.

The Global Commission on Internet Governance, launched in 2014, aimed to make recommendations about the future of global internet governance. However, the commission faced challenges in its efforts to establish a comprehensive and coordinated approach to cyber governance. The commission's recommendations were often met with resistance from states and private actors, highlighting the challenges of regulating and managing cyber activities.

The Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, launched in 2017, faced similar challenges. The commission's efforts to establish norms and rules for responsible state behavior in cyberspace were met with resistance from states and private actors. The commission's definition of the "public core of the Internet," which includes packet routing and forwarding, naming and numbering systems, and physical transmission media, has been criticized for its lack of specificity and enforceability.

In conclusion, international institutions face numerous challenges in their efforts to regulate and manage cyber activities. These challenges include the issue of sovereign states and private order, the prevalence of ad hoc arrangements, and the lack of consensus on cyber norms and rules. Addressing these challenges will require a comprehensive and coordinated approach from international institutions, states, and private actors.

Another important case study is the impact of NSAs on digital literacy in the context of SSI technology. As SSI technology assumes a certain level of digital literacy, NSAs play a crucial role in shaping digital literacy initiatives. For instance, technology companies may provide digital literacy training programs to their users, while non-profit organizations may offer similar programs in underserved communities.

However, critics argue that these initiatives may not be sufficient to address the digital literacy gap. The assumption of digital literacy in SSI technology can lead to exclusion and reduced access to the benefits of SSI for those who lack these skills. This can further exacerbate social inequalities and create barriers to participation in the digital world.

#### 5.4c.3 Case Study 3: Self-Sovereign Identity and Semantic Confusion

The term "self-sovereign identity" can create expectations that individuals have absolute control and ownership over their digital identities, akin to physical possessions. However, in practice, SSI involves complex technical infrastructure, interactions with identity issuers and verifiers, and compliance with legal frameworks. This can lead to semantic confusion and misalignment between the perception generated by the term and the reality of its implementation.

NSAs play a crucial role in shaping this semantic confusion. For instance, technology companies may use the term "self-sovereign identity" to market their products, while non-profit organizations may use it to advocate for user control over digital identities. This can create conflicting perceptions and expectations, leading to confusion among users and the public at large.

In conclusion, these case studies highlight the profound impact of NSAs on international cyber politics. Their involvement in the implementation and development of SSI technology can lead to semantic confusion, exclusion of marginalized populations, and exacerbation of social inequalities. As such, it is crucial to consider the role of NSAs in cyber politics when developing and implementing cyber policies and regulations.

One of the most significant impacts of international organizations on cyber norms and rules has been the development of the "Norm to Protect the Public Core" by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC). This norm, along with the seven subsequent norms developed by the GCSC, has set the standard for responsible state behavior in cyberspace. It has also served as a framework for other international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), to develop their own norms and rules.

The GCSC's "Definition of the Public Core, to which the Norm Applies" has also had a significant impact on cyber norms and rules. This definition, which includes packet routing and forwarding, naming and numbering systems, and physical transmission media, has been used by other international organizations as a standardized description of the principal elements of Internet critical infrastructure. This has helped to create a common understanding of what constitutes the public core of the internet, making it easier for states to agree on norms and rules for protecting it.

Furthermore, international organizations have also played a crucial role in promoting the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. This model, which involves the participation of all stakeholders, including governments, industry, academia, and civil society, is key to maintaining Internet stability. The GCSC's statement on the interpretation of the norm on non-interference with the public core has reiterated the importance of this model and has helped to promote consensus on this issue.

In conclusion, international organizations have had a significant impact on the evolution of cyber norms and rules. Their efforts have led to the development of key documents and initiatives that have set the foundation for responsible state behavior in cyberspace. As the cyber landscape continues to evolve, the role of international organizations will only become more crucial in shaping the future of cyber norms and rules.

However, the lack of clear guidelines and regulations in this field has led to challenges in addressing cyber threats and protecting sensitive information.

In this section, we will explore the role of international law in cyber security. International law plays a crucial role in regulating state behavior in the cyber domain, as it sets the rules and norms for how states interact with each other. It also provides a framework for addressing cyber threats and protecting the rights of individuals and organizations.

#### 7.1a Role of International Law in Cyber Security

International law has been slow to adapt to the rapidly evolving cyber landscape, and there is still no comprehensive international agreement on cyber security. However, there are several international legal instruments that address cyber security, such as the Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest, 23 Nov 2001) and the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The Convention on Cybercrime, also known as the Budapest Convention, is the first international treaty to address cybercrime. It provides a framework for cooperation and information sharing between signatory countries in investigating and prosecuting cybercrimes. The convention also sets out specific offenses, such as illegal access, interference with data, and computer-related fraud, and provides guidelines for lawful interception of communications.

In the European Union, the GDPR has become a key piece of legislation in regulating data protection and privacy in the cyber domain. It sets out strict rules for how organizations handle personal data, including the right to be forgotten and the right to data portability. The GDPR also includes provisions for data breach notification and the appointment of a data protection officer.

#### 7.1b Challenges of International Law in Cyber Security

While international law plays a crucial role in cyber security, there are several challenges that hinder its effectiveness. One of the main challenges is the lack of consensus among states on what constitutes a cyber threat and how to address it. This has led to varying interpretations of international law and different approaches to cyber security.

Another challenge is the difficulty in attributing cyber attacks to specific actors or states. This makes it challenging to hold perpetrators accountable and enforce international law in the cyber domain. Additionally, the rapid pace of technological advancements and the constantly evolving nature of cyber threats make it difficult for international law to keep up and effectively regulate the cyber landscape.

This makes it difficult to determine the legal boundaries of a cyber attack and who is responsible for it.

Another challenge is the difficulty in attributing cyber attacks to specific actors. In traditional warfare, it is relatively easy to identify the perpetrator of an attack, but in cyberspace, it can be nearly impossible. This is due to the anonymity and decentralized nature of the internet, which makes it difficult to trace the source of an attack. This lack of attribution can make it challenging to hold perpetrators accountable and enforce international law.

The rapid pace of technological advancements in cyberspace also poses a challenge for international law. As new technologies emerge and existing ones evolve, it can be difficult for international law to keep up. This can create legal grey areas and loopholes that can be exploited by malicious actors.

Furthermore, the lack of consensus on what constitutes a cyber attack and who is responsible for it can lead to conflicting interpretations of international law. This can create legal ambiguity and hinder the enforcement of international law in cyberspace.

In addition to these challenges, there is also a lack of consensus on how to address cyber threats. Some countries may prioritize privacy and data protection, while others may prioritize national security. This can create conflicts between different legal frameworks and make it difficult to establish a universal standard for addressing cyber threats.

Despite these challenges, there have been efforts to address them. The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, for example, provides a framework for understanding and applying international law to cyberspace. It also addresses some of the challenges mentioned above, such as attribution and the definition of a cyber attack.

In conclusion, the application of international law to cyberspace presents a unique set of challenges. These challenges must be addressed in order to establish a framework for addressing cyber threats and promoting international stability in cyberspace.

Non-state actors (NSAs) play a significant role in cyber diplomacy, particularly in the United States. These actors, which include corporations, transnational networks, foundations, NGOs, religious groups, and citizens themselves, have become increasingly influential in shaping national debates and foreign policy decisions. Their involvement in cyber diplomacy is a direct response to the U.S. Department of State's embrace of 21st century statecraft, which seeks to leverage the power and potential of these actors to advance U.S. foreign policy goals.

The U.S. Department of State's official explanation of 21st century diplomacy is that it is the United States' adaptation to an increasingly varied set of actors who influence national debates, such as an increasing amount of states capable of acting on their own diplomatic agendas, corporations, transnational networks, foundations, NGOs, religious groups and citizens themselves. This adaptation is necessary because these actors have the ability to shape public opinion and influence policy decisions, making them key players in cyber diplomacy.

The incentive to create and embrace U.S. cyber-diplomacy and 21st century statecraft is to connect the private and civic sectors with U.S. foreign policy efforts by utilizing new resources; connection technologies and expanding, facilitating, and streamlining our public-private partnership process. This is particularly important in the context of cyber diplomacy, where the private sector often holds the keys to critical infrastructure and technology.

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton explained the concept as "We're working to leverage the power and potential in what I call 21st century statecraft. Part of our approach is to embrace new tools, like using cell phones for mobile banking or to monitor elections. But we're also reaching to the people behind these tools, the innovators and entrepreneurs themselves." This approach has led the State Department to currently have 230 Facebook pages, 80 Twitter accounts, 55 channels on YouTube and 40 accounts on Flickr. The State Department has also founded many cyber-diplomacy programs and initiatives. Some of these programs are Dipnote, Digital Outreach Team, Opinion Space, Democracy Dialogues and Civil Society.

## Chapter 9: Cyber Warfare and International Security:




### Subsection: 9.1a Role of Cyber Warfare in International Security

Cyber warfare has become a critical component of international security, with the potential to disrupt and destroy critical infrastructure, steal sensitive information, and cause widespread chaos. In this section, we will explore the role of cyber warfare in international security, including its impact on traditional warfare and the challenges it presents for international law.

#### The Impact of Cyber Warfare on Traditional Warfare

The rise of cyber warfare has fundamentally changed the dynamics of traditional warfare. In the past, warfare was primarily conducted on physical battlefields, with armies engaging in direct combat. However, with the advent of cyber warfare, the battlefield has expanded to include the digital realm. This has allowed for new tactics and strategies to be employed, such as the use of malware and hacking to disrupt enemy systems and gather intelligence.

Moreover, cyber warfare has also blurred the lines between offense and defense. In traditional warfare, armies were primarily concerned with defending their territory and attacking the enemy. However, in cyber warfare, the lines between offense and defense are often blurred, as attacks can come from both external and internal sources. This has made it difficult for nations to prepare and defend against cyber attacks, as they must constantly monitor and protect their systems from both external threats and potential insider attacks.

#### The Challenges of Cyber Warfare for International Law

The use of cyber warfare also presents significant challenges for international law. Traditional warfare is governed by a set of rules and regulations, such as the Geneva Conventions, which outline the rights and responsibilities of combatants. However, these rules and regulations were not designed to address cyber warfare, and there is currently no international agreement on how to regulate cyber attacks.

One of the main challenges of cyber warfare for international law is the difficulty in attributing attacks to specific actors.

The Open Source Enterprise (OSE) is another example of a non-state actor that plays a significant role in cyber security and human rights. The OSE is a collaborative effort to develop and distribute open source software, which can enhance cyber security by increasing the number of eyes on the code and reducing the risk of vulnerabilities. However, the OSE also raises concerns about intellectual property rights.

The OSE operates under the principles of the GNU General Public License (GPL), which allows for the free distribution and modification of software. However, this can lead to disputes over intellectual property rights, particularly in cases where the original author of the software may not be adequately recognized or compensated for their work. This can be a challenge for both the OSE and the software developers involved, particularly in cases where the software is used for commercial purposes.

#### Case Study 3: Encryption and Human Rights

The use of encryption by non-state actors, such as corporations and individuals, is a critical aspect of cyber security. Encryption can protect personal data and privacy, and it can also be used to protect freedom of expression by ensuring the confidentiality of communications. However, the use of encryption can also pose challenges for human rights, particularly in cases where governments may seek to limit its use.

For instance, the United States government has been known to advocate for the inclusion of backdoors in encryption systems, which would allow for government access to encrypted data. This can be seen as a violation of human rights, particularly the right to privacy. Similarly, the use of encryption by corporations can also raise concerns about the protection of human rights, particularly in cases where the corporation may seek to limit the user's ability to access or modify their data.

In conclusion, the role of non-state actors in cyber security and human rights is multifaceted and complex. Their actions can have profound impacts on the landscape of cyber security and human rights, and it is crucial to understand these impacts in order to effectively navigate the challenges they pose.

IMPACT, a non-governmental organization, works towards promoting international cooperation and collaboration in addressing cyber threats. By bringing together governments, private sector entities, and civil society organizations, IMPACT helps address cyber threats and promote cyber security in a global context.

In conclusion, non-state actors play a crucial role in both cyber security and cultural development. Their global reach and influence make them key players in promoting cultural understanding and dialogue, as well as protecting and securing cyberspace. By understanding the role of NSAs, we can better address global challenges and promote international cooperation in the digital age.
