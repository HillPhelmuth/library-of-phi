## Foreward

Welcome to "Use of Joint Fact Finding in Science Intensive Policy Disputes, Part II". In this book, we will delve deeper into the concept of joint fact finding and its role in resolving science intensive policy disputes. As we continue to navigate through complex and contentious issues in various fields, the need for effective and collaborative problem-solving techniques has become increasingly apparent.

In the previous volume, we explored the fundamentals of joint fact finding and its potential for resolving policy disputes. We discussed the importance of collaboration, transparency, and mutual understanding in the process. In this volume, we will build upon those foundations and explore more advanced techniques and strategies for effective joint fact finding.

One of the key themes of this book is the role of joint fact finding in addressing the politicization of science. As we have seen in recent years, political agendas and ideologies can often influence the interpretation and dissemination of scientific research. This can lead to confusion, mistrust, and ultimately, ineffective policy decisions. Joint fact finding provides a framework for addressing these issues by promoting open and transparent dialogue between all stakeholders.

We will also explore the concept of "merchants of doubt," as described by Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway in their book "Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming". These individuals and organizations have a vested interest in creating doubt and confusion around scientific issues, often using tactics such as shifting the conversation and capitalizing on uncertainty. Joint fact finding can help to counteract these tactics by promoting a more comprehensive and transparent understanding of the issues at hand.

Throughout this book, we will also discuss the importance of academic and scientific freedom in the joint fact finding process. As we have seen in the past, political pressure can lead to self-censorship and the suppression of dissenting views. Joint fact finding promotes a culture of open dialogue and mutual respect, allowing for a more diverse range of perspectives to be considered.

In conclusion, this book aims to provide a comprehensive guide to using joint fact finding in science intensive policy disputes. We will explore advanced techniques and strategies, as well as the role of joint fact finding in addressing the politicization of science. By promoting collaboration, transparency, and mutual understanding, joint fact finding can play a crucial role in resolving complex and contentious issues.

### Section 1.2 Traditional Adversarial Approach to Environmental Policy:

The traditional approach to environmental policy has been heavily influenced by the adversarial legal system. This approach is characterized by a formalized process where two opposing parties present their arguments and evidence to a neutral decision-maker, such as a judge or jury. The goal of this approach is to determine the truth and apply it to the case at hand.

In the context of environmental policy, the traditional adversarial approach has been used to address disputes between different stakeholders, such as industry and environmental groups. This approach has been criticized for its lack of transparency and inclusivity, as well as its inability to address complex and interconnected environmental issues.

### Subsection 1.2a Definition and History

The traditional adversarial approach to environmental policy can be traced back to the early 20th century, when environmental issues began to gain more attention. The approach was heavily influenced by the legal system, as environmental disputes often ended up in court. This approach was also influenced by the prevailing political and economic climate of the time, which favored individual rights and property ownership over environmental concerns.

The traditional adversarial approach has been used in a variety of environmental policy disputes, including air and water pollution, hazardous waste, and endangered species. In these disputes, the opposing parties present their arguments and evidence to a neutral decision-maker, who then makes a decision based on the evidence presented. This approach has been criticized for its lack of transparency and inclusivity, as well as its inability to address complex and interconnected environmental issues.

### Subsection 1.2b Criticisms and Limitations

The traditional adversarial approach to environmental policy has faced criticism for its lack of transparency and inclusivity. This approach often excludes the voices of marginalized communities and does not consider the long-term impacts of environmental decisions. Additionally, the adversarial nature of this approach can lead to polarization and hinder effective communication between opposing parties.

Furthermore, the traditional adversarial approach has been criticized for its inability to address complex and interconnected environmental issues. Environmental problems often require a collaborative and holistic approach, which is not well-suited to the adversarial system. This approach also does not consider the potential unintended consequences of environmental decisions, which can have long-lasting impacts on both the environment and society.

### Subsection 1.2c Case Studies and Examples

To further illustrate the limitations of the traditional adversarial approach to environmental policy, let us examine two case studies: the Clean Power Plan and the Dakota Access Pipeline.

The Clean Power Plan, implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2015, aimed to reduce carbon emissions from power plants. This plan faced significant opposition from the fossil fuel industry, which argued that it would harm the economy and create job losses. The traditional adversarial approach was used to address this dispute, with the EPA presenting evidence of the plan's benefits and the industry presenting evidence of its negative impacts. The decision was ultimately made by the Supreme Court, which stayed the implementation of the plan pending further legal review.

The Dakota Access Pipeline, completed in 2017, faced significant opposition from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, who argued that the pipeline would harm their sacred sites and water supply. The traditional adversarial approach was used to address this dispute, with the tribe presenting evidence of the pipeline's potential impacts and the company presenting evidence of its safety measures. The decision was ultimately made by the Army Corps of Engineers, who granted a permit for the pipeline's construction.

These case studies highlight the limitations of the traditional adversarial approach to environmental policy. In both cases, the approach failed to address the complex and interconnected issues at hand, and the decisions ultimately made had significant impacts on both the environment and affected communities.

### Conclusion

The traditional adversarial approach to environmental policy has been heavily criticized for its lack of transparency, inclusivity, and ability to address complex environmental issues. As we continue to face pressing environmental challenges, it is crucial to explore alternative approaches that prioritize collaboration, inclusivity, and long-term sustainability. In the next section, we will explore the concept of joint fact finding and its potential to address these limitations.

### Subsection 1.4a Role of Scientists in Policy Making

Scientists play a crucial role in policy making, particularly in science-intensive policy disputes. Their expertise and knowledge are invaluable in informing policy decisions and developing effective solutions. However, the role of scientists in policy making is not without its challenges and complexities.

#### 1.4a.1 Scientists as Policy Advisors

Scientists often serve as policy advisors, providing expert advice and guidance to policymakers. This role is particularly important in science-intensive policy disputes, where the issues are complex and require a deep understanding of scientific principles and evidence. Scientists can help policymakers understand the scientific basis of the issue, the potential impacts of different policy options, and the uncertainties and risks associated with each option.

For example, in the case of climate change, scientists have been instrumental in providing policymakers with information about the scientific basis of climate change, the potential impacts of climate change on ecosystems and human societies, and the uncertainties and risks associated with climate change. This information has been crucial in informing policy decisions and developing strategies to address climate change.

#### 1.4a.2 Scientists as Policy Advocates

In addition to serving as policy advisors, scientists can also serve as policy advocates, advocating for policies that they believe are based on sound scientific evidence. This role can be particularly contentious, as it involves scientists taking a stance on policy issues that may be politically charged.

For instance, in the case of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), some scientists have been vocal advocates for the use of GMOs in agriculture, arguing that they offer significant benefits in terms of increased crop yields and reduced environmental impact. However, other scientists have raised concerns about the potential risks associated with GMOs, leading to a contentious policy debate.

#### 1.4a.3 Scientists as Policy Makers

In some cases, scientists can also serve as policy makers, directly participating in the development and implementation of policies. This role is particularly common in areas where scientific expertise is critical, such as in the development of regulations for new technologies or the management of natural resources.

For example, in the case of the Endangered Species Act in the United States, scientists play a crucial role in determining which species should be listed as endangered or threatened, and in developing management plans for these species. This role requires a deep understanding of the scientific principles and evidence related to the species, as well as the ability to navigate the complex political and social dynamics of policy making.

In conclusion, scientists play a crucial role in policy making, serving as policy advisors, advocates, and even policy makers. Their expertise and knowledge are invaluable in informing policy decisions and developing effective solutions. However, the role of scientists in policy making is not without its challenges and complexities, requiring a deep understanding of both scientific principles and policy dynamics.

### Section: 2.2 Unanswered Questions from Fall Seminar:

In the previous chapter, we discussed the importance of joint fact finding in science-intensive policy disputes and how it can be used to bridge the gap between conflicting parties. However, as with any method, there are always unanswered questions that arise when applying joint fact finding in real-world scenarios. In this section, we will explore some of the unanswered questions that arose from the fall seminar and discuss potential strategies for addressing them.

#### 2.2c Plan for Addressing Unanswered Questions

As we have seen, there are many unanswered questions that arise when applying joint fact finding in science-intensive policy disputes. These questions range from the practical to the theoretical and require careful consideration and planning in order to address them effectively. In this subsection, we will discuss a plan for addressing these unanswered questions and how it can be implemented in future research and applications of joint fact finding.

One of the key challenges in addressing unanswered questions is the lack of a clear and standardized approach. As we have seen, different researchers and practitioners may have different methods and techniques for addressing these questions. This can lead to confusion and inconsistency in the results and conclusions drawn from joint fact finding. To address this challenge, we propose a standardized plan for addressing unanswered questions in joint fact finding.

The first step in this plan is to establish a set of guidelines and protocols for conducting joint fact finding. These guidelines should outline the steps and procedures for conducting joint fact finding, as well as the roles and responsibilities of all parties involved. This will help ensure consistency and transparency in the process, making it easier to address unanswered questions.

Next, we propose the use of a standardized questionnaire for collecting and organizing unanswered questions. This questionnaire should be developed in collaboration with experts in the field and should cover a wide range of topics and areas of concern. By using a standardized questionnaire, researchers and practitioners can ensure that all relevant questions are being addressed and can easily track and compare responses.

In addition to the questionnaire, we also propose the use of a database for storing and organizing unanswered questions. This database should be accessible to all parties involved and should allow for easy search and retrieval of questions. By using a database, researchers and practitioners can easily track and update responses to unanswered questions, making it easier to address them in a timely and effective manner.

Finally, we propose the establishment of a working group or committee for addressing unanswered questions. This group should consist of experts in the field and should be responsible for reviewing and addressing unanswered questions. By having a dedicated group for this purpose, we can ensure that unanswered questions are being addressed in a systematic and thorough manner.

In conclusion, addressing unanswered questions is crucial for the successful application of joint fact finding in science-intensive policy disputes. By establishing guidelines, using a standardized questionnaire and database, and establishing a working group, we can ensure that unanswered questions are being addressed in a consistent and effective manner. This will not only improve the quality of joint fact finding, but also increase its effectiveness in resolving policy disputes.

## Chapter: Use of Joint Fact Finding in Science Intensive Policy Disputes, Part II

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we discussed the importance of joint fact finding in science-intensive policy disputes. We explored how this method can be used to bridge the gap between conflicting parties and find common ground. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic and focus on the role of joint fact finding in the policy process.

The policy process is a complex and dynamic one, involving multiple stakeholders and interests. It is often characterized by conflicting views and opinions, making it challenging to reach a consensus. In such cases, joint fact finding can be a valuable tool in finding a mutually beneficial solution. By bringing together all parties involved and using a collaborative approach, joint fact finding can help to identify common goals and objectives, and find ways to address the concerns of all stakeholders.

In this chapter, we will explore the various aspects of joint fact finding in the policy process. We will discuss the benefits and challenges of using this method, as well as the key factors that contribute to its success. We will also examine case studies and real-world examples to provide a better understanding of how joint fact finding can be applied in different policy contexts.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive guide to using joint fact finding in the policy process. By the end, readers will have a better understanding of the role of joint fact finding in addressing science-intensive policy disputes and how it can be used to find effective solutions.

 # Second-order co-occurrence pointwise mutual information

## Methodology

The method considers the words that are common in both lists and aggregate their PMI values (from the opposite list) to calculate the relative semantic similarity. We define the "pointwise mutual information" function for only those words having <math>f^b (t_i, w)>0</math>,

</math>

where <math>f^t (t_i)</math> tells us how many times the type <math>t_i</math> appeared in the entire corpus, <math>f^b(t_i, w)</math> tells us how many times word <math>t_i</math> appeared with word <math>w</math> in a context window and <math>m</math> is total number of tokens in the corpus. Now, for word <math>w</math>, we define a set of words, <math>X^w</math>, sorted in descending order by their PMI values with <math>w</math> and taken the top-most <math>\beta</math> words having <math>f^\text{pmi}(t_i, w)>0</math>.

The set <math>X^w</math>, contains words <math>X_i^w</math>, 

A rule of thumb is used to choose the value of <math>\beta</math>. The "<math>\beta</math>-PMI summation" function of a word is defined with respect to another word. For word <math>w_1</math> with respect to word <math>w_2</math> it is:

f(w_1,w_2,\beta)=\sum_{i=1}^\beta (f^\text{pmi}(X_i^{w_1},w_2))^\gamma
</math>

where <math>f^\text{pmi}(X_i^{w_1},w_2)>0</math> which sums all the positive PMI values of words in the set <math>X^{w_1}</math> also common to the words in the set <math>X^{w_2}</math>. In other words, this function actually aggregates the positive PMI values of all the semantically close words of <math>w_2</math> which are also common in <math>w_1</math>'s list. <math>\gamma</math> should have a value greater than 1. So, the "<math>\beta</math>-PMI summation" function

## Chapter 3: Case Studies of Joint Fact Finding:




### Section: 2.3b Steps in Developing a Joint Fact Finding Model

In the previous section, we discussed the importance of joint fact finding in science-intensive policy disputes. In this section, we will delve into the steps involved in developing a joint fact finding model.

#### 2.3b.1 Identifying the Dispute

The first step in developing a joint fact finding model is to identify the dispute. This involves understanding the key issues, stakeholders, and their perspectives. It is important to note that the dispute may not be limited to the scientific aspects alone, but may also involve socio-economic, political, and ethical considerations.

#### 2.3b.2 Defining the Scope

Once the dispute has been identified, the next step is to define the scope of the joint fact finding model. This involves determining the scope of the investigation, the types of data to be collected, and the methods to be used. The scope should be broad enough to address the key issues, but narrow enough to be manageable.

#### 2.3b.3 Selecting the Methodology

The methodology used in joint fact finding should be appropriate for the specific dispute. As discussed in the previous section, the second-order co-occurrence pointwise mutual information methodology can be used to consider the words that are common in both lists and aggregate their PMI values to calculate the relative semantic similarity. This methodology can be particularly useful in science-intensive policy disputes where there may be a large amount of complex data.

#### 2.3b.4 Implementing the Model

Once the methodology has been selected, the next step is to implement the joint fact finding model. This involves collecting and analyzing the data, and communicating the findings to the stakeholders. The model should be flexible enough to accommodate new information and adapt to changes in the dispute.

#### 2.3b.5 Evaluating the Model

The final step in developing a joint fact finding model is to evaluate its effectiveness. This involves assessing the accuracy and reliability of the findings, and determining whether the model has helped to resolve the dispute. Feedback from the stakeholders can be particularly useful in this evaluation process.

In conclusion, developing a joint fact finding model is a complex process that requires careful planning and execution. However, when done effectively, it can provide valuable insights into science-intensive policy disputes and help to inform evidence-based decision making.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the use of joint fact finding in science-intensive policy disputes. We have seen how this approach can be used to bridge the gap between conflicting parties and facilitate a more productive dialogue. By focusing on the facts and evidence, joint fact finding allows for a more objective and transparent decision-making process. It also provides a platform for all parties to voice their concerns and perspectives, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the issue at hand.

We have also discussed the challenges and limitations of joint fact finding. These include the potential for manipulation of facts, the complexity of scientific information, and the unequal power dynamics that can exist between parties. However, with careful planning and implementation, these challenges can be mitigated, and the benefits of joint fact finding can be realized.

In conclusion, joint fact finding is a valuable tool in science-intensive policy disputes. It provides a structured and transparent process for resolving conflicts, and can lead to more informed and sustainable decisions.

This chapter will guide you through the process of designing and conducting role-play simulations for science-intensive policy disputes. We will discuss the key elements of a successful simulation, including the selection of roles, the development of a realistic scenario, and the facilitation of the simulation. We will also provide examples and case studies to illustrate the use of role-play simulations in different policy contexts.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of role-play simulations and their role in joint fact finding. You will be equipped with the knowledge and skills to design and conduct effective simulations in your own policy disputes, fostering collaboration and understanding among stakeholders.




### Section: 6.1 Learning and Research Tools:

#### 6.1a Role of Simulations in Learning

Simulations play a crucial role in the learning process, particularly in the context of science-intensive policy disputes. They provide a safe and controlled environment for learners to explore complex systems and processes, test hypotheses, and make mistakes without real-world consequences. This section will explore the role of simulations in learning, focusing on their use in role-play simulations.

Role-play simulations are a form of experiential learning, where learners assume the roles of various stakeholders in a policy dispute and engage in a simulated dispute. This approach allows learners to understand the complexities of the dispute from different perspectives, fostering collaboration and understanding among stakeholders.

The simulation gaming process, as described by Kolb (1984), involves four phases: concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation. In the context of role-play simulations, the concrete experience phase involves the learners' active participation in the simulation, assuming the roles of various stakeholders and engaging in a simulated dispute. The reflective observation phase involves the learners' reflection on their experience, identifying key issues and events, and discussing their implications. The abstract conceptualization phase involves the learners' analysis of the simulation, drawing conclusions and generalizing from their experience. Finally, the active experimentation phase involves the learners' application of their learning to real-world scenarios.

Simulation gaming also involves a debriefing phase, where learners discuss their experience, reflect on their decisions and actions, and draw conclusions about the simulation. This phase is crucial for learning, as it allows learners to articulate their perception of what was learned and for the instructor to provide feedback and put things into a broader perspective.

The use of simulations in learning is supported by various learning theories, including constructivism and authentic e-learning. Constructivism emphasizes the active role of the learner in constructing their own understanding of the world, which is consistent with the active participation and reflection involved in simulation gaming. Authentic e-learning, on the other hand, emphasizes the use of technology to create learning experiences that are authentic and relevant to the learners' lives. Role-play simulations, conducted using technology platforms, provide an authentic and relevant learning experience for learners.

In conclusion, simulations play a crucial role in learning, particularly in the context of science-intensive policy disputes. They provide a safe and controlled environment for learners to explore complex systems and processes, test hypotheses, and make mistakes without real-world consequences. Role-play simulations, in particular, allow learners to understand the complexities of a policy dispute from different perspectives, fostering collaboration and understanding among stakeholders.

#### 6.1b Simulation Tools for Learning

Simulation tools are essential for the effective implementation of role-play simulations in learning. These tools provide a virtual environment where learners can interact with each other and with the simulation, assuming the roles of various stakeholders in a policy dispute. They also allow for the creation and management of the simulation, including the design of the simulation environment, the definition of the simulation rules and constraints, and the control of the simulation flow.

There are several types of simulation tools available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most commonly used simulation tools for learning include:

1. **Virtual Reality (VR) Simulation Tools:** VR simulation tools create an immersive, three-dimensional environment where learners can interact with the simulation in a realistic and engaging way.

#### 6.1b Developing Effective Simulations

Developing effective simulations for role-play scenarios in science-intensive policy disputes requires careful planning and consideration. The following are some key factors to consider when developing simulations:

1. **Learning Objectives**: The first step in developing a simulation is to clearly define the learning objectives. What do you want learners to understand or be able to do as a result of the simulation? These objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

2. **Stakeholder Perspectives**: A simulation is only as effective as the perspectives it represents. Therefore, it is crucial to involve stakeholders in the development process. This could involve conducting interviews, focus groups, or surveys to understand their perspectives and concerns.

3. **Complexity and Realism**: The simulation should be complex enough to accurately represent the real-world system or process, but not so complex that it becomes overwhelming for learners. It should also be realistic, reflecting the actual dynamics and constraints of the system or process.

4. **Feedback and Debriefing**: The simulation should provide opportunities for learners to receive feedback on their performance and engage in a debriefing session to reflect on their experience. This is crucial for learning and understanding.

5. **Usability and Accessibility**: The simulation should be designed with usability and accessibility in mind. This includes considerations of the interface, navigation, and accessibility for learners with different abilities.

6. **Evaluation and Revision**: After the simulation is developed, it should be evaluated for effectiveness. This could involve conducting a pilot test, collecting feedback from learners, and analyzing learning outcomes. The simulation should then be revised based on this feedback and evaluation.

In the context of role-play simulations, these considerations are particularly important. The simulation should provide a safe and controlled environment for learners to explore complex systems and processes, test hypotheses, and make mistakes without real-world consequences. It should also allow learners to understand the complexities of the dispute from different perspectives, fostering collaboration and understanding among stakeholders.

In the next section, we will explore some specific tools and techniques for developing simulations, including the use of software tools and programming languages.

#### 6.1c Evaluating Simulation Effectiveness

Evaluating the effectiveness of a simulation is a crucial step in the learning process. It allows instructors to understand how well the simulation is meeting the learning objectives and to make necessary revisions. This section will discuss some key methods for evaluating simulation effectiveness.

1. **Learning Outcome Assessment**: The most direct way to evaluate simulation effectiveness is to assess learners' achievement of the learning objectives. This could involve pre- and post-simulation assessments, where learners are tested on their knowledge and understanding of the simulation content. The difference in performance between the two assessments can then be used to gauge the effectiveness of the simulation.

2. **User Feedback**: Learners can provide valuable feedback on the simulation experience. This could involve surveys or interviews, where learners are asked about their satisfaction with the simulation, the clarity of the simulation content, and the usefulness of the simulation for learning. This feedback can be used to identify areas for improvement and to understand how learners are interpreting the simulation.

3. **Observational Data**: Instructors can observe learners during the simulation to gain insights into their learning process. This could involve noting learners' interactions with the simulation, their use of resources, and their decision-making processes. This data can be used to understand how learners are engaging with the simulation and to identify areas for improvement.

4. **Simulation Logs**: Simulation logs can provide a detailed record of learners' interactions with the simulation. This could include records of learners' decisions, actions, and outcomes, as well as their use of resources and help systems. This data can be used to analyze learners' strategies and to identify areas for improvement.

5. **Post-Simulation Discussions**: Post-simulation discussions can provide valuable insights into learners' understanding and interpretation of the simulation. This could involve group discussions, where learners are encouraged to share their experiences and insights, or individual reflections, where learners are asked to write about their learning from the simulation. This data can be used to understand how learners are interpreting the simulation and to identify areas for improvement.

In conclusion, evaluating simulation effectiveness is a complex but crucial task. It requires a combination of methods and a careful analysis of the data collected. By understanding how well the simulation is meeting the learning objectives, instructors can make necessary revisions to improve the simulation and enhance learners' learning experience.

## Chapter: Chapter 7: The Role of JFF in Policy Disputes

### Introduction

In the realm of science and policy, disputes are inevitable. These disputes often arise due to differences in opinions, interpretations, and understanding of scientific data and information. In such situations, the role of joint fact finding (JFF) becomes crucial. This chapter, "The Role of JFF in Policy Disputes," delves into the importance and effectiveness of JFF in resolving science-intensive policy disputes.

Joint fact finding is a collaborative process that involves all parties in a dispute coming together to gather and analyze facts.

The developers will be tasked with presenting their technology and its potential benefits, while the regulatory body will be responsible for evaluating its safety and potential risks.

The second simulation, "Simulation B", will focus on a real-world case study of a policy dispute. The participants will be given a briefing on the case study and will be asked to role-play the various stakeholders involved in the dispute. This simulation will provide a more realistic and complex scenario, allowing participants to experience the challenges and nuances of a real-world policy dispute.

Both simulations will be played in a structured and controlled environment, with a facilitator guiding the discussion and ensuring that all participants have an equal opportunity to contribute. The simulations will be followed by a debriefing session, where participants can reflect on their experiences and discuss the lessons learned.

The use of joint fact finding in these simulations will be emphasized, as it is a crucial tool for resolving science-intensive policy disputes. Participants will be encouraged to use joint fact finding techniques, such as data collection and analysis, to inform their decisions and negotiations. This will not only enhance the learning experience but also provide a practical application of the concepts discussed in previous chapters.

In the next section, we will discuss the steps involved in preparing for these simulations, including selecting a case study, defining roles and objectives, and developing a simulation timeline. We will also discuss the importance of role-playing and how it can enhance the learning experience. 

#### 7.1b Role-Playing Techniques

Role-playing is a powerful tool for learning and understanding complex systems. It allows participants to experience a situation from a specific perspective, making it easier to understand the motivations and actions of different stakeholders. In the context of science-intensive policy disputes, role-playing can be particularly useful as it allows participants to explore the complexities of these disputes in a safe and controlled environment.

There are several techniques that can be used for role-playing in simulations. These include:

1. **Character Development:** Participants are assigned a character and are given a briefing on their role in the simulation. This can include information about their background, motivations, and objectives. This technique helps participants to understand the perspective of their character and to make decisions that are consistent with their role.

## Challenge Problem Structure Overview

The Multiple Biometric Grand Challenge is based on previous challenges directed by Dr. P. Jonathon Phillips. Specifically the Facial Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) and the Iris Challenge Evaluation (ICE 2005). The programmatic process of a Challenge Problem is as follows. The Challenge Team designs the protocols, challenge problems, prepares challenge infrastructure, and composes the necessary data sets. Organizations then sign licenses to receive the data and begin to develop technology (mostly computer algorithms) in an attempt to solve the various challenges laid out by the Challenge Team. To advance and inform the various participants and interested parties the Team hosts workshops. The first workshop gives an overview of the challenge and introduces the first set of challenge problems (typically referred to as Version 1). The data sets are then released to participating organizations who develop their algorithms and submit self reported results back to the Challenge Team in the form of similarity matrices. The Team analyzes these results and then hosts another workshop. At the 2nd Workshop the Challenge Team reports the results from Challenge Version 1 and releases the Challenge Version 2. The cycle is repeated, finishing with a final workshop. At this stage the Participants are requested to submit not their self reported results, but the actual executables (or SDKs) to their algorithms. The Challenge Team then runs these algorithms through a battery of tests on large sequestered datasets. This phase ultimately determines the performance levels of the participant’s algorithms. A final report is issued by the Team which is used by Industries and Governments to determine the actual state of the art in a given field and to provide participating organizations with a comprehensive understanding of the performance of their algorithms.

## Chapter: Use of Joint Fact Finding in Science Intensive Policy Disputes, Part II

### Introduction:

In the previous chapter, we discussed the basics of joint fact finding and its importance in resolving science-intensive policy disputes. We explored the concept of joint fact finding and its role in bridging the gap between conflicting parties. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic and discuss advanced techniques for joint fact finding.

Joint fact finding is a crucial aspect of policy disputes, especially in the field of science. It involves the collaboration of all parties involved in a dispute to gather and analyze relevant information. This information is then used to make informed decisions and reach a mutually beneficial solution. However, in many cases, joint fact finding can be a challenging and complex process. This is where advanced techniques come into play.

In this chapter, we will explore various advanced techniques that can be used to enhance the effectiveness of joint fact finding. These techniques will help in gathering and analyzing information more efficiently and effectively. We will also discuss how these techniques can be used to overcome common challenges faced in joint fact finding.

Some of the topics covered in this chapter include advanced data collection methods, data analysis techniques, and communication strategies. We will also discuss the role of technology in joint fact finding and how it can be used to streamline the process. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of advanced techniques for joint fact finding and how they can be applied in science-intensive policy disputes. 


## Chapter 1:5: Advanced Techniques in Joint Fact Finding:




### Subsection: 14.1c Case Studies and Examples

In this section, we will explore some case studies and examples that demonstrate the advanced techniques in proposal development discussed in the previous section. These case studies and examples will provide a practical understanding of how these techniques are applied in real-world scenarios.

#### 14.1c.1 Case Study: IONA Technologies

IONA Technologies, a software company, is a prime example of the application of advanced proposal development techniques. The company's initial integration products were built using the CORBA standard, and later products were built using Web services standards. This approach allowed IONA Technologies to stay abreast of the latest technological advancements and customer needs.

The company's products were designed using the IDEF4 methodology, which involves three distinct layers: system design, application layer, and low-level design. This three-layered organization reduced the complexity of the design and ensured connectivity to other systems in the design context. The IDEF4 methodology also distinguished between artifacts newly created from the application domain, artifacts in transition to design specification, and artifacts that have been specified that can be applied to create the design specification. This allowed practitioners and reviewers to track the progress of the design toward completion.

The IDEF4 methodology also uses three design models and a design rationale component. The design rationale component provides a top-down representation of the system, giving a broad view that encompasses the three design models and documents the rationale for major design evolutions. Each model represents a different cross section of the design and captures all the information represented in a design project.

#### 14.1c.2 Example: Empirical Research

Empirical research is another area where advanced proposal development techniques are applied. The empirical cycle, a key concept in empirical research, involves the iterative process of formulating a hypothesis, collecting and analyzing data, and refining the hypothesis based on the results.

The empirical cycle can be represented using the IDEF4 methodology. The system design layer represents the overall research design, the application layer represents the data collection and analysis methods, and the low-level design layer represents the individual components of the research design. The IDEF4 artifact status can be used to track the progress of the research design, with domain artifacts representing the initial hypothesis, transition artifacts representing the data collection and analysis, and complete artifacts representing the final refined hypothesis.

The IDEF4 design models can also be applied in empirical research. The conceptual model represents the theoretical framework of the research, the logical model represents the data collection and analysis methods, and the physical model represents the individual components of the research. The design rationale component documents the reasoning behind the research design and major design evolutions.

In conclusion, advanced proposal development techniques, such as those used in IONA Technologies and empirical research, can greatly enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of proposal development. These techniques provide a structured and systematic approach to proposal development, allowing for the efficient use of resources and the effective management of complex projects.

To address this challenge, it is important to use a combination of methods to identify stakeholders, such as brainstorming sessions, expert consultations, and stakeholder mapping. Once the stakeholders have been identified, it is crucial to establish a dialogue with them and involve them in the decision-making process (Ottosson, S).

2. **Managing Conflicting Interests**: Stakeholders often have conflicting interests, which can complicate the decision-making process. To manage these conflicts, it is important to establish a clear and transparent decision-making process that takes into account the interests of all stakeholders. This can be achieved through the use of tools such as stakeholder analysis and negotiation techniques (Ottosson, S).

3. **Ensuring Transparency and Accountability**: Ensuring transparency and accountability is a key challenge in stakeholder engagement. This is especially true in complex projects where there are multiple stakeholders and decisions to be made. To address this challenge, it is important to establish clear communication channels, provide regular updates and feedback, and involve stakeholders in the decision-making process. This can help to build trust and ensure that stakeholders are aware of and involved in the decisions that affect them (Ottosson, S).

4. **Leveraging Technology**: Technology can be a powerful tool in stakeholder engagement. It can be used to facilitate communication, collaboration, and decision-making. For example, online platforms can be used to host virtual meetings, share information, and collect feedback from stakeholders. This can help to streamline the stakeholder engagement process and make it more efficient and effective (Ottosson, S).

In conclusion, while stakeholder engagement presents several challenges, these can be effectively addressed through the use of advanced proposal development techniques.

Before delving into specific techniques, it is important to understand the role of simulation rehearsal in policy disputes. Simulation rehearsal allows parties to test different scenarios and strategies in a controlled environment, without the risk of making costly mistakes in the real world. This is especially important in science-intensive policy disputes, where the potential impact of policies can be complex and difficult to predict.

One advanced technique in simulation rehearsal is the use of line integral convolution (LIC). This technique has been applied to a wide range of problems since it was first published in 1993. It involves using mathematical equations to simulate the behavior of a system, and then visualizing the results to gain insights into the system's behavior. In the context of policy disputes, LIC can be used to simulate the impact of different policies and visualize the results to better understand their potential outcomes.

Another advanced technique is the use of depth filters. With the ongoing advancements in process technologies, depth filters have been modified to improve their feasibility within a range of industrial sectors. In policy disputes, depth filters can be used to simulate the impact of different policies on various industries, providing a more comprehensive understanding of their potential outcomes.

In addition to these techniques, there are also advanced methods for conducting simulation rehearsal, such as the use of EIMI (Extended Kalman Filter).

## Agent based Modeling and Simulation of UAS

UAV Simulators generally focus on low-level flight control and coordination by using complex physics-based models that are geared towards accuracy. These simulators requires domain expertise and complex knowledge to build, learn and operate the simulator itself. Alternate simulators are being developed such as Agent Based Modeling and Simulation for UAS, especially by military.

Agent based modeling and simulation of UAV focuses on specialized issues such as coordination and planning. For example, the CoUAV. simulator focuses on cooperative search and MAS-Planes focuses on request servicing by decentralized coordination. Agent based simulation has also been used for UAV flight dynamic simulation modeling.

Agent based modeling and simulation has been used for managing missions for UAS. The authors used Codarra Avatar for their experiments. Codarra Avatar is a lightweight UAV which has been specifically built for small-scale reconnaissance and surveillance missions. This UAV can be assembled and disassembled very quickly and transported in a backpack. However, in becoming an autonomous UAV, the Codarra Avatar faces challenges of flight time, flight range, durability, limited computational power, limited sensory data, and flight regulations and restrictions. The authors developed Agent-Flight Control System Architecture (FCS) to combat the issues faced with the UAV.

FCS has an agent that sits at the top of a control tree, receives data at regular intervals, and issues high level waypoint commands. The agent is designed in JACK, an agent-oriented programming language. The behavior of agents defined using JACK are structured around the BDI (Belief, Desire, Intentions) theory of agency. The mission Management System is designed using the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) Approach that was developed by Colonel John Boyd. This approach allows for quick and efficient decision making in complex and dynamic environments.

##### Feedback and Goal Setting

Feedback and goal setting are highly interrelated and more effective when used in conjunction with each other. Feedback can lead to the creation of feedback loops, either negative or positive, which can influence the participant's behavior and performance. Negative feedback loops, where the output is compared to the goal, can lead to increasing the input associated with goal attainment to improve output in the next loop cycle. On the other hand, positive feedback loops, if not sufficiently reinforced, can lead to subsequent setting of goals at a less difficult level.

Negative feedback can be reframed and errors seen as beneficial to the learning and goal achievement process, increasing participant resilience. This reframing process can be taught through error management training and with clear instructions about how to engage with errors. Error management training involves participants practicing metacognitive activities of planning, monitoring, and evaluation.

##### Feedback and Goal Type, Perceived Tension, and Conscientiousness

The interaction between negative feedback and goal type, perceived tension, and conscientiousness is also significant. People with high conscientiousness and performance goals experience high tension following negative feedback, which leads to lower performance. This is not the case with learning goals, where the effect of negative feedback is less detrimental.

##### Feedback Channels and Employee Adaptation

Without proper feedback channels, it is impossible for employees to adapt or adjust to the required behavior. Managers should keep track of performance to allow employees to see how effective they have been in attaining their goals. Providing feedback on short-term objectives helps to sustain motivation and commitment to the goal. There are two forms of feedback in which the employee can receive (Outcome and Process feedback). Outcome feedback is after the goal or activity is finished, and process feedback is during the completion of a goal. Feedback should be provided on the strategies followed to achieve the goal, as well as the outcomes of those strategies.

In conclusion, feedback and revision are essential components of workshop participation. They provide the necessary guidance and motivation for participants to achieve their goals and improve their performance. By understanding the role of feedback and revision, workshop facilitators can create a more effective learning environment for their participants.

#### 17.3b Techniques for Providing Effective Feedback

Providing effective feedback is a critical aspect of workshop participation. It is through feedback that participants can understand their strengths and weaknesses, and make necessary adjustments to improve their performance. Here are some techniques for providing effective feedback:

##### Use a Balance of Positive and Negative Feedback

Positive feedback can motivate participants by highlighting their strengths and successes. However, it is equally important to provide negative feedback, which can help participants identify areas for improvement. The key is to provide a balance of positive and negative feedback, emphasizing the positive while also addressing the negative. This approach can help participants maintain a positive attitude while also recognizing the need for improvement.

##### Be Specific and Detailed

Vague feedback is not helpful. Participants need specific and detailed feedback to understand what they are doing well and what they need to improve. This can be achieved by providing specific examples and describing the impact of their actions. For instance, instead of saying "You did well," you could say, "Your presentation was clear and concise, and it helped the group understand the issue better."

##### Be Timely

Timely feedback is more effective than feedback provided long after the event. Participants need to know how they are doing in real-time to make necessary adjustments. This can be achieved by providing feedback immediately after a task or activity, or at least within a reasonable time frame.

##### Be Constructive

Feedback should be constructive, offering suggestions for improvement rather than just pointing out mistakes. This can help participants understand how to improve their performance and achieve their goals.

##### Use a Variety of Feedback Mechanisms

There are various ways to provide feedback, including verbal feedback, written feedback, and performance metrics. Using a variety of feedback mechanisms can provide a more comprehensive view of a participant's performance.

##### Encourage Self-Reflection

Participants should be encouraged to reflect on their own performance and identify areas for improvement. This can be achieved by asking them to write a self-assessment or by facilitating group discussions where participants can share their thoughts and insights.

In conclusion, providing effective feedback is a crucial aspect of workshop participation. It can help participants understand their strengths and weaknesses, and make necessary adjustments to improve their performance. By using a balance of positive and negative feedback, being specific and detailed, providing timely feedback, being constructive, using a variety of feedback mechanisms, and encouraging self-reflection, facilitators can provide effective feedback that can enhance the learning experience for participants.

#### 17.3c Case Studies and Examples

However, with the right strategies and tools, these challenges can be overcome. In this section, we will discuss some of the common challenges in stakeholder engagement and propose solutions to address them.

#### Lack of Trust and Communication

One of the main challenges in stakeholder engagement is the lack of trust and communication between the organization and its stakeholders. This can be due to historical issues, conflicting interests, or a lack of understanding of each other's perspectives. To address this challenge, organizations can implement a stakeholder engagement plan that includes regular communication, transparency, and a commitment to addressing stakeholder concerns. This can help build trust and facilitate effective communication.

#### Stakeholder Fatigue

Another challenge in stakeholder engagement is stakeholder fatigue. This occurs when stakeholders are overloaded with information, meetings, and requests for input. To address this challenge, organizations can streamline their stakeholder engagement process and prioritize their engagement efforts. This can help reduce stakeholder fatigue and ensure that stakeholders are not overwhelmed with information.

#### Difficulty in Understanding Stakeholder Perspectives

Understanding stakeholder perspectives is crucial in stakeholder engagement. However, it can be challenging to understand the diverse interests and concerns of different stakeholders. To address this challenge, organizations can use stakeholder mapping and analysis techniques to identify and categorize stakeholders based on their interests, influence, and potential impact. This can help organizations better understand their stakeholders and develop strategies to engage them effectively.

#### Lack of Resources

Stakeholder engagement can be resource-intensive, especially for organizations with limited resources. To address this challenge, organizations can prioritize their stakeholder engagement efforts and focus on the most critical stakeholders. They can also use technology and automation to streamline their stakeholder engagement process and reduce the time and resources required.

#### Resistance to Change

Finally, one of the main challenges in stakeholder engagement is resistance to change. This can occur when stakeholders are hesitant to support a proposed solution or change due to fear, uncertainty, or lack of understanding. To address this challenge, organizations can involve stakeholders in the decision-making process and provide them with clear and transparent information about the proposed change. This can help address their concerns and facilitate their acceptance of the change.

In conclusion, stakeholder engagement is a complex process that requires careful planning and execution. By addressing these challenges and implementing effective strategies, organizations can engage their stakeholders effectively and make informed decisions that benefit all parties involved.
