## Chapter 6: Behavior-Based Robotics / IvP Helm:




### Subsection: 6.1a Introduction to Behavior-Based Robotics

Behavior-based robotics (BBR) is a subfield of robotics that focuses on the development of autonomous systems that can perform complex tasks without the need for explicit instructions. Instead, these systems rely on their own sensory information and internal decision-making processes to determine their actions. This approach is particularly well-suited for marine environments, where traditional control methods may not be feasible due to communication and power limitations.

#### Principles of Behavior-Based Robotics

The principles of behavior-based robotics are rooted in the concept of behavior, which is the observable actions and reactions of an organism. In BBR, behavior is used to describe the actions of a robot, and it is the primary means by which the robot interacts with its environment. Unlike traditional robotics, which relies on a centralized control system, BBR distributes control across multiple behavioral modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the robot's behavior.

#### Techniques and Algorithms Used in Behavior-Based Robotics

There are several techniques and algorithms used in behavior-based robotics, each with its own strengths and limitations. Reinforcement learning, for example, is a popular technique that allows a robot to learn from its own experiences and adjust its behavior accordingly. Evolutionary computation, on the other hand, uses principles of natural selection and genetics to evolve and optimize a robot's behavior.

#### Applications of Behavior-Based Robotics in Marine Environments

The marine environment presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities for behavior-based robotics. The limited communication and power capabilities of marine environments make traditional control methods impractical, making BBR a more feasible approach. Additionally, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of marine environments makes BBR's ability to adapt and learn particularly valuable. Some specific applications of BBR in marine environments include underwater exploration, search and rescue operations, and environmental monitoring.

#### The IvP Helm: A Behavior-Based Robotics Platform for Marine Environments

It is a modular and extensible system that allows for the development and testing of behavior-based algorithms in a controlled and realistic environment. The IvP Helm is equipped with a variety of sensors and actuators, allowing it to interact with its environment in a natural and realistic manner. It also includes a user-friendly interface for programming and controlling the robot.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the specific techniques and algorithms used in behavior-based robotics, providing examples and applications in marine environments. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of BBR in this field and explore potential solutions and advancements. 





### Subsection: 6.1b Basic Behavior-Based Robotics

Behavior-based robotics (BBR) is a powerful approach to developing autonomous systems, particularly in marine environments. In this section, we will delve deeper into the basic principles and techniques of BBR, focusing on the IvP Helm architecture and its role in marine autonomy.

#### IvP Helm Architecture

The IvP Helm architecture is a hierarchical control system that is used in behavior-based robotics. It is designed to handle complex tasks by distributing control across multiple behavioral modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the robot's behavior. This architecture is particularly well-suited for marine environments, where traditional control methods may not be feasible due to communication and power limitations.

The IvP Helm architecture is composed of three main layers: the behavioral layer, the cognitive layer, and the physical layer. The behavioral layer is responsible for generating low-level behaviors, such as navigation and obstacle avoidance. The cognitive layer integrates these behaviors to achieve higher-level tasks, such as mission planning and decision-making. The physical layer is responsible for executing the behaviors and tasks determined by the cognitive layer.

#### Behavioral Modules in IvP Helm

Each behavioral module in the IvP Helm architecture is responsible for a specific aspect of the robot's behavior. These modules are typically implemented as finite state machines, with each state representing a different behavior. The transitions between states are determined by the robot's sensory information and internal decision-making processes.

For example, a behavioral module responsible for navigation might have states for exploring, localizing, and following a path. In the exploring state, the robot would use its sensors to gather information about its environment and generate a map. In the localizing state, the robot would use its map to determine its position and orientation. In the following a path state, the robot would use its map and path planning algorithms to navigate to a specific location.

#### Cognitive Modules in IvP Helm

The cognitive layer in the IvP Helm architecture is responsible for integrating the behaviors generated by the behavioral layer to achieve higher-level tasks. This is typically done through a hierarchical decision-making process, where higher-level tasks are broken down into subtasks and assigned to lower-level behavioral modules.

For example, a cognitive module responsible for mission planning might have subtasks for navigating to a specific location, avoiding obstacles, and completing a task at the destination. Each of these subtasks would be assigned to a different behavioral module, and the cognitive module would use feedback from these modules to adjust the plan and achieve the overall mission goal.

#### Physical Modules in IvP Helm

The physical layer in the IvP Helm architecture is responsible for executing the behaviors and tasks determined by the cognitive layer. This layer includes the robot's sensors, actuators, and control systems. The IvP Helm architecture is designed to be modular, allowing for easy integration of new sensors and actuators as needed.

In conclusion, the IvP Helm architecture is a powerful tool for developing autonomous systems, particularly in marine environments. By distributing control across multiple behavioral, cognitive, and physical layers, this architecture allows for complex tasks to be achieved in a dynamic and adaptive manner. 





### Subsection: 6.1c Advanced Behavior-Based Robotics

#### Advanced Behaviors in IvP Helm

While the basic behavioral modules in IvP Helm are responsible for low-level behaviors such as navigation and obstacle avoidance, advanced behavioral modules can handle more complex tasks. These modules can be designed to handle tasks such as object manipulation, communication, and decision-making.

For example, an advanced behavioral module for object manipulation might use a combination of vision and touch sensors to pick up and manipulate objects in the environment. This module could be used for tasks such as loading and unloading cargo, or even performing delicate tasks such as surgery.

Another advanced behavioral module could be responsible for communication. This module could use a variety of communication methods, such as acoustics, optics, or even biomimetic communication, to interact with other robots or humans. This could be particularly useful in marine environments, where traditional communication methods may not be feasible.

Finally, an advanced behavioral module for decision-making could use a combination of sensory information and internal decision-making processes to make complex decisions. This could be particularly useful in situations where the robot needs to adapt to changing environments or tasks.

#### Advanced Techniques in IvP Helm

In addition to advanced behaviors, IvP Helm can also incorporate advanced techniques to improve the robot's performance. These techniques can include machine learning, adaptive control, and swarm behavior.

Machine learning techniques, such as reinforcement learning, can be used to improve the robot's performance over time. By learning from its own experiences, the robot can adapt to new environments and tasks, making it more versatile and efficient.

Adaptive control techniques can be used to improve the robot's performance in dynamic environments. By continuously adjusting its control parameters, the robot can adapt to changes in its environment, making it more robust and reliable.

Finally, swarm behavior techniques can be used to improve the robot's performance in complex tasks. By coordinating multiple robots to work together, a swarm of robots can achieve tasks that would be difficult or impossible for a single robot.

In conclusion, advanced behavior-based robotics in IvP Helm involves more complex behaviors and techniques that can greatly enhance the robot's capabilities. By incorporating these advanced features, IvP Helm can be a powerful tool for marine autonomy, sensing, and communication.

#### 8.1a Introduction to Nested Autonomy Paradigm

The Nested Autonomy Paradigm is a concept that has emerged from the field of marine autonomy, specifically in the context of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). It is a hierarchical approach to autonomy, where different levels of autonomy are nested within each other. This paradigm is crucial for enabling these vehicles to operate effectively in the complex and dynamic marine environments they are designed for.

The Nested Autonomy Paradigm is based on the principle of delegation, where higher levels of autonomy delegate tasks to lower levels. This allows for a more efficient and effective distribution of tasks, as each level of autonomy is designed to handle a specific set of tasks. This delegation of tasks also allows for a more modular and scalable approach to autonomy, as new tasks can be easily added or removed without affecting the overall system.

There are three main levels of autonomy within the Nested Autonomy Paradigm:

1. Basic Autonomy: This is the lowest level of autonomy and is responsible for basic tasks such as sensor fusion and navigation. It is typically implemented using simple algorithms and rules, and is often hard-coded into the vehicle.

2. Intermediate Autonomy: This level of autonomy is responsible for more complex tasks, such as decision-making and task execution. It is typically implemented using more advanced algorithms and techniques, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.

3. Advanced Autonomy: This is the highest level of autonomy and is responsible for overall mission planning and execution. It is typically implemented using high-level decision-making algorithms and may involve human intervention.

The Nested Autonomy Paradigm also includes a fourth level, known as the Human-in-the-Loop (HITL), which is responsible for overseeing and intervening in the autonomy of the vehicle when necessary. This level is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of the vehicle, as it allows for human intervention in critical situations.

The Nested Autonomy Paradigm has been successfully applied in various marine autonomy applications, including underwater exploration, surveillance, and search and rescue operations. It has also been extended to other fields, such as robotics and artificial intelligence, where it has shown great potential for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of autonomous systems.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the principles, benefits, and challenges of the Nested Autonomy Paradigm, as well as its applications in marine autonomy.

### Subsection: 12.1a Introduction to Acoustic Comms

Acoustic communications, also known as underwater acoustics, is a crucial aspect of marine autonomy. It enables the exchange of information between autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and other marine devices, allowing for efficient and reliable communication in the underwater environment. In this section, we will provide an overview of acoustic communications, including its principles, techniques, and applications.

#### Principles of Acoustic Communications

Acoustic communications is based on the principles of sound propagation in water. Sound waves travel at a constant speed of 1500 meters per second in water, and their wavelength and frequency determine their ability to penetrate water. Longer wavelengths, typically in the range of 100 Hz to 100 kHz, are able to travel greater distances but are more susceptible to interference and attenuation. Shorter wavelengths, in the range of 100 kHz to 1 MHz, have less range but are less affected by interference and attenuation.

Acoustic signals are generated by a transducer, which converts electrical energy into sound waves. These sound waves are then transmitted through the water and received by another transducer, which converts them back into electrical energy. The received signal is then processed to extract the transmitted information.

#### Techniques of Acoustic Communications

Acoustic communications utilizes various techniques to ensure reliable and accurate communication in the noisy and challenging underwater environment. These techniques include modulation and demodulation, error correction coding, and equalization.

Modulation and demodulation are used to encode and decode the transmitted information. The most common modulation techniques used in acoustic communications are amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM). These techniques allow for the efficient transmission of information over long distances.

Error correction coding is used to detect and correct errors in the transmitted information. This is crucial in the noisy underwater environment, where signals are susceptible to interference and attenuation. Common error correction codes used in acoustic communications include convolutional codes and Reed-Solomon codes.

Equalization is used to compensate for the effects of the underwater environment on the transmitted signal. This includes correcting for signal attenuation and distortion caused by water temperature, salinity, and pressure. Equalization techniques, such as adaptive equalization and decision-directed equalization, are used to improve the quality of the received signal.

#### Applications of Acoustic Communications

Acoustic communications has a wide range of applications in marine autonomy. It is used for communication between AUVs and surface vessels, communication between AUVs and other underwater devices, and communication between AUVs and marine infrastructure. Acoustic communications is also used for underwater navigation, localization, and mapping.

In addition, acoustic communications is being explored for use in underwater acoustic networks, which would allow for communication between multiple AUVs and other devices in a coordinated manner. This could greatly enhance the capabilities of marine autonomy and enable more complex and efficient operations.

#### Future Developments in Acoustic Communications

As technology continues to advance, there are several areas of research and development that could greatly improve acoustic communications in the marine environment. These include the use of cognitive radio, which would allow for more efficient use of the limited acoustic spectrum, and the development of new modulation and coding techniques that can better handle the challenges of the underwater environment.

In addition, advancements in acoustic technology, such as the development of new transducers and signal processing techniques, could greatly improve the performance of acoustic communications. This could lead to more reliable and efficient communication in the underwater environment, enabling a wider range of applications for marine autonomy.

Sound waves travel at a constant speed of 1500 meters per second in water, and their wavelength and frequency determine their ability to penetrate water. Longer wavelengths, typically in the range of 100 Hz to 100 kHz, are able to travel greater distances but are more susceptible to interference and attenuation. Shorter wavelengths, in the range of 100 kHz to 1 MHz, have less range but are less affected by interference and attenuation.

#### Basic Techniques of Acoustic Communications

Acoustic communications utilizes various techniques to ensure reliable and accurate communication in the noisy and challenging underwater environment. These techniques include modulation and demodulation, error correction coding, and equalization.

Modulation and demodulation are used to encode and decode the transmitted information. The most common modulation techniques used in acoustic communications are amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM). These techniques allow for the efficient transmission of information over long distances.

Error correction coding is used to detect and correct errors in the transmitted information. This is crucial in the noisy underwater environment, where signals are susceptible to interference and attenuation. Various error correction codes, such as Hamming codes and Reed-Solomon codes, are used in acoustic communications.

Equalization is used to compensate for the effects of the underwater environment on the transmitted signal. This includes compensating for multipath propagation, where the signal reaches the receiver through multiple paths, and frequency selective fading, where different frequency components of the signal experience different levels of attenuation.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of acoustic communications in marine autonomy.





### Subsection: 12.1c Advanced Acoustic Comms

In addition to the basic techniques discussed in the previous section, advanced acoustic communications also utilizes more sophisticated techniques to improve the reliability and efficiency of communication. These techniques include spread spectrum modulation, multiple frequency-shift keying (MFSK), and adaptive equalization.

#### Spread Spectrum Modulation

Spread spectrum modulation is a technique that spreads the signal over a wide frequency band, making it more resilient to interference and noise. This is achieved by spreading the signal over a wide frequency band, which makes it more difficult for a narrowband interference signal to completely occupy the same band. The receiver can then use a filter to remove the interference and recover the transmitted signal.

#### Multiple Frequency-Shift Keying (MFSK)

Multiple frequency-shift keying (MFSK) is a modulation technique that uses multiple frequencies to represent different symbols. This technique is particularly useful in acoustic communications, as it allows for the transmission of multiple symbols simultaneously, increasing the data rate. MFSK is also more resilient to frequency-selective fading, as the different symbols are transmitted at different frequencies.

#### Adaptive Equalization

Adaptive equalization is a technique used to compensate for the effects of channel distortion. In acoustic communications, the transmitted signal can be distorted by the channel, making it difficult to recover the transmitted information. Adaptive equalization uses a feedback loop to adjust the received signal and compensate for the distortion, improving the quality of the received signal.

In conclusion, advanced acoustic communications utilizes a variety of techniques to improve the reliability and efficiency of communication in the challenging underwater environment. These techniques, along with the basic principles and techniques discussed in the previous section, form the foundation of acoustic communications in marine autonomy.

In this subsection, we will discuss the basics of behavior authoring, including the different types of behaviors and how they are created. We will also explore the concept of behavior trees and how they are used to represent the behavior of an autonomous vehicle.

##### Types of Behaviors

There are several types of behaviors that can be created for an autonomous vehicle. These include:

- **Reactive behaviors:** These are simple behaviors that respond to immediate stimuli, such as avoiding obstacles or following a specific path.
- **Goal-oriented behaviors:** These behaviors have a specific goal or objective, such as reaching a certain location or completing a task.
- **Adaptive behaviors:** These behaviors are able to adjust and adapt to changing environments or conditions, such as adjusting speed or course based on weather conditions.
- **Learning behaviors:** These behaviors use machine learning techniques to learn and improve over time, such as learning to navigate through a complex environment.

##### Behavior Trees

Behavior trees are a graphical representation of the behavior of an autonomous vehicle. They are used to capture the behavior expressed in the natural language requirements of the vehicle. Each node in the tree represents a component-state, which is a state that the vehicle can be in. These component-states are composed sequentially or concurrently to create a behavior tree that represents the behavior of the vehicle.

The behavior tree notation uses conventions found in programming languages to represent components, actions, composition, events, control-flow, data-flow, and threads. This allows for a clear and traceable relationship between the natural language requirements and the formal specification of the behavior.

##### Creating Behaviors

Creating behaviors for an autonomous vehicle involves identifying the desired behavior, determining the type of behavior, and creating a behavior tree to represent the behavior. This process may involve working with a team of engineers and programmers to ensure that the behavior is efficient and effective.

In addition to creating behaviors, it is also important to test and evaluate them to ensure that they are functioning as intended. This may involve simulating the behavior in a virtual environment or testing it in a real-world setting.

In conclusion, behavior authoring is a crucial aspect of marine autonomy, as it allows for the creation of complex and dynamic behaviors for autonomous vehicles. By understanding the different types of behaviors and how to create them using behavior trees, engineers and programmers can effectively design and implement behaviors for autonomous vehicles.

In this subsection, we will delve deeper into the advanced concepts of behavior authoring for marine autonomous vehicles. We will explore the use of behavior trees in more detail, including the concept of behavior cloning and the use of advanced sensors and communications in behavior authoring.

##### Behavior Cloning

Behavior cloning is a technique used in machine learning to learn a policy from a set of expert demonstrations. In the context of marine autonomous vehicles, this can be used to learn complex behaviors from human demonstrations. This can be particularly useful when creating behaviors that involve decision-making or strategic planning.

The process of behavior cloning involves collecting a set of expert demonstrations, which are then used to train a policy. The policy is then used to generate new behaviors based on the learned patterns from the demonstrations. This can be particularly useful when creating complex behaviors that involve decision-making or strategic planning.

##### Advanced Sensors and Communications

Advanced sensors and communications play a crucial role in behavior authoring for marine autonomous vehicles. These sensors and communications allow the vehicle to gather information about its environment and make decisions based on this information.

For example, advanced sensors such as cameras, radar, and sonar can provide the vehicle with information about its surroundings, including the presence of obstacles or other vehicles. This information can then be used to create behaviors that avoid collisions or navigate through complex environments.

Advanced communications, such as Wi-Fi or cellular networks, can also play a crucial role in behavior authoring. These communications allow the vehicle to communicate with other vehicles or a central control system, enabling coordinated behaviors and decision-making.

##### Behavior Trees in Detail

As mentioned earlier, behavior trees are a graphical representation of the behavior of an autonomous vehicle. Each node in the tree represents a component-state, which is a state that the vehicle can be in. These component-states are composed sequentially or concurrently to create a behavior tree that represents the behavior of the vehicle.

The behavior tree notation uses conventions found in programming languages to represent components, actions, composition, events, control-flow, data-flow, and threads. This allows for a clear and traceable relationship between the natural language requirements and the formal specification of the behavior.

In addition to the basic concepts of behavior trees, there are also advanced concepts that can be used to create more complex behaviors. These include the use of leaf nodes, which can revert to an ancestor node to repeat behavior, or start a new thread. There are also constructs for creating parallel branches, which allow for concurrent execution of behaviors.

In conclusion, advanced behavior authoring for marine autonomous vehicles involves the use of advanced sensors and communications, as well as more complex techniques such as behavior cloning and advanced behavior trees. These concepts are crucial for creating sophisticated and adaptive behaviors for these vehicles.

### Section: 17.1 Parameter Estimation:

Parameter estimation is a crucial aspect of marine autonomy, sensing, and communications. It involves the use of mathematical models and algorithms to estimate the parameters of a system or process. These parameters are essential for understanding and predicting the behavior of the system. In this section, we will discuss the basic concepts of parameter estimation and its applications in marine autonomy.

#### 17.1a Basic Parameter Estimation

Basic parameter estimation involves the use of mathematical models and algorithms to estimate the parameters of a system or process. These parameters can include the initial state of the system, the system dynamics, and the measurement model. The goal of parameter estimation is to find the values of these parameters that best fit the observed data.

One of the most commonly used methods for basic parameter estimation is the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The EKF is a recursive algorithm that estimates the state of a system by combining measurements with a mathematical model of the system. It is particularly useful for systems with non-linear dynamics and non-Gaussian noise.

The EKF consists of two main steps: prediction and update. In the prediction step, the algorithm uses the system model to predict the state of the system at the next time step. In the update step, it uses the measurements to correct the predicted state. This process is repeated at each time step, resulting in an estimate of the system state.

The EKF is based on the following assumptions:

1. The system dynamics are represented by a continuous-time model.
2. The measurements are taken at discrete time intervals.
3. The system and measurement models are Gaussian.
4. The system and measurement models are linear.

If these assumptions do not hold, the EKF may not provide accurate estimates of the system parameters. In such cases, other methods such as the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) or Particle Filter (PF) may be more suitable.

#### 17.1b Parameter Estimation in Marine Autonomy

In marine autonomy, parameter estimation plays a crucial role in the design and operation of autonomous vehicles. These vehicles rely on accurate estimates of their position, velocity, and other parameters to navigate and perform tasks. Parameter estimation is also essential for the development of control algorithms and for the prediction of the vehicle's behavior.

One of the main challenges in parameter estimation for marine autonomy is the presence of noise and uncertainties in the measurements. These can be caused by factors such as sensor errors, environmental conditions, and interference from other sources. To address this challenge, advanced techniques such as the Extended Kalman Filter and the Unscented Kalman Filter are often used.

Another important aspect of parameter estimation in marine autonomy is the integration of different sensors and data sources. Autonomous vehicles often use a combination of sensors, such as GPS, INS, and acoustics, to estimate their parameters. This requires the development of algorithms that can fuse data from these different sources and provide accurate estimates of the vehicle's parameters.

In conclusion, parameter estimation is a crucial aspect of marine autonomy, sensing, and communications. It allows for the accurate estimation of system parameters, which is essential for the design and operation of autonomous vehicles. With the development of advanced techniques and algorithms, parameter estimation will continue to play a vital role in the field of marine autonomy.





#### 17.1c Advanced Parameter Estimation

Advanced parameter estimation techniques are used when the assumptions of the basic parameter estimation methods do not hold. These techniques are often more complex and require more computational resources, but they can provide more accurate estimates of the system parameters.

One such technique is the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The UKF is a non-linear extension of the Extended Kalman Filter. It uses a set of sigma points to approximate the probability distribution of the system state. These sigma points are propagated through the system model and measurement model, and the resulting estimates are combined to obtain the final estimate of the system state.

The UKF is particularly useful for systems with non-linear dynamics and non-Gaussian noise. It does not require the system and measurement models to be linear, and it can handle non-Gaussian noise by using a non-linear weighting scheme.

Another advanced parameter estimation technique is the Particle Filter (PF). The PF is a non-parametric method that uses a set of particles to represent the probability distribution of the system state. These particles are propagated through the system model and measurement model, and the resulting estimates are combined to obtain the final estimate of the system state.

The PF is particularly useful for systems with non-linear dynamics and non-Gaussian noise. It does not require the system and measurement models to be linear, and it can handle non-Gaussian noise by using a non-linear weighting scheme.

In addition to these techniques, there are also more advanced methods such as the Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter (AEKF) and the Adaptive Unscented Kalman Filter (AUKF). These methods use adaptive algorithms to adjust the parameters of the filter in real-time, making them suitable for systems with time-varying dynamics and noise.

In conclusion, advanced parameter estimation techniques are essential for accurately estimating the parameters of a system or process when the assumptions of the basic parameter estimation methods do not hold. These techniques are often more complex and require more computational resources, but they can provide more accurate estimates of the system parameters.

### Subsection: 19.1a Introduction to Adaptive Acoustic Sensing

Adaptive acoustic sensing is a rapidly growing field that combines the principles of adaptive signal processing and acoustics to develop systems that can sense and communicate in a dynamic and changing marine environment. This section will provide an overview of the basic principles of adaptive acoustic sensing, including the use of adaptive filters and the concept of adaptive beamforming.

#### Adaptive Filters

Adaptive filters are a key component of adaptive acoustic sensing systems. They are used to estimate the parameters of a signal in the presence of noise, interference, and other distortions. The goal of an adaptive filter is to minimize the error between the estimated and actual parameters of the signal. This is achieved by adjusting the filter coefficients in response to changes in the signal environment.

The operation of an adaptive filter can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
\hat{x}(n) = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} w_i(n) x(n-i)
$$

where $\hat{x}(n)$ is the estimated signal, $x(n)$ is the actual signal, and $w_i(n)$ are the filter coefficients. The filter coefficients are updated at each time step using an algorithm such as the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm.

#### Adaptive Beamforming

Adaptive beamforming is another important aspect of adaptive acoustic sensing. It involves the use of multiple sensors to form a beam that is directed towards a specific direction. The beam is then used to receive or transmit signals. The direction of the beam can be adjusted in response to changes in the signal environment, allowing the system to track moving sources.

The operation of an adaptive beamformer can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
y(n) = \sum_{i=1}^{M} w_i(n) x_i(n)
$$

where $y(n)$ is the received signal, $x_i(n)$ are the signals received by the individual sensors, and $w_i(n)$ are the beamforming coefficients. The beamforming coefficients are updated at each time step using an algorithm such as the least variance unbiased (LVU) algorithm.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these topics, exploring their applications in marine autonomy and communication. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of adaptive acoustic sensing, and the ongoing research efforts to overcome them.




### Subsection: 19.1b Basic Adaptive Acoustic Sensing

#### Adaptive Acoustic Sensing Algorithms

Adaptive acoustic sensing algorithms are designed to adapt to changes in the signal environment. These algorithms are used to update the filter coefficients and beamforming coefficients in response to changes in the signal environment. The goal of these algorithms is to minimize the error between the estimated and actual parameters of the signal.

One of the most commonly used adaptive acoustic sensing algorithms is the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm. This algorithm is used to update the filter coefficients in an adaptive filter. The LMS algorithm minimizes the error between the estimated and actual parameters of the signal by adjusting the filter coefficients at each time step.
