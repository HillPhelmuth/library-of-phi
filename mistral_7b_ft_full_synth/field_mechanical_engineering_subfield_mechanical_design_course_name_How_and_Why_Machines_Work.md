## Foreward

Welcome to "How and Why Machines Work: A Comprehensive Guide". This book aims to provide a thorough understanding of the principles and applications of machines, drawing from a wide range of disciplines including physics, engineering, and computer science.

The book is structured around the concept of machine learning, a field that has seen significant advancements in recent years. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that allow machines to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. This approach is particularly useful in complex systems where the rules are not explicitly known, but can be inferred from data.

The book begins with an exploration of the concept of machine learning, drawing parallels with the learning process in organisms. This is followed by a discussion on the work of John von Neumann and his theory of games, and its application to military situations. The book then delves into the evolution of conflict, using examples from various fields such as chess-playing computers, matador and bull, mongoose and cobra, and tennis opponents.

The book also discusses the need for caution in delegating responsibility for warfare strategy to machines, particularly in the context of nuclear weapons. This is followed by a discussion on self-replicating machines and the work of Professor Dennis Gabor in this area.

The second chapter of the book focuses on the concept of brain waves and self-organising systems. This chapter explores the mechanism of evolution by natural selection, referred to as "phylogenetic learning", and modifications of behaviour over a lifetime in response to experience, referred to as "ontogenetic learning". The chapter also discusses the role of non-linear feedback in these processes and speculates on the correlation between changes in patterns of electrical activity and learning.

Throughout the book, we will draw on the work of renowned scholars such as John von Neumann, Dennis Gabor, and Norbert Wiener. Their work provides a solid foundation for our exploration of machine learning and its applications.

We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for advanced undergraduate students at MIT, providing them with a comprehensive understanding of machines and their workings. We also hope that it will inspire them to delve deeper into this fascinating field and contribute to its ongoing evolution.

Thank you for joining us on this journey. Let's explore the world of machines together.

### Subsection 1.2a Definition of Control Volumes

In the study of fluid dynamics, the concept of a control volume is fundamental. A control volume is a specific volume in space through which fluid flows. It is a fixed volume that is defined by the boundaries of the control volume. These boundaries can be stationary or moving, and they can be defined by solid surfaces, such as walls or pipes, or by fluid boundaries, such as shock waves or contact discontinuities.

The control volume approach is a powerful tool for analyzing fluid flow. It allows us to focus on the behavior of the fluid within the control volume, rather than on the details of the fluid outside the control volume. This simplification is particularly useful in complex fluid flow situations, such as in machines.

The control volume approach is based on the principle of conservation of mass, which states that the mass of fluid entering a control volume must equal the mass of fluid leaving the control volume, plus the change in mass within the control volume. This principle can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\int_{\text{control volume}} \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} dV + \int_{\text{control surface}} \rho \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{n} dA = 0
$$

where $\rho$ is the fluid density, $t$ is time, $dV$ is the differential volume, $\mathbf{u}$ is the fluid velocity, $\mathbf{n}$ is the outward unit normal vector on the control surface, and $dA$ is the differential area on the control surface.

The control volume approach can also be used to analyze the forces acting on a control volume. This is done by applying the principle of conservation of momentum, which states that the sum of the forces acting on a control volume must equal the rate of change of momentum within the control volume. This principle can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\int_{\text{control volume}} \rho \mathbf{u} \frac{D \mathbf{u}}{D t} dV = \int_{\text{control surface}} \mathbf{T} \cdot \mathbf{n} dA
$$

where $\mathbf{T}$ is the stress tensor.

In the next section, we will explore how these principles can be applied to analyze the fluid flow in machines.

The International System of Units (SI) is the most widely used system of units in the world. It is a coherent system of units, meaning that all units are derived from a small set of base units. The base units in the SI system are meter (m) for length, kilogram (kg) for mass, second (s) for time, ampere (A) for electric current, kelvin (K) for temperature, mole (mol) for amount of substance, and candela (cd) for luminous intensity.

#### 1.4b Multiples and Submultiples

Decimal multiples and sub-multiples are formed using standard SI units. For example, a kilometer (km) is a multiple of the meter, and a millimeter (mm) is a sub-multiple of the meter. This allows us to express very large or very small quantities in a manageable way.

#### 1.4c Unit Conversion

Unit conversion is the process of changing the unit of a quantity. This is often necessary when dealing with quantities expressed in different units. For example, to convert a length expressed in meters to a length expressed in millimeters, we would use the conversion factor of 1 meter = 1000 millimeters.

#### 1.4d Units of Information

In addition to physical quantities, units are also used to measure information. For example, a bit is a unit of information that can have a value of either 0 or 1. A byte is a unit of information that can hold a set of bits. These units are used in the field of information technology to measure the size and capacity of data and systems.

#### 1.4e Obsolete and Unusual Units

There are several other units of information storage that have been named, but are now obsolete or used only in very restricted contexts. These include the crumb, unibit, dibit, quartic digit, tribit, triad, pentad, hexad, heptad, sextet, declet, doublet, quadlet, octlet, hexlet, parcel, wyde, tetra, octa, combit, and comword.

#### 1.4f Radiation-Related Quantities

The SI system also includes units for measuring radiation quantities. For example, the gray (Gy) is the unit of absorbed dose of ionizing radiation, and the sievert (Sv) is the unit of equivalent dose of ionizing radiation. These units are used in the field of radiation therapy to measure the amount of radiation absorbed by a patient's body.

#### 1.4g Unit of Measurement

A unit of measurement is a standardized measure of a physical quantity. It is a fundamental component of any measurement system, providing a common basis for expressing and comparing quantities. Units are used to quantify the size, speed, temperature, and other properties of objects and phenomena.

#### 1.4h Physical Quantity Components

Physical quantities can be broken down into components. For example, a vector quantity can be broken down into its x, y, and z components. This allows us to express complex quantities in a manageable way.

#### 1.4i Dimensional Homogeneity

Units can only be added or subtracted if they are the same type. However, units can always be multiplied or divided. This is known as the principle of dimensional homogeneity. For example, the unit of force (N) is the same as the unit of mass (kg) times the unit of acceleration (m/s^2).

#### 1.4j Standards

A distinction should be made between units and standards. A unit is fixed by its definition and is independent of physical conditions such as temperature. By contrast, a standard is a physical realization of a unit and realizes that unit only under certain physical conditions. For example, a metre is a unit, while a metal bar is a standard. One metre is the same length regardless of temperature, but a metal bar will be exactly one metre long only at a certain temperature.

#### 1.4k Rules for Dealing with Units

There are certain rules that have to be used when dealing with units. These include the rules of dimensional homogeneity, the rules for unit conversion, and the rules for dealing with multiples and submultiples. These rules are essential for ensuring the correctness and consistency of measurements.

#### 1.4l Converting Units of Measurement

Converting units of measurement is a common task in engineering. It involves changing the unit of a quantity from one system of units to another. This is often necessary when dealing with quantities expressed in different units. For example, to convert a length expressed in meters to a length expressed in millimeters, we would use the conversion factor of 1 meter = 1000 millimeters.

#### 1.4m Real-World Implications

The importance of agreed units cannot be overstated. One example of the implications of not using agreed units is the failure of the NASA Mars Climate Orbiter, which was accidentally destroyed on a mission to Mars in September 1999. The failure was caused by a miscommunication about the value of forces, with different computer programs using different units. This incident highlights the critical role that units play in the functioning of machines and systems.




#### 1.4b Importance of Units

Units play a crucial role in the field of engineering. They provide a standardized way of expressing and comparing quantities, which is essential for accurate and consistent measurements. Without units, it would be difficult to compare the size of two objects, the speed of two vehicles, or the temperature of two substances.

Moreover, units are essential for the functioning of machines. Machines are designed to operate within specific parameters, and these parameters are often expressed in units. For example, a machine might be designed to operate at a maximum speed of 100 km/h. Without the unit of kilometers per hour, it would be impossible to express this maximum speed.

Units also play a key role in unit conversion. As we have seen in the previous section, unit conversion is often necessary when dealing with quantities expressed in different units. This is particularly important in engineering, where quantities are often expressed in a variety of units. For example, in the design of a machine, an engineer might need to convert a length expressed in meters to a length expressed in millimeters.

In addition to their role in measurement and conversion, units also have a symbolic significance. For example, the unit of the meter is often associated with the concept of length, the unit of the kilogram is often associated with the concept of mass, and the unit of the second is often associated with the concept of time. This symbolic significance can be useful in understanding and remembering the properties of different units.

In conclusion, units are a fundamental component of the field of engineering. They provide a standardized way of expressing and comparing quantities, they are essential for the functioning of machines, and they have a symbolic significance that can aid in understanding and remembering the properties of different units.

#### 1.4c Conversion of Units

Conversion of units is a fundamental skill in engineering. It allows engineers to compare quantities expressed in different units and to convert between different units as needed. In this section, we will discuss the process of unit conversion and provide some examples.

The process of unit conversion involves three main steps:

1. Identify the units of the quantity you want to convert.
2. Determine the conversion factor between the original unit and the desired unit.
3. Apply the conversion factor to the quantity to convert it to the desired unit.

Let's consider an example. Suppose we want to convert a length of 5 meters to millimeters. The conversion factor is 1 meter = 1000 millimeters. Therefore, the length in millimeters is 5 meters x 1000 millimeters per meter = 5000 millimeters.

Another example is the conversion of a speed of 60 km/h to meters per second. The conversion factor is 1 km/h = 1000 m/h. Therefore, the speed in meters per second is 60 km/h x 1000 m/h per km/h = 60000 m/h.

In some cases, the conversion factor may not be a simple ratio. For example, the conversion factor between degrees Celsius and Kelvin is not a simple ratio. Instead, it is given by the formula $C = K - 273.15$, where $C$ is the temperature in degrees Celsius and $K$ is the temperature in Kelvin.

In conclusion, unit conversion is a crucial skill in engineering. It allows engineers to compare quantities expressed in different units and to convert between different units as needed. The process of unit conversion involves identifying the units of the quantity, determining the conversion factor, and applying the conversion factor to the quantity.




#### 1.4c Conversion of Units

Conversion of units is a fundamental skill in engineering. It allows engineers to compare quantities expressed in different units and to convert between these units. This is particularly important in the design and operation of machines, where quantities are often expressed in a variety of units.

The process of unit conversion involves two main steps: determining the conversion factor and applying this factor to the quantity to be converted. The conversion factor is the ratio of the units to be converted to the units to which the quantity is expressed. For example, to convert a length expressed in meters to a length expressed in millimeters, the conversion factor is 1000 (since 1 meter = 1000 millimeters).

The application of the conversion factor involves multiplying the quantity to be converted by the conversion factor. For example, to convert a length of 5 meters to millimeters, we multiply 5 by 1000, giving 5000 millimeters.

In some cases, the conversion factor may be a fraction or a decimal. In these cases, the conversion factor is often expressed as a power of 10. For example, to convert a quantity expressed in kilograms to grams, the conversion factor is 1000 (since 1 kilogram = 1000 grams). This can be expressed as a power of 10 as 10^3.

Unit conversion is not limited to simple conversions between two units. It can also involve more complex conversions, such as converting between different systems of units. For example, to convert a quantity expressed in the British Gravitational System (BGS) to the International System of Units (SI), we need to apply a series of conversion factors.

In the next section, we will discuss some practical applications of units, including the use of units in the design and operation of machines.

A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions. Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Programs such as SolidWorks and AutoCAD are examples of programs used to draft new parts and products under development.

Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using a computer-controlled machine tool. This process is known as computer-aided manufacturing (CAM). CAM allows for precise and complex parts to be manufactured with high efficiency and accuracy.

### Section: 4.1 Casting:

Casting is a manufacturing process in which molten material is poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape. The molten material is then allowed to cool and solidify, resulting in a solid object with the same shape as the cavity. This process is widely used in the production of various machine components, including gears, shafts, and housings.

#### 4.1a Introduction to Casting

Casting is a versatile manufacturing process that allows for the production of complex shapes and intricate details. It is particularly useful for creating objects with internal cavities or undercuts, which would be difficult or impossible to achieve through other manufacturing methods.

The process of casting involves several steps, each of which is crucial to the final outcome. These steps include pattern making, mold preparation, pouring the molten material, cooling and solidification, and finally, the removal of the solidified object from the mold.

##### Pattern Making

The first step in the casting process is to create a pattern of the object to be produced. This pattern is typically made of wood, metal, or a plastic such as expanded polystyrene. The pattern must be slightly larger than the final product to account for the contraction of the molten material during solidification.

##### Mold Preparation

Once the pattern is complete, it is placed in a molding box, known as a casting flask. The flask is made up of two halves, the cope and the drag, which are latched together and to end closures. The molding sand is then packed around the pattern, and the flask is vibrated to ensure that the sand is compacted and free of air pockets.

##### Pouring the Molten Material

The molten material, typically a metal or alloy, is then poured into the mold cavity. This is typically done through a runner system, which includes a sprue, feeders, and in-gates. The sprue provides the main path for the molten material, while the feeders maintain a good metal feed and the in-gates attach the runner system to the casting cavity.

##### Cooling and Solidification

Once the molten material is poured, it is allowed to cool and solidify. This process can take several hours, depending on the type of material and the design of the object. During this time, gas and steam generated during casting exit through the permeable sand or via risers, which are added either in the pattern itself or as separate pieces.

##### Removal of the Solidified Object

Once the object is solidified, the mold is broken open, and the solidified object is removed from the mold. The object is then cleaned and finished, typically through processes such as grinding, polishing, or heat treatment.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the different types of casting processes, including sand casting, permanent mold casting, and investment casting. Each of these processes has its own unique advantages and applications, and understanding them is crucial to the successful manufacturing of machines.

#### 4.1b Casting Processes

There are several types of casting processes used in the manufacturing industry, each with its own unique characteristics and applications. These include sand casting, permanent mold casting, and investment casting.

##### Sand Casting

Sand casting is the most common type of casting process. It involves using sand as the mold material. The sand is mixed with a binder to form a moldable material. The pattern is then placed in the sand, and the sand is compacted around the pattern. The mold is then heated, and the molten material is poured into the mold. The sand acts as an insulator, allowing the molten material to cool slowly and solidify. The solidified object is then removed from the sand mold.

##### Permanent Mold Casting

Permanent mold casting, also known as die casting, involves using a permanent mold made of steel or aluminum. The mold is heated, and the molten material is poured into the mold. The mold is then cooled, and the solidified object is removed from the mold. This process is typically used for high-volume production of complex shapes.

##### Investment Casting

Investment casting, also known as lost wax casting, is a highly detailed and precise casting process. A wax pattern of the object is created, and it is then coated with a refractory material. The wax is then melted out, leaving a void in the mold. The molten material is then poured into the mold, and the object is solidified. The refractory material is then broken away, and the solidified object is removed from the mold. This process is typically used for small, intricate objects.

Each of these casting processes has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of process depends on the specific requirements of the object being produced. In the next section, we will delve deeper into the casting process and discuss the various factors that can affect the quality of the final product.

#### 4.1c Casting Defects

Despite the precision and care taken during the casting process, defects can still occur in the final product. These defects can be categorized into two types: surface defects and internal defects.

##### Surface Defects

Surface defects occur on the surface of the cast object and can be seen without cutting into the object. These defects can be further divided into three categories: surface roughness, surface cracks, and surface porosity.

Surface roughness is a common defect that occurs when the surface of the cast object is not smooth. This can be caused by improper mold preparation, such as insufficient sand compaction or the presence of air pockets. Surface roughness can be reduced by improving the mold preparation process and using a suitable binder for the sand mold.

Surface cracks are another common defect that can occur during the casting process. These cracks can be caused by rapid cooling of the molten material, which can result in stresses within the solidified object. Surface cracks can be reduced by controlling the cooling rate and using a suitable alloy for the casting.

Surface porosity is a defect that occurs when the surface of the cast object is not solid. This can be caused by insufficient feeding of the molten material, which can result in the formation of gas pockets. Surface porosity can be reduced by improving the feeding system and using a suitable alloy for the casting.

##### Internal Defects

Internal defects occur within the body of the cast object and cannot be seen without cutting into the object. These defects can be further divided into three categories: internal cracks, internal porosity, and shrinkage cavities.

Internal cracks are a type of defect that can occur within the body of the cast object. These cracks can be caused by stresses within the solidified object, similar to surface cracks. Internal cracks can be reduced by controlling the cooling rate and using a suitable alloy for the casting.

Internal porosity is a defect that occurs when the interior of the cast object is not solid. This can be caused by insufficient feeding of the molten material, similar to surface porosity. Internal porosity can be reduced by improving the feeding system and using a suitable alloy for the casting.

Shrinkage cavities are a type of defect that can occur when the molten material contracts during solidification. This can result in the formation of voids within the solidified object. Shrinkage cavities can be reduced by using a suitable alloy for the casting and controlling the cooling rate.

In conclusion, while casting is a precise and efficient manufacturing process, defects can still occur. Understanding these defects and their causes can help in improving the casting process and reducing the occurrence of these defects.

#### 4.2a Introduction to Forging

Forging is a manufacturing process that involves shaping and forming metal using localized deformation. This process is used to create objects of various shapes and sizes, from simple household items to complex machine parts. Forging is particularly useful for creating objects with high strength and ductility, making it a critical process in the manufacturing of machines.

The forging process can be broadly classified into two types: hot forging and cold forging. Hot forging is done at high temperatures, typically above the recrystallization temperature of the metal. This allows for easy deformation and shaping of the metal. Cold forging, on the other hand, is done at room temperature or near-room temperature. This process is typically used for metals that have been previously hot-worked, as it allows for the creation of more intricate shapes and designs.

The forging process begins with the selection of a suitable metal or alloy. The metal is then heated to the desired temperature and shaped using various tools and techniques. The forged object is then cooled and solidified, resulting in a strong and durable product.

Forging is a versatile process that can be used to create a wide range of objects. It is particularly useful for creating objects with complex shapes and designs, as it allows for precise control over the shape and dimensions of the final product. Forging is also a cost-effective process, as it allows for the production of multiple objects simultaneously.

The first step in the forging process is to heat the metal or alloy to a temperature above its recrystallization temperature. This is typically done using a furnace or a heat treatment process. The metal is heated until it is malleable and can be easily shaped without breaking.

##### Shaping

Once the metal is at the desired temperature, it is shaped using various tools and techniques. This can include hammering, pressing, or rolling the metal to achieve the desired shape. The shaping process is typically done using a die, which is a tool that is used to give the metal its final shape. The die is typically made of a harder material than the metal being forged, such as steel or carbide.

##### Cooling

After the metal has been shaped, it is cooled and solidified. This is typically done by removing the metal from the die and allowing it to cool in the air or in a water bath. The cooling process is crucial as it allows the metal to retain its new shape and hardness.

##### Final Processing

Once the metal has been forged, it may undergo additional processing steps such as heat treatment, machining, or surface finishing. These steps are often necessary to achieve the desired properties and dimensions of the final product.

Forging is a versatile process that can be used to create a wide range of objects. It is particularly useful for creating objects with complex shapes and designs, as it allows for precise control over the shape and dimensions of the final product. Forging is also a cost-effective process, as it allows for the production of multiple objects simultaneously.

In the next section, we will explore the role of forging in the manufacturing of machines, and how it contributes to the overall strength and durability of machine components.

#### 4.2c Forging Defects

Despite the precision and control involved in the forging process, defects can still occur in the final product. These defects can be categorized into two types: surface defects and internal defects.

##### Surface Defects

Surface defects occur on the surface of the forged object and can be seen without cutting into the object. These defects can be further divided into three categories: surface cracks, surface porosity, and surface roughness.

Surface cracks are small cracks that occur on the surface of the forged object. These cracks can be caused by the metal being overheated, resulting in a weakening of the metal. They can also occur if the metal is not properly shaped, resulting in stress concentrations.

Surface porosity is the presence of small holes or voids on the surface of the forged object. These holes can be caused by the metal not being properly heated or by the presence of impurities in the metal.

Surface roughness is a rough or uneven surface on the forged object. This can be caused by the metal not being properly shaped or by the presence of impurities in the metal.

##### Internal Defects

Internal defects occur within the body of the forged object and cannot be seen without cutting into the object. These defects can be further divided into three categories: internal cracks, internal porosity, and internal voids.

Internal cracks are small cracks that occur within the body of the forged object. These cracks can be caused by the metal being overheated, resulting in a weakening of the metal. They can also occur if the metal is not properly shaped, resulting in stress concentrations.

Internal porosity is the presence of small holes or voids within the body of the forged object. These holes can be caused by the metal not being properly heated or by the presence of impurities in the metal.

Internal voids are large empty spaces within the body of the forged object. These voids can be caused by the metal not being properly heated or by the presence of impurities in the metal.

In conclusion, while forging is a precise and controlled process, defects can still occur. These defects can significantly impact the strength and durability of the final product, making it crucial for manufacturers to understand and mitigate these defects.

#### 4.3a Introduction to Machining
