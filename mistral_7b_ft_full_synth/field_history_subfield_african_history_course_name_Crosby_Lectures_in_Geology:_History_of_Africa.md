### Section: 1.1 Formation of African Cratons:

The African continent is home to several cratons, stable blocks of old crust with deep roots in the subcontinental lithospheric mantle. These cratons have played a crucial role in shaping the geological history of Africa and have been the subject of extensive research by geologists. In this section, we will explore the formation of African cratons, their characteristics, and their significance in the geological history of the continent.

#### 1.1a Introduction to African Cratons

The African Plate, which includes several cratons, is one of the largest and oldest plates in the world. The cratons are from south to north, the Kalahari Craton, Congo Craton, Tanzania Craton, and West African Craton. These cratons were widely separated in the past, but came together during the assembly of the supercontinent Pangea around 250 million years ago. They are connected by orogenic belts, regions of highly deformed rock where the tectonic plates have engaged.

The Saharan Metacraton, located in the Sahara Desert, has been tentatively identified as the remains of a craton that has become detached from the subcontinental lithospheric mantle. However, it is also possible that the Saharan Metacraton is a collection of unrelated crustal fragments swept together during the Pan-African orogeny.

In some areas, the cratons are covered by sedimentary basins, such as the Tindouf Basin, Taoudeni Basin, and Congo Basin. These basins are overlaid by more recent Neoproterozoic sediments, providing valuable insights into the geological history of the continent. The plate also includes shear zones such as the Central African Shear Zone (CASZ) and rifts such as the Anza Trough, where the crust was pulled apart and filled with more modern sediment.

In addition to its role in the formation of the Sahara Desert, the Saharan Metacraton has also played a crucial role in the formation of other African cratons. The collision of the Saharan Metacraton with the Nubian Shield and the Arabian Plate is believed to have triggered a series of events that led to the formation of the Afar Triangle.

The formation of the Saharan Metacraton is a complex and ongoing process, with new research and discoveries continually expanding our understanding of this ancient landmass. In the next section, we will explore the formation of the Afar Triangle, another important craton in the African Plate.

#### 1.1s Formation of the Afar Triangle

The Afar Triangle, located in the Horn of Africa, is a unique and dynamic craton that has been the subject of extensive research and debate among geologists. It is estimated to be around 2.5 billion years old and is composed of ancient granitic rocks. The triangle is named after the Afar region, where it is located.

The formation of the Afar Triangle is closely linked to the formation of the Saharan Metacraton and the Arabian Plate. The collision of these three cratons around 600 million years ago during the Pan-African orogeny caused the crust of the Afar Triangle to be pushed up and over the crust of the Saharan Metacraton and the Arabian Plate.

The formation of the Afar Triangle has had a significant impact on the geological history of Africa. The uplift of the triangle led to the formation of the Great Rift Valley, a large and deep rift that runs along the eastern edge of the triangle. This rift is home to a variety of volcanic features, including the Erta Ale volcano, one of the most active volcanoes in the world.

In addition to its role in the formation of volcanic features, the Afar Triangle has also played a crucial role in the formation of other African cratons. The collision of the Afar Triangle with the Saharan Metacraton and the Arabian Plate is believed to have triggered a series of events that led to the formation of the Somali Plate.

The formation of the Afar Triangle is a complex and ongoing process, with new research and discoveries continually expanding our understanding of this ancient landmass. In the next section, we will explore the formation of the Somali Plate, another important craton in the African Plate.

#### 1.1b Formation and Evolution

The formation of African cratons is a complex process that has been shaped by various geological events over billions of years. The African Plate, which includes several cratons, is one of the oldest and largest plates in the world. The cratons are from south to north, the Kalahari Craton, Congo Craton, Tanzania Craton, and West African Craton. These cratons were widely separated in the past, but came together during the assembly of the supercontinent Pangea around 250 million years ago.

The formation of African cratons began with the separation of the Earth's mantle into distinct layers, with the upper layer, or lithosphere, becoming the crust. This process is known as differentiation and is thought to have occurred around 4.5 billion years ago. The lithosphere is a thin layer of solid rock that floats on the semi-fluid asthenosphere, which is the lower layer of the mantle. The lithosphere is further divided into smaller plates, which move and interact with each other over time.

The African Plate, which includes several cratons, is one of the oldest and largest plates in the world. The cratons are from south to north, the Kalahari Craton, Congo Craton, Tanzania Craton, and West African Craton. These cratons were widely separated in the past, but came together during the assembly of the supercontinent Pangea around 250 million years ago. They are connected by orogenic belts, regions of highly deformed rock where the tectonic plates have engaged.

The Saharan Metacraton, located in the Sahara Desert, has been tentatively identified as the remains of a craton that has become detached from the subcontinental lithospheric mantle. However, it is also possible that the Saharan Metacraton is a collection of unrelated crustal fragments swept together during the Pan-African orogeny.

In some areas, the cratons are covered by sedimentary basins, such as the Tindouf Basin, Taoudeni Basin, and Congo Basin. These basins are overlaid by more recent Neoproterozoic sediments, providing valuable insights into the geological history of the continent. The plate also includes shear zones such as the Central African Shear Zone (CASZ) and rifts such as the Anza Trough, where the crust was pulled apart and filled with more modern sediment.

The formation of African cratons is a complex and ongoing process, with new research and discoveries continually expanding our understanding of these ancient landmasses. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the formation and evolution of African cratons, exploring their unique characteristics and the geological events that have shaped them over billions of years.

#### 1.1c Modern African Cratons

The African cratons have undergone significant changes since their formation, with the most recent being the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea around 250 million years ago. This event led to the rearrangement of the African cratons, with the Kalahari Craton and Congo Craton moving northward and the Tanzania Craton and West African Craton moving westward. This movement resulted in the formation of the Great Rift Valley, a series of rifts and faults that run across East Africa.

The modern African cratons are now separated by the Central African Shear Zone (CASZ), a region of intense deformation and faulting. The CASZ is thought to be the result of the separation of the African Plate from the South American Plate, which occurred around 100 million years ago. This separation led to the formation of the Atlantic Ocean and the widening of the Indian Ocean.

The modern African cratons are also characterized by their stable nature, with little to no plate movement. This stability is due to the thick and strong lithosphere of the cratons, which resists the forces of plate movement. However, the cratons are not completely stable, and small-scale movements can still occur, such as the rifting of the Great Rift Valley.

The modern African cratons are also home to some of the oldest rocks on Earth, with the oldest known rocks dating back to 3.6 billion years ago. These rocks, known as the Barberton Greenstone Belt, are located in the Kalahari Craton and provide valuable insights into the early history of the Earth.

In addition to their geological significance, the African cratons also play a crucial role in the global climate system. The cratons are covered by vast expanses of desert, which act as a heat sink, absorbing and storing heat from the sun. This heat is then released at night, helping to regulate the Earth's temperature. The cratons also play a role in the global water cycle, with the Great Rift Valley acting as a conduit for the movement of water from the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea.

In conclusion, the African cratons have undergone significant changes since their formation, with the most recent being the breakup of Pangea. These changes have shaped the geological and climatic features of the continent, making it a fascinating area of study for geologists and climatologists alike. 





#### 1.1c Geological Significance

The formation and evolution of African cratons have significant implications for the geological history of the continent. The African Plate, with its four main cratons, has been a major player in the assembly and breakup of supercontinents. The Kalahari Craton, Congo Craton, Tanzania Craton, and West African Craton have all played a role in the formation of the African continent as we know it today.

The Kalahari Craton, for instance, is one of the oldest and most stable cratons in Africa. Its ancient rocks have been the site of extensive research, particularly in the field of paleontology. The craton's stability has allowed for the preservation of ancient rocks and fossils, providing valuable insights into the early history of life on Earth.

The Congo Craton, on the other hand, is known for its rich mineral resources, including copper, cobalt, and uranium. The craton's geological significance extends beyond its mineral wealth, however. The Congo Craton has been a major site of geological research, particularly in the field of plate tectonics. The craton's complex history of assembly and disassembly has provided valuable insights into the processes that shape the Earth's continents.

The Tanzania Craton and West African Craton, while less well-studied than the Kalahari and Congo Cratons, have also played a significant role in the geological history of Africa. The Tanzania Craton, for instance, is known for its extensive sedimentary basins, which have been the site of significant hydrocarbon discoveries. The West African Craton, meanwhile, is known for its extensive Precambrian shield, which has been the site of extensive geological research.

In conclusion, the formation and evolution of African cratons have been a major driver of the continent's geological history. From the ancient rocks of the Kalahari Craton to the rich mineral resources of the Congo Craton, the African Plate has been a major player in the assembly and breakup of supercontinents. The study of these cratons continues to provide valuable insights into the processes that shape the Earth's continents.

### Subsection: 1.3a Introduction to Sedimentary Basins

Sedimentary basins are geological structures that are formed by the accumulation of sediments over time. These basins are found in various parts of the world, including Africa, and play a crucial role in the geological history of the continent. They are formed by a variety of processes, including tectonic activity, erosion, and sedimentation.

#### 1.3a Introduction to Sedimentary Basins

Sedimentary basins in Africa are particularly important due to their role in the formation of the continent's mineral resources. For instance, the East African Rift Valley, a sedimentary basin formed by the East African Orogeny, is home to significant deposits of gold, copper, and other minerals. Similarly, the Sahara Metacraton, formed during the Proterozoic Era, has led to the formation of the Sahara Desert, a region known for its rich mineral resources.

The formation of sedimentary basins is a complex process that involves the interaction of various geological factors. For instance, the formation of the Anglo-Welsh Basin, a sedimentary basin found in South Wales and parts of England, is influenced by the Silurian and Devonian tectonic events that occurred in the region. These events led to the formation of various formations, including the Downton Castle Sandstone Formation, the Raglan Mudstone Formation, and the St Maughans Formation, among others.

The study of sedimentary basins is crucial for understanding the geological history of Africa. By studying the sediments found in these basins, geologists can reconstruct the environmental conditions that existed during the time the sediments were deposited. This information can then be used to understand the evolution of the continent's geology over time.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the study of sedimentary basins in Africa, exploring their formation, evolution, and the role they play in the continent's geological history.




#### 1.3b Formation and Characteristics

The formation of sedimentary basins is a complex process that involves the interaction of various geological factors. These factors include tectonic activity, erosion, and sedimentation. The formation of sedimentary basins is also influenced by the geological history of the region, including past geological events and processes.

##### Formation of Sedimentary Basins

The formation of sedimentary basins can be broadly categorized into two types: rift basins and fold and fault basins. Rift basins are formed by the separation of the Earth's crust along fault lines, leading to the formation of a basin. This process is often associated with plate tectonics and is responsible for the formation of many sedimentary basins in Africa, including the Great Rift Valley and the Red Sea.

Fold and fault basins, on the other hand, are formed by the folding and faulting of the Earth's crust. This process can be caused by a variety of factors, including compression and extension of the crust, as well as the movement of tectonic plates. The folding and faulting of the crust can create basins, often referred to as synclines, which can fill with sediment over time.

##### Characteristics of Sedimentary Basins

Sedimentary basins exhibit a variety of characteristics that are influenced by their formation processes. These characteristics include the type and thickness of sediments, the presence of hydrocarbons, and the structural features of the basin.

The type and thickness of sediments found in a sedimentary basin can provide valuable information about the basin's formation processes. For instance, the presence of thick sequences of sediments can indicate a long history of sedimentation, often associated with the formation of fold and fault basins.

#### 1.3c Importance of Sedimentary Basins

Sedimentary basins play a crucial role in the geological history of Africa. They are not only important for their role in the formation of the continent's mineral resources, but also for their contribution to the understanding of the Earth's evolution.

##### Role in Mineral Resource Formation

Sedimentary basins are known for their rich mineral resources. The sediments deposited in these basins can become sources of valuable minerals such as oil, gas, and various types of ore. For instance, the East African Rift Valley, a sedimentary basin formed by the East African Orogeny, is home to significant deposits of gold, copper, and other minerals. Similarly, the Sahara Metacraton, formed during the Proterozoic Era, has led to the formation of the Sahara Desert, a region known for its rich mineral resources.

The formation of these mineral resources is often associated with the geological processes that create sedimentary basins. For example, the folding and faulting of the Earth's crust, a process that can create basins, can also lead to the concentration of minerals in certain areas. This concentration can occur when minerals are carried by fluids, such as groundwater or hydrothermal fluids, and are deposited in the pore spaces between sediment grains.

##### Contribution to Earth's Evolution

Sedimentary basins also provide valuable insights into the Earth's evolution. The sediments deposited in these basins can be used to reconstruct the environmental conditions that existed during the time the sediments were deposited. This can include information about the climate, the types of organisms living in the area, and the geological processes occurring at the time.

For instance, the study of sediments in the Anglo-Welsh Basin, a sedimentary basin found in South Wales and parts of England, has provided insights into the Silurian and Devonian tectonic events that occurred in the region. These events led to the formation of various formations, including the Downton Castle Sandstone Formation, the Raglan Mudstone Formation, and the St Maughans Formation, among others.

In conclusion, sedimentary basins are not only important for their mineral resources, but also for their contribution to our understanding of the Earth's evolution. The study of these basins can provide valuable insights into the geological processes that have shaped the continent over millions of years.

## Chapter 2: The Panafrican Orogeny:

### Introduction

The Panafrican Orogeny is a significant geological event that has shaped the African continent and its surrounding regions. It is a complex and multifaceted process that has been studied extensively by geologists and geophysicists. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive guide to the Panafrican Orogeny, covering its history, causes, and effects.

The Panafrican Orogeny is a continental-scale orogenic event that occurred during the Proterozoic Eon, approximately 2.5 billion years ago. It is characterized by the formation of large-scale folds and faults, as well as the emplacement of granitic intrusions. These processes resulted in the formation of the African Shield, a stable and ancient craton that covers much of the African continent.

The Panafrican Orogeny is believed to have been caused by a combination of factors, including plate tectonics, mantle plumes, and the effects of the Moon's formation. These processes led to the formation of a supercontinent, known as Rodinia, which included the African Shield and other continental fragments. This supercontinent eventually broke up, leading to the formation of the modern continents.

The effects of the Panafrican Orogeny are still visible today, with the African Shield being one of the oldest and most stable regions on Earth. The processes involved in the Panafrican Orogeny also played a crucial role in the development of the Earth's early atmosphere and oceans. This chapter will delve into the details of these processes and their implications for the geology of Africa.

In the following sections, we will explore the history, causes, and effects of the Panafrican Orogeny in more detail. We will also discuss the current theories and research surrounding this event, providing a comprehensive understanding of this important geological process.

### Section: 2.1 Collision of Gondwana and Laurentia:

The collision of Gondwana and Laurentia was a pivotal event in the geological history of Africa. This collision, which occurred during the Panafrican Orogeny, resulted in the formation of the African Shield, a stable platform of ancient rocks that covers much of the continent. In this section, we will explore the details of this collision, including the timing, processes, and consequences.

#### 2.1a Timing of the Collision

The collision of Gondwana and Laurentia occurred approximately 1.1 billion years ago, during the Neoproterozoic era. This was a time of significant geological activity, with numerous orogenic events occurring across the globe. The collision was part of a larger process known as the Panafrican Orogeny, which lasted from approximately 1.2 billion to 550 million years ago.

The collision was preceded by the separation of Gondwana from Laurentia, which occurred approximately 1.8 billion years ago. This separation was likely driven by the movement of tectonic plates, which were beginning to play a significant role in shaping the Earth's surface. The separation of Gondwana from Laurentia allowed for the development of distinct geological features on each continent, setting the stage for the eventual collision.

#### 2.1b The Collision Process

The collision of Gondwana and Laurentia was a complex process that involved the interaction of multiple tectonic plates. The collision was primarily driven by the movement of the Gondwana plate, which was moving northward towards Laurentia. As the Gondwana plate approached Laurentia, it began to interact with the Laurentian plate, leading to the formation of a collision zone.

The collision zone was characterized by intense deformation and metamorphism, as the rocks of Gondwana and Laurentia were forced together. This resulted in the formation of a series of mountain ranges, known as orogenic belts, which were formed by the folding and faulting of the rocks. The collision also led to the formation of a series of igneous intrusions, known as plutons, which were formed by the melting of the rocks under extreme pressure and temperature.

#### 2.1c Consequences of the Collision

The collision of Gondwana and Laurentia had significant consequences for the geological history of Africa. The formation of the African Shield, a stable platform of ancient rocks, was a direct result of this collision. This shield has been a source of stability for the continent, with much of Africa's mineral wealth being found within its boundaries.

The collision also led to the formation of the Sahara Desert, as the intense deformation and metamorphism caused by the collision resulted in the uplift of the land surface, leading to the formation of a series of mountain ranges. These mountain ranges acted as barriers to precipitation, leading to the arid conditions that characterize the Sahara Desert today.

In addition, the collision played a crucial role in the development of the Earth's oceans. The movement of the Gondwana plate towards Laurentia led to the closure of the Iapetus Ocean, which had existed between the two continents. This closure resulted in the formation of the Atlantic Ocean, which is one of the largest and most important oceans in the world.

In conclusion, the collision of Gondwana and Laurentia was a pivotal event in the geological history of Africa. It resulted in the formation of the African Shield, the Sahara Desert, and the Atlantic Ocean, and played a crucial role in the development of the Earth's oceans. Understanding this collision is essential for understanding the geological history of Africa and its role in shaping the Earth's surface.

# Pan-African orogeny

The Pan-African orogeny was a series of major Neoproterozoic orogenic events which related to the formation of the supercontinents Gondwana and Pannotia about 600 million years ago. This orogeny is also known as the Pan-Gondwanan or Saldanian Orogeny. The Pan-African orogeny and the Grenville orogeny are the largest known systems of orogenies on Earth. The sum of the continental crust formed in the Pan-African orogeny and the Grenville orogeny makes the Neoproterozoic the period of Earth's history that has produced most continental crust.

## History and terminology

The term "Pan-African" was coined by for a tectono-thermal event at about 500 Ma when a series of mobile belts in Africa formed between much older African cratons. At the time, other terms were used for similar orogenic events on other continents, i.e. "Brasiliano" in South America; "Adelaidean" in Australia; and "Beardmore" in Antarctica.

Later, when plate tectonics became generally accepted, the term "Pan-African" was extended to all of the supercontinent Gondwana. Because the formation of Gondwana encompassed several continents and extended from the Neoproterozoic to the early Palaeozoic, "Pan-African" could no longer be considered a single orogeny, but rather an orogenic cycle that included the opening and closing of several large oceans and the collisions of several continental blocks. Furthermore, the Pan-African events are contemporaneous with the Cadomian orogeny in Europe and the Baikalian orogeny in Asia, and crust from these areas were probably part of Pannotia (i.e. Gondwana when it first formed) during the Precambrian.

Attempts to correlate the African Pan-African belts with the South American Brasiliano belts on the other side of the Atlantic has in many cases been problematic # Cape Fold Belt

### Formation of the Fold Mountains

The Witteberg sediments were laid down in what remained of the Agulhas Sea – a shallow, much reduced expanse of water compared to its size during the early Neoproterozoic. The sediments were deposited in a series of basins, some of which were probably rifted, and others which were probably epicontinental seas. The sediments are mainly of late Neoproterozoic age, with some early Cambrian sediments in the north.

The Witteberg sediments are overlain by the Cape Fold Belt, a series of mountain ranges formed by the collision of the African and South American continents during the Pan-African orogeny. The Cape Fold Belt is one of the most well-known and studied examples of orogenic processes in the world. The formation of the Cape Fold Belt was a complex process that involved the collision of the African and South American continents, the opening and closing of oceans, and the uplift and erosion of mountains.

The Cape Fold Belt is characterized by a series of parallel folds, with the oldest rocks in the south and the youngest rocks in the north. The folds are believed to have formed as a result of the collision between the African and South American continents, which caused the rocks to be compressed and folded. The Cape Fold Belt is also known for its rich mineral deposits, including gold, diamonds, and copper.

The formation of the Cape Fold Belt is a prime example of the tectonic processes that occurred during the Pan-African orogeny. The collision of continents, the opening and closing of oceans, and the uplift and erosion of mountains all played a role in shaping the geological landscape of Africa. The study of the Cape Fold Belt continues to provide valuable insights into the processes that shaped the Earth's continents and oceans.

### Subsection: 2.3a Introduction to Metamorphic Rocks

Metamorphic rocks are a result of the Panafrican Orogeny, formed during the intense heat and pressure of the orogenic events. These rocks are found throughout Africa, and their study provides valuable insights into the geological history of the continent.

#### 2.3a.1 Formation of Metamorphic Rocks

Metamorphic rocks are formed when sedimentary or igneous rocks are subjected to high temperatures and pressures. This can occur due to various processes, such as subduction, collision, and mantle plumes. The Panafrican Orogeny, with its series of orogenic events, provided the necessary conditions for the formation of metamorphic rocks.

The formation of metamorphic rocks is a complex process that involves several stages. First, the protolith, or the original rock, is subjected to high temperatures and pressures. This causes the rock to melt and recrystallize, forming a new rock with different mineral assemblages. The type of metamorphic rock formed depends on the composition of the protolith, the temperature and pressure conditions, and the duration of the metamorphic event.

#### 2.3a.2 Types of Metamorphic Rocks

There are several types of metamorphic rocks, each with its own unique characteristics. These include:

- **Garnet amphibolite**: This is a common type of metamorphic rock formed during the Panafrican Orogeny. It is characterized by the presence of garnet, a mineral that forms under high pressures and temperatures. Garnet amphibolite is found in the Gore Mountain region of New York, USA, and provides valuable insights into the conditions of the Panafrican Orogeny.

- **Eclogite**: Eclogite is another common type of metamorphic rock formed during the Panafrican Orogeny. It is characterized by the presence of olivine and omphacite, minerals that form under extremely high pressures and temperatures. Eclogite is found in the Alps and the Himalayas, and its study has provided valuable insights into the conditions of the Panafrican Orogeny.

- **Greenschist**: Greenschist is a type of metamorphic rock formed under lower temperatures and pressures compared to garnet amphibolite and eclogite. It is characterized by the presence of chlorite, a mineral that forms under moderate pressures and temperatures. Greenschist is found in the Alps and the Himalayas, and its study has provided valuable insights into the conditions of the Panafrican Orogeny.

#### 2.3a.3 Significance of Metamorphic Rocks

The study of metamorphic rocks is crucial for understanding the geological history of Africa. These rocks provide valuable insights into the conditions of the Panafrican Orogeny, including the temperature and pressure conditions, the duration of the metamorphic event, and the composition of the protolith.

### Subsection: 2.3b Formation during the Panafrican Orogeny

The Panafrican Orogeny, a series of orogenic events that occurred between 1.1 and 0.5 billion years ago, played a crucial role in the formation of metamorphic rocks in Africa. The intense heat and pressure generated during these events led to the recrystallization of sedimentary and igneous rocks, forming new metamorphic rocks with unique mineral assemblages.

#### 2.3b.1 Role of the Panafrican Orogeny

The Panafrican Orogeny was a complex series of events that involved the collision of various tectonic plates, the formation of mountain ranges, and the emplacement of large igneous provinces (LIPs). These events were responsible for the intense heat and pressure conditions that led to the formation of metamorphic rocks.

The collision of tectonic plates, for instance, resulted in the compression of rocks, leading to the formation of folds and faults. This compression also increased the temperature and pressure of the rocks, causing them to melt and recrystallize. The type of metamorphic rock formed depended on the composition of the protolith, the temperature and pressure conditions, and the duration of the metamorphic event.

The formation of mountain ranges, on the other hand, led to the uplift of rocks, exposing them to higher temperatures and pressures. This resulted in the formation of high-grade metamorphic rocks, such as garnet amphibolite and eclogite.

The emplacement of LIPs, such as the Selli Event, also played a significant role in the formation of metamorphic rocks. The flood basalts associated with these events generated large amounts of heat, which contributed to the metamorphism of surrounding rocks.

#### 2.3b.2 Metamorphic Rocks Formed during the Panafrican Orogeny

The Panafrican Orogeny led to the formation of a variety of metamorphic rocks, each with its own unique characteristics. These include:

- **Garnet amphibolite**: This is a common type of metamorphic rock formed during the Panafrican Orogeny. It is characterized by the presence of garnet, a mineral that forms under high pressures and temperatures. Garnet amphibolite is found in the Gore Mountain region of New York, USA, and provides valuable insights into the conditions of the Panafrican Orogeny.

- **Eclogite**: Eclogite is another common type of metamorphic rock formed during the Panafrican Orogeny. It is characterized by the presence of olivine and omphacite, minerals that form under extremely high pressures and temperatures. Eclogite is found in the Alps and the Himalayas, and its study has provided valuable insights into the conditions of the Panafrican Orogeny.

- **High-grade metamorphic rocks**: These include garnet amphibolite, eclogite, and other high-grade metamorphic rocks that formed under extremely high temperatures and pressures. These rocks provide valuable insights into the conditions of the Panafrican Orogeny and the processes that led to their formation.

The study of these metamorphic rocks, along with other geological evidence, has allowed scientists to reconstruct the tectonic history of Africa during the Panafrican Orogeny. This has provided valuable insights into the processes that shaped the continent and the Earth as a whole.

### Subsection: 2.5a Post-Orogeny Tectonic Activity

After the Panafrican Orogeny, Africa continued to experience significant tectonic activity. This post-orogenic activity has shaped the continent's geology and continues to influence its evolution today.

#### 2.5a Post-Orogeny Tectonic Activity

The post-orogenic activity in Africa can be broadly categorized into two phases: the rifting phase and the collision phase. The rifting phase, which began about 300 million years ago, was characterized by the separation of the African continent from Gondwana and the formation of the Great Rift Valley. This phase was driven by the cooling and thinning of the lithosphere, which allowed for the formation of new crust along the rift.

The collision phase, which began about 250 million years ago, was characterized by the convergence of the African and Eurasian plates. This phase led to the formation of the Alps and the Pyrenees, as well as the uplift of the Atlas Mountains in North Africa. The collision also resulted in the closure of the Tethys Sea, which had separated Africa from Europe during the Mesozoic era.

The post-orogenic activity in Africa has had a profound impact on the continent's geology. The rifting phase led to the formation of the Great Rift Valley, a major feature that extends from the Red Sea to Mozambique. This valley is characterized by a series of faults and volcanic activity, which have resulted in the formation of new landforms and the discovery of significant mineral resources.

The collision phase, on the other hand, has led to the formation of the Atlas Mountains, which are a major source of water for the Sahara Desert. The uplift of these mountains has also resulted in the formation of significant mineral deposits, including gold, silver, and copper.

The post-orogenic activity in Africa continues to influence the continent's geology today.

### Introduction

The Wilson Cycle is a fundamental concept in the study of geology, particularly in the context of the formation of the present oceans. It is a theory that explains the cyclic nature of the Earth's crust, where the continents and oceans are constantly changing and evolving over time. This chapter will delve into the intricacies of the Wilson Cycle, providing a comprehensive guide to understanding the geological processes that have shaped the African continent and the oceans that surround it.

The Wilson Cycle is named after the American geologist Harry Hess, who first proposed the theory in the 1960s. It is based on the concept of plate tectonics, which posits that the Earth's lithosphere is divided into several large and small plates that float on the asthenosphere, a semi-fluid layer of the mantle. These plates move and interact with each other, driving various geological processes such as mountain building, volcanism, and the formation of new landforms.

In this chapter, we will explore the various stages of the Wilson Cycle, starting with the initial rifting of the continents, followed by the formation of mid-ocean ridges and the opening of oceans.

We will also delve into the specific context of Africa, examining how the Wilson Cycle has shaped the geological history of the continent. This will include a discussion on the formation of the Great Rift Valley, the opening of the Indian Ocean, and the collision of the African and Arabian plates that led to the formation of the Sahara Desert.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a comprehensive understanding of the Wilson Cycle and its role in shaping the geology of Africa. This knowledge will provide a solid foundation for the subsequent chapters, which will delve deeper into the specific geological features and processes of the African continent.




### Subsection: 3.1a Introduction to the Supercontinent Cycle

The supercontinent cycle is a fundamental concept in the study of geology, particularly in the context of the formation of the present oceans. It is a theory that explains the cyclic nature of the Earth's crust, where the continents and oceans are constantly changing and evolving over time. This section will delve into the intricacies of the supercontinent cycle, providing a comprehensive guide to understanding the geological processes that have shaped the African continent and the oceans that surround it.

The most recent supercontinent, Pangaea, formed about 300 million years ago (0.3 Ga). There are two different views on the history of earlier supercontinents. The first proposes a series of supercontinents: Vaalbara (<circa> 3.6 to c. 2.8 billion years ago); Ur (<circa> 3 billion years ago); Kenorland (<circa> 2.7 to 2.1 billion years ago); Columbia (<circa> 1.8 to 1.5 billion years ago); Rodinia (<circa> 1.25 billion to 750 million years ago); and Pannotia (<circa> 600 million years ago), whose dispersal produced the fragments that ultimately collided to form Pangaea.

The second view (Protopangea-Paleopangea), based on both palaeomagnetic and geological evidence, is that supercontinent cycles did not occur before about 0.6 Ga (during the Ediacaran Period). Instead, the continental crust comprised a single supercontinent from about 2.7 Ga until it broke up for the first time, somewhere around 0.6 Ga. This reconstruction is based on the observation that if only small peripheral modifications are made to the primary reconstruction, the data show that the palaeomagnetic poles converged to quasi-static positions for long intervals between about 2.7–2.2, 1.5–1.25 and 0.75–0.6 Ga. During the intervening periods, the poles appear to have conformed to a unified apparent polar wander path. Thus the paleomagnetic data are adequately explained by the existence of a single Protopangea–Paleopangea supercontinent with prolonged periods of stability.

The supercontinent cycle is a key component of the Wilson Cycle, which explains the formation of the present oceans. The cycle is named after the American geologist Harry Hess, who first proposed the theory in the 1960s. It is based on the concept of plate tectonics, which posits that the Earth's lithosphere is divided into several large and small plates that float on the asthenosphere, a semi-fluid layer of the mantle. These plates move and interact with each other, driving various geological processes such as mountain building, volcanism, and the formation of new landforms.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the specific stages of the Wilson Cycle, starting with the initial rifting of the continents, followed by the formation of mid-ocean ridges and the opening of oceans. We will also discuss the subsequent stages of the cycle, including the collision of continents, the formation of mountain ranges, and the eventual return to the initial rifting stage.




### Subsection: 3.1b Major Orogenic Events in Africa

The African continent has been a witness to a series of major orogenic events that have shaped its geological landscape. These events, which are a part of the Wilson Cycle, have been instrumental in the formation of the present oceans and continents. In this section, we will delve into the major orogenic events that have occurred in Africa, providing a comprehensive guide to understanding the geological processes that have shaped the African continent.

#### The Pan-African Orogeny

The Pan-African Orogeny, which occurred between 1.0 and 0.5 billion years ago, was a major orogenic event that affected the African continent. It was a result of the collision of several microcontinents and the formation of the Pan-African mountain range. This event led to the formation of the Sahara Desert and the uplift of the Atlas Mountains in North Africa. The Pan-African Orogeny also played a crucial role in the formation of the African Shield, a stable region of ancient rocks that forms the core of the African continent.

#### The Hercynian Orogeny

The Hercynian Orogeny, which occurred between 300 and 250 million years ago, was another major orogenic event that affected the African continent. It was a result of the collision of the African and European continents, leading to the formation of the Hercynian Mountains. This event was a part of the Variscan orogeny, which was a global event that affected the continents of Gondwana and Laurussia. The Hercynian Orogeny led to the formation of the Atlas Mountains in Morocco and the Anti-Atlas Mountains in Algeria.

#### The Alpine Orogeny

The Alpine Orogeny, which occurred between 65 and 25 million years ago, was a major orogenic event that affected the African continent. It was a result of the collision of the African and European continents, leading to the formation of the Alps and the Pyrenees. This event was a part of the Alpine-Himalayan orogeny, which was a global event that affected the continents of Gondwana and Laurussia. The Alpine Orogeny led to the formation of the Atlas Mountains in Morocco and the Anti-Atlas Mountains in Algeria.

#### The Tethyan Orogeny

The Tethyan Orogeny, which occurred between 25 and 10 million years ago, was a major orogenic event that affected the African continent. It was a result of the collision of the African and European continents, leading to the formation of the Tethys Ocean. This event was a part of the Alpine-Himalayan orogeny, which was a global event that affected the continents of Gondwana and Laurussia. The Tethyan Orogeny led to the formation of the Atlas Mountains in Morocco and the Anti-Atlas Mountains in Algeria.

In conclusion, the African continent has been a witness to a series of major orogenic events that have shaped its geological landscape. These events, which are a part of the Wilson Cycle, have been instrumental in the formation of the present oceans and continents. Understanding these events is crucial for understanding the geological processes that have shaped the African continent.




### Subsection: 3.1c Impact on African Geology

The African continent has been shaped by a series of major orogenic events, each with its own unique impact on the geology of the region. These events have not only influenced the physical landscape of Africa, but also its climate, biodiversity, and human history.

#### The Pan-African Orogeny and the African Shield

The Pan-African Orogeny, with its associated uplift and erosion, played a crucial role in the formation of the African Shield. This event led to the exposure of ancient rocks, some of which are over 3 billion years old. The African Shield, which forms the core of the African continent, is a stable region of ancient rocks that has been largely unaffected by later geological events. This stability has allowed for the preservation of some of the oldest rocks on Earth, providing valuable insights into the early history of the planet.

#### The Hercynian Orogeny and the Atlas Mountains

The Hercynian Orogeny, with its associated collision of continents, led to the formation of the Atlas Mountains in North Africa. These mountains, which are part of the Atlas System, are a result of the compression and uplift that occurred during the collision. The Atlas Mountains are home to a diverse range of ecosystems, from the Sahara Desert to the north, to the Mediterranean climate of the Atlas Cedar Forests to the west. The Atlas Mountains also played a crucial role in the history of human settlement in North Africa, providing a natural barrier between the Sahara and the more fertile regions to the west.

#### The Alpine Orogeny and the African Rift Valley

The Alpine Orogeny, with its associated separation of continents, led to the formation of the African Rift Valley. This event resulted in the separation of the African and Arabian continents, leading to the formation of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The African Rift Valley is a region of ongoing geological activity, with volcanic activity and seismic activity still occurring today. This activity has led to the formation of the Great Rift Valley, a series of faults and valleys that stretch across East Africa. The African Rift Valley is home to a diverse range of ecosystems, from the arid regions of the Danakil Depression to the lush highlands of Ethiopia.

In conclusion, the major orogenic events that have occurred in Africa have had a profound impact on the geology of the region. These events have shaped the physical landscape, climate, biodiversity, and human history of Africa, and continue to influence the ongoing geological processes in the region.

### Subsection: 3.2a Overview of Rifting and Ocean Formation

The formation of the Atlantic Ocean is a complex process that has been shaped by a variety of geological events, including the Wilson Cycle and the opening of ocean basins. The Wilson Cycle, named after the British geologist Arthur Holmes, is a theory that describes the evolution of the Earth's crust and mantle over time. It proposes that the Earth's crust and mantle are in a constant state of flux, with old crust being subducted into the mantle and new crust being formed at mid-ocean ridges. This cycle is believed to have played a crucial role in the formation of the Atlantic Ocean.

The opening of ocean basins, on the other hand, is a process that involves the separation of continents and the formation of new oceanic crust. This process is driven by plate tectonics, which is the movement of the Earth's lithosphere (the uppermost layer of the Earth's mantle and crust) over the asthenosphere (the semi-fluid layer of the Earth's mantle). The opening of ocean basins is a key component of the Wilson Cycle, as it allows for the formation of new crust at mid-ocean ridges.

The formation of the Atlantic Ocean is a prime example of the opening of an ocean basin. The North American–South American–African triple junction, located near the Fifteen-Twenty Fracture Zone (FTFZ), is associated with the initial opening of the Atlantic Ocean. This triple junction has had a complex tectonic history, migrating from near 10°N to its current location near the FTFZ between 72.5 and 35.5 Ma. This migration is believed to have been driven by the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, which was facilitated by the Wilson Cycle.

The FTFZ itself is a region of intense geological activity. It is characterized by the presence of megamullions, which are corrugated surfaces measuring 25 km along-axis and 10–15 km across. These structures are found on both sides of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) away from any non-transform discontinuities, indicating a reduction in magma supply near the FTFZ. This is paradoxical, as geochemical analyses of basalts near the FTFZ suggest an enriched mantle source and the presence of a mantle hotspot.

To explain these contradictions, two models have been proposed. The first model suggests a westward ridge jump, which would relocate an older megamullion on the original western flank to the opposite flank. This would be followed by the formation of a new megamullion on the new western flank. The second model proposes an eastward ridge jump or migration, which would turn a west-dipping detachment fault into an east-dipping fault. This would result in an older abandoned and a younger active megamullion. Which of these models is correct is currently not known.

Superimposed on the larger corrugated surfaces are two systems of smaller scale corrugations: one on a 1–3 km-scale, roughly 200 m high, and another finer about 100–500 m wide. These smaller corrugations are covered by elevated ridges running parallel to the spreading direction, about 10 m wide, hundreds of metres long, and 10 m tall. These in turn are covered with cm-scale striations running in the same direction. These smaller scale features add further complexity to the geological processes occurring at the FTFZ and the formation of the Atlantic Ocean.

In conclusion, the formation of the Atlantic Ocean is a complex process that has been shaped by a variety of geological events, including the Wilson Cycle and the opening of ocean basins. The FTFZ, with its megamullions and smaller scale corrugations, is a key region in this process, and further research is needed to fully understand the geological processes occurring in this region.

### Subsection: 3.2b Role of Rifting in Ocean Formation

The role of rifting in ocean formation is a crucial aspect of the Wilson Cycle. Rifting, or the process of splitting or breaking apart, plays a significant role in the formation of new ocean basins. This process is driven by the movement of the Earth's lithosphere over the asthenosphere, as mentioned earlier. 

Rifting can occur in various ways, depending on the specific geological conditions. In the case of the Atlantic Ocean, the opening of the ocean basin was facilitated by the triple junction of the North American–South American–African plates. This triple junction, located near the Fifteen-Twenty Fracture Zone (FTFZ), is associated with the initial opening of the Atlantic Ocean. 

The FTFZ itself is a region of intense geological activity, characterized by the presence of megamullions. These corrugated surfaces, measuring 25 km along-axis and 10–15 km across, are found on both sides of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) away from any non-transform discontinuities. This indicates a reduction in magma supply near the FTFZ, which is paradoxical given the enriched mantle source and mantle hotspot suggested by geochemical analyses of basalts near the FTFZ.

To explain these contradictions, two models have been proposed. The first model suggests a westward ridge jump, which would relocate an older megamullion on the original western flank to the opposite flank. This would be followed by the formation of a new megamullion on the new western flank. The second model proposes an eastward ridge jump or migration, which would turn a west-dipping detachment fault into an east-dipping fault. This would result in an older abandoned and a younger active megamullion. 

These models highlight the complex nature of rifting and its role in ocean formation. The FTFZ, with its megamullions and other geological features, provides a unique opportunity to study these processes in action. Further research in this region will undoubtedly shed more light on the role of rifting in ocean formation.

### Subsection: 3.2c Case Studies of Ocean Formation

The formation of the Atlantic Ocean provides a compelling case study of the role of rifting in ocean formation. The opening of the Atlantic Ocean was facilitated by the triple junction of the North American–South American–African plates, located near the Fifteen-Twenty Fracture Zone (FTFZ). This triple junction is associated with the initial opening of the Atlantic Ocean, which began about 180 million years ago.

The FTFZ itself is a region of intense geological activity, characterized by the presence of megamullions. These corrugated surfaces, measuring 25 km along-axis and 10–15 km across, are found on both sides of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) away from any non-transform discontinuities. This indicates a reduction in magma supply near the FTFZ, which is paradoxical given the enriched mantle source and mantle hotspot suggested by geochemical analyses of basalts near the FTFZ.

To explain these contradictions, two models have been proposed. The first model suggests a westward ridge jump, which would relocate an older megamullion on the original western flank to the opposite flank. This would be followed by the formation of a new megamullion on the new western flank. The second model proposes an eastward ridge jump or migration, which would turn a west-dipping detachment fault into an east-dipping fault. This would result in an older abandoned and a younger active megamullion.

These models highlight the complex nature of rifting and its role in ocean formation. The FTFZ, with its megamullions and other geological features, provides a unique opportunity to study these processes in action. Further research in this region will undoubtedly shed more light on the role of rifting in ocean formation.

In addition to the Atlantic Ocean, other examples of ocean formation through rifting can be found in the Pacific Ocean, where the Pacific Plate is moving northwestward relative to the North American Plate. This movement is causing the formation of the Juan de Fuca Plate and the Explorer Plate, which are both spreading ridges. The Pacific Plate is also moving relative to the Philippine Plate, causing the formation of the Philippine Plate. These examples further illustrate the role of rifting in ocean formation.




### Subsection: 3.2b Major Ocean Basins in Africa

The African continent is home to several major ocean basins, each with its own unique geological characteristics. These basins have been shaped by the Wilson Cycle and the opening of ocean basins, and they continue to evolve as a result of ongoing geological processes.

#### The Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR)

The Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) is a mid-ocean ridge located in the Indian Ocean. It is one of the youngest and most active mid-ocean ridges in the world, with a mean axial depth that varies between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. The SWIR is characterized by a series of transform faults, which are associated with the opening of the Indian Ocean.

The SWIR is segmented into several major transform faults, including the Marion hotspot, the Prince Edward FZ, the Atlantis II FZ, the Discovery FZ, the Gallieni FZ, and the Melville FZ. These faults are associated with magnetic anomalies that indicate the direction of spreading for the past 80 million years. The SWIR is also characterized by a high magma supply and thicker crust, which is likely due to the interaction with the Crozet hotspot.

#### The Agulhas Bank

The Agulhas Bank is a large submarine bank located off the eastern coast of South Africa. It is part of the Agulhas Plateau, which is a region of intense geological activity. The Agulhas Bank is characterized by a series of faults and fractures, which are associated with the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean.

The Agulhas Bank is believed to have played a crucial role in the formation of the South Atlantic Ocean. It is associated with the Agulhas Fracture Zone, which is a region of intense spreading that is responsible for the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean. The Agulhas Bank is also believed to be the site of a large hotspot, which is responsible for the formation of the Agulhas Plateau.

#### The South Atlantic Anomaly

The South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) is a region of intense geological activity located in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by a series of faults and fractures, which are associated with the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean. The SAA is also believed to be the site of a large hotspot, which is responsible for the formation of the South Atlantic Plateau.

The SAA is associated with the South Atlantic Fracture Zone, which is a region of intense spreading that is responsible for the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean. It is also believed to be the site of a large hotspot, which is responsible for the formation of the South Atlantic Plateau. The SAA is also characterized by a high magma supply and thicker crust, which is likely due to the interaction with the South Atlantic hotspot.

### Conclusion

The African continent is home to several major ocean basins, each with its own unique geological characteristics. These basins have been shaped by the Wilson Cycle and the opening of ocean basins, and they continue to evolve as a result of ongoing geological processes. The Southwest Indian Ridge, the Agulhas Bank, and the South Atlantic Anomaly are just a few examples of these major ocean basins, each with its own complex geological history.




### Subsection: 3.2c Geological Significance

The geological significance of the Wilson Cycle and the opening of ocean basins cannot be overstated. These processes have shaped the Earth's surface and continue to do so, creating new landforms and altering existing ones. The Wilson Cycle, in particular, has played a crucial role in the evolution of the African continent.

#### The Wilson Cycle and the African Continent

The Wilson Cycle has been instrumental in the formation of the African continent. The cycle's process of seafloor spreading and plate separation has led to the creation of new landforms, such as the Southwest Indian Ridge and the Agulhas Bank. These features have not only altered the physical appearance of the African continent but have also influenced its geological history.

The Southwest Indian Ridge, for instance, is a young and active mid-ocean ridge that has been shaped by the Wilson Cycle. Its segmentation into several major transform faults, each associated with a hotspot, has led to the formation of new ocean basins. This process has been ongoing for the past 80 million years, with the SWIR being one of the youngest and most active mid-ocean ridges in the world.

Similarly, the Agulhas Bank, part of the Agulhas Plateau, has been shaped by the Wilson Cycle. The intense geological activity in this region, characterized by a series of faults and fractures, is a direct result of the cycle's process of seafloor spreading and plate separation. The Agulhas Bank is believed to have played a crucial role in the formation of the South Atlantic Ocean, and its association with the Agulhas Fracture Zone, a region of intense spreading, further underscores its geological significance.

#### The Geological Significance of the South Atlantic Anomaly

The South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) is another feature of geological significance. This region, characterized by a series of faults and fractures, is believed to be the site of a large hotspot. The SAA's association with the Agulhas Fracture Zone, a region of intense spreading, suggests that it may have played a role in the formation of the South Atlantic Ocean.

The SAA's geological significance is further underscored by its association with the Agulhas Bank. The Agulhas Bank, part of the Agulhas Plateau, is a region of intense geological activity. Its association with the SAA suggests that the two features may be interconnected, with the SAA influencing the geological activity in the Agulhas Bank.

In conclusion, the Wilson Cycle and the opening of ocean basins have played a crucial role in shaping the African continent. The Southwest Indian Ridge, the Agulhas Bank, and the South Atlantic Anomaly are just some of the features that have been shaped by these processes. Their geological significance cannot be overstated, and their study continues to provide valuable insights into the Earth's geological history.

### Subsection: 3.3a Introduction to Sedimentary Deposition

Sedimentary deposition is a fundamental process in the Wilson Cycle, playing a crucial role in the formation of new landforms and the evolution of the African continent. This process involves the accumulation of sediments, such as sand, silt, and clay, on the seafloor. These sediments are primarily derived from the weathering of rocks on land, which are transported by rivers and wind to the coast and then deposited on the seafloor.

#### The Role of Sedimentary Deposition in the Wilson Cycle

Sedimentary deposition is a key component of the Wilson Cycle, particularly in the context of the opening of ocean basins. The process of seafloor spreading, which is central to the Wilson Cycle, is facilitated by the accumulation of sediments on the seafloor. These sediments act as a lubricant, allowing the seafloor to move apart and create new ocean basins.

The sediments deposited during the Wilson Cycle also provide valuable insights into the Earth's history. For instance, the sediments of the Huab Formation in Namibia, which were deposited during the early stages of the Wilson Cycle, have been studied in detail by Wanke (2000). These sediments provide a record of the depositional environments that existed during the early stages of the Wilson Cycle, including glacial, fluvial, and estuarine environments.

#### The Huab Formation and Sedimentary Deposition

The Huab Formation is a prime example of the sedimentary deposition that occurs during the Wilson Cycle. The formation is characterized by a variety of sedimentary structures, including stromatolite bioherms, flat-pebble conglomerates, and algal laminites. These structures provide a detailed record of the depositional environments that existed during the early stages of the Wilson Cycle.

Stromatolite bioherms, for instance, acted as a barrier towards the open sea in the west, and their preferred E-W orientation coincides with tidal- and wave induced currents perpendicular to the palaeo-coastline. Lagoonal environments were established landwards of the bioherm belts, in which laminated shales developed. The lamination is due to suspension fallout in slightly agitated water. Erosive based interbeds of coarse to gritty sandstones formed during storm events and are therefore interpreted as tempestites. West of the bioherm belts, the fair weather wave basis reached the ground, expressed in oscillation-rippled surfaces.

Channels between bioherm ridges have been interpreted as tidal channels. They host flat-pebble conglomerates, which are characterized by a high ooid content. These ooid bearing flat-pebble conglomerates support the facies concept of shallow, wave dominated water in the vicinity of the bioherms: Ooids form in very shallow, fairly agitated, carbonate saturated water probably under warm climate. The flat pebbles derived from desiccated layers of unlithified cohesive fine clastics that had been reworked, preferentially under the influence of storm waves. Tidal flats or lagoons provide the conditions for the generation of both, ooids and flat-pebble conglomerates.

In conclusion, sedimentary deposition plays a crucial role in the Wilson Cycle, facilitating the opening of ocean basins and providing valuable insights into the Earth's history. The Huab Formation serves as a prime example of the sedimentary structures that can be formed during this process.

### Subsection: 3.3b Sedimentary Deposition during the Wilson Cycle

The Wilson Cycle is a fundamental concept in the study of the Earth's geology, particularly in the context of the opening of ocean basins. During this cycle, sedimentary deposition plays a crucial role, not only in the formation of new landforms but also in the preservation of the Earth's history. 

#### Sedimentary Deposition and the Opening of Ocean Basins

The opening of ocean basins is a key process in the Wilson Cycle. This process is facilitated by the accumulation of sediments on the seafloor, which act as a lubricant, allowing the seafloor to move apart and create new ocean basins. The sediments deposited during the Wilson Cycle provide a record of the depositional environments that existed during the early stages of the cycle, offering valuable insights into the Earth's history.

#### Sedimentary Deposition in the Huab Formation

The Huab Formation in Namibia is a prime example of the sedimentary deposition that occurs during the Wilson Cycle. The formation is characterized by a variety of sedimentary structures, including stromatolite bioherms, flat-pebble conglomerates, and algal laminites. These structures provide a detailed record of the depositional environments that existed during the early stages of the Wilson Cycle.

Tidal flats or lagoons provide the conditions for the generation of both, ooids and flat-pebble conglomerates.

#### Sedimentary Deposition and the Geological Significance of the Wilson Cycle

The sedimentary deposition that occurs during the Wilson Cycle has significant implications for the Earth's geology. The sediments deposited during this cycle provide a record of the depositional environments that existed during the early stages of the cycle, offering valuable insights into the Earth's history. Furthermore, the process of sedimentary deposition facilitates the opening of ocean basins, a key process in the Wilson Cycle.

### Subsection: 3.3c Case Studies of Sedimentary Deposition

The study of sedimentary deposition during the Wilson Cycle is not limited to the Huab Formation in Namibia. There are several other case studies that provide valuable insights into the processes and environments involved in sedimentary deposition.

#### Sedimentary Deposition in the South African Karoo Basin

The South African Karoo Basin is another example of a sedimentary basin that formed during the Wilson Cycle. The basin is characterized by a variety of sedimentary structures, including fluvial, lacustrine, and aeolian deposits. The sediments deposited in the basin provide a record of the depositional environments that existed during the early stages of the Wilson Cycle.

The sedimentary deposition in the Karoo Basin is particularly interesting due to the presence of aeolian deposits. These deposits, which are primarily composed of sand dunes, provide insights into the wind patterns and climatic conditions that existed during the early stages of the Wilson Cycle. The presence of aeolian deposits in the basin suggests that the region was subjected to strong winds, which were likely associated with a warm and arid climate.

#### Sedimentary Deposition in the North Atlantic Ocean

The North Atlantic Ocean is another region where sedimentary deposition during the Wilson Cycle has been extensively studied. The sediments deposited in the ocean provide a record of the depositional environments that existed during the early stages of the cycle, offering valuable insights into the Earth's history.

The sedimentary deposition in the North Atlantic Ocean is particularly interesting due to the presence of ophiolite complexes. These complexes, which are composed of oceanic crust and mantle rocks, provide insights into the processes involved in the formation of new ocean basins. The presence of ophiolite complexes in the North Atlantic Ocean suggests that the region was subjected to intense volcanic activity, which was likely associated with the opening of the North Atlantic Ocean.

#### Sedimentary Deposition and the Geological Significance of the Wilson Cycle

The sedimentary deposition that occurs during the Wilson Cycle has significant implications for the Earth's geology. The sediments deposited during this cycle provide a record of the depositional environments that existed during the early stages of the cycle, offering valuable insights into the Earth's history. Furthermore, the process of sedimentary deposition facilitates the opening of ocean basins, a key process in the Wilson Cycle.

The study of sedimentary deposition during the Wilson Cycle is not limited to these case studies.

### Subsection: 3.3b Deposition during the Wilson Cycle

The deposition of sediments during the Wilson Cycle is a complex process that is influenced by a variety of factors. These include the rate of seafloor spreading, the composition of the sediments, and the depositional environment. 

#### The Rate of Seafloor Spreading

The rate of seafloor spreading plays a crucial role in the deposition of sediments during the Wilson Cycle. As the seafloor moves apart, sediments are deposited on the newly created seafloor. The rate at which this occurs can vary significantly, depending on the location and the geological conditions. For instance, the rate of seafloor spreading in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is significantly higher than in the Pacific Ocean. This difference in spreading rates can lead to variations in the thickness of sedimentary deposits across different regions.

#### The Composition of Sediments

The composition of sediments deposited during the Wilson Cycle can provide valuable insights into the Earth's history. For instance, the sediments of the Huab Formation in Namibia, which were deposited during the early stages of the Wilson Cycle, are primarily composed of quartz, feldspar, and mica. These minerals were derived from the weathering of the surrounding rocks, and their relative abundance can provide information about the depositional environment and the climate at the time of deposition.

#### The Depositional Environment

The depositional environment can also influence the type of sediments deposited during the Wilson Cycle. For instance, the sediments of the Huab Formation were deposited in a variety of environments, including glacial, fluvial, and estuarine environments. These different environments led to the deposition of different types of sediments, including glacial till, river sediments, and estuarine sediments.

#### The Selli Event and Sedimentary Deposition

The Selli Event, a major marine anoxic event that occurred approximately 120 million years ago, also had a significant impact on sedimentary deposition during the Wilson Cycle. The event was characterized by an increase in marine productivity, likely driven by an increase in iron availability. This increase in productivity led to an increase in hydrogen sulphide production, which in turn increased phosphorus availability in the water column. The event also caused a drop in the pH of seawater, as much of the excess carbon dioxide was absorbed by the ocean and dissolved as carbonic acid. This ocean acidification lasted for approximately 0.85 Myr and was accompanied by a decrease in the carbonate-saturation of seawater.

The Selli Event also led to a spike in silicate weathering, as evidenced by a negative lithium isotope excursion. This weathering may have helped to cool the Earth back to its pre-OAE1a state. The event also led to the widespread deposition of black shales rich in organic matter, which were incapable of being decomposed on the seabed due to the anoxic conditions.

In conclusion, the deposition of sediments during the Wilson Cycle is a complex process that is influenced by a variety of factors. These include the rate of seafloor spreading, the composition of the sediments, and the depositional environment. The Selli Event, a major marine anoxic event that occurred approximately 120 million years ago, also had a significant impact on sedimentary deposition during the Wilson Cycle.

### Subsection: 3.3c Impact on African Geology

The Wilson Cycle, a geological process that began approximately 3 billion years ago, has had a profound impact on the geology of Africa. This section will explore the various ways in which the Wilson Cycle has shaped the geological landscape of Africa, including the formation of the African Rift Valley and the deposition of sediments in the Sahara Desert.

#### The African Rift Valley

The African Rift Valley, a series of rifts and faults that run along the eastern edge of Africa, is a direct result of the Wilson Cycle. As the African and Arabian plates began to separate, the lithosphere of the African plate was pulled apart, creating a series of rifts and faults. These rifts and faults have been deepening over time, forming the African Rift Valley. The formation of the African Rift Valley has had a significant impact on the geology of Africa, leading to the creation of new landforms and the exposure of previously hidden rocks.

#### Sedimentary Deposition in the Sahara Desert

The Sahara Desert, one of the largest deserts in the world, has been shaped by the Wilson Cycle. During the early stages of the Wilson Cycle, the Sahara was a lush and fertile region, with rivers flowing across its surface. However, as the Wilson Cycle progressed, the climate of Africa began to change, leading to the gradual desertification of the Sahara. This desertification was accompanied by a significant increase in sedimentary deposition in the Sahara. As the climate became drier, more sediments were deposited in the region, leading to the formation of sand dunes and other desert features.

#### The Role of the Selli Event

The Selli Event, a major marine anoxic event that occurred approximately 120 million years ago, also had a significant impact on the geology of Africa. The Selli Event led to a spike in marine productivity, as seen by an increase in the amount of organic matter preserved in sedimentary rocks. This increase in productivity was likely driven by an increase in iron availability, which was caused by an increase in sulphate flux from volcanism. The Selli Event also led to an increase in hydrogen sulphide production, which further increased iron availability. The Selli Event had a profound impact on the geology of Africa, leading to changes in the composition of sediments and the formation of new landforms.

In conclusion, the Wilson Cycle has had a profound impact on the geology of Africa, leading to the formation of the African Rift Valley, the desertification of the Sahara, and the Selli Event. These events have shaped the geological landscape of Africa, providing valuable insights into the Earth's history.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the fascinating world of the Wilson Cycle, a fundamental concept in the study of the geology of Africa. We have explored how the Wilson Cycle, named after the American geologist Harry Hess, is a theory that explains the formation of the Earth's oceans and continents. This theory is based on the concept of plate tectonics, which posits that the Earth's lithosphere is divided into several large and small plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere.

We have also examined how the Wilson Cycle is divided into three main phases: the opening of the ocean, the drifting of the continents, and the closing of the ocean. Each of these phases has its own unique characteristics and implications for the geology of Africa. For instance, the opening of the ocean phase is marked by the separation of the continents, leading to the formation of new oceanic crust. This phase has been particularly significant in the geological history of Africa, as it has led to the formation of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

Furthermore, we have discussed how the Wilson Cycle has been instrumental in shaping the geological landscape of Africa. The drifting of the continents, for example, has led to the formation of the Great Rift Valley, a unique geological feature that stretches across East Africa. Similarly, the closing of the ocean phase has resulted in the collision of the African and Arabian plates, leading to the formation of the mountain ranges in the Horn of Africa.

In conclusion, the Wilson Cycle is a crucial concept in the study of the geology of Africa. It provides a framework for understanding the complex processes that have shaped the Earth's oceans and continents, and has been instrumental in shaping the geological landscape of Africa.

#### Exercise 4
Explain how the collision of the African and Arabian plates during the closing of the ocean phase of the Wilson Cycle has led to the formation of mountain ranges in the Horn of Africa.

#### Exercise 5
Discuss the implications of the Wilson Cycle for the future geology of Africa. How might the Wilson Cycle continue to shape the Earth's oceans and continents in the future?

## Chapter: The Geology of Africa: From the Ancient Past to the Present

### Introduction

In this chapter, we delve into the fascinating world of the geology of Africa, exploring the ancient past and the present. The African continent, with its diverse landscapes and geological formations, has been a subject of intense study for geologists and scientists for centuries. The continent's geological history is as rich and complex as its cultural diversity. 

Africa's geological history is marked by a series of significant events that have shaped the continent's landscape and the life within it. These events include the formation of the Sahara Desert, the rise and fall of the Ethiopian Rift Valley, and the formation of the Kalahari Basin. Each of these events has had a profound impact on the continent's geology and the life that inhabits it.

In this chapter, we will explore these events in detail, examining the geological processes that led to their formation and the implications they have had for the continent's geology. We will also look at the role of plate tectonics in shaping Africa's geology, and how the continent's geological history is intertwined with the history of the Earth's continents.

We will also delve into the present geology of Africa, examining the ongoing geological processes that are shaping the continent's landscape. This includes the formation of new mountains, the movement of tectonic plates, and the ongoing changes in the Earth's climate and sea levels.

Through this exploration, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the geology of Africa, from the ancient past to the present. This chapter will serve as a foundation for the subsequent chapters, which will delve deeper into the specific geological formations and processes that make Africa such a fascinating and diverse continent.




### Subsection: 3.4a Overview of Plate Tectonics

Plate tectonics is a fundamental concept in geology that explains the movement and evolution of the Earth's lithosphere. It is a theory that describes the large-scale motion of the Earth's lithosphere, which is the thin, rigid outer shell of the Earth that includes the crust and the uppermost mantle. The lithosphere is broken into several large and small pieces, known as tectonic plates, which float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere, a layer of the mantle that lies beneath the lithosphere.

The movement of these tectonic plates is driven by convection currents in the mantle, which are caused by the heat generated by the Earth's core. As the plates move, they can collide, separate, or slide past each other, leading to various geological phenomena such as mountain building, volcanic activity, and the formation of oceanic trenches.

#### The African Plate

The African Plate is one of the largest and most stable tectonic plates in the world. It is bounded by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to the west, the Great Rift Valley to the east, and the Red Sea Rift to the northeast. The African Plate is also home to the oldest known rocks on Earth, the Acasta Gneisses, which are estimated to be 4.03 billion years old.

The African Plate has been relatively stable throughout the Phanerozoic Eon, with only minor changes in its boundaries. However, the plate has experienced significant changes in the past, including the formation of the African Rift Valley and the separation of the Arabian Plate.

#### Plate Tectonics and the Wilson Cycle

The Wilson Cycle, a geological process that began approximately 3 billion years ago, is closely linked to plate tectonics. The cycle is characterized by the formation of an ocean basin, its subsequent filling with sediments, and the eventual collision of the continents that formed the basin. This process is driven by the movement of tectonic plates, which can create new ocean basins and close existing ones.

The African Plate has played a significant role in the Wilson Cycle. The separation of the African and Arabian plates led to the formation of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, two of the youngest ocean basins in the world. This process is ongoing, with the African Plate continuing to move westward from the Arabian Plate.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the role of plate tectonics in the geology of Africa, focusing on the formation of the African Rift Valley and the impact of the Selli Event on the continent's geological history.

### Subsection: 3.4b Role of Plate Tectonics in Africa

Plate tectonics plays a crucial role in the geology of Africa. The African Plate, being one of the largest and most stable tectonic plates, has been instrumental in shaping the continent's geological landscape. The plate's movement and interactions with other plates have led to the formation of various geological features, including the African Rift Valley, the Sahara Desert, and the Atlas Mountains.

#### The African Rift Valley

The African Rift Valley, a series of rifts and faults that run along the eastern edge of Africa, is a direct result of plate tectonics. The valley is a product of the separation of the African and Arabian plates, which began about 30 million years ago. As the Arabian Plate moved northward, it pulled away from the African Plate, creating a rift that eventually led to the formation of the Great Rift Valley.

The Great Rift Valley is a linear depression that stretches from the Red Sea in the north to the Zambezi River in the south. It is characterized by a series of rifts, faults, and volcanic features. The valley is home to some of the most active volcanoes in the world, including Mount Kilimanjaro and the Erta Ale volcano.

#### The Sahara Desert

The Sahara Desert, the largest hot desert in the world, is another geological feature shaped by plate tectonics. The desert is located in the northern part of Africa and is primarily a result of the African Plate's movement. As the African Plate moved northward, it caused a shift in the Earth's rotation axis, which led to a decrease in precipitation in the region. This decrease in precipitation, combined with the region's proximity to the equator, resulted in the formation of the Sahara Desert.

#### The Atlas Mountains

The Atlas Mountains, a mountain range that stretches across northwest Africa, are another example of how plate tectonics can shape the Earth's surface. The mountains are a result of the collision between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate, which began about 250 million years ago. As the African Plate moved northward, it collided with the Eurasian Plate, causing the formation of the Atlas Mountains.

In conclusion, plate tectonics plays a crucial role in the geology of Africa. The movement and interactions of tectonic plates have led to the formation of various geological features, including the African Rift Valley, the Sahara Desert, and the Atlas Mountains. Understanding plate tectonics is essential for understanding the geological history and evolution of Africa.

### Subsection: 3.4c Case Studies of Plate Tectonics in Africa

The African continent has been a hotspot for plate tectonic activity, with numerous examples of plate interactions shaping the continent's geological landscape. In this section, we will explore some case studies that highlight the role of plate tectonics in Africa.

#### The Great Rift Valley

The Great Rift Valley, as discussed in the previous section, is a direct result of plate tectonics. The separation of the African and Arabian plates has led to the formation of this linear depression, characterized by a series of rifts, faults, and volcanic features. The Great Rift Valley is home to some of the most active volcanoes in the world, including Mount Kilimanjaro and the Erta Ale volcano.

The Great Rift Valley is also a site of ongoing research for geologists. The valley's volcanic activity provides valuable insights into the processes of plate tectonics and the Earth's mantle. For instance, the study of the volcanic rocks in the valley has revealed the presence of mantle plumes, which are columns of hot material rising from the Earth's core-mantle boundary.

#### The Atlas Mountains

The Atlas Mountains, a mountain range that stretches across northwest Africa, are another example of how plate tectonics can shape the Earth's surface. The mountains are a result of the collision between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate, which began about 250 million years ago. As the African Plate moved northward, it collided with the Eurasian Plate, causing the formation of the Atlas Mountains.

The Atlas Mountains are also a site of ongoing research for geologists. The study of the mountains' geology has provided valuable insights into the processes of mountain building and the Earth's crust. For instance, the study of the Atlas Mountains has revealed the presence of ophiolites, which are fragments of the Earth's oceanic crust that have been uplifted onto the continental crust.

#### The Sahara Desert

The Sahara Desert, the largest hot desert in the world, is another geological feature shaped by plate tectonics. The desert is located in the northern part of Africa and is primarily a result of the African Plate's movement. As the African Plate moved northward, it caused a shift in the Earth's rotation axis, which led to a decrease in precipitation in the region. This decrease in precipitation, combined with the region's proximity to the equator, resulted in the formation of the Sahara Desert.

The Sahara Desert is also a site of ongoing research for geologists. The study of the desert's geology has provided valuable insights into the processes of desertification and the Earth's climate. For instance, the study of the Sahara Desert has revealed the presence of paleolakes, which are remnants of ancient lakes that once existed in the desert.

In conclusion, these case studies highlight the significant role of plate tectonics in shaping the geological landscape of Africa. The study of these geological features provides valuable insights into the processes of plate tectonics and the Earth's mantle, crust, and climate.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the fascinating world of the Wilson Cycle, a fundamental concept in the study of the geology of Africa. We have explored how the Wilson Cycle, named after the American geologist Harry Hess, explains the formation of the continents and oceans. The cycle is based on the concept of plate tectonics, which posits that the Earth's lithosphere is divided into several large and small plates that float on the asthenosphere, a semi-fluid layer of the mantle.

We have also examined how the Wilson Cycle is responsible for the opening and closing of oceans. According to this cycle, an ocean basin opens when a rift forms between two continental plates, allowing seawater to enter. Conversely, an ocean basin closes when two plates move together, forming a mountain range. This process is ongoing, and it is responsible for the formation of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Andes Mountains, among other geological features.

Furthermore, we have discussed the implications of the Wilson Cycle for the geology of Africa. The African continent, being one of the oldest and most stable landmasses on Earth, has been shaped by the Wilson Cycle in unique ways. The cycle has been instrumental in the formation of the Great Rift Valley, the Atlas Mountains, and other geological features in Africa.

In conclusion, the Wilson Cycle is a crucial concept in the study of the geology of Africa. It provides a framework for understanding the formation of the continents and oceans, and it has significant implications for the geological landscape of Africa.

### Subsection: 3.5a Overview of the Wilson Cycle

The Wilson Cycle, named after the American geologist Harry Hess, is a theory that explains the formation and evolution of the Earth's oceans. It is a part of the larger theory of plate tectonics, which describes the movement and evolution of the Earth's lithosphere. The Wilson Cycle is a fundamental concept in geology, providing a framework for understanding the geological processes that shape our planet.

#### The Stages of the Wilson Cycle

The Wilson Cycle is divided into three main stages: seafloor spreading, subduction, and collision. These stages are not discrete, but rather occur simultaneously and in a cyclical manner. 

##### Seafloor Spreading

Seafloor spreading is the first stage of the Wilson Cycle. It is the process by which new oceanic crust is formed at mid-ocean ridges, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This process is driven by the movement of the Earth's plates, which are pulled apart at these ridges. As the plates move apart, molten rock, or magma, rises to fill the gap, cooling and solidifying to form new crust. This process creates a ridge of new seafloor on one side of the mid-ocean ridge, and a valley of old seafloor on the other.

##### Subduction

The second stage of the Wilson Cycle is subduction. Subduction is the process by which one plate is forced beneath another plate at a convergent plate boundary. This process is responsible for the formation of deep ocean trenches, volcanic arcs, and mountain ranges. As the plate is forced beneath the overriding plate, it is heated and partially melted, forming a dense, buoyant fluid that rises towards the surface. This process can lead to the formation of volcanic arcs, such as the Aleutian Islands, or to the collision of plates, leading to the formation of mountain ranges, such as the Himalayas.

##### Collision

The final stage of the Wilson Cycle is collision. Collision occurs when two plates move towards each other and collide at a convergent plate boundary. This process can lead to the formation of mountain ranges, such as the Himalayas, as the denser plate is forced beneath the lighter plate. Alternatively, if the plates are of similar density, they can collide and form a suture, a zone of crustal thickening and deformation.

#### The Geological Significance of the Wilson Cycle

The Wilson Cycle has significant implications for the geology of Africa. The African Plate, being one of the largest and most stable tectonic plates, has been a witness to the various stages of the Wilson Cycle. The African Rift Valley, a geological feature that is a direct result of the Wilson Cycle, is a prime example of the seafloor spreading stage. The interaction between the African Plate and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a divergent plate boundary that runs along the eastern edge of the plate, has also been a part of the Wilson Cycle. These interactions have led to the formation of new ocean basins and the evolution of the Earth's oceans.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the geological significance of the Wilson Cycle, exploring how it has shaped the geology of Africa and the rest of the world.

### Subsection: 3.5b Role of the Wilson Cycle in Geology

The Wilson Cycle plays a crucial role in the geology of Africa. The African continent, being one of the oldest and most stable landmasses on Earth, has been a witness to the various stages of the Wilson Cycle. The geological processes that occur during the Wilson Cycle have shaped the African continent and its surrounding oceans.

#### The Wilson Cycle and the African Rift Valley

The African Rift Valley is a prime example of the seafloor spreading stage of the Wilson Cycle. This geological feature is a divergent plate boundary where the African Plate is pulling apart, creating a rift that is slowly filling with sediments. This process is a part of the Wilson Cycle, as it leads to the formation of new ocean basins. The African Rift Valley is a direct result of the Wilson Cycle, providing valuable insights into the geological processes that shape our planet.

#### The Wilson Cycle and Plate Tectonics

The Wilson Cycle is a part of the larger theory of plate tectonics, which describes the movement and evolution of the Earth's lithosphere. The African Plate's interaction with other tectonic plates, such as the Arabian Plate and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has been influenced by the Wilson Cycle. These interactions have led to the formation of new ocean basins and the evolution of the Earth's oceans.

#### The Wilson Cycle and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge

The African Plate's interaction with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a divergent plate boundary that runs along the eastern edge of the plate, has also been a part of the Wilson Cycle. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a site of intense volcanic activity, and its interaction with the African Plate has led to the formation of new ocean basins. This process is ongoing and is expected to continue for millions of years, providing a continuous record of the Wilson Cycle in action.

#### The Wilson Cycle and the Geological Evolution of Africa

The Wilson Cycle has played a significant role in the geological evolution of Africa. The African continent has been shaped by the Wilson Cycle, with the formation of the African Rift Valley and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge being key examples. The Wilson Cycle has also influenced the geological history of Africa, with the formation of new ocean basins and the movement of tectonic plates shaping the continent's geology.

In conclusion, the Wilson Cycle plays a crucial role in the geology of Africa. Its influence can be seen in the formation of the African Rift Valley, the interaction with other tectonic plates, and the ongoing geological evolution of the continent. Understanding the Wilson Cycle is essential for understanding the geology of Africa and the rest of the world.

### Subsection: 3.5c Case Studies of the Wilson Cycle

The Wilson Cycle is a fundamental concept in geology, providing a framework for understanding the formation and evolution of the Earth's oceans. In this section, we will explore some case studies that illustrate the Wilson Cycle in action.

#### The Mid-Atlantic Ridge

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a divergent plate boundary that runs along the eastern edge of the African Plate. This ridge is a site of intense volcanic activity, with new oceanic crust being formed as the African and Eurasian Plates move apart. This process is a clear example of the seafloor spreading stage of the Wilson Cycle. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is also a site of hydrothermal vents, which are hot springs on the seafloor that support unique ecosystems. These vents are a result of the heat and chemical reactions associated with the Wilson Cycle.

#### The African Rift Valley

The African Rift Valley is a divergent plate boundary where the African Plate is pulling apart, creating a rift that is slowly filling with sediments. This process is a part of the Wilson Cycle, as it leads to the formation of new ocean basins. The African Rift Valley is a prime example of the seafloor spreading stage of the Wilson Cycle. The formation of the African Rift Valley has also led to the formation of the Great Rift Valley, a geological feature that is home to some of the oldest human fossils.

#### The Red Sea Rift

The Red Sea Rift is another example of the Wilson Cycle in action. This rift is a divergent plate boundary where the African and Arabian Plates are moving apart. The Red Sea Rift is a site of intense volcanic activity, with new oceanic crust being formed as the plates move apart. This process is a clear example of the seafloor spreading stage of the Wilson Cycle. The Red Sea Rift is also a site of hydrothermal vents, similar to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

#### The Himalayas

The Himalayas are a result of the collision stage of the Wilson Cycle. The Indian Plate, which was once part of the African Plate, collided with the Eurasian Plate about 50 million years ago. This collision led to the formation of the Himalayas, one of the youngest mountain ranges on Earth. The Himalayas are a site of intense geological activity, with ongoing uplift and erosion. This process is a clear example of the collision stage of the Wilson Cycle.

These case studies illustrate the diverse ways in which the Wilson Cycle shapes the Earth's geology. From the formation of new ocean basins to the uplift of mountains, the Wilson Cycle is a fundamental process that has shaped the Earth's surface over millions of years.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the fascinating world of the Wilson Cycle, a fundamental concept in the study of geology. We have explored how the Earth's oceans came into being, and how the continents have moved and changed over millions of years. The Wilson Cycle provides a framework for understanding the dynamic nature of our planet, and how it continues to evolve and transform.

We have seen how the Wilson Cycle is a continuous process, with the opening and closing of oceans, the formation of new landmasses, and the movement of continents. This process is driven by the movement of tectonic plates, which are the large, rigid sections of the Earth's crust that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere. The Wilson Cycle is a key component of plate tectonics, a theory that has revolutionized our understanding of the Earth's geology.

The Wilson Cycle is not just a theoretical concept, but has real-world implications. It helps us understand the distribution of natural resources, the formation of mountains and valleys, and the movement of animals and plants across the Earth's surface. It also provides a context for understanding the impact of human activities on the Earth's geology, and the potential consequences of climate change.

In conclusion, the Wilson Cycle is a complex and fascinating process that has shaped the Earth as we know it. It is a key part of the study of geology, and provides a foundation for understanding the dynamic nature of our planet.

### Subsection: 3.5b Impact on African Geology

The Wilson Cycle has had a profound impact on the geology of Africa. The continent's geological history is marked by a series of events that have shaped its landforms and resources. These events are largely a result of the Wilson Cycle and its associated processes.

#### The Role of the Wilson Cycle in African Geology

The Wilson Cycle has played a significant role in the geological evolution of Africa. The seafloor spreading stage of the cycle has been particularly influential. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a major site of seafloor spreading, runs along the eastern coast of Africa. As the Earth's plates have moved apart at this ridge, new oceanic crust has been formed, creating a ridge of new seafloor on one side and a valley of old seafloor on the other. This process has resulted in the formation of the African Plate, one of the world's largest and most stable plates.

The subduction stage of the Wilson Cycle has also had a significant impact on African geology. The process of subduction has been responsible for the formation of the Great Rift Valley, a series of rifts and faults that run across the continent. These rifts are the result of the African Plate being pulled apart at these points, a process that is still ongoing. The Great Rift Valley is a site of significant geological activity, with volcanic activity and seismic activity still occurring along its length.

#### The Wilson Cycle and African Mineral Resources

The Wilson Cycle has also played a crucial role in the formation of mineral resources in Africa. The seafloor spreading stage of the cycle has led to the formation of large deposits of manganese nodules in the Indian Ocean. These nodules, which are rich in manganese and other minerals, are a significant resource for the continent.

The subduction stage of the Wilson Cycle has also led to the formation of significant mineral deposits. The process of subduction has resulted in the formation of volcanic arcs, such as the Ethiopian Rift, which are rich in minerals such as gold, copper, and nickel. The collision stage of the Wilson Cycle has led to the formation of mountain ranges, such as the Atlas Mountains in Morocco, which are also rich in mineral deposits.

In conclusion, the Wilson Cycle has had a profound impact on the geology of Africa. Its processes have shaped the continent's landforms, resources, and mineral deposits. Understanding the Wilson Cycle is therefore crucial for understanding the geological history and future of Africa.

## Chapter 4: Geology of Africa




### Introduction

The study of geology is a vast and complex field, and within it, the study of rocks and minerals is a crucial aspect. In this chapter, we will delve into the world of undeformed and deformed alkaline rocks and carbonatites, exploring their unique characteristics, formation processes, and significance in the geological landscape of Africa.

Africa, with its diverse geological history and vast mineral resources, provides a rich ground for the study of these rocks. The continent's geological evolution has been shaped by a complex interplay of tectonic forces, climate changes, and biological processes, resulting in the formation of a variety of rock types. Among these, alkaline rocks and carbonatites hold a significant place, not only for their geological interest but also for their economic importance.

Alkaline rocks, characterized by their high alkalinity and low silica content, are found in various parts of Africa. They are often associated with volcanic activity and are known for their unique mineral assemblages. Carbonatites, on the other hand, are sedimentary rocks primarily composed of carbonate minerals. They are of particular interest due to their potential as a source of strategic minerals such as bauxite, phosphates, and uranium.

In this chapter, we will explore the formation and evolution of these rocks, their mineral compositions, and their role in the geological history of Africa. We will also discuss the ongoing research and advancements in the field, shedding light on the latest developments and future directions in the study of undeformed and deformed alkaline rocks and carbonatites.

As we journey through this chapter, we aim to provide a comprehensive guide to these fascinating rocks, offering insights into their geological significance and their role in shaping the African continent. Whether you are a seasoned geologist or a curious reader, we hope this chapter will enhance your understanding of the geological diversity and wealth of Africa.




### Subsection: 4.1a Overview of Alkaline Rocks and Carbonatites

Alkaline rocks and carbonatites are two distinct types of rocks that have played a significant role in the geological evolution of Africa. They are characterized by their unique mineral assemblages, formation processes, and economic importance. In this section, we will provide an overview of these rocks, their formation, and their significance in the geological history of Africa.

#### Alkaline Rocks

Alkaline rocks are a group of igneous rocks that are characterized by their high alkalinity and low silica content. They are often associated with volcanic activity and are known for their unique mineral assemblages. The alkaline magma series, which includes alkaline basalt, basanite, and nephelinite, is a chemically distinct range of magma compositions that describes the evolution of an alkaline mafic magma into a more evolved, silica-rich end member.

The geochemical characterization of alkaline rocks is distinct from other magma series. They have a high content of alkali metal oxides (K<sub>2</sub>O plus Na<sub>2</sub>O) relative to silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>). They also tend to show high titanium oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) content, typically in excess of 3% by weight. Other incompatible elements, such as phosphorus and light rare earth elements, are also elevated. This is attributed to a very low degree of partial melting of the source rock, with only 5% or less of the source rock going into the magma melt.

Petrographically, all alkaline series magmas are thought to have evolved from a primitive mafic alkaline magma, either an alkalic picrite basalt or an ankaramite. This evolves to an alkali olivine basalt or basanite. Thereafter, the series branches to the "sodic" series, the "potassic series", or the "nephelinic, leucitic, and analcitic series".

#### Carbonatites

Carbonatites are sedimentary rocks primarily composed of carbonate minerals. They are of particular interest due to their potential as a source of strategic minerals such as bauxite, phosphates, and uranium. The formation of carbonatites is closely linked to the evolution of the Earth's mantle and the movement of tectonic plates.

The geochemical characterization of carbonatites is distinct from other types of rocks. They are typically high in carbonate minerals, with a high pH and low alkalinity. This is due to the high concentration of carbonate ions in the magma, which can reach up to 40% by weight. The high pH of carbonatites also makes them resistant to weathering, leading to their preservation over long periods of time.

In the next sections, we will delve deeper into the formation and evolution of these rocks, their mineral compositions, and their role in the geological history of Africa. We will also discuss the ongoing research and advancements in the field, shedding light on the latest developments and future directions in the study of undeformed and deformed alkaline rocks and carbonatites.




### Subsection: 4.1b Formation and Characteristics

#### Formation of Alkaline Rocks and Carbonatites

The formation of alkaline rocks and carbonatites is closely tied to the geological processes that occur in the Earth's mantle and crust. Alkaline rocks, for instance, are often associated with mid-ocean ridges and ocean island basalts, which are thought to originate from the partial melting of the upper mantle. This partial melting is believed to be triggered by the presence of hotspots or plumes, which can cause the mantle to rise and cool, leading to the formation of alkaline rocks.

Carbonatites, on the other hand, are believed to form through the precipitation of carbonate minerals from hydrothermal fluids. These fluids are often associated with magmatic systems and can carry high concentrations of carbon dioxide and other gases. As these fluids interact with the surrounding rocks, they can precipitate carbonate minerals, leading to the formation of carbonatites.

#### Characteristics of Alkaline Rocks and Carbonatites

Alkaline rocks and carbonatites are characterized by their unique mineral assemblages and chemical compositions. Alkaline rocks, for instance, are known for their high alkalinity and low silica content, as well as their high titanium oxide content. These characteristics are believed to be a result of the low degree of partial melting that occurs during their formation.

Carbonatites, on the other hand, are characterized by their high carbonate content, often exceeding 90% by weight. They are also known for their high concentrations of rare earth elements, which can be attributed to their formation from hydrothermal fluids.

#### Economic Importance of Alkaline Rocks and Carbonatites

Both alkaline rocks and carbonatites have significant economic importance. Alkaline rocks, due to their high titanium oxide content, are often mined for their titanium dioxide, a key component in the production of paint and other industrial products. Carbonatites, on the other hand, are mined for their high concentrations of rare earth elements, which are used in a variety of high-tech applications.

In addition to their direct economic value, alkaline rocks and carbonatites also play a crucial role in understanding the geological history of Africa. Their unique mineral assemblages and chemical compositions provide valuable insights into the processes that have shaped the Earth's mantle and crust over millions of years.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the petrography and mineralogy of alkaline rocks and carbonatites, and explore their economic potential in more detail.




### Subsection: 4.2b Petrography and Mineralogy of Alkaline Rocks

#### Petrography of Alkaline Rocks

The petrography of alkaline rocks is characterized by the presence of various minerals, including olivine, augite, and plagioclase feldspar. These minerals are typically found in phenocrysts, which are large crystals that form before the melt solidifies. The presence and abundance of these phenocrysts can provide valuable insights into the conditions under which the rock formed.

For example, the presence of olivine phenocrysts suggests that the rock formed at a low pressure and temperature, while the presence of augite phenocrysts indicates a higher pressure and temperature. The presence of plagioclase feldspar, on the other hand, suggests that the rock formed at a higher pressure and temperature.

#### Mineralogy of Alkaline Rocks

The mineralogy of alkaline rocks is also characterized by the presence of various minerals, including olivine, augite, and plagioclase feldspar. These minerals are typically found in the groundmass, which is the fine-grained matrix that fills the spaces between the phenocrysts.

The mineral composition of the groundmass can provide valuable insights into the conditions under which the rock formed. For example, the presence of olivine in the groundmass suggests that the rock formed at a low pressure and temperature, while the presence of augite and plagioclase feldspar suggests a higher pressure and temperature.

#### Importance in the Study of Alkaline Rocks

The petrography and mineralogy of alkaline rocks are crucial in understanding the formation and evolution of these rocks. By studying the minerals present in these rocks, we can infer the conditions under which they formed, and use this information to understand the geological processes that shaped the Earth's crust.

It is our hope that this chapter will inspire readers to explore the fascinating world of igneous rocks and their role in shaping the Earth's crust.




### Subsection: 4.3a Overview of Magmatic Processes

Magmatic processes are fundamental to the formation of alkaline rocks. These processes involve the generation, evolution, and emplacement of magmas, which are molten rocks that form when the temperature and pressure conditions in the Earth's mantle or crust are sufficient to melt the rocks. The composition and behavior of magmas are influenced by a variety of factors, including the composition of the parent rock, the pressure and temperature conditions, and the presence of volatiles.

#### Generation of Magmas

Magmas are generated through partial melting of the Earth's mantle or crust. This partial melting occurs when the temperature and pressure conditions are sufficient to break the chemical bonds holding the minerals in the rock together. The composition of the magma generated depends on the composition of the parent rock and the conditions under which the melting occurs. For instance, the melting of a basaltic rock at high pressures and temperatures will result in a different composition of magma than the melting of the same rock at lower pressures and temperatures.

#### Evolution of Magmas

Once generated, magmas evolve as they move through the Earth's crust. This evolution is primarily driven by changes in pressure and temperature, which can cause the magma to crystallize or melt different minerals. The composition of the magma can also change due to the assimilation of surrounding rocks, which can introduce new minerals and elements into the magma.

#### Emplacement of Magmas

The final stage of the magmatic process is the emplacement of the magma. This can occur through various mechanisms, including eruption at the surface, intrusion into the crust, or solidification within the crust. The emplacement mechanism can have a significant impact on the final composition and structure of the resulting rock. For instance, an eruption at the surface will result in a volcanic rock, while an intrusion into the crust can result in a plutonic rock.

#### Volatiles and Magmatic Processes

Volatiles, such as water and carbon dioxide, play a crucial role in magmatic processes. These volatiles can significantly impact the behavior of magmas, including their viscosity, density, and crystallization behavior. The presence of volatiles can also lead to the formation of different types of magmas, such as rhyolite, andesite, and basalt.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the specific magmatic processes that occur in alkaline rocks, including the formation of carbonatites and the role of volatiles in these processes.

### Subsection: 4.3b Magmatic Processes in Alkaline Rocks

Alkaline rocks, characterized by their high silica and alkali content, are formed through unique magmatic processes. These processes are influenced by the high alkali and silica content of the magmas, which can significantly alter their behavior and the resulting rock types.

#### Generation of Alkaline Magmas

The generation of alkaline magmas is primarily driven by the melting of the Earth's upper mantle. This mantle is composed of peridotite, a rock rich in iron and magnesium. As the mantle rises towards the surface, it undergoes partial melting due to the decrease in pressure and temperature. The resulting magma is highly alkaline, with a high silica and alkali content.

#### Evolution of Alkaline Magmas

The evolution of alkaline magmas is characterized by the crystallization of olivine, a common mineral in peridotite. As the magma cools and evolves, olivine crystals can form a solid solution with the magma, altering its composition. This process can lead to the formation of different types of alkaline rocks, including nephelinite, phonolite, and trachyte.

#### Emplacement of Alkaline Magmas

The emplacement of alkaline magmas can occur through various mechanisms, including eruption at the surface, intrusion into the crust, or solidification within the crust. However, the high viscosity of alkaline magmas can make their emplacement more challenging compared to other types of magmas. This is due to the high silica and alkali content, which increases the magma's resistance to flow.

#### Volatiles and Alkaline Magmas

Volatiles, such as water and carbon dioxide, can significantly impact the behavior of alkaline magmas. These volatiles can lower the magma's viscosity, making it more fluid and easier to emplace. They can also alter the crystallization behavior of the magma, leading to the formation of different types of alkaline rocks.

In the next section, we will explore the specific types of alkaline rocks and their unique characteristics.

### Subsection: 4.3c Case Studies

In this section, we will delve into specific case studies that illustrate the magmatic processes in alkaline rocks. These case studies will provide a more detailed understanding of the generation, evolution, and emplacement of alkaline magmas.

#### Case Study 1: The Skaergaard Intrusion, Greenland

The Skaergaard intrusion in Greenland is a layered igneous complex that provides a unique insight into the processes of magma formation and evolution. The intrusion is composed of a series of layered rocks, each with a distinct mineral composition. The lower layers are composed of olivine basalt, while the upper layers are composed of plagioclase feldspar and quartz. This layering suggests a process of magma differentiation, where the magma evolved as it cooled and crystallized.

The Skaergaard intrusion also provides evidence of the role of volatiles in magmatic processes. The upper layers of the intrusion contain more volatiles, which are thought to have been introduced during the late stages of magma formation. These volatiles are believed to have lowered the magma's viscosity, allowing for the formation of the upper layers with their distinct mineral composition.

#### Case Study 2: The Altiplano-Puna Magma Body, South America

The Altiplano-Puna Magma Body (APMB) in South America is one of the largest magmatic bodies on Earth. It is composed of a series of alkaline rocks, including nephelinite, phonolite, and trachyte. The APMB is thought to have formed through the melting of the Earth's upper mantle, similar to the generation of alkaline magmas in general.

The APMB provides a unique opportunity to study the emplacement of alkaline magmas. The magmas are thought to have been emplaced through a process of dike intrusion, where the magmas moved along fractures in the crust. This process is believed to have been facilitated by the high viscosity of the alkaline magmas, which allowed them to move slowly and fill the fractures.

#### Case Study 3: The Bushveld Complex, South Africa

The Bushveld Complex in South Africa is one of the largest layered igneous complexes in the world. It is composed of a series of layers, each with a distinct mineral composition. The lower layers are composed of olivine basalt, similar to the lower layers of the Skaergaard intrusion. However, the Bushveld Complex also contains a layer of platinum-rich ore, which is thought to have formed through the crystallization of a platinum-rich mineral.

The Bushveld Complex provides evidence of the role of volatiles in magmatic processes. The upper layers of the complex contain more volatiles, which are thought to have been introduced during the late stages of magma formation. These volatiles are believed to have lowered the magma's viscosity, allowing for the formation of the upper layers with their distinct mineral composition.

These case studies illustrate the complex processes involved in the formation and evolution of alkaline magmas. They highlight the importance of studying these processes in understanding the geological history of the Earth.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the fascinating world of undeformed and deformed alkaline rocks and carbonatites. We have explored their unique characteristics, formation processes, and the role they play in the geological history of Africa. 

We have learned that alkaline rocks, due to their high alkali content, are often associated with volcanic activity. They are typically found in areas of recent volcanism and are often used as indicators of volcanic activity. Carbonatites, on the other hand, are formed when carbon dioxide is released from the mantle and reacts with calcium and magnesium in the crust. This process results in the formation of rocks rich in calcium and magnesium carbonates.

We have also examined the deformation processes that these rocks undergo. Deformation can occur due to various factors, including tectonic activity, temperature changes, and pressure changes. The deformation of these rocks can provide valuable insights into the geological history of a region.

### Subsection: 4.3b Magmatic Processes in Alkaline Rocks

Alkaline rocks, due to their high alkali content, are formed through unique magmatic processes. These processes are influenced by the composition of the parent rock, the pressure and temperature conditions, and the presence of volatiles. 

#### Generation of Alkaline Magmas

Alkaline magmas are generated through the partial melting of the Earth's mantle or crust. This partial melting occurs when the temperature and pressure conditions are sufficient to break the chemical bonds holding the minerals in the rock together. The composition of the magma generated depends on the composition of the parent rock and the conditions under which the melting occurs. For instance, the melting of a basaltic rock at high pressures and temperatures will result in a different composition of magma than the melting of the same rock at lower pressures and temperatures.

#### Evolution of Alkaline Magmas

Once generated, alkaline magmas evolve as they move through the Earth's crust. This evolution is primarily driven by changes in pressure and temperature, which can cause the magma to crystallize or melt different minerals. The composition of the magma can also change due to the assimilation of surrounding rocks, which can introduce new minerals and elements into the magma.

#### Emplacement of Alkaline Magmas

The final stage of the magmatic process is the emplacement of the magma. This can occur through various mechanisms, including eruption at the surface, intrusion into the crust, or solidification within the crust. The emplacement mechanism can have a significant impact on the final composition and structure of the resulting alkaline rock. For instance, an eruption at the surface will result in a volcanic rock, while an intrusion into the crust can result in a plutonic rock.

#### Alkaline Magma Series

The alkaline magma series is a chemically distinct range of magma compositions that describes the evolution of an alkaline mafic magma into a more evolved, silica-rich end member. This series is characterized by high content of alkali metal oxides (K<sub>2</sub>O plus Na<sub>2</sub>O) relative to silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>). They are distinct from the rare peralkaline magmas, which have excess alkali oxides relative to alumina (Na<sub>2</sub>O + K<sub>2</sub>O > Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).

#### Geochemical Characterization of Alkaline Magmas

Alkaline magmas tend to show high titanium oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) content, typically in excess of 3% by weight. Other incompatible elements, such as phosphorus and light rare earth elements, are also elevated. This is attributed to a very low degree of partial melting of the source rock, with only 5% or less of the source rock going into the magma melt.

#### Petrography of Alkaline Magmas

All alkaline series magmas are thought to have evolved from a primitive mafic alkaline magma, either an alkalic picrite basalt or an ankaramite. This evolves to an alkali olivine basalt or basanite. Thereafter the series branches to the "sodic" series, the "potassic series", or the "nephelinic, leucitic, and analcitic series".

The sodic series evolves through hawaiite or nepheline hawaiite through mugearite or nepheline mugearite and benmoreite or nepheline benmoreite to trachyte or phonolite. The potassic series evolves through trachybasalt or leucite trachybasalt through tristanite or leucite tristanite to potassic trachyte or leucite phonolite. The nephelinic, leucitic and analcitic series evolves from nephelinite or melilite through analcite to leucitite or wyomingite. The latter two may also be produced by evolution of leucite trachybasalt.

The less evolved alkali rocks tend to contain phenocrysts of olivine, and almost all have augite phenocrysts within them.

## Chapter 5: Deformation of Igneous Rocks

### Introduction

The study of geology in Africa is a vast and complex field, with a multitude of factors influencing the formation and evolution of the continent's rocks. One such factor is deformation, a process that shapes and reshapes the Earth's crust through various geological events. In this chapter, we will delve into the specific area of deformation of igneous rocks, a crucial aspect of understanding the geological history of Africa.

Igneous rocks, formed by the cooling and solidification of molten rock, are a significant component of the Earth's crust. They are found in various forms, from intrusive igneous rocks, which solidify beneath the surface, to extrusive igneous rocks, which solidify above the surface. The deformation of these rocks can provide valuable insights into the tectonic history of the region, as well as the forces that have shaped the Earth's crust over time.

The deformation of igneous rocks can occur through various mechanisms, including ductile and brittle deformation. Ductile deformation, characterized by the ability of a material to deform plastically without breaking, can occur in igneous rocks under high temperatures and pressures. Brittle deformation, on the other hand, occurs when a material breaks under stress, often due to rapid cooling or the presence of cracks or flaws.

Carbonatites are often found at the more evolved end of this series, indicating a high degree of partial melting of the source rock.

The formation of carbonatites is also closely tied to the presence of a low-density, high-temperature fluid phase. This fluid phase is thought to be responsible for the high titanium oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) content often observed in carbonatites, as well as the high concentrations of other incompatible elements such as phosphorus and light rare earth elements. The presence of this fluid phase is likely a result of the high temperatures and pressures associated with the tectonic processes that occur in these regions.

### Subsection: 4.5b Tectonic Significance of Alkaline Rocks in Africa

Alkaline rocks, particularly carbonatites, have played a significant role in the geological history of Africa. Their formation and evolution have been closely tied to the tectonic processes that have shaped the continent. In this section, we will delve deeper into the tectonic significance of alkaline rocks in Africa, focusing on the role of carbonatites.

#### 4.5b.1 Carbonatites and Tectonics

Carbonatites are a type of alkaline rock that is primarily composed of carbonate minerals. They are often associated with alkaline igneous complexes and have been found in several locations across Africa, including Kenya, Ethiopia, and Zimbabwe. The formation of carbonatites is closely linked to the tectonic processes that occur in these regions.

The tectonic significance of carbonatites can be understood in the context of the alkaline magma series. As discussed in the previous section, the alkaline magma series is a chemically distinct range of magma compositions that describes the evolution of an alkaline mafic magma into a more evolved, silica-rich end member. Carbonatites are often found at the more evolved end of this series, indicating a high degree of partial melting of the source rock.

The formation of carbonatites is also closely tied to the presence of a low-density, high-temperature fluid phase. This fluid phase is thought to be responsible for the high titanium oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) content often observed in carbonatites, as well as the high concentrations of other incompatible elements such as phosphorus and light rare earth elements. The presence of this fluid phase is likely a result of the high temperatures and pressures associated with the tectonic processes that occur in these regions.

#### 4.5b.2 Tectonic Implications of Alkaline Rocks

The presence of alkaline rocks, particularly carbonatites, in Africa has significant implications for our understanding of the continent's tectonic history. The formation of these rocks is closely tied to the tectonic processes that occur in these regions, providing valuable insights into the geological evolution of Africa.

One of the key tectonic implications of alkaline rocks is their role in the formation of the Great Rift Valley in East Africa. The Great Rift Valley is a series of rift valleys and grabens that stretch from the Red Sea in the north to Mozambique in the south. The formation of this valley is thought to be a result of the separation of the African and Arabian plates, which began approximately 30 million years ago. The presence of alkaline rocks, particularly carbonatites, in this region is thought to be a result of the high temperatures and pressures associated with this plate separation.

In addition to their role in the formation of the Great Rift Valley, alkaline rocks also provide valuable insights into the tectonic history of Africa. The presence of these rocks in different regions of Africa can be used to reconstruct the movement of plates and the formation of different geological structures. For example, the presence of alkaline rocks in the Okavango Dyke Swarm in Botswana can be used to understand the tectonic processes that occurred during the separation of the African and Antarctic plates.

In conclusion, the tectonic significance of alkaline rocks in Africa is vast and continues to be a topic of ongoing research. The presence of these rocks provides valuable insights into the geological evolution of the continent and the tectonic processes that have shaped it over millions of years. Further research and study of these rocks will continue to enhance our understanding of the tectonic history of Africa.

This climate has played a significant role in shaping the Sahara's geology, as it has led to the formation of unique geological features such as sand dunes and salt flats.

In addition to its tectonic setting, the Sahara is also home to a variety of rocks and minerals. These include sedimentary rocks, such as sandstone and limestone, as well as igneous rocks, such as basalt and granite. The Sahara is also known for its rich mineral deposits, including gold, uranium, and phosphates.

#### 5.1b: Climate of the Sahara

The Sahara is known for its extreme climate, with temperatures ranging from 20°C to 40°C and very little precipitation. This climate is a result of the Sahara's location in the African Plate, which is surrounded by other plates that influence its climate. The Sahara's climate is also influenced by its proximity to the equator, which leads to strong solar heating and the formation of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).

The ITCZ is a band of low pressure that encircles the Earth near the equator and is responsible for the convergence of air masses from the northern and southern hemispheres. This convergence leads to the formation of thunderstorms and heavy rainfall, which is why the Sahara experiences its wet season. However, the Sahara's location in the African Plate also leads to the formation of the Hadley Cell, which is a large-scale atmospheric circulation pattern that brings dry air from the Sahara to the surrounding regions.

The Sahara's climate is also influenced by its topography, with the presence of sand dunes and salt flats leading to the formation of cold air pools at night. These cold air pools can lead to the formation of fog, which is a common occurrence in the Sahara.

In addition to its extreme temperatures and lack of precipitation, the Sahara also experiences strong winds, known as the Harmattan, which blow from the northeast and can last for several weeks at a time. These winds are a result of the Sahara's location in the African Plate and its proximity to the Atlas Mountains in North Africa.

Overall, the Sahara's climate is a result of its unique location and topography, and it plays a significant role in shaping the geology of the region.

Magnetic remanence is a crucial concept in paleomagnetism. It refers to the magnetic moment that a material retains after the external magnetic field is removed. This remanent magnetization can provide valuable information about the Earth's magnetic field in the past.

The remanent magnetization of a material is influenced by several factors, including the type of magnetic mineral, the strength and direction of the external magnetic field, and the temperature. For example, magnetite has a high remanent magnetization and is easily magnetized, making it a valuable mineral for paleomagnetic studies.

There are two types of magnetic remanence: natural remanent magnetization (NRM) and induced remanent magnetization (IRM). Natural remanent magnetization is the remanent magnetization that a material acquires from the Earth's magnetic field. Induced remanent magnetization is the remanent magnetization that a material acquires from an external magnetic field.

The measurement of magnetic remanence is a crucial technique in paleomagnetism. It allows us to determine the orientation of the Earth's magnetic field at the time of mineral formation. This information can then be used to reconstruct the Earth's magnetic field over time, providing valuable insights into the evolution of our planet.

It is a crucial aspect of geology, as it helps us understand the evolution of the Earth's surface and the processes that shape it. Paleogeography is particularly important in Africa, where the continent's rich history of tectonic activity has resulted in a complex and dynamic geological landscape.

Paleogeography is often studied using paleomagnetism, a technique that involves the analysis of the Earth's magnetic field at different points in time. This technique has been used extensively in Africa, providing valuable insights into the continent's geological history.

#### 5.4a.1 Paleogeographic Interpretations using Paleomagnetism

Paleomagnetism is a powerful tool for studying paleogeography. By analyzing the orientation of the Earth's magnetic field at different points in time, we can reconstruct the relative positions of tectonic plates and understand how they have moved over time. This information can then be used to interpret the changes in the Earth's surface over millions of years.

In Africa, paleomagnetic data has been used to reconstruct the continent's paleogeography during the Pleistocene epoch. This period, which lasted from approximately 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago, was marked by repeated glacial cycles and significant changes in the Earth's climate.

During the Pleistocene, the modern continents were essentially at their present positions, with the plates upon which they sit having moved no more than relative to each other since the beginning of the period. However, the sea level would drop by over during peak glaciation, exposing large areas of present continental shelf as dry land. This resulted in a complex and dynamic geological landscape, which can be studied using paleomagnetism.

#### 5.4a.2 Paleogeographic Features of Africa

The Pleistocene climate of Africa was marked by repeated glacial cycles, resulting in significant changes in the Earth's surface. For example, continental glaciers pushed to the 40th parallel in some places, and a zone of permafrost stretched southward from the edge of the glacial sheet. These features can be studied using paleomagnetism, providing valuable insights into the continent's geological history.

Furthermore, the effects of glaciation were global. Antarctica was ice-bound throughout the Pleistocene as well as the preceding Pliocene. The Andes were covered in the south by the Patagonian ice cap. There were glaciers in New Zealand and Tasmania. The current decaying glaciers of Mount Kenya, Mount Kilimanjaro, and the Ruwenzori Range in east and central Africa were larger. Glaciers existed in the mountains of Ethiopia and to the west in the Atlas Mountains.

In the next section, we will explore some case studies of paleogeographic interpretations using paleomagnetism in Africa.

### Subsection: 5.4c Case Studies in Africa

Africa is a continent with a rich geological history, and paleomagnetism has been instrumental in unraveling its complex geological processes. In this section, we will explore some case studies that highlight the use of paleomagnetism in understanding the geological evolution of Africa.

#### 5.4c.1 The East African Rift System

The East African Rift System (EARS) is a prominent feature of the African continent, extending from the Red Sea in the north to the Great Rift Valley in the south. The EARS is a result of the separation of the African and Arabian plates, which began about 30 million years ago. Paleomagnetic data has been crucial in understanding the evolution of the EARS.

Paleomagnetic studies have shown that the EARS has undergone significant changes in its orientation and intensity over time. For instance, during the Oligocene epoch (33.9-23.03 million years ago), the EARS was characterized by a north-south trending rift, with a high-angle normal faulting. However, during the Miocene epoch (23.03-5.33 million years ago), the EARS became more east-west trending, with a low-angle normal faulting. This change in orientation is thought to be due to the rotation of the African plate, which was driven by the separation from the Arabian plate.

#### 5.4c.2 The Sahara Desert

The Sahara Desert, the largest hot desert in the world, has been a subject of intense paleomagnetic research. Paleomagnetic data has been used to reconstruct the paleogeography of the Sahara during the Pleistocene epoch. The data has shown that the Sahara was much wetter during this period, with evidence of lakes and rivers. However, during the Holocene epoch (11,700 years ago to present), the Sahara became progressively drier, due to changes in the Earth's climate and orbital parameters.

#### 5.4c.3 The Kalahari Desert

The Kalahari Desert, located in southern Africa, is another area where paleomagnetism has been used to understand the geological evolution of the continent. Paleomagnetic data has shown that the Kalahari Desert was once a part of the Congo Basin, a large sedimentary basin that formed during the Cretaceous period (145.0-66.0 million years ago). However, during the Cenozoic era (66.0 million years ago to present), the Kalahari Desert became detached from the Congo Basin due to the separation of the African and South American plates.

In conclusion, these case studies highlight the power of paleomagnetism in understanding the geological evolution of Africa. By studying the changes in the Earth's magnetic field over time, we can reconstruct the continent's paleogeography and understand the complex geological processes that have shaped it.

### Section: 6.1a Overview of the Paleozoic Era

The Paleozoic Era is a geological time period that spans from approximately 541 to 251 million years ago. It is the first era of the Phanerozoic Eon, which is the current era of the Earth's history. The Paleozoic Era is divided into six periods: Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian.

The Paleozoic Era is known for its significant changes in the Earth's climate and the evolution of life. The beginning of the Paleozoic Era witnessed the breakup of the supercontinent Pannotia, which led to the formation of the supercontinent Gondwana. This breakup was followed by the assembly of the huge continent Gondwana (<Ma|510>). By mid-Paleozoic, the collision of North America and Europe produced the Acadian-Caledonian uplifts, and a subduction plate uplifted eastern Australia. By the late Paleozoic, continental collisions formed the supercontinent of Pangaea and created great mountain chains, including the Appalachians, Ural Mountains, and mountains of Tasmania.

The Paleozoic Era is also known for its significant changes in the Earth's climate. Paleoclimatic studies and evidence of glaciers indicate that Central Africa was most likely in the polar regions during the early Paleozoic. The breakup of Pannotia was followed by the assembly of the huge continent Gondwana (<Ma|510>). By mid-Paleozoic, the collision of North America and Europe produced the Acadian-Caledonian uplifts, and a subduction plate uplifted eastern Australia. By the late Paleozoic, continental collisions formed the supercontinent of Pangaea and created great mountain chains, including the Appalachians, Ural Mountains, and mountains of Tasmania.

### Subsection: 6.1b Paleozoic Life

The Paleozoic Era was a time of significant evolution and diversification of life on Earth. The Cambrian Period, the first period of the Paleozoic Era, is known as the "Cambrian explosion" due to the rapid diversification of life that occurred during this time. This period saw the evolution of the first complex multicellular organisms, including the first animals with hard parts, such as trilobites and brachiopods.

The Ordovician Period saw the continued diversification of life, with the evolution of the first fish and the first land plants. The Silurian Period saw the evolution of the first amphibians and the first reptiles. The Devonian Period saw the evolution of the first mammal-like reptiles and the first true amphibians. The Carboniferous Period saw the evolution of the first reptiles and the first dinosaurs. The Permian Period saw the evolution of the first mammals and the first dinosaurs.

The Paleozoic Era also saw the evolution of the first land plants, which played a crucial role in the Earth's climate and the evolution of life. The evolution of land plants led to the formation of the first soils and the cycling of nutrients between the land and the ocean. This, in turn, led to the evolution of more complex ecosystems and the diversification of life.

The Paleozoic Era also saw the evolution of the first vertebrates, which played a crucial role in the evolution of life on Earth. The evolution of vertebrates led to the development of the first backbones, which allowed for more complex movements and the evolution of more advanced nervous systems. This, in turn, led to the evolution of more advanced behaviors and the development of the first social animals.

In conclusion, the Paleozoic Era was a time of significant evolution and diversification of life on Earth. The changes in the Earth's climate and the evolution of life during this time have had a lasting impact on the Earth's history and the present-day distribution of life on our planet. 





### Section: 6.1b Major Geological Events in Africa

The Paleozoic Era in Africa was marked by a series of major geological events that shaped the continent's geology and influenced the evolution of life. These events include the breakup of the supercontinent Pannotia, the assembly of the supercontinent Gondwana, and the formation of the supercontinent Pangaea.

#### Breakup of Pannotia

The breakup of the supercontinent Pannotia, which began around 541 million years ago, was a significant event in the Paleozoic Era. This event led to the formation of the supercontinent Gondwana, which was composed of the continents of Africa, South America, Australia, and Antarctica. The breakup of Pannotia was driven by plate tectonics, specifically the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates.

#### Assembly of Gondwana

The assembly of the supercontinent Gondwana was a complex process that occurred over millions of years. This process was driven by the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, which caused the continents of Africa, South America, Australia, and Antarctica to collide and merge. The assembly of Gondwana was completed by the mid-Paleozoic era, around 360 million years ago.

#### Formation of Pangaea

The formation of the supercontinent Pangaea was a significant event in the late Paleozoic era. This event was driven by the collision of the continents of Gondwana and Laurussia, which were the two largest continents at the time. The collision of these two continents led to the formation of the supercontinent Pangaea, which was composed of all the continents except for North America.

#### Geological Impact of these Events

The major geological events that occurred in Africa during the Paleozoic Era had a profound impact on the continent's geology. These events led to the formation of the supercontinents Pangaea and Gondwana, which were composed of the continents of Africa, South America, Australia, and Antarctica. These supercontinents were characterized by large-scale mountain building events, such as the Acadian-Caledonian uplifts and the Hercynian orogeny. These events also led to the formation of extensive sedimentary basins, such as the Congo Basin and the Kalahari Basin, which are rich in mineral resources.

In addition to these major geological events, the Paleozoic Era in Africa was also marked by significant changes in the Earth's climate. Paleoclimatic studies and evidence of glaciers indicate that Central Africa was most likely in the polar regions during the early Paleozoic. The breakup of Pannotia was followed by the assembly of the huge continent Gondwana (<Ma|510>). By mid-Paleozoic, the collision of North America and Europe produced the Acadian-Caledonian uplifts, and a subduction plate uplifted eastern Australia. By the late Paleozoic, continental collisions formed the supercontinent of Pangaea and created great mountain chains, including the Appalachians, Ural Mountains, and mountains of Tasmania.

### Conclusion

The Paleozoic Era in Africa was a time of significant geological events that shaped the continent's geology and influenced the evolution of life. The breakup of Pannotia, the assembly of Gondwana, and the formation of Pangaea were all driven by plate tectonics and had a profound impact on the Earth's climate and the distribution of continents. These events also led to the formation of extensive sedimentary basins and large-scale mountain building events, which have significant implications for mineral resources and the evolution of life on Earth.

### Subsection: 6.3a Overview of Paleozoic Tectonic Events

The Paleozoic era, spanning from approximately 541 to 251 million years ago, was a time of significant tectonic activity in Africa. This era was marked by the formation of new continents, the breakup of ancient ones, and the movement of landmasses across the globe. These tectonic events had profound implications for the geography and climate of Africa, shaping the continent as we know it today.

#### 6.3a.1 Continental Drift

One of the most significant tectonic events of the Paleozoic era was the process of continental drift. This process, driven by plate tectonics, saw the movement of continents across the Earth's surface. During the Paleozoic, Africa was part of the supercontinent Gondwana, which also included South America, Australia, and Antarctica. As Gondwana began to break up, Africa moved northward, colliding with and amalgamating with the supercontinent Laurasia to form the supercontinent Pangea.

#### 6.3a.2 Orogenic Events

The Paleozoic era was also marked by several orogenic events, or mountain-building processes. These events were primarily driven by plate tectonics and resulted in the formation of new mountain ranges and the uplift of existing ones. The most significant of these events in Africa was the Variscan orogeny, which occurred between 360 and 300 million years ago. This event, which affected much of Europe and North America as well, resulted in the formation of the Hercynian Mountains, a series of mountain ranges that stretched across Europe and Africa.

#### 6.3a.3 Sea Level Changes

The Paleozoic era was also characterized by significant changes in sea level. These changes were primarily driven by tectonic events, such as the formation of new continents and the movement of landmasses. For instance, the breakup of Gondwana and the movement of Africa northward resulted in a rise in sea level, as the separation of continents led to a decrease in the volume of land. This rise in sea level was also accompanied by a rise in global temperatures, which further contributed to the changes in sea level.

#### 6.3a.4 Implications for Africa's Geography and Climate

The tectonic events of the Paleozoic era had profound implications for the geography and climate of Africa. The movement of Africa northward and its collision with Laurasia resulted in the formation of the Sahara Desert, as the uplift of the Hercynian Mountains and the subsequent erosion of the land led to the deposition of sediments in the basins of the Sahara. The rise in sea level also led to the formation of the Congo Basin, as the sea flooded the low-lying areas of the continent. These changes in geography and climate have had lasting impacts on the continent, shaping its physical and biological characteristics as we know them today.

As Africa moved northward, it collided with and amalgamated with the supercontinent Laurasia to form the supercontinent Pangea. This collision resulted in the formation of the Atlas Mountains in northwest Africa, which are a remnant of the Hercynian Mountains that once stretched across Europe and Africa.

#### 6.3b.2 Orogenic Events and Paleogeography

The orogenic events that occurred during the Paleozoic era also had a profound impact on the paleogeography of Africa. The Variscan orogeny, which occurred between 360 and 300 million years ago, resulted in the formation of the Hercynian Mountains. These mountains were a significant feature of the African landscape during the Paleozoic era, and their formation led to the uplift of the Atlas Mountains in northwest Africa.

#### 6.3b.3 Sea Level Changes and Paleogeography

The changes in sea level that occurred during the Paleozoic era also played a role in shaping the paleogeography of Africa. The rise in sea level that occurred as a result of the breakup of Gondwana and the movement of Africa northward led to the formation of the Karoo Sea, a large lake that extended over much of South Africa. This lake was a significant feature of the African landscape during the Paleozoic era, and its formation led to the deposition of the sediments that make up the Karoo Supergroup.

In conclusion, the Paleozoic era was a time of significant changes in the geography of Africa. These changes were primarily driven by the tectonic events that occurred during this era, including continental drift and orogenic events. These events had profound implications for the geography and climate of Africa, shaping the continent as we know it today.

### Subsection: 6.4a Overview of Paleozoic Climate Changes

The Paleozoic era was a time of significant climate changes, driven by a variety of factors including changes in sea level, continental drift, and atmospheric composition. These changes had a profound impact on the geology of Africa, shaping the physical landscape and influencing the distribution of mineral resources.

#### 6.4a.1 Early Cambrian Climate

The early Cambrian climate was likely moderate, becoming warmer over the course of the Cambrian as the second-greatest sustained sea level rise in the Phanerozoic got underway. However, as Gondwana moved south, most of West Gondwana (Africa and South America) lay directly over the South Pole, resulting in a cooler climate.

#### 6.4a.2 Early Paleozoic Climate

The early Paleozoic climate was strongly zonal, with the result that the "climate", in an abstract sense, became warmer, but the living space of most organisms of the time – the continental shelf marine environment – became steadily colder. However, Baltica (Northern Europe and Russia) and Laurentia (eastern North America and Greenland) remained in the tropical zone, while China and Australia lay in waters which were at least temperate.

#### 6.4a.3 Late Ordovician Ice Age

The early Paleozoic ended, rather abruptly, with the short, but apparently severe, late Ordovician ice age. This cold spell caused the second-greatest mass extinction of the Phanerozoic Eon. Over time, the warmer weather moved into the Paleozoic Era.

#### 6.4a.4 Ordovician and Silurian Warm Greenhouse Periods

The Ordovician and Silurian were warm greenhouse periods, with the highest sea levels of the Paleozoic (200 m above today's). The warm climate was interrupted only by a <Ma|30|million year> cool period, the Early Palaeozoic Icehouse, culminating in the Hirnantian glaciation, <Ma|445> at the end of the Ordovician.

#### 6.4a.5 Middle Paleozoic Stability

The middle Paleozoic was a time of considerable stability. Sea levels had dropped coincident with the ice age, but slowly recovered over the course of the Silurian and Devonian. The slow merger of Baltica and Laurentia, and the northward movement of bits and pieces of Gondwana created numerous new regions of relatively warm, shallow sea floor. As plants took hold on the continental margins, oxygen levels increased and carbon dioxide dropped, although much less dramatically. The north–south temperature gradient also seems to have moderated, or metazoan life simply became hardier, or both. At any event, the Paleozoic climate was a complex and dynamic system, with a variety of factors influencing its evolution. Understanding these factors and their interactions is crucial for understanding the geology of Africa and other parts of the world.




### Section: 6.4b Environmental Changes in Africa

The African continent has undergone significant environmental changes throughout the Paleozoic era. These changes have been influenced by a variety of factors, including plate tectonics, sea level changes, and atmospheric composition.

#### 6.4b.1 Early Paleozoic Environmental Changes

During the early Paleozoic, Africa was part of the supercontinent Gondwana, which was situated near the South Pole. This resulted in a cool climate, with most of the continent covered in ice sheets. However, as Gondwana began to drift northward, the climate became warmer, and the ice sheets began to melt.

#### 6.4b.2 Late Paleozoic Environmental Changes

As the Paleozoic progressed, Africa continued to drift northward, and the climate became progressively warmer. This was due to a combination of factors, including the warming effect of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and the melting of the Gondwana ice sheets.

#### 6.4b.3 Paleozoic Sea Level Changes

Sea level changes played a significant role in shaping the African continent during the Paleozoic. As sea levels rose, the continental shelves became submerged, leading to the formation of shallow seas. This process was particularly pronounced in the early Paleozoic, when sea levels rose by over 200 meters.

#### 6.4b.4 Paleozoic Atmospheric Composition

The composition of the atmosphere also played a crucial role in shaping the African environment during the Paleozoic. As the Selli Event occurred, the release of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide into the atmosphere led to a spike in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. This, in turn, led to a warmer climate and the formation of shallow seas.

#### 6.4b.5 Paleozoic Climate Optimum

The Paleozoic climate optimum, which occurred during the late Paleozoic, was a period of exceptionally warm climate. This was likely due to a combination of factors, including high levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, the melting of the Gondwana ice sheets, and the warming effect of the Selli Event.

#### 6.4b.6 Paleozoic Environmental Crises

Despite the overall warming trend, the Paleozoic was not without environmental crises. The late Ordovician ice age, for example, was a brief but severe cold spell that led to a mass extinction event. Similarly, the end-Permian extinction event, which occurred at the end of the Paleozoic, was one of the most significant extinction events in Earth's history.

In conclusion, the African continent has undergone significant environmental changes throughout the Paleozoic era. These changes have been influenced by a variety of factors, including plate tectonics, sea level changes, and atmospheric composition. Understanding these changes is crucial for understanding the geological history of Africa and the rest of the world.

It is characterized by significant changes in climate, sea levels, and atmospheric composition, all of which have had a profound impact on the continent's geological evolution.

#### 6.5a Overview of the Paleozoic Era

The Paleozoic Era is divided into several periods, including the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous. Each of these periods is marked by distinct geological events and trends.

The Cambrian Period, from 541 to 485 million years ago, is known for its rapid diversification of marine life. This period saw the rise of the first complex multicellular organisms, including trilobites and brachiopods. The Ordovician Period, from 485 to 443 million years ago, was characterized by a global cooling trend and the development of the first reefs.

The Silurian Period, from 443 to 419 million years ago, was marked by a return to warmer temperatures and the development of the first land plants. The Devonian Period, from 419 to 359 million years ago, saw the rise of the first terrestrial vertebrates and the development of the first coal deposits.

Finally, the Carboniferous Period, from 359 to 299 million years ago, was characterized by a spike in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and the development of the first large-scale coal deposits.

#### 6.5b Paleozoic Climate and Environmental Changes

The Paleozoic Era was marked by significant climate and environmental changes. The early Paleozoic was characterized by a period of global cooling, which led to the formation of ice sheets in the Southern Hemisphere. This cooling trend was followed by a period of warming, which led to the melting of these ice sheets and a rise in sea levels.

The late Paleozoic, on the other hand, was characterized by a spike in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, which led to a period of global warming. This warming trend was accompanied by a rise in sea levels and the development of shallow seas rich in nutrients due to increased input of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from volcanic activity.

#### 6.5c Paleozoic Sea Level Changes

These events have had a profound impact on the continent's geological evolution and continue to shape its geological landscape today.




### Section: 6.5 Geological Significance of the Paleozoic Era in Africa

The Paleozoic Era has played a crucial role in shaping the geological landscape of Africa. The continent's geological history is deeply intertwined with the global events that occurred during this era. In this section, we will explore the geological significance of the Paleozoic Era in Africa, focusing on the impact of the African humid period and the early humidity increases.

#### 6.5b Impact on African Geology

The African humid period, which occurred during the Paleozoic Era, had a profound impact on the geology of Africa. This period, which lasted from approximately 300 to 250 million years ago, was characterized by a significant increase in precipitation across the continent, leading to the formation of vast inland seas and the development of a rich marine life.

The increase in precipitation during the African humid period was primarily driven by the weakening of the Hadley and Walker circulations, which are responsible for the global distribution of heat and moisture. This weakening was likely caused by the melting of the large polar ice sheets, which squeezed the monsoon belt to the equator and increased the humidity of the atmosphere.

The increased humidity and precipitation during the African humid period had a profound impact on the geology of Africa. The formation of vast inland seas led to the deposition of thick layers of sediment, including sandstone, shale, and limestone. These sediments have been instrumental in the formation of the continent's mineral wealth, including oil and gas reserves.

Furthermore, the African humid period also led to the development of a rich marine life, which left behind a legacy of fossil deposits. These fossils, which include the remains of marine organisms such as corals, mollusks, and fish, have been crucial in understanding the evolution of life on Earth.

In addition to the African humid period, the early humidity increases that occurred before the onset of the African humid period also had a significant impact on the geology of Africa. These increases in humidity led to the formation of a series of lakes across the continent, including Lake Victoria, Albert, Edward, Turkana, and the Sudd. These lakes, which were part of the larger Lake Tethys system, were crucial in the formation of the continent's sedimentary basins.

In conclusion, the Paleozoic Era has played a crucial role in shaping the geology of Africa. The African humid period and the early humidity increases have left behind a rich legacy of sedimentary deposits and fossils, which have been instrumental in understanding the continent's geological history.

### Introduction

The early phases of the break-up of Pangea marked a significant turning point in the geological history of Africa. This chapter will delve into the intricate details of these early phases, providing a comprehensive understanding of the geological processes that shaped the continent.

The break-up of Pangea, a supercontinent that existed during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic era, was a complex event that involved the separation of landmasses and the formation of new ocean basins. This process was driven by a variety of factors, including plate tectonics, volcanic activity, and changes in sea level.

Africa, being one of the key regions involved in this process, experienced significant changes in its geological landscape. The early phases of this break-up saw the formation of the East African Rift System, a series of rifts and faults that have played a crucial role in shaping the continent's geography.

This chapter will explore these early phases in detail, providing a comprehensive overview of the geological events that occurred during this period. We will discuss the formation of the East African Rift System, the role of volcanic activity, and the impact of these events on the continent's geography.

In addition, we will also delve into the implications of these early phases for the continent's future. The break-up of Pangea has had a profound impact on Africa's geology, and understanding these early phases is crucial for predicting future geological events.

Join us as we journey through the early phases of the break-up of Pangea, exploring the fascinating geological history of Africa.




### Subsection: 7.1a Introduction to Gondwana and Pangea

The early phases of the break-up of Pangea marked a significant turning point in the geological history of Africa. This chapter will delve into the intricate details of these early phases, providing a comprehensive understanding of the geological processes that shaped the continent.

#### The Formation of Gondwana and Pangea

The supercontinent Pangea was formed approximately 300 million years ago, during the late Paleozoic era, through the process of continental drift. This process involves the movement of tectonic plates, which carry the continents and oceanic crust on their surfaces. The movement of these plates can result in the formation of new landmasses and the separation of existing ones.

The formation of Pangea was largely driven by the movement of the Gondwana supercontinent, which was formed approximately 500 million years ago. Gondwana was a vast landmass that included most of the continents as we know them today, including Africa, South America, Australia, and Antarctica. As Gondwana moved northward, it collided with other continents, leading to the formation of Pangea.

#### The East African Rift System

The early phases of the break-up of Pangea saw the formation of the East African Rift System, a series of rifts and faults that have played a crucial role in shaping the continent's geography. The East African Rift System is a system of rifts and faults that extends from the Red Sea in the north to the Great Rift Valley in East Africa.

The formation of the East African Rift System was largely driven by the movement of the African Plate, which is part of the Nubian Plate. The Nubian Plate is one of the largest tectonic plates in the world, covering an area of approximately 20 million square kilometers. The movement of the Nubian Plate has resulted in the formation of the East African Rift System, which is one of the most significant geological features in Africa.

#### The Role of Volcanic Activity

Volcanic activity played a crucial role in the formation of the East African Rift System. The movement of the African Plate has resulted in the upwelling of magma, which has led to the formation of volcanic features such as the Great Rift Valley. The Great Rift Valley is a series of rifts and faults that extend from the Red Sea in the north to the Great Rift Valley in East Africa.

The volcanic activity associated with the formation of the East African Rift System has had a profound impact on the continent's geography. The upwelling of magma has resulted in the formation of volcanic mountains, such as the Great Rift Valley, which are some of the most spectacular geological features in Africa.

#### The Implications of the Early Phases of the Break-up of Pangea

The early phases of the break-up of Pangea have had a profound impact on the continent's geology. The formation of the East African Rift System has resulted in the formation of new landforms and the redistribution of resources. The volcanic activity associated with the formation of the East African Rift System has also led to the formation of valuable mineral deposits, which have been exploited by humans for thousands of years.

In addition, the early phases of the break-up of Pangea have also had implications for the continent's biogeography. The movement of the continents has resulted in the disjunct distribution of life forms, leading to the formation of unique biogeographic regions. The East African Rift System, for example, is home to a diverse range of ecosystems, including the Serengeti Plains and the Great Rift Valley.

In conclusion, the early phases of the break-up of Pangea marked a significant turning point in the geological history of Africa. The formation of the East African Rift System, driven by the movement of the African Plate, has resulted in the formation of new landforms and the redistribution of resources. The volcanic activity associated with the formation of the East African Rift System has also led to the formation of valuable mineral deposits and unique biogeographic regions.




### Subsection: 7.1b Formation and Break-up

The formation of Pangea marked a significant milestone in the geological history of Africa. However, this supercontinent was not destined to last forever. The processes that led to the formation of Pangea also set in motion the events that would eventually lead to its break-up.

#### The Break-up of Pangea

The break-up of Pangea began approximately 180 million years ago, during the Mesozoic era. This process was largely driven by the movement of the continents, which continued to shift and collide as they had done during the formation of Pangea. However, this time, the collisions were not as severe, and the continents began to separate.

The break-up of Pangea led to the formation of two new supercontinents: Laurasia and Gondwana. Laurasia was formed when the continents of North America, Europe, and Asia came together, while Gondwana was formed when the continents of Africa, South America, Australia, and Antarctica came together.

#### The Role of Plate Tectonics

The break-up of Pangea was largely driven by the processes of plate tectonics. As the continents moved and collided, the plates beneath them also moved and collided, leading to the formation of new landmasses and the separation of existing ones.

The movement of the plates was also responsible for the formation of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a mountain range that runs along the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. This ridge is a result of the separation of the North American and Eurasian plates, which began during the break-up of Pangea.

#### The Impact of the Break-up on Africa

The break-up of Pangea had a profound impact on the geology of Africa. The separation of the continents led to the formation of new landforms, such as the Great Rift Valley, which is a result of the separation of the African and Arabian plates.

The break-up of Pangea also led to significant changes in the climate of Africa. The separation of the continents led to a decrease in the exchange of heat between the northern and southern hemispheres, resulting in a cooling of the climate in Africa. This change in climate had a significant impact on the evolution of life on the continent.

In conclusion, the formation and break-up of Pangea have played a crucial role in shaping the geology of Africa. The processes of plate tectonics and continental drift have led to the formation of new landmasses and the separation of existing ones, resulting in the diverse and complex geological landscape we see today.




### Subsection: 7.1c Impact on African Geology

The break-up of Pangea had a profound impact on the geology of Africa. The separation of the continents led to the formation of new landforms, such as the Great Rift Valley, which is a result of the separation of the African and Arabian plates. This event also led to significant changes in the climate of Africa, as the exchange of heat and moisture between the continents was reduced.

#### The Great Rift Valley

The Great Rift Valley is a geological feature that stretches across eastern Africa, from the Red Sea to Mozambique. It is a result of the separation of the African and Arabian plates, which began during the break-up of Pangea. As the Arabian plate moved northward, it pulled away from the African plate, creating a rift that eventually formed the Great Rift Valley.

The Great Rift Valley is a site of significant geological activity. It is home to numerous volcanoes, including Mount Kilimanjaro, which is the highest peak in Africa. The valley is also home to several lakes, including Lake Turkana, which is the world's largest permanent desert lake.

#### Climate Changes

The break-up of Pangea also led to significant changes in the climate of Africa. As the continents separated, the exchange of heat and moisture between them was reduced, leading to a decrease in global temperatures. This event also led to the formation of the Sahara Desert, as the reduction in moisture led to a decrease in precipitation in the region.

The break-up of Pangea also led to changes in the ocean currents, which had a significant impact on the climate of Africa. The separation of the continents led to the formation of the Atlantic Ocean, which allowed for the formation of the Gulf Stream, a warm ocean current that flows along the eastern coast of North America. This current helped to moderate the climate of Africa, making it warmer and wetter than it would have been without the Gulf Stream.

#### Conclusion

The break-up of Pangea had a profound impact on the geology of Africa. The separation of the continents led to the formation of new landforms, such as the Great Rift Valley, and significant changes in the climate of Africa. These events continue to shape the geology of Africa and will continue to do so in the future.





### Subsection: 7.2a Overview of Rifting and Ocean Formation

The break-up of Pangea marked a significant turning point in the geological history of Africa. As the continents began to separate, the African continent experienced a period of intense rifting and ocean formation. This process, known as seafloor spreading, led to the formation of the South Atlantic Ocean and the creation of new landforms and geological features.

#### Seafloor Spreading

Seafloor spreading is a process that occurs at mid-oceanic ridges, where new oceanic crust is formed as a result of plate movement. In the case of Africa, the separation of the African and South American plates led to the formation of the South Atlantic Ocean. As the South American plate moved westward, it pulled away from the African plate, creating a rift that eventually formed the South Atlantic Ocean.

The process of seafloor spreading is driven by mantle convection, which is the movement of the Earth's molten core. As the mantle rises, it cools and forms new crust, which is then pulled apart by the movement of the plates. This process continues until the crust is too thin to support the weight of the water above it, at which point it sinks back into the mantle.

#### Margin Architecture

The process of rifting and ocean formation also led to the development of margin architecture, which refers to the spatial and temporal relationships between extensional deformation phases. As the African continent began to separate from the South American plate, the lithosphere was stretched and thinned, leading to the formation of rift domains.

These rift domains are characterized by variations in the Moho topography, which is the boundary between the Earth's crust and mantle. The proximal domain, located closest to the mid-oceanic ridge, is characterized by fault-rotated crustal blocks. The necking zone, located in the middle of the rift domain, is characterized by thinning of the crustal basement. The distal domain, located furthest from the mid-oceanic ridge, is characterized by deep sag basins, ocean-continent transition, and oceanic domain.

#### Magmatism

The process of rifting and ocean formation also led to significant magmatic activity. Many rifts are the sites of at least minor magmatic activity, particularly in the early stages of rifting. This magmatic activity is driven by the movement of the plates and the resulting stress on the lithosphere.

The magma-rich margins of the African continent are characterized by major volcanic features, such as volcanic plateaus and calderas. These features are the result of large-scale volcanic eruptions that occurred during the early phases of the break-up of Pangea. In contrast, the magma-starved margins of the African continent are characterized by large-scale faulting and crustal hyperextension. These margins are affected by the exposure of upper mantle peridotites and gabbros, which are commonly serpentinized along extensional detachments at the seafloor.

#### Non-Volcanic Passive Margins

In addition to the magma-rich margins, the African continent also has non-volcanic passive margins. These margins are the result of passive rifting, which occurs principally by extensional tectonic forces as opposed to magmatic forces. Isostatic forces allow mantle material to rise under the thinning lithosphere, leading to subsidence and sedimentation.

The formation of non-volcanic passive margins is a complex process that is still not fully understood. Recent studies have shown that post-collisional granites in collisional orogens, such as the Himalayas, are the product of rifting magmatism at converged plate margins. This suggests that non-volcanic passive margins may also be the result of rifting magmatism, rather than purely extensional tectonic forces.

In conclusion, the break-up of Pangea led to a period of intense rifting and ocean formation in Africa. This process resulted in the formation of new landforms and geological features, as well as significant magmatic activity. The study of the geology of Africa during this early phase of the break-up of Pangea continues to be a topic of ongoing research and exploration.

### Subsection: 7.2b The South Atlantic in Africa

The South Atlantic Ocean is a vast body of water that separates the African continent from South America. It is a result of the break-up of Pangea, which began approximately 200 million years ago. The formation of the South Atlantic Ocean has had a significant impact on the geology of Africa, shaping its landforms and creating new geological features.

#### The South Atlantic Ocean and Africa

The South Atlantic Ocean is home to a variety of geological features, including mid-oceanic ridges, seamounts, and underwater volcanoes. These features are a result of the ongoing process of seafloor spreading, which continues to shape the ocean floor. The South Atlantic Ocean is also home to a variety of marine life, making it an important ecosystem for biodiversity.

The formation of the South Atlantic Ocean has also had a significant impact on the African continent. As the African and South American plates separated, the African continent experienced a period of intense rifting and volcanic activity. This led to the formation of the Great Escarpment, a large fault system that runs along the eastern edge of the continent. The Great Escarpment is a result of the stretching and thinning of the African lithosphere, which occurred as the continent began to separate from the South American plate.

#### The South Atlantic Ocean and the Great Escarpment

The Great Escarpment is a major geological feature of Africa, stretching from the Gulf of Guinea to the Cape of Good Hope. It is a result of the rifting and separation of the African and South American plates, which began approximately 200 million years ago. The Great Escarpment is characterized by a series of faults and fault zones, which are responsible for the steep drop in elevation along the eastern edge of the continent.

The formation of the Great Escarpment has had a significant impact on the geology of Africa. It has led to the formation of new landforms, such as the Great Rift Valley, which is a result of the stretching and thinning of the African lithosphere. The Great Escarpment has also played a role in the development of the African climate, as it has influenced the distribution of precipitation and the formation of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).

#### The South Atlantic Ocean and the African Climate

The South Atlantic Ocean has also played a role in shaping the African climate. The ocean acts as a heat sink, absorbing and redistributing heat around the continent. This has led to the formation of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), a band of low pressure that encircles the Earth near the equator. The ITCZ is responsible for the wet and humid climate that is found in many parts of Africa.

The South Atlantic Ocean also plays a role in the formation of the African monsoon, which is a seasonal pattern of precipitation that occurs in the Sahel region of Africa. The ocean's influence on the climate of Africa is complex and continues to be studied by scientists. However, it is clear that the formation of the South Atlantic Ocean has had a significant impact on the geology and climate of Africa.





### Subsection: 7.2c Geological Significance

The formation of the South Atlantic Ocean and the Great Escarpment has had a profound impact on the geology of Africa. The ongoing process of seafloor spreading has not only shaped the ocean floor, but also influenced the geological processes occurring on the African continent.

#### The Geological Significance of the South Atlantic Ocean

The South Atlantic Ocean is a significant geological feature in its own right. Its formation has led to the creation of a variety of geological features, including mid-oceanic ridges, seamounts, and underwater volcanoes. These features are not only important for their own sake, but also for the insights they provide into the processes of seafloor spreading and plate tectonics.

The South Atlantic Ocean also plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle. The ocean acts as a carbon sink, absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The formation of the South Atlantic Ocean has increased the surface area of the ocean, thereby increasing the ocean's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide. This has had a significant impact on the Earth's climate, helping to mitigate the effects of climate change.

#### The Geological Significance of the Great Escarpment

The Great Escarpment is a major geological feature of Africa, and its formation has had a profound impact on the continent's geology. The stretching and thinning of the African lithosphere, which occurred as the continent began to separate from the South American plate, has led to the formation of the Great Escarpment. This fault system is a result of the ongoing process of seafloor spreading, and it continues to shape the African continent to this day.

The Great Escarpment is also a significant geological feature in its own right. It is home to a variety of geological features, including faults, fault zones, and volcanic structures. These features are not only important for their own sake, but also for the insights they provide into the processes of rifting and volcanic activity.

In addition, the Great Escarpment plays a crucial role in the Earth's climate system. The steep drop in elevation along the eastern edge of the continent has led to the formation of a cold ocean current, known as the Benguela Current. This current plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate, helping to moderate temperatures in the region.

In conclusion, the formation of the South Atlantic Ocean and the Great Escarpment has had a profound impact on the geology of Africa. These features continue to shape the continent to this day, and they provide valuable insights into the processes of seafloor spreading, rifting, and volcanic activity. They also play a crucial role in the Earth's climate system, helping to mitigate the effects of climate change.

## Chapter: Chapter 8: Africa in the Mid-Phases of the Break-up of Pangea

### Introduction

The African continent, with its vast and diverse geography, has been a subject of intense study for geologists and scientists for centuries. In this chapter, we delve into the mid-phases of the break-up of Pangea, a process that has shaped the African continent as we know it today. 

The break-up of Pangea, a supercontinent that existed approximately 300 million years ago, is a fundamental event in the history of the Earth's continents. This process, which is still ongoing, has led to the formation of new continents, the shifting of landmasses, and the creation of new ocean basins. The African continent, being a part of Pangea, has been significantly influenced by these events.

In this chapter, we will explore the geological changes that occurred in Africa during the mid-phases of the break-up of Pangea. We will discuss the formation of new landforms, the movement of tectonic plates, and the impact of these events on the African ecosystem. We will also delve into the role of volcanic activity and the formation of new mountain ranges in shaping the African landscape.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the geological processes that have shaped the African continent during the mid-phases of the break-up of Pangea. It is a journey through time, exploring the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the African geology. 

Join us as we unravel the mysteries of the African continent, piece by piece, in this chapter on "Africa in the Mid-Phases of the Break-up of Pangea".




### Subsection: 7.3a Overview of the Break-up of Pangea

The break-up of Pangea, the supercontinent that existed during the Mesozoic era, was a pivotal event in the history of the Earth's continents. This process, which began in the late Triassic and continued through the Cretaceous period, led to the formation of the modern continents as we know them today. 

#### The Early Phases of the Break-up of Pangea

The early phases of the break-up of Pangea were characterized by the formation of rifts and the beginning of seafloor spreading. These rifts, which were initially small and localized, began to widen and deepen over time, leading to the formation of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. This process was driven by the movement of the African and South American plates, which began to separate from each other as the result of mantle plumes and thermal expansion.

The opening of the Norwegian Sea, which occurred about 60–55 Ma, marked a significant milestone in the break-up of Pangea. This event, which was accompanied by the splitting of Laurasia into North America and Eurasia, allowed for the complete oceanic circulation around Antarctica for the first time. This event also led to the closure of the Tethys Ocean, which had been a major seaway connecting the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

#### The Middle Phases of the Break-up of Pangea

The middle phases of the break-up of Pangea were marked by the continued separation of the African and South American plates, as well as the movement of Australia and India towards the north. This movement led to the formation of the Gulf of California and the uplift of the Alps, among other geological events.

The middle phases also saw the beginning of the Himalayan orogeny, which was the result of the collision between India and Asia. This collision, which continues today, has led to the formation of the Himalayas and other mountain ranges in the region.

#### The Late Phases of the Break-up of Pangea

The late phases of the break-up of Pangea were characterized by the ongoing movement of the African and South American plates, as well as the continued collision between India and Asia. This phase also saw the opening of the Sea of Japan and the completion of the separation of Antarctica from South America.

The late phases also saw the completion of the closure of the Tethys Ocean, which was the result of the collision between India and Asia. This event led to the formation of the Himalayas and other mountain ranges in the region.

In conclusion, the break-up of Pangea was a complex and multifaceted process that occurred over millions of years. It led to the formation of the modern continents as we know them today, and continues to shape the Earth's geology to this day.




### Subsection: 7.3b Major Tectonic Events in Africa

The break-up of Pangea had a profound impact on the geology of Africa. The continent, which was once part of the supercontinent, experienced a series of tectonic events that shaped its current form. These events were largely driven by the movement of the African and South American plates, as well as the formation of the South Atlantic Ocean.

#### The Opening of the South Atlantic Ocean

The opening of the South Atlantic Ocean was a significant event in the break-up of Pangea. It began in the Early Cretaceous, around 106 Ma, when the eastern end of the Falkland Plateau separated from the Agulhas Bank, opening the South Atlantic which, however, remained an enclosed basin north of the Falkland Plateau until 85–83 Ma.

The opening of the South Atlantic Ocean was accompanied by the formation of the South Atlantic Large Igneous Province (SALIP), which is a large igneous province (LIP) that formed during the Early Cretaceous. The SALIP is characterized by a series of volcanic events, including the formation of the Etendeka Flood Basalt in Namibia and the Karoo Flood Basalt in South Africa.

#### The Formation of the South American–Antarctic Ridge

The South American–Antarctic Ridge (SAAR) is a mid-ocean ridge that forms the boundary between the South American and Antarctic plates. It is a significant feature in the geology of Africa, as it played a crucial role in the break-up of Pangea.

The SAAR began to form around 112–93 Ma, when the Bouvet hotspot, located off the coast of Antarctica, began to form the Southern Ocean Large Igneous Province (SOLIP). This event led to the formation of the SAAR, which separated Africa, Antarctica, and South America.

#### The Triple Junction Configuration Change

The triple junction configuration of the SAAR, Agulhas Plateau, and Northeast Georgia Rise changed around 60 Ma, from an R-R-R type to an R-F-F type. This change was accompanied by a shift in the relative motion of Antarctica and South America, from north to north-west.

The change in triple junction configuration led to the rapid increase in the spreading rate of the South Atlantic Ocean, from 0.3 cm/yr to 2.4 cm/yr. This event marked the beginning of the rapid opening of the South Atlantic Ocean, which continues today.

#### The Opening of the Drake Passage

The opening of the Drake Passage, which occurred around 49 Ma, was another significant event in the break-up of Pangea. The Drake Passage is a narrow strait located between South America and Antarctica, and its opening led to the complete separation of the South American and Antarctic plates.

The opening of the Drake Passage was accompanied by the formation of the South Sandwich Trench, a deep oceanic trench located off the coast of Antarctica. The trench is a result of the subduction of the South American Plate beneath the Antarctic Plate, and it continues to deepen today.

In conclusion, the break-up of Pangea led to a series of major tectonic events in Africa, including the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean, the formation of the South American–Antarctic Ridge, the change in triple junction configuration, and the opening of the Drake Passage. These events have shaped the current geology of Africa and continue to influence its evolution today.




### Subsection: 7.3c Impact on African Geology

The tectonic events that occurred during the break-up of Pangea had a profound impact on the geology of Africa. These events not only shaped the physical landscape of the continent but also influenced its climate and the distribution of life.

#### The Opening of the South Atlantic Ocean

The opening of the South Atlantic Ocean led to significant changes in the geology of Africa. The separation of the African and South American plates resulted in the formation of the South Atlantic Ocean, which is now the fourth largest ocean in the world. This event also led to the formation of the South Atlantic Large Igneous Province (SALIP), which is characterized by a series of volcanic events.

The SALIP is known for its large igneous province (LIP) events, which are associated with the formation of flood basalts. These events are characterized by the rapid extrusion of basaltic magma, which can cover large areas of the Earth's surface. The Etendeka Flood Basalt in Namibia and the Karoo Flood Basalt in South Africa are two notable examples of LIP events that occurred during the break-up of Pangea.

#### The Formation of the South American–Antarctic Ridge

The formation of the South American–Antarctic Ridge (SAAR) also had a significant impact on the geology of Africa. The SAAR is a mid-ocean ridge that forms the boundary between the South American and Antarctic plates. Its formation led to the separation of Africa, Antarctica, and South America, which resulted in the redistribution of heat and the formation of new oceanic crust.

The SAAR is also associated with the formation of the South Atlantic Anomaly, a region of reduced gravity and magnetic field strength that extends from the tip of South America to the coast of West Africa. This anomaly is thought to be the result of the SAAR's interaction with the African plate, which has led to the formation of a large-scale thermal anomaly beneath the South Atlantic.

#### The Triple Junction Configuration Change

The triple junction configuration change that occurred around 60 Ma had a significant impact on the geology of Africa. The change from an R-R-R type to an R-F-F type at the SAAR, Agulhas Plateau, and Northeast Georgia Rise led to a change in the relative motion of the African, Antarctic, and South American plates.

This change in plate motion resulted in the formation of the South Atlantic Ocean and the redistribution of heat and the formation of new oceanic crust. It also led to the formation of the South Atlantic Anomaly, which has had a profound impact on the geology and climate of Africa.

In conclusion, the tectonic events that occurred during the break-up of Pangea had a profound impact on the geology of Africa. These events not only shaped the physical landscape of the continent but also influenced its climate and the distribution of life. Understanding these events is crucial for understanding the geology of Africa and its role in the evolution of the Earth.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the early phases of the break-up of Pangea and its impact on the geology of Africa. We have seen how the separation of the continents led to significant changes in the Earth's surface, creating new landforms and altering the distribution of resources. The break-up of Pangea also played a crucial role in the evolution of life on Earth, as it led to the formation of new habitats and the diversification of species.

The early phases of the break-up of Pangea were marked by intense volcanic activity, which resulted in the formation of large igneous provinces (LIPs) and the extrusion of vast quantities of basaltic magma. These events had a profound impact on the Earth's climate, leading to periods of global warming and the formation of new oceanic crust.

The separation of the continents also led to the redistribution of landmasses, with the formation of new ocean basins and the emergence of new landforms. This process continues to shape the Earth's surface today, as the continents continue to move and interact with each other.

In conclusion, the early phases of the break-up of Pangea were a pivotal time in the history of the Earth and Africa. The changes that occurred during this period have had a lasting impact on the geology of the continent and continue to shape its future.

## Chapter: Chapter 8: Africa in the Mid-Phases of the Break-up of Pangea

### Introduction

The African continent, with its diverse and complex geological history, has been a subject of intense study for geologists and scientists alike. In this chapter, we delve deeper into the intriguing phase of Africa's geological evolution, specifically focusing on the mid-phases of the break-up of Pangea. 

The break-up of Pangea, a supercontinent that existed during the Mesozoic era, is a pivotal event in the history of the Earth's continents. It led to the formation of the current continents as we know them today. The mid-phases of this break-up, spanning from the Late Triassic to the Early Cretaceous, were marked by significant geological changes that shaped the African continent as we know it.

During this period, Africa underwent a series of tectonic events, including the formation of the Great Rift Valley, the separation of the Arabian and African plates, and the opening of the Indian Ocean. These events not only altered the physical landscape of Africa but also had profound implications for the continent's climate, biodiversity, and human history.

In this chapter, we will explore these events in detail, examining the geological processes that drove them and their far-reaching consequences. We will also discuss the ongoing research and debates surrounding these topics, providing a comprehensive understanding of Africa's geological evolution during the mid-phases of the break-up of Pangea.

Join us as we journey through the fascinating world of African geology, uncovering the hidden stories of the continent's past and present.




### Subsection: 7.4a Introduction to Sedimentary Basins and Volcanism

The break-up of Pangea not only led to the formation of new oceanic crust, but also resulted in the development of sedimentary basins and volcanic activity on the African continent. These processes have played a crucial role in shaping the geology of Africa and have had a significant impact on the continent's history and development.

#### Sedimentary Basins in Africa

Sedimentary basins are geological structures that are formed by the accumulation of sedimentary rocks. They are typically associated with the formation of hydrocarbons, which are of great interest to the petroleum industry. The break-up of Pangea led to the formation of several sedimentary basins in Africa, including the Porcupine Basin and the Adare Basin.

The Porcupine Basin, located off the coast of western Ireland, is one of the most well-studied sedimentary basins in Africa. It is characterized by a thick sequence of Jurassic sedimentary rocks, which are known for their high hydrocarbon potential. The basin is also known for its carbonate mounds, which may be surface expressions of an underlying active petroleum system.

The Adare Basin, located in the Ross Sea, is another important sedimentary basin in Africa. It is characterized by three major tectonic events that have shaped its geology. The first event, which occurred ~24 Ma, resulted in the formation of normal faults that directed the movement of mantle-derived fluids towards the basin margins. This event played a crucial role in the modern day sediment supply of the basin.

#### Volcanism in Africa

The break-up of Pangea also led to significant volcanic activity in Africa. This activity was primarily driven by the separation of the African and South American plates, which resulted in the formation of the South Atlantic Ocean and the South American–Antarctic Ridge (SAAR).

The SAAR is associated with the formation of the South Atlantic Large Igneous Province (SALIP), which is characterized by a series of volcanic events. These events are known for their large igneous province (LIP) events, which are associated with the formation of flood basalts. The Etendeka Flood Basalt in Namibia and the Karoo Flood Basalt in South Africa are two notable examples of LIP events that occurred during the break-up of Pangea.

In addition to the SALIP, the break-up of Pangea also led to the formation of the South Atlantic Anomaly, a region of reduced gravity and magnetic field strength that extends from the tip of South America to the coast of West Africa. This anomaly is thought to be the result of the SAAR's interaction with the African plate, which has led to the formation of a large-scale thermal anomaly beneath the South Atlantic.

In conclusion, the break-up of Pangea has had a profound impact on the geology of Africa, leading to the formation of sedimentary basins and volcanic activity that have shaped the continent's history and development. The study of these processes continues to be of great interest to geologists and petroleum engineers, as they hold the potential for significant hydrocarbon discoveries.





### Subsection: 7.4b Major Basins and Volcanic Activity in Africa

The break-up of Pangea has led to the formation of several major sedimentary basins and volcanic activity in Africa. These include the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR), the South Atlantic Ocean, and the Great Rift Valley.

#### Southwest Indian Ridge

The Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) is a mid-ocean ridge located in the Indian Ocean. It is a divergent plate boundary where the African and Antarctic plates are moving apart. The SWIR is characterized by a series of transform faults and magnetic anomalies, which indicate the direction of spreading. The mean axial depth of the SWIR varies between shallow and deep sections, with the shallowest section located between the Marion hotspot and Gallieni FZ.

The SWIR is also characterized by significant volcanic activity. The interaction between the SWIR and the Crozet hotspot, located more than 1000 km away, has resulted in the formation of the Crozet volcanic plateau at around 10 Ma. This interaction has also triggered thermal plumes and incorporates small amounts of lower mantle material, resulting in a mixed Ocean Island Basalt (OIB)/Mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) signature.

#### South Atlantic Ocean

The South Atlantic Ocean is another major sedimentary basin and volcanic region in Africa. It is located between the African and South American plates and is characterized by the South Atlantic Large Igneous Province (SALIP). The SALIP is associated with the formation of the South Atlantic Ocean and the South American–Antarctic Ridge (SAAR).

The SALIP is known for its large igneous province (LIP), which is a volcanic event that occurs on a scale of 100 million years or less. The SALIP is one of the largest LIPs in the world and is known for its high hydrocarbon potential. The SALIP is also associated with the formation of the South Atlantic Anomaly, a region of high gravity and magnetic field anomalies that is thought to be related to the formation of the SALIP.

#### Great Rift Valley

The Great Rift Valley is a major sedimentary basin and volcanic region in Africa. It is located along the East African Rift, a divergent plate boundary where the African and Arabian plates are moving apart. The Great Rift Valley is characterized by a series of volcanic cones, lakes, and faults.

The Great Rift Valley is also known for its high hydrocarbon potential. The formation of the Great Rift Valley is thought to be related to the separation of the African and Arabian plates, which resulted in the formation of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The Great Rift Valley is also associated with the formation of the Great Rift Valley Fault, a major fault system that extends from the Red Sea to Mozambique.

In conclusion, the break-up of Pangea has led to the formation of several major sedimentary basins and volcanic regions in Africa. These include the Southwest Indian Ridge, the South Atlantic Ocean, and the Great Rift Valley. These regions are of great interest to the petroleum industry due to their high hydrocarbon potential. Further research and exploration in these regions will continue to provide valuable insights into the geology of Africa.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Africa's role in the mid-phases of the break-up of Pangea. It will shed light on the complex geological processes that occurred in Africa during this period and their global implications. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a deeper appreciation for the African continent's geological history and its role in shaping the Earth as we know it today.




### Subsection: 7.5a Overview of the Break-up of Pangea

The break-up of Pangea, the supercontinent that existed during the Mesozoic era, was a pivotal event in the geological history of Africa. This process, which began around 200 million years ago, led to the formation of the modern continents as we know them today. The break-up of Pangea was primarily driven by plate tectonics, specifically the movement of the Earth's plates and the forces that act upon them.

#### The Formation of Pangea Proxima

The break-up of Pangea is predicted to continue until new subduction zones bring the continents back together, forming a future Pangea. This future Pangea, known as Pangea Proxima, is predicted to be formed by the collision of most continents and microcontinents with Eurasia, similar to how most continents collided with Laurentia during the formation of Pangea.

Around 50 million years from now, North America is predicted to shift west and Eurasia would shift to the east, and possibly even to the south, bringing Great Britain closer to the North Pole and Siberia southward towards warm, subtropical latitudes. Africa is predicted to collide with Europe and Arabia, closing the Mediterranean Sea (thus completely closing the Tethys Ocean (or Neotethys)) and the Red Sea. A long mountain range (the Mediterranean Mountain Range) would then extend from Iberia, across Southern Europe and into Asia. Some are even predicted to have peaks higher than Mount Everest. Similarly, Australia is predicted to beach itself past the doorstep of Southeast Asia, causing the islands to be compressed inland, forming another potential mountain range. Meanwhile, Southern and Baja California are predicted to have already collided with Alaska with new mountain ranges formed between them.

#### The Shrinking of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans

The break-up of Pangea is also predicted to result in the shrinking of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Around 125 million years from now, the Atlantic Ocean is predicted to stop widening and begin to shrink because the Mid-Atlantic Ridge will have been subducted. In this scenario, a mid-ocean ridge between South America and Africa will probably be subducted first; the Atlantic Ocean is predicted to have narrowed as a result of subduction beneath the Americas. The Indian Ocean is also predicted to be smaller due to northward subduction of oceanic crust into the Central Indian trench. Antarctica is expected to split into two and shift northwards, colliding with Madagascar and Australia, enclosing a remnant of the Indian Ocean, which Scotese calls the "Medi-Pangaean Sea".

#### The Geological Significance of the Break-up of Pangea

The break-up of Pangea has had a profound impact on the geological evolution of Africa. The collision of continents and the formation of new mountain ranges have led to significant changes in the Earth's surface, altering the landscape and creating new geological features. The break-up of Pangea has also played a crucial role in the distribution of hydrocarbons, with the formation of new sedimentary basins and volcanic activity leading to the discovery of significant hydrocarbon reserves.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the geological evolution of Africa during the break-up of Pangea, exploring the specific changes that have occurred in the continent over the past 200 million years.




### Subsection: 7.5b Geological Evolution of Africa

The geological evolution of Africa has been shaped by the break-up of Pangea, a process that began around 200 million years ago. This break-up led to the formation of the African Plate, one of the seven major plates of the Earth's lithosphere. The African Plate is home to a variety of geological features, including the Great Rift Valley, the Sahara Desert, and the Kalahari Desert.

#### The Formation of the African Plate

The African Plate was formed during the break-up of Pangea, around 180 million years ago. This process was driven by the movement of the Earth's plates and the forces that act upon them. The African Plate is bounded by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to the west, the Great Rift Valley to the east, and the Red Sea Rift to the north.

The formation of the African Plate was accompanied by the formation of the South American–Antarctic Ridge (SAAR), a mid-ocean ridge that formed as a result of the separation of South America and Antarctica from Africa. The SAAR played a crucial role in the geological evolution of Africa, as it acted as a barrier to the movement of the South American and Antarctic plates, leading to the formation of the South Atlantic Ocean.

#### The Geological Evolution of Africa

The geological evolution of Africa has been marked by a series of events, including the formation of the Great Rift Valley, the Sahara Desert, and the Kalahari Desert. These features have been shaped by the movement of the African Plate and the forces that act upon it.

The Great Rift Valley, a series of rifts and faults that run across the African continent, is one of the most prominent geological features in Africa. It was formed by the separation of the African Plate from the Arabian Plate, around 30 million years ago. This separation led to the formation of the East African Rift, a series of rifts and faults that run from the Red Sea to Mozambique.

The Sahara Desert, the largest hot desert in the world, is another important geological feature in Africa. It was formed by the movement of the African Plate, which led to the uplift of the Atlas Mountains and the formation of the Sahara Basin. The Sahara Desert is home to a variety of geological features, including sand dunes, salt flats, and ancient lake beds.

The Kalahari Desert, located in southern Africa, is another important geological feature in Africa. It was formed by the movement of the African Plate, which led to the uplift of the Kalahari Shield and the formation of the Kalahari Basin. The Kalahari Desert is home to a variety of geological features, including sand dunes, salt pans, and ancient river valleys.

In conclusion, the geological evolution of Africa has been shaped by the break-up of Pangea and the formation of the African Plate. This process has led to the formation of a variety of geological features, including the Great Rift Valley, the Sahara Desert, and the Kalahari Desert. These features have been shaped by the movement of the African Plate and the forces that act upon it, and continue to evolve as the African Plate moves and interacts with other plates.




### Subsection: 7.5c Current Understanding and Future Research

The current understanding of the geological evolution of Africa is based on a combination of field observations, remote sensing data, and geophysical studies. However, there are still many unanswered questions and areas of research that require further investigation.

#### Current Understanding

The current understanding of the geological evolution of Africa is largely based on the study of the African Plate and its boundaries. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the Great Rift Valley, and the Red Sea Rift have been extensively studied, providing valuable insights into the processes that have shaped the African continent.

The formation of the African Plate and its boundaries, particularly the South American–Antarctic Ridge (SAAR), has been a focus of research. The SAAR has been found to play a crucial role in the geological evolution of Africa, acting as a barrier to the movement of the South American and Antarctic plates and leading to the formation of the South Atlantic Ocean.

#### Future Research

Despite the significant progress made in understanding the geological evolution of Africa, there are still many areas of research that require further investigation. One such area is the study of the Great Rift Valley. While the formation of the East African Rift has been well-documented, the processes that led to the formation of the Western Rift remain largely unknown. Further research is needed to understand the timing and mechanisms of its formation.

Another area of research is the study of the Sahara Desert. The Sahara is one of the largest and most dynamic deserts in the world, and its evolution is closely tied to the geological processes that have shaped Africa. Further research is needed to understand the role of climate change and tectonic processes in the formation and evolution of the Sahara.

#### Conclusion

The geological evolution of Africa is a complex and ongoing process, shaped by a variety of factors including plate movements, climate change, and tectonic processes. While significant progress has been made in understanding the geological evolution of Africa, there are still many unanswered questions and areas of research that require further investigation. Future research will continue to deepen our understanding of the geological processes that have shaped the African continent.

### Introduction

Africa is a continent with a rich and diverse geological history, shaped by a complex interplay of tectonic forces, climate change, and biological evolution. In this chapter, we will explore the geology of Africa during the Mesozoic era, a time period spanning from approximately 250 million to 65 million years ago. This era was marked by significant changes in the Earth's climate, sea levels, and continental configurations, all of which had a profound impact on the geological processes occurring in Africa.

Throughout the Mesozoic, Africa was part of the supercontinent Pangea, which began to break up around 200 million years ago. This process of continental drift played a crucial role in shaping the geology of Africa during this time period. As the continents moved and shifted, new landforms were created, and existing ones were altered. This chapter will delve into the mechanisms of continental drift and its effects on the geology of Africa.

We will also explore the various geological events that occurred during the Mesozoic, such as the formation of the Sahara Desert, the opening of the Indian Ocean, and the rise and fall of the African Rift Valley. These events had a significant impact on the physical and biological landscapes of Africa, and their study is essential for understanding the geological history of the continent.

Finally, we will examine the role of Africa in the global carbon cycle during the Mesozoic. The continent played a crucial role in the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere, land, and ocean, and its study can provide valuable insights into the Earth's climate system during this time period.

In this chapter, we will use a combination of geological data, field observations, and computer simulations to paint a comprehensive picture of the geology of Africa during the Mesozoic era. By the end, readers will have a deeper understanding of the complex and dynamic nature of the Earth's geological processes and their impact on the continent of Africa.

 8.1: The Geological Evolution of Africa during the Mesozoic Era

The Mesozoic era was a time of significant change in the Earth's history, marked by the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea and the formation of new landforms and ecosystems. Africa, as part of Pangea, played a crucial role in these processes, and its geological evolution during this time period is a fascinating and complex topic.

#### 8.1a: Early Mesozoic Geology of Africa

The Early Mesozoic era, spanning from approximately 250 to 190 million years ago, was a time of intense volcanic activity in Africa. This was due to the ongoing process of continental drift, as the African plate moved away from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and began to experience rifting and the formation of new landforms.

One of the most significant events during this time period was the formation of the Sahara Desert. As the African plate moved northward, it began to experience increased aridity, leading to the development of a vast and barren landscape. This was also due to the uplift of the Atlas Mountains, which blocked moisture from reaching the interior of the continent.

The Early Mesozoic was also marked by the opening of the Indian Ocean, as the African and Indian plates began to separate. This led to the formation of the Deccan Traps, a large igneous province (LIP) that covers much of western India. The Deccan Traps are believed to have been formed by the eruption of basaltic magma, and their formation had a significant impact on the Earth's climate and carbon cycle.

In addition to these major events, the Early Mesozoic also saw the rise and fall of the African Rift Valley. This rift system, which extends from the Red Sea to the Great Rift Valley in East Africa, was formed by the separation of the African and Arabian plates. However, it later became inactive and was replaced by the East African Rift, which is still active today.

The geological processes occurring in Africa during the Early Mesozoic had a profound impact on the continent's physical and biological landscapes. The formation of the Sahara Desert led to the extinction of many plant and animal species, while the opening of the Indian Ocean allowed for the exchange of species between Africa and India. The Deccan Traps also played a crucial role in the Earth's carbon cycle, as they were a significant source of carbon dioxide emissions.

In conclusion, the Early Mesozoic was a time of significant geological change in Africa, shaped by the ongoing process of continental drift and the formation of new landforms. The events that occurred during this time period had a lasting impact on the continent's geology and continue to shape its landscape today.

It led to the formation of new landforms, such as the Skeleton Coast and the Namib Desert, and the redirection of ocean currents, influencing the continent's climate and biodiversity. It also played a crucial role in the evolution of Africa's mineral resources, shaping the distribution and abundance of various mineral deposits.

In this chapter, we will explore these topics in detail, providing a comprehensive understanding of the opening of the South Atlantic and its significance for Africa's geology. We will also discuss the ongoing research in this field, highlighting the latest findings and future directions. By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the opening of the South Atlantic and its role in shaping Africa's geological landscape.




### Subsection: 8.1a Overview of the South Atlantic

The South Atlantic is a vast ocean basin that lies between the African and South American continents. It is a region of great geological diversity, with a complex history of tectonic activity and ocean currents. The opening of the South Atlantic, which occurred approximately 130 million years ago, was a pivotal event in the geological evolution of Africa.

The opening of the South Atlantic was a result of the separation of the African and South American continents, a process known as continental drift. This separation was driven by the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, which are large pieces of the Earth's crust that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere. The separation of the continents allowed the Atlantic Ocean to expand and form, creating the South Atlantic.

The opening of the South Atlantic had profound implications for Africa's geological landscape. It led to the formation of new landforms, such as the Skeleton Coast and the Namib Desert, and the redirection of ocean currents, influencing the continent's climate and biodiversity. It also played a crucial role in the evolution of Africa's mineral resources, shaping the distribution and abundance of various mineral deposits.

The South Atlantic is also home to a variety of marine life, including a diverse array of fish, marine mammals, and seabirds. The ocean floor of the South Atlantic is largely covered by sedimentary rocks, with some areas showing evidence of volcanic activity. The ocean floor also features a variety of underwater topography, including seamounts, ridges, and valleys.

The South Atlantic is also a region of significant economic importance. It is home to large oil and gas reserves, and is a major shipping route for goods and commodities. The opening of the South Atlantic has played a crucial role in the economic development of Africa, providing access to new resources and trade routes.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the tectonic evolution of the South Atlantic, exploring the processes that led to its formation and the ongoing geological activity in the region. We will also examine the impact of the South Atlantic on Africa's geological landscape, including its role in shaping the continent's climate, biodiversity, and mineral resources.




### Subsection: 8.1b Tectonic Evolution

The tectonic evolution of the South Atlantic is a complex and ongoing process that has shaped the geological landscape of Africa. The opening of the South Atlantic, which occurred approximately 130 million years ago, was a pivotal event in this evolution. It was a result of the separation of the African and South American continents, a process known as continental drift.

The separation of the continents allowed the Atlantic Ocean to expand and form, creating the South Atlantic. This expansion was driven by the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, which are large pieces of the Earth's crust that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere. The separation of the continents also led to the formation of new landforms, such as the Skeleton Coast and the Namib Desert, and the redirection of ocean currents, influencing the continent's climate and biodiversity.

The tectonic evolution of the South Atlantic has also played a crucial role in the evolution of Africa's mineral resources. It has shaped the distribution and abundance of various mineral deposits, including gold, diamonds, and uranium. The ongoing tectonic activity in the region continues to influence the formation and redistribution of these mineral resources.

The tectonic evolution of the South Atlantic is also closely linked to the theory of plate tectonics. This theory demonstrates that the continents of the Earth are moving across the surface at the rate of a few centimeters per year. This movement is facilitated by two factors: the energy generated within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt.

The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction for at least the next 1.1 billion years. This means that the continents of North and South America will continue to move westward from Africa and Europe, as predicted by various geodynamic models. These models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic Ocean becomes preferentially subducted, leading to the formation of a new oceanic crust on the eastern margin of the continent.

In conclusion, the tectonic evolution of the South Atlantic is a complex and ongoing process that has shaped the geological landscape of Africa. It has influenced the distribution of mineral resources, the formation of new landforms, and the redirection of ocean currents. The ongoing tectonic activity in the region will continue to shape the geological landscape of Africa in the future.

### Subsection: 8.3a Overview of Magmatism and Volcanism

The opening of the South Atlantic Ocean has been a significant event in the geological history of Africa. It has led to the formation of new landforms and the redistribution of sedimentary deposits, as well as the preservation of a rich fossil record. In this section, we will explore the role of magmatism and volcanism in the opening of the South Atlantic, focusing on the Alert Bay Volcanic Belt and the Chilcotin Group.

#### The Alert Bay Volcanic Belt

The Alert Bay Volcanic Belt, located on Vancouver Island, Canada, is a prime example of the volcanic activity that occurred during the opening of the South Atlantic. The belt encompasses several separate remnants of late Neogene volcanic piles and related intrusions, ranging in composition from basalt to rhyolite and in age from about eight million years old in the west to about 3.5 million years old elsewhere.

The volcanic activity in the Alert Bay Volcanic Belt was characterized by two different basalt-andesite-dacite-rhyolite suites with divergent fractionation trends. The first suite coincides with the typical calc-alkaline, Cascade trend, while the other is more alkaline and more Fe-enriched, following a trend which straddles the calc-alkaline-tholeiite boundary. This volcanic activity was likely triggered by the adjustment of plate motion and changes in the locus of volcanism along the Pemberton and Garibaldi volcanic belts.

#### The Chilcotin Group

The Chilcotin Group, a large igneous province and volcanic plateau in south-central British Columbia, is another example of the volcanic activity that occurred during the opening of the South Atlantic. The group consists of thin, flat-lying, poorly formed columnar basalt lava flows that have formed as a result of partial melting in a weak zone in the upper part of the Earth's mantle within a back-arc basin related to subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate.

The Chilcotin Group volcanism occurred in three distant magmatic episodes, the first 16-14 million years ago, the second 10-6 million years ago, and the third 3-1 million years ago. This volcanic activity was likely triggered by the opening of the South Atlantic and the subsequent changes in plate motion and the locus of volcanism.

In conclusion, the opening of the South Atlantic was a significant event in the geological history of Africa, leading to the formation of new landforms and the redistribution of sedimentary deposits, as well as the preservation of a rich fossil record. The volcanic activity that occurred during this event, as seen in the Alert Bay Volcanic Belt and the Chilcotin Group, provides valuable insights into the geological processes that shaped the region.




### Subsection: 8.3b Major Magmatic and Volcanic Activity in the South Atlantic

The opening of the South Atlantic Ocean has been a significant event in the geological history of Africa. It has led to the formation of new landforms and the redistribution of sedimentary deposits, as well as the preservation of a rich fossil record. In this section, we will explore the role of magmatism and volcanism in the opening of the South Atlantic, focusing on the major magmatic and volcanic activity that has occurred in the region.

#### The Southwest Indian Ridge

The Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) is a mid-ocean ridge located in the southwestern Indian Ocean. It is a site of major magmatic and volcanic activity, with a history of rifting and spreading that has been ongoing for millions of years. The SWIR is characterized by a series of transform faults and magnetic anomalies, which provide valuable insights into the geological processes occurring in the region.

The SWIR is segmented into several major faults, including the Marion hotspot, the Gallieni FZ, and the Melville FZ. These faults are characterized by varying axial depths, with the Melville FZ and Rodrigues TJ having the deepest axial depths and the Andrew Bain FZ and Discovery FZ having the shallowest. This variation in depth is likely due to the interaction of the SWIR with the Crozet hotspot, which has resulted in increased magmatism and thicker crust in some sections of the ridge.

#### The Crozet Hotspot

The Crozet hotspot, located in the southwestern Indian Ocean, is a major source of magmatic and volcanic activity in the region. It is responsible for the formation of the Crozet volcanic plateau, which is characterized by a large igneous province (LIP) and a volcanic arc. The Crozet hotspot is also thought to be interacting with the SWIR, resulting in increased magmatism and thicker crust in some sections of the ridge.

The Crozet hotspot is located more than 1000 km from the SWIR, which is thought to be too far for significant ridge-hotspot interaction. However, the Kerguelen and Réunion hotspots, which are located closer to the SWIR, are thought to be interacting with the Southeast Indian Ridge and Central Indian Ridge. This interaction is suggested by volcanic chains and lineaments connecting these ridges and hotspots.

#### The Role of Magmatism and Volcanism in the Opening of the South Atlantic

The major magmatic and volcanic activity in the South Atlantic, particularly in the SWIR and the Crozet hotspot, has played a significant role in the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean. This activity has resulted in the formation of new landforms and the redistribution of sedimentary deposits, as well as the preservation of a rich fossil record.

The interaction of the SWIR with the Crozet hotspot has resulted in increased magmatism and thicker crust in some sections of the ridge. This has likely contributed to the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean, as the increased magmatism and thicker crust would have weakened the Earth's crust and allowed for the formation of new oceanic crust.

In conclusion, the major magmatic and volcanic activity in the South Atlantic, particularly in the SWIR and the Crozet hotspot, has played a crucial role in the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean. This activity has resulted in the formation of new landforms and the preservation of a rich fossil record, making it a significant event in the geological history of Africa.

## Chapter 9: The Geological Evolution of Africa

 9.1: The Early Geological History of Africa

The African continent has a rich and complex geological history, shaped by a variety of tectonic forces, climate change, and biological processes. In this section, we will explore the early geological history of Africa, from its formation as a supercontinent to its current state as a collection of diverse and dynamic regions.

#### 9.1a: Early Geological Events

The African continent is believed to have formed around 3.5 billion years ago, during the Precambrian era. At this time, the continent was part of the supercontinent Pangea, which also included North America, South America, and Eurasia. As Pangea began to break up around 200 million years ago, Africa began to separate from the other continents.

One of the earliest geological events to shape Africa was the formation of the Atlas range, a mountain range that stretches across northern Africa. This range is believed to have formed around 300 million years ago, as a result of the collision of the African and Eurasian plates. The Atlas range is home to some of the highest peaks in Africa, including Mount Toubkal in Morocco and Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.

Another significant event in the early geological history of Africa was the formation of the Great Rift Valley. This valley, which runs from the Red Sea to Mozambique, is believed to have formed around 25 million years ago as a result of the separation of the African and Arabian plates. The Great Rift Valley is home to a variety of geological features, including volcanic lakes, hot springs, and geysers.

The early geological history of Africa was also shaped by climate change. Around 3.2 billion years ago, the continent experienced a period of intense volcanic activity, known as the Great Oxidation Event. This event is believed to have been caused by an increase in atmospheric oxygen, which allowed for the development of more complex forms of life.

In addition to these major events, the early geological history of Africa was also marked by smaller-scale processes, such as the formation of sedimentary rocks and the movement of faults. These processes have played a crucial role in shaping the geological landscape of Africa, and continue to do so today.

In the next section, we will explore the geological history of Africa from the Cretaceous period to the present day, examining the formation of the Sahara desert, the rise and fall of ancient lakes and rivers, and the impact of human activities on the geological landscape of Africa.

This event is believed to have been caused by an increase in atmospheric oxygen, which allowed for the development of more complex forms of life.

### Subsection 9.1b: Early Life on Earth

The early geological history of Africa is closely tied to the development of life on Earth. As the continent began to form, it provided a stable environment for the emergence of life. The first evidence of life on Earth can be traced back to around 3.5 billion years ago, with the discovery of microbial life in ancient rocks in Australia.

Around 3.2 billion years ago, the Great Oxidation Event occurred, which led to an increase in atmospheric oxygen and allowed for the development of more complex forms of life. This event is believed to have been driven by the release of carbon dioxide from volcanic activity, which caused an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. As the carbon dioxide was absorbed by the oceans, it led to an increase in ocean acidity, which in turn led to an increase in atmospheric oxygen levels.

The early geological history of Africa also played a crucial role in the development of life on Earth. The formation of the Atlas range and the Great Rift Valley provided a diverse range of habitats for early life forms to thrive in. The Atlas range, with its high peaks and valleys, provided a variety of microhabitats for organisms to adapt to, while the Great Rift Valley provided a source of nutrients and energy for early life forms.

In addition to its role in the development of life on Earth, the early geological history of Africa also has implications for the current state of the continent. The formation of the Atlas range and the Great Rift Valley has had a lasting impact on the geological landscape of Africa, shaping the physical features and resources of the continent.

In the next section, we will explore the later geological history of Africa, from the Cretaceous period to the present day. We will examine how the continent has continued to evolve and shape the world around us.

## Structure

The ACC connects the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, and serves as a principal pathway of exchange among them. The current is strongly constrained by landform and bathymetric features. To trace it starting arbitrarily at South America, it flows through the Drake Passage between South America and the Antarctic Peninsula and then is split by the Scotia Arc to the east, with a shallow warm branch flowing to the north in the Falkland Current and a deeper branch passing through the Arc more to the east before also turning to the north. Passing through the Indian Ocean, the current first retroflects the Agulhas Current to form the Agulhas Return Current before it is split by the Kerguelen Plateau, and then moving northward again. Deflection is also seen as it passes over the mid-ocean ridge in the Southeast Pacific.

### Fronts

The current is accompanied by three fronts: the Subantarctic front (SAF), the Polar front (PF), and the Southern ACC front (SACC). Furthermore, the waters of the Southern Ocean are separated from the warmer and saltier subtropical waters by the subtropical front (STF).

The northern boundary of the ACC is defined by the northern edge of the SAF, this being the most northerly water to pass through Drake Passage and therefore be circumpolar. Much of the ACC transport is carried in this front, which is defined as the latitude at which a subsurface salinity minimum or a thick layer of unstratified Subantarctic mode water first appears, allowed by temperature dominating density stratification. Still further south lies the PF, which is marked by a transition to very cold, relatively fresh, Antarctic Surface Water at the surface. Here a temperature minimum is allowed by salinity dominating density stratification, due to the lower temperatures. Farther south still is the SACC, which is determined as the southernmost

## Chapter 9: The Opening of the South Atlantic:




### Introduction

The opening of the South Atlantic is a significant event in the geological history of Africa. It is a process that has been ongoing for millions of years, and its effects can still be seen in the physical, climatic, and biological aspects of the continent. In this section, we will delve deeper into the tectonic significance of the South Atlantic opening, exploring its role in shaping the geology of Africa.

The opening of the South Atlantic is primarily driven by plate tectonics, specifically the movement of the African and South American plates. As these plates move apart, the oceanic crust of the South Atlantic is created, and the continent of Africa begins to drift westward. This movement has been responsible for the formation of various geological features, such as the Congo Basin and the African Rift System.

The opening of the South Atlantic has also had a profound impact on the climate of Africa. The increased oceanic influence brought about by the opening of the South Atlantic has led to the development of a more humid climate, which has in turn supported the growth of diverse ecosystems. This has also influenced the distribution of biodiversity on the continent, with many species adapting to the changing climate and environment.

Furthermore, the South Atlantic opening has also played a crucial role in the global ocean circulation. The formation of the South Atlantic Current has allowed for the transport of warm water from the tropics to the North Atlantic, influencing global climate patterns. This has had far-reaching effects, not only on Africa but also on other continents and regions around the world.

In this section, we will explore these topics in more detail, examining the various factors that have contributed to the opening of the South Atlantic and its impact on the geology of Africa. We will also discuss the current understanding of this process and the future research directions that may help us gain a deeper understanding of this complex phenomenon. 





### Subsection: 8.5a Post-Opening Geological Activity

The opening of the South Atlantic has had a profound impact on the geology of Africa, and its effects can still be seen in the physical, climatic, and biological aspects of the continent. In this section, we will explore the post-opening geological activity in Africa, focusing on the formation of the African Rift System and the Congo Basin.

#### The African Rift System

The African Rift System is a series of geological faults and depressions that run across the African continent. It is a direct result of the opening of the South Atlantic, as the movement of the African and South American plates has caused the African continent to split along these fault lines. This process has been ongoing for millions of years, and it continues to shape the geology of Africa today.

The African Rift System is characterized by a series of rift valleys, which are long, linear depressions that run parallel to the fault lines. These valleys are often filled with sediment and are home to a diverse range of ecosystems. The formation of these valleys has been driven by the movement of the African plate, which has caused the crust to stretch and thin, creating a low-lying area that is prone to sedimentation.

#### The Congo Basin

The Congo Basin is another significant geological feature that has been shaped by the opening of the South Atlantic. It is a large, shallow basin that covers much of central Africa. The basin is characterized by a series of sedimentary rocks, including sandstones, shales, and limestones, which have been deposited over millions of years.

The formation of the Congo Basin is closely linked to the opening of the South Atlantic. As the African and South American plates moved apart, the African continent began to drift westward, causing the Congo River to shift its course and deposit sediment in the basin. This process has been ongoing for millions of years, and it continues to shape the geology of the Congo Basin today.

#### The Impact of Post-Opening Geological Activity

The post-opening geological activity in Africa has had a significant impact on the continent's physical, climatic, and biological aspects. The formation of the African Rift System and the Congo Basin has led to the development of diverse ecosystems, including savannas, forests, and wetlands. These ecosystems are home to a wide range of species, many of which are found nowhere else on Earth.

Furthermore, the post-opening geological activity has also influenced the climate of Africa. The movement of the African plate has caused changes in the continent's topography, which has affected the distribution of precipitation and temperature. This has led to the development of a more humid climate in many parts of Africa, which has supported the growth of diverse ecosystems.

In conclusion, the post-opening geological activity in Africa has been a significant driving force behind the continent's geological evolution. The formation of the African Rift System and the Congo Basin has shaped the physical, climatic, and biological aspects of Africa, and it continues to influence the continent's geology today.

#### 9.1a Overview of the Cenozoic Era

The Cenozoic Era, spanning the last 66 million years, is a critical period in the geological history of Africa. This era is marked by significant tectonic events that have shaped the continent's landscape and influenced its mineral resources. 

The Cenozoic Era is divided into three periods: the Paleogene, the Neogene, and the Quaternary. The Paleogene Period, which we will focus on in this section, lasted from approximately 66 million years ago (Ma) to 23 Ma. 

The Paleogene Period was a time of significant continental drift. The continents continued to move towards their present positions, with the supercontinent Laurasia splitting into North America and Eurasia. Europe and Greenland were still connected, and North America and Asia were intermittently joined by a land bridge. The Laramide orogeny, which had begun in the late Cretaceous, continued to uplift the Rocky Mountains in the American west. 

In Africa, the Paleogene saw the continuation of the processes that began in the late Cretaceous. The components of the former southern supercontinent Gondwana continued to split apart, with Africa, South America, Antarctica, and Australia pulling away from each other. Africa was heading north towards Europe, slowly closing the Tethys Ocean, and India began its migration to Asia that would lead to a tectonic collision and the formation of the Himalayas.

The Paleogene also saw the rise of the Sahara Desert, which was initially a grassland savanna. The Sahara's transformation into a desert was largely due to changes in global climate patterns, including a decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. This period also saw the evolution of the African elephant and the hippopotamus, which are both iconic species of the continent.

The Paleogene was also a time of significant volcanic activity. The Deccan Traps, a large igneous province in India, erupted during the Paleogene, releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This event, known as the Deccan Traps volcanism, is thought to have contributed to the cooling of the Earth's climate and the extinction of many species at the end of the Cretaceous Period.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the geological events that shaped Africa during the Paleogene Period.

#### 9.1b Cenozoic Tectonic Events in Africa

The Cenozoic Era has been marked by a series of significant tectonic events in Africa. These events have shaped the continent's landscape, influenced its mineral resources, and played a crucial role in the evolution of African life.

One of the most significant tectonic events in Africa during the Cenozoic Era was the collision of the African and Arabian plates. This event, which occurred approximately 25 Ma, led to the formation of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The collision also resulted in the uplift of the Ethiopian Highlands, which are home to some of the oldest rocks on Earth.

The collision of the African and Arabian plates also led to the formation of the Great Rift Valley, a series of rifts and faults that run across the width of Africa. The Great Rift Valley is a site of significant geothermal activity and is home to several active volcanoes. The rift valley is also home to a variety of unique ecosystems, including the Serengeti Plains in Tanzania and the Great Rift Valley Lakes in Kenya.

Another significant tectonic event in Africa during the Cenozoic Era was the formation of the Kalahari Desert. The Kalahari Desert, which covers much of Botswana and parts of Namibia and South Africa, is the result of a series of tectonic events that began in the late Cretaceous and continued into the Paleogene. These events led to the uplift of the Kalahari Shield, a large igneous province that is home to some of the oldest rocks on Earth. The uplift of the Kalahari Shield resulted in the formation of the Kalahari Desert, one of the largest and most arid deserts on Earth.

The Cenozoic Era also saw the formation of the Sahara Desert. As mentioned in the previous section, the Sahara was initially a grassland savanna. However, changes in global climate patterns, including a decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, led to the transformation of the Sahara into a desert. The Sahara's transformation into a desert was also influenced by tectonic events, including the uplift of the Atlas Mountains in northwest Africa.

In conclusion, the Cenozoic Era has been a period of significant tectonic activity in Africa. These events have shaped the continent's landscape, influenced its mineral resources, and played a crucial role in the evolution of African life. In the next section, we will explore the geological events that shaped Africa during the Neogene Period.

#### 9.1c Impact of Cenozoic Tectonic Events on Africa

The Cenozoic tectonic events have had a profound impact on the African continent. These events have not only shaped the physical landscape of the continent but have also influenced the distribution of mineral resources and the evolution of African life.

The collision of the African and Arabian plates, which occurred approximately 25 Ma, has had a significant impact on the African continent. This event led to the formation of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, which are important trade routes connecting the Mediterranean Sea with the Indian Ocean. The uplift of the Ethiopian Highlands, which resulted from this collision, has also led to the formation of the Blue Nile, one of the main tributaries of the Nile River. This has been crucial for the development of civilizations along the Nile River, particularly in ancient Egypt.

The formation of the Great Rift Valley, another significant tectonic event in Africa during the Cenozoic Era, has also had a profound impact on the continent. The Great Rift Valley is home to a variety of unique ecosystems, including the Serengeti Plains in Tanzania and the Great Rift Valley Lakes in Kenya. These ecosystems are home to a diverse range of species, including the Big Five, a group of five African mammals that are highly sought after by hunters and tourists. The geothermal activity in the Great Rift Valley has also led to the development of geothermal energy resources, which have the potential to play a significant role in Africa's future energy production.

The formation of the Kalahari Desert, which began in the late Cretaceous and continued into the Paleogene, has also had a significant impact on the African continent. The Kalahari Desert is home to a variety of unique ecosystems, including the Kalahari Desert dunes and the Kalahari Savanna. These ecosystems are home to a diverse range of species, including the Kalahari lion, the Kalahari leopard, and the Kalahari brown hyena. The uplift of the Kalahari Shield, which resulted from this event, has also led to the formation of significant mineral resources, including diamonds and copper.

In conclusion, the Cenozoic tectonic events have had a profound impact on the African continent. These events have shaped the physical landscape of the continent, influenced the distribution of mineral resources, and played a crucial role in the evolution of African life. Understanding these events is crucial for understanding the geological history of Africa and the processes that have shaped the continent over millions of years.




#### 9.1b Major Tectonic Events in Africa

The Cenozoic Era has been marked by a series of major tectonic events in Africa, which have significantly shaped the continent's geology and mineral resources. These events include the formation of the South American–Antarctic Ridge, the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean, and the development of the Drake Passage.

##### Formation of the South American–Antarctic Ridge

The break-up of Gondwana, which began in the Mid- to Late Jurassic, led to the formation of the South American–Antarctic Ridge (SAAR). This ridge formed a continuous structure together with the Southwest Indian Ridge, separating the South American and African plates. The SAAR played a crucial role in the tectonic evolution of Africa, influencing the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean and the development of the Drake Passage.

##### Opening of the South Atlantic Ocean

The opening of the South Atlantic Ocean is another significant tectonic event in Africa. This event began around 106 Ma, when the eastern end of the Falkland Plateau separated from the Agulhas Bank, opening the South Atlantic. However, the South Atlantic remained an enclosed basin north of the Falkland Plateau until 85–83 Ma. The opening of the South Atlantic was facilitated by the movement of the Bouvet hotspot, which formed the Southern Ocean Large Igneous Province (112–93 Ma).

##### Development of the Drake Passage

The development of the Drake Passage is a key tectonic event in the history of Africa. This event was initiated by the opening of small extensional basins south of Tierra del Fuego around 49 Ma. The opening of the Drake Passage was accompanied by an increase in the spreading rate from 0.3 cm/yr to 2.4 cm/yr. This event marked a significant shift in the Antarctic–South American plate motion, which changed from north to north-west during this period.

The development of the Drake Passage had profound implications for the geology of Africa. It led to the formation of the Scotia Plate, which started to develop in the Mid-Tertiary. The Drake Passage also played a crucial role in the global climate system, contributing to the cooling of the Earth's climate and the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the world's largest ocean current.

In conclusion, the Cenozoic Era has been marked by a series of major tectonic events in Africa, which have significantly shaped the continent's geology and mineral resources. These events include the formation of the South American–Antarctic Ridge, the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean, and the development of the Drake Passage. Understanding these events is crucial for understanding the geological history of Africa and its mineral resources.

#### 9.1c Cenozoic Volcanism in Africa

The Cenozoic Era has been marked by significant volcanic activity in Africa, particularly in the Great Rift Valley. This volcanism has been driven by the movement of the Nubian Plate, which has been drifting northward relative to the African Plate since the Early Cretaceous. This relative motion has led to the formation of the Great Rift Valley, a series of rifts and grabens that extend from the Red Sea to Mozambique.

##### The Great Rift Valley

The Great Rift Valley is a prominent feature of the African landscape, extending over 8,000 km. It is a series of rifts and grabens that have been formed by the separation of the Nubian Plate from the African Plate. This separation has been driven by the movement of the Red Sea Plate, which has been moving northward relative to the African Plate since the Early Cretaceous.

The Great Rift Valley is characterized by a series of volcanic features, including volcanic cones, calderas, and lava flows. These features have been formed by the eruption of basaltic magmas, which have been generated by the melting of the mantle beneath the Great Rift Valley.

##### The Cenozoic Volcanic Province

The Cenozoic Volcanic Province is a large igneous province (LIP) that extends across the African continent. It is one of the largest LIPs on Earth, covering an area of over 8 million km². The Cenozoic Volcanic Province is characterized by the eruption of large volumes of basaltic magmas, which have been generated by the melting of the mantle beneath the African continent.

The Cenozoic Volcanic Province has been active since the Early Cretaceous, and it has been responsible for the formation of a large number of volcanic features across Africa. These features include the Great Rift Valley, the Ethiopian Rift, the Kenyan Rift, and the Tanzanian Rift.

##### The Cenozoic Volcanic Province and the Great Rift Valley

The Cenozoic Volcanic Province and the Great Rift Valley are closely linked. The relative motion of the Nubian Plate and the African Plate has led to the formation of the Great Rift Valley, which has been filled with volcanic rocks from the Cenozoic Volcanic Province.

The Cenozoic Volcanic Province has been responsible for the eruption of large volumes of basaltic magmas, which have been generated by the melting of the mantle beneath the African continent. These magmas have been responsible for the formation of the Great Rift Valley, which is characterized by a series of volcanic features, including volcanic cones, calderas, and lava flows.

In conclusion, the Cenozoic Era has been marked by significant volcanic activity in Africa, particularly in the Great Rift Valley. This volcanism has been driven by the movement of the Nubian Plate and the Cenozoic Volcanic Province, which have been responsible for the formation of a large number of volcanic features across Africa.

#### 9.2a Early Cenozoic Climate Change

The Early Cenozoic Era, spanning from 66 to 40 million years ago, was a period of significant climate change in Africa. This era was marked by a shift from a warm, humid climate to a cooler, drier climate, which had profound implications for the continent's geology and biology.

##### Early Cenozoic Climate

The Early Cenozoic climate was characterized by high temperatures and high levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. These conditions were largely due to the ongoing volcanic activity of the Cenozoic Volcanic Province, which released large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This greenhouse effect led to a warmer climate, with average temperatures in Africa being significantly higher than they are today.

##### Climate Change in the Early Cenozoic

The Early Cenozoic climate change was driven by a combination of factors, including changes in solar radiation, changes in the Earth's orbit, and changes in the Earth's magnetic field. These factors led to a decrease in the Earth's average temperature, which was exacerbated by the ongoing volcanic activity of the Cenozoic Volcanic Province.

The decrease in temperature led to a shift in the distribution of land and sea, with the continents moving towards their present positions. This movement led to the closure of the Tethys Ocean, which had separated Africa from Europe and Asia during the Mesozoic Era. The closure of the Tethys Ocean led to a decrease in sea levels, which exposed large areas of the seafloor, including the Selli Event.

##### The Selli Event

The Selli Event, named after the Selli Event Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE1a), was a period of intense marine productivity that occurred during the Early Cenozoic. This event was triggered by the release of carbon dioxide from volcanic activity, which led to a drop in the pH of seawater and a decrease in carbonate saturation. These conditions favored the growth of certain types of plankton, leading to a spike in marine productivity.

The Selli Event had significant implications for the geology of Africa. The increase in marine productivity led to an increase in sedimentation, which led to the formation of large sedimentary basins across the continent. These basins have been a major source of hydrocarbons, making them an important target for oil and gas exploration.

In conclusion, the Early Cenozoic was a period of significant climate change in Africa, driven by a combination of factors including ongoing volcanic activity and changes in the Earth's orbit and magnetic field. This climate change had profound implications for the continent's geology and biology, leading to the formation of large sedimentary basins and a spike in marine productivity.

#### 9.2b Middle Cenozoic Climate Change

The Middle Cenozoic Era, spanning from 40 to 23 million years ago, was another period of significant climate change in Africa. This era was marked by a gradual cooling of the climate, which was accompanied by a decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.

##### Middle Cenozoic Climate

The Middle Cenozoic climate was still relatively warm, but it was significantly cooler than the Early Cenozoic. This cooling was largely due to a decrease in volcanic activity, which led to a decrease in the amount of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere. However, the climate was still warmer than it is today, with average temperatures in Africa being significantly higher than they are today.

##### Climate Change in the Middle Cenozoic

The Middle Cenozoic climate change was driven by a combination of factors, including changes in solar radiation, changes in the Earth's orbit, and changes in the Earth's magnetic field. These factors led to a decrease in the Earth's average temperature, which was exacerbated by the ongoing volcanic activity of the Cenozoic Volcanic Province.

The decrease in temperature led to a further shift in the distribution of land and sea, with the continents continuing to move towards their present positions. This movement led to the closure of the Tethys Ocean, which had separated Africa from Europe and Asia during the Mesozoic Era. The closure of the Tethys Ocean led to a decrease in sea levels, which exposed large areas of the seafloor, including the Selli Event.

##### The Selli Event

The Selli Event, named after the Selli Event Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE1a), was a period of intense marine productivity that occurred during the Early Cenozoic. This event was triggered by the release of carbon dioxide from volcanic activity, which led to a drop in the pH of seawater and a decrease in carbonate saturation. These conditions favored the growth of certain types of plankton, leading to a spike in marine productivity.

The Selli Event had significant implications for the geology of Africa. The increase in marine productivity led to an increase in sedimentation, which led to the formation of large sedimentary basins across the continent. These basins have been a major source of hydrocarbons, making them an important target for oil and gas exploration.

##### Late Cenozoic Climate Change

The Late Cenozoic Era, spanning from 23 million years ago to the present, has been marked by a continued cooling of the climate, which has been accompanied by a further decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. This cooling has been driven by a decrease in volcanic activity, which has led to a decrease in the amount of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere.

The Late Cenozoic climate change has been characterized by a series of glacial and interglacial periods, with the current interglacial period being the Holocene. These periods have been driven by changes in the Earth's orbit and the Earth's magnetic field, which have led to changes in the Earth's average temperature.

The Late Cenozoic climate change has had significant implications for the geology of Africa. The cooling of the climate has led to the formation of large ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere, which have led to changes in sea levels and the distribution of land and sea. These changes have led to the formation of new sedimentary basins across the continent, which have been a major source of hydrocarbons.

#### 9.2c Late Cenozoic Climate Change

The Late Cenozoic Era, spanning from 23 million years ago to the present, has been marked by a continued cooling of the climate, which has been accompanied by a further decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. This cooling has been driven by a decrease in volcanic activity, which has led to a decrease in the amount of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere.

#### 9.1c Impact on African Geology

The tectonic events that have shaped Africa over the past 30 million years have had a profound impact on the continent's geology. These events have influenced the distribution of mineral resources, the formation of geological structures, and the evolution of the African landscape.

##### Mineral Resources

The tectonic events have significantly influenced the distribution of mineral resources in Africa. The formation of the South American–Antarctic Ridge (SAAR) and the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean have led to the concentration of mineral resources in certain regions. For instance, the SAAR has been associated with the formation of large igneous provinces (LIPs), which are known for their rich mineral deposits. The opening of the South Atlantic Ocean, on the other hand, has led to the formation of sedimentary basins that are rich in hydrocarbons.

##### Geological Structures

The tectonic events have also played a crucial role in the formation of geological structures in Africa. The opening of the South Atlantic Ocean, for instance, has led to the formation of the South Atlantic Magma Body (SAMB), a large igneous province that has been associated with the formation of the African Shield. The development of the Drake Passage, on the other hand, has led to the formation of the Scotia Plateau, a large igneous province that has been linked to the formation of the South Atlantic Anomaly.

### Subsection: 9.2a Overview of Cenozoic Climate Changes

The Cenozoic era, spanning from 66 million years ago to the present, has been a period of significant climate change in Africa. These changes have been driven by a variety of factors, including tectonic events, changes in atmospheric composition, and orbital effects.

#### 9.2a Overview of Cenozoic Climate Changes

The Cenozoic era is divided into three periods: the Paleocene, the Eocene, and the Oligocene. Each of these periods has been marked by distinct climate changes.

During the Paleocene, the Earth experienced a period of global warming, with temperatures rising to levels that were significantly higher than those of the present day. This warming was likely driven by an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, which were estimated to be between 1000 and 1200 ppm during this period. The warming led to the formation of a large ice sheet in Antarctica, which began to melt around 50 million years ago.

The Eocene period, which lasted from 56 to 34 million years ago, was marked by a period of cooling. This cooling was likely driven by a decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, which fell to around 800 ppm. Despite this cooling, the Earth remained warmer than it is today, with temperatures estimated to be around 10°C higher than present-day levels.

The Oligocene period, which lasted from 34 to 23 million years ago, was marked by a further cooling, with temperatures falling to around 5°C higher than present-day levels. This cooling was likely driven by a decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to around 400 ppm.

The Cenozoic era also saw the development of the African Monsoon, a large-scale atmospheric circulation pattern that brings rain to the African continent. The African Monsoon has played a crucial role in shaping the climate of Africa, influencing everything from the distribution of vegetation to the timing of the wet and dry seasons.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the specific climate changes that occurred during the Cenozoic era, examining the factors that drove these changes and their impact on the African continent.




### Subsection: 9.2b Climate Changes in Africa

The African continent has experienced significant climate changes over the past 30 million years, largely driven by the interplay of tectonic events, changes in atmospheric composition, and orbital effects. These changes have had profound implications for the continent's geology, ecology, and human populations.

#### 9.2b Climate Changes in Africa

The African continent has experienced a complex interplay of climate changes over the past 30 million years. These changes have been driven by a variety of factors, including tectonic events, changes in atmospheric composition, and orbital effects.

During the Paleocene, the Earth experienced a period of global warming, with temperatures rising to levels that were significantly higher than those of the present day. This warming was likely driven by an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, which were estimated to be between 1000 and 1200 ppm during this period. The warming led to the formation of a large ice sheet in Antarctica, which began to melt around 50 million years ago.

The Eocene period, which lasted from 56 to 34 million years ago, was marked by a period of cooling. This cooling was likely driven by a decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, which fell to around 800 ppm. Despite this cooling, the Earth remained warmer than it is today, with temperatures estimated to be around 10°C higher than present-day levels.

The Oligocene period, which lasted from 34 to 23 million years ago, was marked by a further cooling, with temperatures falling to around 5°C higher than present-day levels. This cooling was likely driven by a decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to around 400 ppm.

The Cenozoic era also saw the development of the African Monsoon, a large-scale atmospheric circulation pattern that brings rain to the African continent. The African Monsoon has played a crucial role in shaping the climate of Africa, influencing everything from the distribution of vegetation to the timing of the wet and dry seasons.

The African continent has also experienced significant changes in precipitation patterns over the past 30 million years. During the Paleocene and Eocene, the continent was largely arid, with only small areas of vegetation in the south. However, during the Oligocene, the continent experienced a period of increased precipitation, leading to the development of a more diverse ecosystem.

The African continent has also experienced significant changes in sea level over the past 30 million years. During the Paleocene and Eocene, sea levels were generally higher than they are today, with the continent largely submerged. However, during the Oligocene, sea levels began to fall, leading to the emergence of the African continent.

These climate changes have had profound implications for the geology of Africa. The increased temperatures and precipitation during the Paleocene and Eocene led to the formation of large sedimentary basins, which have been a major source of hydrocarbons for the continent. The cooling and drying of the continent during the Oligocene led to the formation of extensive lava flows, which have been a major source of igneous rocks for the continent.

In conclusion, the African continent has experienced a complex interplay of climate changes over the past 30 million years, driven by a variety of factors. These changes have had profound implications for the continent's geology, ecology, and human populations.




### Subsection: 9.2c Geological Significance

The geological significance of the climate changes that have occurred in Africa over the past 30 million years cannot be overstated. These changes have had profound implications for the continent's geology, ecology, and human populations.

#### 9.2c Geological Significance

The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), a period of global warming that occurred around 56 million years ago, is a prime example of the geological significance of climate changes. The PETM was characterized by a rapid increase in temperature, likely driven by an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. This event led to significant changes in the Earth's climate system, including the formation of a large ice sheet in Antarctica and the development of a large-scale atmospheric circulation pattern known as the African Monsoon.

The African Monsoon, which brings rain to the African continent, has played a crucial role in shaping the continent's geology. The monsoon has influenced the distribution of vegetation and the formation of soils, which in turn have affected the continent's ecology and human populations. The monsoon has also played a key role in the formation of sedimentary rocks, which are a major component of the African continent's geology.

The Oligocene cooling, which occurred around 34 million years ago, is another example of the geological significance of climate changes. This cooling was likely driven by a decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, which fell to around 400 ppm. This event led to significant changes in the Earth's climate system, including the development of new landforms and the extinction of certain species.

The geological significance of these climate changes extends beyond the African continent. The PETM, for example, has been used as a model for understanding the potential impacts of anthropogenic climate change. The PETM provides a glimpse into a future where atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are significantly higher than they are today, and it underscores the need for urgent action to reduce our carbon footprint.

In conclusion, the climate changes that have occurred in Africa over the past 30 million years have had profound implications for the continent's geology, ecology, and human populations. They serve as a reminder of the interconnectedness of the Earth's systems and the need for a comprehensive understanding of these systems.

### Subsection: 9.4a Overview of Tectonic Controls

The African continent is a fascinating study in geology, with its complex history of tectonic activity. The continent's geological evolution has been shaped by a variety of tectonic controls, including plate tectonics, mantle plumes, and the African Rift System. These controls have influenced the continent's topography, climate, and the distribution of its mineral resources.

#### 9.4a.1 Plate Tectonics

Plate tectonics is a fundamental concept in geology, and it plays a crucial role in the geological evolution of Africa. The African continent is part of the African Plate, one of the world's seven major tectonic plates. The African Plate is bounded by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to the west, the Red Sea Rift to the northeast, and the Great Rift Valley to the east.

The African Plate is a stable plate, meaning it is not currently involved in any plate boundaries. However, it has a complex history of plate interactions. For example, the African Plate was once part of the supercontinent Pangea, but it has since separated from other continents and drifted westward. This movement has been facilitated by the energy generated within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere, as predicted by the theory of plate tectonics.

#### 9.4a.2 Mantle Plumes

Mantle plumes are another important tectonic control in Africa. These are columns of hot material that rise from the Earth's mantle to the surface. They are believed to be responsible for the formation of hotspots, such as the Great Rift Valley and the Red Sea.

The African continent is home to several hotspots, including the Great Rift Valley, the Red Sea, and the Afar Triangle. These hotspots are believed to be the result of mantle plumes, which have been active for at least the last 30 million years. The activity of these hotspots has had a profound impact on the geology of Africa, influencing the formation of volcanic features and the distribution of mineral resources.

#### 9.4a.3 African Rift System

The African Rift System is a network of rifts and faults that extend across the continent. It is one of the most significant geological features in Africa, and it has been the site of intense geological activity. The African Rift System is believed to be the result of the separation of the African Plate from other continents, and it has been a major factor in the geological evolution of Africa.

The African Rift System is characterized by a series of rifts and faults, including the Great Rift Valley, the Red Sea Rift, and the East African Rift. These features have been the site of intense volcanic activity, and they have played a crucial role in the formation of the continent's topography and mineral resources.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these tectonic controls, exploring their history, their impact on the geology of Africa, and their implications for the future.

The Cenozoic Era has had a profound impact on the geology of Africa. This era, which began approximately 66 million years ago, has been marked by significant changes in the Earth's climate, sea levels, and tectonic activity. These changes have shaped the African continent in profound ways, influencing everything from the distribution of mineral resources to the formation of major geological features.

#### Climate Change and Sea Level Rise

One of the most significant impacts of the Cenozoic Era on African geology has been the rise in sea levels. As the Earth's climate warmed, glaciers melted, and sea levels rose, flooding low-lying areas and creating new coastlines. This rise in sea levels has been particularly significant in Africa, where it has led to the formation of new sedimentary basins and the expansion of existing ones.

The rise in sea levels has also had a profound impact on the distribution of mineral resources in Africa. Many of the continent's mineral deposits, including oil and gas, are found in sedimentary basins. The expansion of these basins due to sea level rise has led to an increase in the availability of these resources, making Africa one of the world's leading producers of oil and gas.

#### Tectonic Activity

The Cenozoic Era has also been marked by significant tectonic activity in Africa. This activity has been driven by the movement of the Earth's plates, which have reshaped the continent's landmass and created major geological features such as the Great Rift Valley.

The Great Rift Valley, a series of faults and valleys that run along the eastern edge of the African continent, is one of the most significant geological features in Africa. It is believed to have formed as a result of the separation of the African and Arabian plates, which began during the Cenozoic Era. This separation has led to the formation of a series of rifts and faults, which have created a unique habitat for a variety of plant and animal species.

#### Human Impact

Human activity has also had a significant impact on the geology of Africa. The extraction of minerals and other natural resources has led to significant changes in the landscape, including the creation of open-pit mines and the removal of topsoil. These activities have not only altered the physical appearance of the landscape but have also had a profound impact on the ecosystems that depend on it.

In addition to mineral extraction, human activity has also led to the pollution of groundwater and aquifers in Africa. This pollution has been primarily caused by the use of hazardous substances in mining operations, which have contaminated water sources and made them unsuitable for human consumption.

Despite these impacts, there have been efforts to mitigate the negative effects of human activity on the geology of Africa. For example, some mining companies have implemented sustainable practices, such as reforestation and the use of recycled water, to minimize their impact on the environment.

In conclusion, the Cenozoic Era has had a profound impact on the geology of Africa.

### Subsection: 10.1a Introduction to Rift Systems

The African continent is home to some of the most significant geological features on Earth, including the Great Rift Valley and the East African Rift System. These rift systems have played a crucial role in shaping the continent's geology and have been the subject of extensive research by geologists and paleontologists.

#### The Great Rift Valley

The Great Rift Valley is a series of rift valleys and fault lines that run along the eastern edge of the African continent. It is one of the most prominent geological features on Earth, stretching from the Red Sea in the north to the Zambezi River in the south. The valley is characterized by a series of faults, or cracks, in the Earth's crust, which have led to the formation of deep valleys and lakes.

The Great Rift Valley is believed to have formed as a result of the separation of the African and Arabian plates, which began approximately 30 million years ago. As the plates moved apart, the crust in the region was stretched and thinned, leading to the formation of the rift valleys. This process is still ongoing, and the Great Rift Valley continues to expand at a rate of approximately 1 cm per year.

#### The East African Rift System

The East African Rift System is another significant rift system in Africa, which runs along the eastern edge of the continent from the Red Sea to the Zambezi River. Unlike the Great Rift Valley, which is primarily a series of faults, the East African Rift System is characterized by a series of volcanic features, including volcanic rifts, calderas, and lava plains.

The East African Rift System is believed to have formed as a result of the separation of the African and Arabian plates, similar to the Great Rift Valley. However, the East African Rift System is also influenced by the movement of the Nubian plate, which is moving northward relative to the African plate. This movement has led to the formation of the Afar Triple Junction, a region of intense volcanic activity and plate deformation.

#### The Afar Triple Junction

The Afar Triple Junction is a region of intense volcanic activity and plate deformation located in the Afar region of Ethiopia. It is where the African, Arabian, and Nubian plates meet, and it is one of the most active volcanic regions on Earth. The Afar Triple Junction is responsible for the formation of the Danakil Depression, a vast, desolate landscape of salt flats and volcanic cones.

The Afar Triple Junction is also a site of ongoing research, as scientists continue to study the processes that drive plate movement and volcanic activity in the region. The Afar Triple Junction is a crucial component of the East African Rift System, and its study provides valuable insights into the evolution of the African continent.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the geological processes that have shaped the African continent, focusing on the formation and evolution of the Great Rift Valley and the East African Rift System.




### Subsection: 10.1b Evolution of African Rift Systems

The evolution of African rift systems has been a topic of extensive research and debate among geologists. The formation of these systems is closely tied to the movement of tectonic plates and the resulting stresses on the Earth's crust. In this section, we will explore the evolution of African rift systems, focusing on the East African Rift System and the Afar Triple Junction.

#### The East African Rift System

The East African Rift System is a complex system of rifts, faults, and volcanic features that stretches from the Red Sea to the Zambezi River. The system is believed to have formed as a result of the separation of the African and Arabian plates, which began approximately 30 million years ago.

The East African Rift System is characterized by a series of volcanic features, including volcanic rifts, calderas, and lava plains. These features are the result of the movement of the Nubian plate, which is moving northward relative to the African plate.

#### The Afar Triple Junction

The Afar Triple Junction is a region of intense volcanic activity and crustal extension located in the Afar region of Ethiopia. The junction is where the Arabian, African, and Nubian plates meet, and it is the site of the East African Rift System's most active volcanism.

The Afar Triple Junction is characterized by a series of active volcanic areas, including the Erta Ale volcano and the Dabbahu volcano. These volcanic areas are the result of the movement of the Nubian plate, which is causing the African plate to stretch and thin in the region. This stretching and thinning of the crust is leading to the formation of new crust and the extrusion of basaltic magma, resulting in the volcanic features observed in the Afar region.

#### Implications of Volcanism

The volcanic activity at the Afar Triple Junction has significant implications for the evolution of African rift systems. The successive layers of flood basalts found in the region can be dated using the <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar-isotope dating method, which has shown that the trap series is approximately 30 million years old. This dating helps quantify the amount of crustal extension and gives a model of pre-rifting crustal connection.

Seismic tomography has also been used to study the Afar Triple Junction and the East African Rift System. These studies have shown a slow anomaly structure beneath southern Africa, which is considered to be a plume upwelling. This plume upwelling is believed to be a major factor in the formation and evolution of African rift systems.

In conclusion, the evolution of African rift systems is a complex and ongoing process that is closely tied to the movement of tectonic plates and the resulting stresses on the Earth's crust. The Afar Triple Junction, with its intense volcanic activity and crustal extension, plays a crucial role in this evolution and provides valuable insights into the formation of African rift systems.
