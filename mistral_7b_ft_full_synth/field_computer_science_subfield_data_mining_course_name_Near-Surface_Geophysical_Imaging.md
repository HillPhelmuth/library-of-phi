## Chapter 1: Introduction to seismic wave propagation

### Introduction

Seismic wave propagation is a fundamental concept in the field of geophysics, particularly in the study of the Earth's subsurface. It is the process by which seismic waves, or vibrations, travel through the Earth's layers, providing valuable information about the properties of these layers. This chapter will introduce the basic principles of seismic wave propagation, including the types of seismic waves, their behavior in different media, and the factors that affect their propagation.

Seismic waves are generated by natural events such as earthquakes or man-made sources like explosions. They travel through the Earth's layers, each of which has different physical properties. The interaction of these waves with the layers they encounter is what provides us with information about the Earth's subsurface.

The chapter will begin by discussing the two main types of seismic waves: P-waves and S-waves. P-waves, or primary waves, are compressional waves that cause the medium through which they travel to expand and contract. S-waves, or secondary waves, are shear waves that cause the medium to vibrate in a circular motion. The behavior of these waves in different media, such as solid rock or liquid water, will be explored.

The chapter will also delve into the factors that affect seismic wave propagation, such as the properties of the medium, the frequency of the wave, and the angle at which the wave is propagating. Understanding these factors is crucial for interpreting the information that seismic waves provide about the Earth's subsurface.

In conclusion, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to seismic wave propagation, setting the stage for the more advanced topics covered in the subsequent chapters. By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the basic principles of seismic wave propagation and be ready to delve deeper into the fascinating world of near-surface geophysical imaging.




### Section: 1.1 Seismic wave equations

Seismic waves are a fundamental aspect of geophysical imaging, providing valuable information about the Earth's subsurface. The propagation of these waves is governed by a set of equations known as the seismic wave equations. These equations describe the behavior of seismic waves as they travel through different media, and are essential for understanding the information they provide about the Earth's subsurface.

#### 1.1a Wave types: P-waves, S-waves, surface waves

There are three main types of seismic waves: primary waves (P-waves), secondary waves (S-waves), and surface waves. Each of these waves has unique properties and behaviors, which are described by the seismic wave equations.

##### Primary Waves (P-waves)

Primary waves, also known as P-waves, are longitudinal waves that cause the medium through which they travel to expand and contract. They are the fastest moving waves and are always the first to appear on a seismogram. The behavior of P-waves in different media is described by the wave equation:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 p
$$

where $p$ is the pressure perturbation, $t$ is time, $c$ is the wave speed, and $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator.

##### Secondary Waves (S-waves)

Secondary waves, also known as S-waves, are transverse waves that move perpendicular to the direction of propagation. They are slower than P-waves and appear later on a seismogram. The behavior of S-waves in different media is described by the wave equation:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 s}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 s
$$

where $s$ is the shear stress, $t$ is time, $c$ is the wave speed, and $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator.

##### Surface Waves

Surface waves are the result of P-waves and S-waves interacting with the surface of the Earth. They are dispersive, meaning that different frequencies have different velocities. The two main types of surface waves are Rayleigh waves and Love waves.

Rayleigh waves result from the interaction of P-waves and vertically polarized S-waves with the surface. They can exist in any solid medium and have both compressional and shear motions. The behavior of Rayleigh waves is described by the wave equation:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 r}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 r
$$

where $r$ is the displacement, $t$ is time, $c$ is the wave speed, and $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator.

Love waves, on the other hand, are formed by horizontally polarized S-waves interacting with the surface. They can only exist if there is a change in the elastic properties with depth in a solid medium, which is always the case in seismological applications. The behavior of Love waves is described by the wave equation:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 l}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 l
$$

where $l$ is the displacement, $t$ is time, $c$ is the wave speed, and $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the properties and behaviors of these waves, and how they provide valuable information about the Earth's subsurface.

#### 1.1b Wave propagation in different media

The propagation of seismic waves is influenced by the properties of the medium through which they travel. These properties include the density of the medium, the elastic properties of the medium, and the presence of any interfaces or boundaries between different media. The seismic wave equations provide a mathematical description of how these waves propagate in different media.

##### Solid Media

In solid media, both P-waves and S-waves can propagate. The wave speed for these waves is given by the equation:

$$
c = \sqrt{\frac{K + 4/3G}{\rho}}
$$

where $K$ is the bulk modulus, $G$ is the shear modulus, and $\rho$ is the density of the medium. The bulk modulus and shear modulus are measures of the resistance of the medium to volume change and shear deformation, respectively.

##### Fluid Media

In fluid media, only P-waves can propagate. The wave speed for P-waves in fluid media is given by the equation:

$$
c = \sqrt{\frac{K}{\rho}}
$$

where $K$ is the bulk modulus and $\rho$ is the density of the medium. In fluid media, the shear modulus $G$ is typically very small, so S-waves cannot propagate.

##### Interfaces and Boundaries

At interfaces or boundaries between different media, a portion of the wave energy is reflected back into the first medium, and a portion is transmitted into the second medium. The amount of reflection and transmission depends on the properties of the media and the angle of incidence of the wave. This phenomenon is described by the reflection and transmission coefficients, which can be calculated using the seismic wave equations.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of dispersion, which refers to the dependence of the wave speed on the frequency of the wave. This is an important aspect of seismic wave propagation, as it affects the interpretation of seismic data.

#### 1.1c Wave speed and wavelength

The speed of a seismic wave is a critical parameter in understanding its propagation and interaction with the medium. It is defined as the distance traveled by the wave per unit time. The wave speed, $c$, is related to the wavelength, $\lambda$, and the frequency, $f$, of the wave by the equation:

$$
c = \lambda f
$$

where $\lambda$ is the wavelength and $f$ is the frequency. The wavelength is the distance over which the wave's shape repeats, and the frequency is the number of oscillations that occur per unit of time.

The wave speed is also related to the properties of the medium. In solid media, the wave speed is given by the equation:

$$
c = \sqrt{\frac{K + 4/3G}{\rho}}
$$

where $K$ is the bulk modulus, $G$ is the shear modulus, and $\rho$ is the density of the medium. In fluid media, the wave speed for P-waves is given by the equation:

$$
c = \sqrt{\frac{K}{\rho}}
$$

where $K$ is the bulk modulus and $\rho$ is the density of the medium.

The wavelength of a wave is inversely proportional to its frequency. Higher frequency waves have shorter wavelengths, and lower frequency waves have longer wavelengths. This relationship is known as the dispersion relation.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of dispersion and its implications for seismic wave propagation.




### Section: 1.1b Wave propagation in different media: solids, liquids, gases

The propagation of seismic waves is influenced by the properties of the medium through which they travel. These properties include density, elasticity, and viscosity. In this section, we will explore how these properties affect the propagation of seismic waves in solids, liquids, and gases.

#### Solids

In solids, seismic waves propagate through the lattice structure of the material. The behavior of these waves is described by the wave equation:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 p
$$

where $p$ is the pressure perturbation, $t$ is time, $c$ is the wave speed, and $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator. The wave speed $c$ in solids is typically higher than in liquids or gases due to the stronger intermolecular forces.

#### Liquids

In liquids, seismic waves propagate through the fluid medium. The behavior of these waves is described by the wave equation:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 p
$$

where $p$ is the pressure perturbation, $t$ is time, $c$ is the wave speed, and $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator. The wave speed $c$ in liquids is typically lower than in solids or gases due to the weaker intermolecular forces.

#### Gases

In gases, seismic waves propagate through the gas medium. The behavior of these waves is described by the wave equation:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 p
$$

where $p$ is the pressure perturbation, $t$ is time, $c$ is the wave speed, and $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator. The wave speed $c$ in gases is typically lower than in solids or liquids due to the even weaker intermolecular forces.

In the next section, we will explore how these properties affect the propagation of seismic waves in more detail.




#### 1.1c Wave interactions: scattering, diffraction, attenuation

Seismic waves, like all waves, interact with the medium through which they propagate. These interactions can result in phenomena such as scattering, diffraction, and attenuation. Understanding these phenomena is crucial for interpreting seismic data and imaging the subsurface.

#### Scattering

Scattering occurs when a wave encounters an obstacle or a change in the medium properties. The wave is deflected or redirected by the obstacle or change in properties. The amount of scattering depends on the size and shape of the obstacle, as well as the contrast in properties between the obstacle and the surrounding medium.

The scattering of seismic waves can be described by the scattering matrix, or S-matrix. The S-matrix relates the incident wave to the scattered wave, and is defined as:

$$
S = \frac{E_{scattered}}{E_{incident}}
$$

where $E_{scattered}$ is the electric field of the scattered wave and $E_{incident}$ is the electric field of the incident wave.

#### Diffraction

Diffraction occurs when a wave encounters an edge or a boundary between two different media. The wave is bent around the edge or boundary, and can propagate into regions that would not be accessible to the wave without the diffraction.

The diffraction of seismic waves can be described by the diffraction matrix, or D-matrix. The D-matrix relates the incident wave to the diffracted wave, and is defined as:

$$
D = \frac{E_{diffracted}}{E_{incident}}
$$

where $E_{diffracted}$ is the electric field of the diffracted wave and $E_{incident}$ is the electric field of the incident wave.

#### Attenuation

Attenuation is the loss of wave energy as the wave propagates through the medium. This loss of energy can be due to absorption, where the wave energy is converted into heat, or scattering, where the wave energy is redirected without changing its frequency.

The attenuation of seismic waves can be described by the attenuation matrix, or A-matrix. The A-matrix relates the incident wave to the attenuated wave, and is defined as:

$$
A = \frac{E_{attenuated}}{E_{incident}}
$$

where $E_{attenuated}$ is the electric field of the attenuated wave and $E_{incident}$ is the electric field of the incident wave.

In the next section, we will explore these phenomena in more detail, and discuss how they affect the propagation of seismic waves.




#### 1.1d Wave behavior at interfaces: transmission, reflection, refraction

When a seismic wave encounters an interface between two different media, it can exhibit three primary behaviors: transmission, reflection, and refraction. These behaviors are governed by the wave equations and the continuity conditions at the interface.

#### Transmission

Transmission occurs when a wave passes through an interface without being reflected or refracted. The wave continues to propagate in the new medium with a modified velocity and wavelength. The transmission coefficient, $T$, is defined as the ratio of the transmitted wave amplitude to the incident wave amplitude.

The transmission coefficient for a wave incident on an interface between two media with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$ is given by:

$$
T = \frac{2v_1}{v_1 + v_2}
$$

#### Reflection

Reflection occurs when a wave is bounced back from an interface. The reflected wave has the same frequency and wavelength as the incident wave, but its amplitude and phase can change depending on the properties of the interface. The reflection coefficient, $R$, is defined as the ratio of the reflected wave amplitude to the incident wave amplitude.

The reflection coefficient for a wave incident on an interface between two media with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$ is given by:

$$
R = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{v_1 + v_2}
$$

#### Refraction

Refraction occurs when a wave changes its direction as it passes through an interface. The refracted wave has a different velocity and wavelength in the new medium. The refraction angle, $\theta_r$, is defined as the angle between the refracted wave and the normal to the interface.

The refraction angle for a wave incident on an interface between two media with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$ is given by Snell's law:

$$
n_1 \sin(\theta_i) = n_2 \sin(\theta_r)
$$

where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the refractive indices of the media, and $\theta_i$ is the angle of incidence.

These behaviors are crucial for understanding the propagation of seismic waves in the subsurface. They are also the basis for many geophysical imaging techniques, such as reflection and refraction seismology.

### Subsection: 2.1a Near-surface geological complexities and their impact on imaging

The near-surface geological complexities pose significant challenges to geophysical imaging. These complexities are often the result of the interaction between the Earth's surface and the subsurface, and they can significantly affect the accuracy and reliability of the imaging results.

#### 2.1a.1 Geological Structures

Geological structures, such as faults, folds, and fractures, are common features in the near-surface environment. These structures can significantly alter the physical properties of the Earth's surface and subsurface, and they can cause significant variations in the geophysical signals. For example, a fault can cause a sudden change in the seismic velocity, which can result in a discontinuity in the seismic reflection data. Similarly, a fold can cause a change in the electrical resistivity, which can result in a change in the electromagnetic response.

#### 2.1a.2 Surface Cover

The presence of surface cover, such as vegetation, soil, and water, can also pose significant challenges to geophysical imaging. These cover materials can significantly affect the propagation of the geophysical signals, and they can cause significant variations in the measured data. For example, vegetation can cause a reduction in the seismic velocity, which can result in a decrease in the seismic amplitude. Similarly, soil can cause a decrease in the electrical resistivity, which can result in a decrease in the electromagnetic response.

#### 2.1a.3 Subsurface Heterogeneity

The subsurface heterogeneity refers to the variations in the physical properties of the Earth's subsurface. These variations can be caused by a variety of factors, including changes in the rock type, changes in the mineral composition, and changes in the fluid content. The subsurface heterogeneity can cause significant variations in the geophysical signals, and it can make the interpretation of the imaging results more challenging.

#### 2.1a.4 Near-Surface Imaging Techniques

Despite these challenges, various near-surface imaging techniques have been developed to overcome the limitations of traditional geophysical methods. These techniques include ground-penetrating radar, seismic reflection, and electromagnetic methods. These techniques have the advantage of being able to penetrate through the surface cover and the near-surface environment, and they can provide valuable information about the subsurface properties.

In the following sections, we will discuss these imaging techniques in more detail, and we will explore how they can be used to image the near-surface geological complexities.




### Subsection: 2.1b Analysis of dispersive and non-dispersive surface waves

Surface waves are a crucial tool in near-surface geophysical imaging, providing valuable information about the subsurface properties. However, the interpretation of surface waves can be challenging due to their dispersive nature. Dispersion refers to the phenomenon where the phase velocity of a wave depends on its wavelength. In the context of surface waves, this means that waves of different wavelengths travel at different speeds, which can complicate the interpretation of the wavefield.

#### 2.1b.1 Dispersive Surface Waves

Dispersive surface waves are characterized by their ability to penetrate to different depths depending on their wavelength. This property is a result of the variation of velocities with wavelength in the subsurface. As mentioned earlier, longer wavelengths tend to travel faster than shorter wavelengths, which allows them to penetrate deeper into the subsurface. This property can be exploited to infer critical information about the subsurface, as demonstrated by Dobrin (1951) using a water disturbance example.

The dispersion of surface waves can be quantified by the group velocity and phase velocity. The group velocity is the speed at which a wave group travels, while the phase velocity is the speed at which an individual wave travels. Both velocities increase with wavelength, which can be visualized by plotting the amplitude of surface waves against depth for different wavelengths.

#### 2.1b.2 Non-Dispersive Surface Waves

In contrast to dispersive surface waves, non-dispersive surface waves travel at a constant velocity regardless of their wavelength. This property simplifies the interpretation of the wavefield, as all waves travel at the same speed. However, non-dispersive surface waves are less common than dispersive waves, and their interpretation can still be challenging due to other factors such as surface cover and geological structures.

In the next section, we will discuss the methods for analyzing dispersive and non-dispersive surface waves, including the use of Fourier theory and the concept of wave groups.




#### 2.1c Geophone and hydrophone array design and deployment

The design and deployment of geophone and hydrophone arrays are crucial steps in the process of near-surface geophysical imaging. These arrays are designed to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio and minimize the influence of surface waves on recorded data.

#### 2.1c.1 Design of Geophone and Hydrophone Arrays

The design of geophone and hydrophone arrays involves several considerations. One of the primary considerations is the number of receivers in the array. The Nyquist criterion, which states that the sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency component of the signal, is often used to determine the minimum number of receivers required in an array. This criterion ensures that the continuous signal is adequately discretized.

Another important consideration is the spacing between receivers. The spacing should be sufficient to resolve the wavelengths of interest, but not so large that the array becomes too sparse. The spacing can also affect the directionality of the array, with closer spacing resulting in a more directional array.

The type of receivers used in the array is also an important consideration. As mentioned earlier, geophones can be either single-component or multi-component, while hydrophones are typically piezoelectric. The choice of receivers depends on the specific requirements of the imaging task, such as the desired signal-to-noise ratio and the frequency range of interest.

#### 2.1c.2 Deployment of Geophone and Hydrophone Arrays

The deployment of geophone and hydrophone arrays involves careful consideration of the location and orientation of the receivers. The receivers should be deployed in a manner that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio and minimizes the influence of surface waves.

The location of the receivers is determined by the area of interest and the desired coverage. The receivers should be deployed in a manner that provides adequate coverage of the area of interest. This can be achieved by deploying the receivers in a grid pattern or in a pattern that follows the expected direction of the signal.

The orientation of the receivers is determined by the desired directionality of the array. As mentioned earlier, closer spacing results in a more directional array. The orientation of the receivers can also be adjusted to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio.

In conclusion, the design and deployment of geophone and hydrophone arrays are crucial steps in the process of near-surface geophysical imaging. These arrays are designed to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio and minimize the influence of surface waves on recorded data. The design and deployment of these arrays require careful consideration of several factors, including the number of receivers, the spacing between receivers, the type of receivers, and the location and orientation of the receivers.

### Section: 3.1 Traveltime curves:

In the previous section, we discussed the basics of traveltime curves and their importance in near-surface geophysical imaging. In this section, we will delve deeper into the topic and explore the process of building velocity models for near-surface imaging.

#### 3.1b Building velocity models for near-surface imaging

Velocity models are essential tools in near-surface geophysical imaging as they provide a means to interpret traveltime curves and understand the subsurface structure. Building a velocity model involves determining the velocity of the subsurface materials at different depths. This is typically done by analyzing the traveltime curves and using various geophysical techniques such as seismic reflection, gravity, and electromagnetic methods.

The first step in building a velocity model is to collect data from various geophysical techniques. This data is then used to create a traveltime curve, which represents the time it takes for a seismic wave to travel from the source to the receiver. By analyzing the shape and characteristics of the traveltime curve, we can determine the velocity of the subsurface materials.

One commonly used technique for building velocity models is the P-wave velocity model. This model takes into account the velocity of P-waves, which are the fastest seismic waves and are not affected by the presence of fluids. By using this model, we can determine the velocity of the subsurface materials and create a velocity profile.

Another important aspect of building velocity models is understanding the effects of anisotropy. Anisotropy refers to the directional dependence of the velocity of subsurface materials. In near-surface imaging, anisotropy can be caused by the presence of layered materials or by the alignment of particles in the soil. By considering anisotropy, we can create more accurate velocity models and interpret traveltime curves more effectively.

In addition to anisotropy, it is also important to consider the effects of heterogeneity when building velocity models. Heterogeneity refers to the variations in velocity within a given material. This can be caused by variations in the composition or structure of the material. By accounting for heterogeneity, we can create more realistic velocity models and better interpret traveltime curves.

Overall, building velocity models for near-surface imaging is a complex and important process. By considering factors such as anisotropy and heterogeneity, we can create more accurate models and better understand the subsurface structure. This allows us to effectively interpret traveltime curves and gain valuable insights into the near-surface geophysical environment.





### Section: 3.1c Statics correction methods for refraction data

However, in order to accurately interpret traveltime curves, it is also necessary to apply statics corrections to the data. In this section, we will explore the various methods for applying statics corrections to refraction data.

#### 3.1c.1 Static corrections for refraction data

Static corrections are necessary when dealing with refraction data, as the traveltime curves can be affected by the presence of subsurface interfaces. These interfaces can cause changes in the velocity of the seismic waves, resulting in errors in the traveltime curves. By applying statics corrections, we can account for these changes and obtain more accurate traveltime curves.

One commonly used method for applying statics corrections is the Zoeppritz method. This method takes into account the changes in velocity caused by subsurface interfaces and uses this information to correct the traveltime curves. By applying the Zoeppritz method, we can obtain more accurate traveltime curves and better understand the subsurface structure.

Another important aspect of statics corrections is understanding the effects of anisotropy. As mentioned in the previous section, anisotropy can cause changes in the velocity of subsurface materials. By considering anisotropy, we can apply more accurate statics corrections and obtain more accurate traveltime curves.

In addition to the Zoeppritz method, there are other methods for applying statics corrections, such as the Dix method and the Dix-Zoeppritz method. These methods take into account different factors, such as the thickness of subsurface interfaces and the presence of anisotropy, and can provide more accurate results.

Overall, it is important to carefully consider the effects of anisotropy and apply appropriate statics corrections when dealing with refraction data. By doing so, we can obtain more accurate traveltime curves and better understand the subsurface structure.

### Subsection: 3.1 Introduction to Refraction traveltime interpretation

In the previous chapter, we discussed the basics of refraction traveltime interpretation and its importance in near-surface geophysical imaging. In this section, we will delve deeper into the topic and explore the various methods and techniques used for refraction traveltime interpretation.

#### 3.1a Basics of Refraction traveltime interpretation

Refraction traveltime interpretation is a crucial aspect of near-surface geophysical imaging. It involves the use of seismic data to determine the velocity of subsurface materials and their boundaries. This information is then used to create a subsurface image of the Earth's interior.

The basic principle behind refraction traveltime interpretation is the concept of refraction. When a seismic wave travels through a medium, it changes direction and speed as it encounters different materials with varying densities and velocities. This change in direction and speed is known as refraction. By measuring the change in traveltime of a seismic wave as it passes through different materials, we can determine the velocity of those materials.

There are two main methods used for refraction traveltime interpretation: the first arrival time method and the P-wave velocity method. The first arrival time method involves measuring the time it takes for the first arrival of a seismic wave to reach a receiver. This time is then compared to the expected traveltime for a wave traveling through a homogeneous medium. Any difference in traveltime can be attributed to the presence of a subsurface boundary.

The P-wave velocity method, on the other hand, involves measuring the velocity of P-waves (primary waves) as they travel through different materials. This method is more accurate than the first arrival time method, but it requires more complex equipment and analysis techniques.

#### 3.1b Refraction traveltime interpretation methods and techniques

In addition to the two main methods mentioned above, there are several other techniques used for refraction traveltime interpretation. These include the use of shear-wave splitting, which involves measuring the velocity of S-waves (secondary waves) as they travel through different materials. This method is particularly useful for determining the properties of anisotropic materials, where the velocity of waves can vary depending on the direction of travel.

Another important technique is the use of seismic tomography, which involves analyzing the traveltime of seismic waves to create a 3D image of the Earth's interior. This method has been used to study the structure and properties of the Earth's crust and upper mantle.

#### 3.1c Challenges and future directions

Despite the advancements in refraction traveltime interpretation techniques, there are still challenges that need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the accuracy of the measurements. Small errors in the measurement of traveltime can result in significant errors in the determination of subsurface properties.

In the future, advancements in technology and computing power will allow for more accurate and detailed refraction traveltime interpretation. This will involve the use of more advanced techniques, such as full-waveform inversion, which can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the subsurface.

#### 3.1d Conclusion

In conclusion, refraction traveltime interpretation is a crucial aspect of near-surface geophysical imaging. It allows us to determine the properties of subsurface materials and their boundaries, providing valuable information for various applications such as resource exploration and hazard assessment. With the continued development of new techniques and technology, refraction traveltime interpretation will continue to play a vital role in our understanding of the Earth's interior.

### Section: 4.1 Traveltime picking:

Traveltime picking is a crucial step in first-arrival traveltime tomography. It involves the identification and measurement of the first arrivals of seismic waves at different locations on the surface. This section will discuss the principles and techniques used for traveltime picking, as well as the challenges and limitations that may arise.

#### 4.1a Manual and automated traveltime picking techniques

Traveltime picking can be done manually or automatically. Manual picking involves visually inspecting the seismic data and identifying the first arrivals by hand. This technique is often used when the data is of high quality and the subsurface structure is relatively simple. However, manual picking can be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially when dealing with complex structures or noisy data.

Automated picking, on the other hand, uses algorithms to identify the first arrivals automatically. This technique can handle large amounts of data and complex structures, but it also requires careful calibration and validation to ensure accurate results. Some common automated picking techniques include correlation methods, which use the correlation between different signals to identify the first arrivals, and thresholding methods, which use a predefined threshold to identify the first arrivals.

#### 4.1b Challenges and limitations of traveltime picking

Despite its advantages, traveltime picking also has its limitations and challenges. One of the main challenges is the presence of noise in the data, which can make it difficult to accurately identify the first arrivals. Noise can be caused by various sources, such as instrument noise, environmental noise, and interference from other signals. To mitigate noise, various signal processing techniques can be used, such as filtering and averaging.

Another challenge is the need for accurate calibration and validation of the picking results. This involves comparing the picked travel times with known values, such as the travel time from a known source location to a receiver. Any discrepancies between the picked and known travel times can indicate errors in the picking process and may require manual correction.

#### 4.1c Future directions in traveltime picking

As technology continues to advance, there are several potential directions for future developments in traveltime picking. One direction is the use of machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of automated picking. Machine learning algorithms can learn from the data and adapt to the specific characteristics of the subsurface, leading to more accurate results.

Another direction is the integration of traveltime picking with other geophysical techniques, such as gravity and magnetic surveys. By combining these techniques, a more comprehensive understanding of the subsurface can be achieved, leading to more accurate and detailed imaging.

In conclusion, traveltime picking is a crucial step in first-arrival traveltime tomography. While it has its challenges and limitations, advancements in technology and techniques continue to improve its accuracy and efficiency. As we continue to explore and understand the near-surface geophysical environment, traveltime picking will play a vital role in our ability to image and interpret the subsurface.

#### 4.1b Iterative and non-iterative tomographic inversion algorithms

Once the travel times have been picked, they can be used to create a velocity model of the subsurface. This is done through the process of tomographic inversion, which involves solving an inverse problem to determine the velocity structure that would have produced the observed travel times. There are two main types of tomographic inversion algorithms: iterative and non-iterative.

Iterative algorithms, such as the Gauss-Seidel method and the conjugate gradient method, use an iterative process to solve the inverse problem. These methods start with an initial velocity model and then iteratively update the model until it matches the observed travel times. The advantage of iterative methods is that they can handle complex velocity structures and large amounts of data. However, they can also be computationally intensive and may not always converge to a solution.

Non-iterative algorithms, such as the least squares method and the Levenberg-Marquardt method, use a direct approach to solve the inverse problem. These methods calculate the velocity model directly from the observed travel times, without the need for an iterative process. Non-iterative methods are faster and more straightforward than iterative methods, but they may not be as accurate and may not be able to handle complex velocity structures.

#### 4.1c Challenges and limitations of traveltime picking and tomographic inversion

Despite the advancements in traveltime picking and tomographic inversion techniques, there are still challenges and limitations that must be considered. One of the main challenges is the presence of noise in the seismic data, which can affect the accuracy of the picked travel times and the resulting velocity model. Noise can be caused by various sources, such as instrument noise, environmental noise, and interference from other signals.

Another challenge is the assumption of homogeneity in the velocity structure, which is often made in tomographic inversion. In reality, the subsurface may not be homogeneous, and this can lead to errors in the velocity model. Additionally, the accuracy of the velocity model is highly dependent on the quality and quantity of the observed travel times. More data and higher quality data can improve the accuracy of the model, but this can be difficult to obtain in practice.

Despite these challenges, traveltime picking and tomographic inversion remain essential tools in geophysical imaging. With continued advancements in technology and techniques, these methods will continue to play a crucial role in understanding the subsurface structure and properties.

This process can be computationally intensive and may not always converge to a solution.

Non-iterative algorithms, on the other hand, use a direct approach to solve the inverse problem. These methods, such as the least squares method and the Tikhonov regularization method, use mathematical techniques to solve the inverse problem in a single step. While these methods are faster than iterative methods, they may not always provide a unique solution and may require additional constraints to ensure a stable solution.

#### 4.1c Assessing resolution and uncertainty of tomographic models

Once a velocity model has been created using traveltime picking and tomographic inversion, it is important to assess its resolution and uncertainty. The resolution of a model refers to its ability to distinguish between different layers or structures in the subsurface. The uncertainty of a model refers to the level of confidence we can have in its accuracy.

The resolution of a model is influenced by several factors, including the quality of the data, the complexity of the subsurface structure, and the type of tomographic inversion algorithm used. In general, models created using automated picking techniques and non-iterative inversion algorithms tend to have lower resolution due to their reliance on assumptions and simplifications.

The uncertainty of a model is also influenced by several factors, including the quality of the data, the complexity of the subsurface structure, and the type of tomographic inversion algorithm used. In general, models created using manual picking techniques and iterative inversion algorithms tend to have lower uncertainty due to their ability to handle complex structures and the iterative nature of the algorithm.

To assess the resolution and uncertainty of a model, it is important to use techniques such as cross-validation and sensitivity analysis. Cross-validation involves using a portion of the data to validate the model and assess its accuracy. Sensitivity analysis involves studying the effect of changes in the input data on the output model. By using these techniques, we can gain a better understanding of the limitations and uncertainties of our models.

In conclusion, traveltime picking and tomographic inversion are crucial steps in creating velocity models of the subsurface. It is important to carefully consider the choice of picking technique and inversion algorithm, as well as the assessment of resolution and uncertainty, in order to create accurate and reliable models.

Open access to data, tools and facilities for processing, analysis, and visualization, and new algorithms and workflows are changing the landscape of geodetic scientific collaboration # Digital outcrop model

A digital outcrop model (DOM), also called a virtual outcrop model, is a digital 3D representation of the outcrop surface, mostly in a form of textured polygon mesh.

DOMs allow for interpretation and reproducible measurement of different geological features, e.g. orientation of geological surfaces, width and thickness of layers. The quantity of identifiable and measurable geological features highly depends on the outcrop model resolution and accuracy.

Using remote sensing techniques enables these 3D models to cover areas with difficult accessibility, e.g. several meter high cliff walls. The fact that geological interpretation can be performed on the screen, also in inaccessible areas where using conventional fieldwork methods may be unsafe, and the large quantity of data that can be collected in relatively short time are the key advantages of using DOMs. Georeferencing digital outcrop models allows for integration with other spatial data, e.g. results of digital geologic mapping or GIS.

Alternatively to the photorealistic textured models 3D digital outcrop models may be represented by a point cloud coloured with the spectral (RGB) data from the corresponding images. Such surface model representation accurately describes the topography of the outcrop but due to its discrete nature is often difficult to interpret (see Figure 1.). 
Texturing digital polygonal outcrop models with images enhances the models with high resolution continuous data and therefore facilitates geological interpretation.

## Creation techniques

Creation of textured DOMs can be divided into three main steps: 

In order to create a textured DOM, the following steps are typically followed:

1. Data collection: This involves collecting data from various sources, such as high-resolution images, topography maps, and other spatial data. This data is then used to create a 3D model of the outcrop surface.

2. Model creation: Using specialized software, the collected data is used to create a 3D model of the outcrop surface. This model is typically represented as a textured polygon mesh, which accurately describes the topography of the outcrop.

3. Model validation: The final step involves validating the accuracy of the model by comparing it to other spatial data, such as results of digital geologic mapping or GIS data. This step ensures that the model accurately represents the outcrop surface and can be used for further analysis and interpretation.

### Section: 4.1 Traveltime picking:

Traveltime picking is a crucial step in first-arrival traveltime tomography. It involves the identification and measurement of the first arrivals of seismic waves at different locations on the surface. This section will discuss the principles and techniques used for traveltime picking, as well as the challenges and limitations that may arise.

#### 4.1a Manual and automated traveltime picking techniques

Traveltime picking can be done manually or automatically. Manual picking involves visually inspecting the seismic data and identifying the first arrivals by hand. This technique is often used when the data is of high quality and the subsurface structure is relatively simple. However, manual picking can be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially when dealing with complex structures or noisy data.

Automated picking, on the other hand, uses algorithms to identify the first arrivals automatically. This technique can handle large amounts of data and complex structures, but it also requires careful calibration and validation to ensure accurate results. Some common automated picking techniques include correlation methods, which use the correlation between different signals to identify the first arrivals, and thresholding methods, which use a predefined threshold to identify the first arrivals.

#### 4.1b Iterative and non-iterative tomographic inversion algorithms

Once the travel times have been picked, they can be used to create a velocity model of the subsurface. This is done through the process of tomographic inversion, which involves solving an inverse problem to determine the velocity structure that would have produced the observed travel times. There are two main types of tomographic inversion algorithms: iterative and non-iterative.

Iterative algorithms, such as the Gauss-Seidel method and the conjugate gradient method, use an iterative process to solve the inverse problem. These methods start with an initial velocity model and then iteratively adjust the model until it matches the observed travel times. This process can be time-consuming, but it allows for more complex and accurate models to be created.

Non-iterative algorithms, on the other hand, use a single step to solve the inverse problem. These methods, such as the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and the simplex method, use a mathematical approach to determine the optimal velocity model that matches the observed travel times. These methods are faster than iterative algorithms, but they may not be as accurate or able to handle complex structures.

### Subsection: 4.1d Integrating geological information for model interpretation

In addition to traveltime picking and tomographic inversion, integrating geological information is also crucial for accurately interpreting the resulting velocity models. This involves using geological knowledge and data to constrain and validate the models.

Geological information can be integrated into the velocity models in various ways. One common approach is to use well data, which provides direct measurements of the subsurface properties. This data can be used to calibrate and validate the velocity models, ensuring that they accurately represent the subsurface structure.

Another approach is to use remote sensing data, such as satellite imagery or airborne geophysical surveys. This data can provide valuable information about the surface and near-surface properties, which can then be used to constrain the velocity models.

Integrating geological information is essential for accurately interpreting the velocity models and understanding the subsurface structure. It allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the subsurface and can help to identify any discrepancies or errors in the models.

In conclusion, first-arrival traveltime tomography is a powerful tool for imaging the near-surface geology. By integrating geological information with traveltime picking and tomographic inversion, accurate and detailed velocity models can be created, providing valuable insights into the subsurface structure.

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have discussed various geophysical imaging techniques that are used to study the Earth's subsurface. These techniques have been instrumental in providing valuable insights into the structure and properties of the Earth's crust and upper mantle. However, these techniques are limited in their ability to accurately image the near-surface region, which is of great interest to many geophysicists and engineers.

In this chapter, we will delve into the topic of refraction migration methods, which are a class of geophysical imaging techniques that are specifically designed to image the near-surface region. These methods are based on the principle of refraction, which is the change in direction of a wave as it passes from one medium to another. By exploiting this principle, refraction migration methods are able to accurately image the near-surface region, providing valuable information about the subsurface structure and properties.

We will begin by discussing the basic principles of refraction migration methods, including the concept of refraction and the equations that govern it. We will then move on to discuss the different types of refraction migration methods, including the popular Kirchhoff migration method and the more advanced reverse time migration method. We will also cover the applications of these methods in various fields, such as seismic imaging, electromagnetic imaging, and ground-penetrating radar.

Throughout this chapter, we will provide examples and case studies to illustrate the principles and applications of refraction migration methods. We will also discuss the advantages and limitations of these methods, as well as the ongoing research and developments in this field. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of refraction migration methods and their role in near-surface geophysical imaging.




### Section: 5.1 Kirchhoff migration:

Kirchhoff migration is a powerful method used in geophysical imaging to migrate seismic data. It is based on the Kirchhoff's theory of migration, which states that the migration of a seismic event can be calculated by integrating the seismic field over the time interval of interest. This theory is the basis for the Kirchhoff migration method.

#### 5.1a Principles and algorithms of Kirchhoff migration

The Kirchhoff migration method is based on the principle of superposition, which states that the total effect of multiple sources is equal to the sum of the effects of each source acting alone. This principle is used to calculate the migration of a seismic event by integrating the seismic field over the time interval of interest.

The Kirchhoff migration method involves two main steps: the forward modeling step and the migration step. In the forward modeling step, the seismic field is calculated for a given source and receiver location. This is done by solving the wave equation for the given source and receiver location. The solution to the wave equation gives the seismic field at the receiver location as a function of time.

In the migration step, the seismic field is integrated over the time interval of interest to calculate the migration of the seismic event. This is done by summing the seismic field at each time step. The result is a migration image that shows the location of the seismic event in the subsurface.

The Kirchhoff migration method is based on the assumption that the subsurface is homogeneous and isotropic. This assumption is often not valid in real-world scenarios, and therefore, the results of the Kirchhoff migration method may not be accurate. However, the method is still widely used due to its simplicity and ease of implementation.

The Kirchhoff migration method can be extended to handle more complex scenarios by incorporating more advanced algorithms. One such algorithm is the line integral convolution (LIC) method, which has been applied to a wide range of problems since it was first published in 1993. The LIC method involves convolving the seismic field with a kernel function to calculate the migration of the seismic event. This method is particularly useful for handling complex subsurface structures.

Another important aspect of the Kirchhoff migration method is the use of fast wavelet transforms and numerical algorithms. These techniques allow for efficient computation of the migration image, making the method more practical for real-world applications.

In conclusion, the Kirchhoff migration method is a powerful tool for migrating seismic data. It is based on the principles of superposition and integration, and can be extended to handle more complex scenarios by incorporating advanced algorithms and techniques. However, it is important to note that the results of the Kirchhoff migration method may not be accurate in all scenarios, and therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider the assumptions and limitations of the method.





### Section: 5.1b Imaging with common-offset data using different migration approaches

In the previous section, we discussed the Kirchhoff migration method, a popular method used in geophysical imaging. In this section, we will explore how this method can be applied to common-offset data and how it compares to other migration approaches.

#### 5.1b.1 Common-Offset Data

Common-offset data refers to seismic data collected with a common offset distance between the source and receiver. This type of data is commonly used in geophysical imaging as it allows for a more accurate determination of the subsurface structure.

#### 5.1b.2 Migration Approaches

There are several migration approaches that can be used to process common-offset data. These include the Kirchhoff migration method, the finite-difference method, and the finite-element method. Each of these methods has its own advantages and limitations, and the choice of method depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the subsurface structure.

#### 5.1b.3 Comparison of Migration Approaches

The Kirchhoff migration method is a popular choice for processing common-offset data due to its simplicity and ease of implementation. However, it is based on the assumption of a homogeneous and isotropic subsurface, which may not always be the case. The finite-difference method and the finite-element method, on the other hand, can handle more complex subsurface structures, but they are more computationally intensive and require more advanced mathematical knowledge.

In terms of imaging quality, the Kirchhoff migration method has been shown to produce high-quality images with good resolution and accuracy. However, the finite-difference method and the finite-element method have been shown to produce even higher quality images, especially in cases where the subsurface structure is complex and heterogeneous.

#### 5.1b.4 Advantages and Limitations of Common-Offset Data

One of the main advantages of using common-offset data is the improved accuracy in determining the subsurface structure. This is due to the fact that the source and receiver distances are constant, which reduces the effects of wave dispersion and scattering. However, common-offset data can also be more challenging to process, as it requires more advanced migration methods and algorithms.

Another limitation of common-offset data is the potential for aliasing, which can occur when the source and receiver distances are too close together. This can result in a distorted image of the subsurface structure. To avoid aliasing, it is important to carefully select the source and receiver distances when collecting common-offset data.

In conclusion, common-offset data can provide valuable insights into the subsurface structure, but it requires careful processing and the use of advanced migration methods. The Kirchhoff migration method is a popular choice for processing common-offset data, but it may not always be the most suitable method for complex subsurface structures. Other migration approaches, such as the finite-difference method and the finite-element method, can provide even higher quality images, but they require more advanced mathematical knowledge and computational resources. 





### Subsection: 5.1c Reverse-time migration for imaging complex near-surface structures

Reverse-time migration is a powerful technique used in geophysical imaging to image complex near-surface structures. It is based on the principle of reverse-time migration, which involves migrating the data in reverse time, from the receiver to the source. This approach is particularly useful for imaging complex near-surface structures, as it allows for a more accurate determination of the subsurface structure.

#### 5.1c.1 Reverse-Time Migration

Reverse-time migration is a form of migration that involves migrating the data in reverse time, from the receiver to the source. This approach is based on the assumption that the subsurface structure is time-invariant, meaning that it does not change over time. By migrating the data in reverse time, the effects of the subsurface structure can be removed, resulting in a more accurate image of the subsurface structure.

#### 5.1c.2 Imaging Complex Near-Surface Structures

One of the main advantages of reverse-time migration is its ability to image complex near-surface structures. This is because the effects of the subsurface structure are removed by migrating the data in reverse time, resulting in a more accurate image of the subsurface structure. This is particularly useful for imaging near-surface structures, as they are often complex and can be difficult to image using traditional migration methods.

#### 5.1c.3 Comparison with Other Migration Approaches

Reverse-time migration is a powerful technique for imaging complex near-surface structures, but it is not without its limitations. One of the main limitations is its reliance on the assumption of time-invariance of the subsurface structure. If this assumption is not met, the results of reverse-time migration may be less accurate. Additionally, reverse-time migration can be computationally intensive and requires advanced mathematical knowledge.

In terms of imaging quality, reverse-time migration has been shown to produce high-quality images with good resolution and accuracy. However, it may not always produce the highest quality images, especially in cases where the subsurface structure is complex and heterogeneous. In these cases, other migration approaches, such as the finite-difference method and the finite-element method, may produce even higher quality images.

#### 5.1c.4 Advantages and Limitations of Reverse-Time Migration

Despite its limitations, reverse-time migration has several advantages that make it a valuable tool in geophysical imaging. One of the main advantages is its ability to image complex near-surface structures, which is not always possible with other migration methods. Additionally, reverse-time migration can be used in conjunction with other migration approaches to improve imaging quality. However, it is important to carefully consider the limitations of reverse-time migration and its suitability for a given dataset before applying it.

### Subsection: 6.1a Forward modeling of seismic waveforms in near-surface media

In the previous section, we discussed the basics of waveform modeling and its importance in geophysical imaging. In this section, we will delve deeper into the topic and explore the process of forward modeling of seismic waveforms in near-surface media.

#### 6.1a.1 Introduction to Forward Modeling

Forward modeling is a crucial step in waveform modeling, as it allows us to predict the behavior of seismic waves as they propagate through the near-surface media. This is achieved by using mathematical models and equations that describe the physical properties of the media, such as its density, elasticity, and porosity.

The process of forward modeling involves solving the wave equation, which describes the propagation of seismic waves through a medium. The wave equation is given by:

$$
\nabla^2 u - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = 0
$$

where $u$ is the displacement of the wave, $c$ is the speed of sound in the medium, and $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator.

#### 6.1a.2 Forward Modeling in Near-Surface Media

In near-surface media, the properties of the medium can vary significantly due to the presence of complex geological structures and interfaces. This makes the process of forward modeling more challenging, as we need to account for these variations in the mathematical models.

One approach to forward modeling in near-surface media is the use of the finite-difference method. This method involves discretizing the medium into a grid and solving the wave equation at each point on the grid. The solution at each point is then used to calculate the solution at neighboring points, resulting in a numerical solution of the wave equation.

Another approach is the use of the finite-element method, which involves dividing the medium into smaller elements and solving the wave equation for each element. The solutions for each element are then combined to obtain a solution for the entire medium.

#### 6.1a.3 Applications of Forward Modeling

Forward modeling has a wide range of applications in geophysical imaging. It is used to predict the behavior of seismic waves as they propagate through the near-surface media, which is crucial for understanding the subsurface structure and properties.

One of the main applications of forward modeling is in the design and interpretation of seismic surveys. By using forward modeling, we can predict the arrival times and amplitudes of seismic waves at different locations, which can then be compared to actual measurements to identify subsurface structures and properties.

Forward modeling is also used in the development of seismic imaging techniques, such as seismic tomography. By using forward modeling, we can simulate the propagation of seismic waves through different media and compare the results to actual measurements to create images of the subsurface structure.

In conclusion, forward modeling is a crucial aspect of waveform modeling and has numerous applications in geophysical imaging. By understanding the principles and techniques of forward modeling, we can gain valuable insights into the properties and structure of the near-surface media.

One of the main challenges is the accuracy of the mathematical models used. These models are based on assumptions and simplifications, which may not accurately represent the complex geological structures and interfaces present in the near-surface media.

Additionally, forward modeling can be computationally intensive, especially for large-scale problems. This can limit its practical application in certain scenarios.

Despite these challenges, forward modeling remains an essential tool in geophysical imaging, providing valuable insights into the behavior of seismic waves in near-surface media. With advancements in technology and computing power, it is expected to play an even more significant role in the future.

### Section: 7.1 Surface wave analysis techniques:

Surface waves are a type of seismic wave that travels along the surface of the Earth. They are generated by the interaction of primary waves with the Earth's surface and can provide valuable information about the subsurface properties. In this section, we will explore the various techniques used for analyzing surface waves and their applications in geophysical imaging.

#### 7.1a Analysis of dispersion in surface wave data

Dispersion is a phenomenon that occurs when surface waves of varying wavelengths travel at different speeds. This is due to the variation of velocities with wavelength in the subsurface. The analysis of dispersion in surface wave data is a crucial step in understanding the subsurface properties.

To analyze dispersion in surface wave data, we first need to obtain the dispersion curve. This curve is a plot of the phase velocity of surface waves against the wavelength. It can be obtained by measuring the travel time of surface waves over a known distance. The dispersion curve can then be compared to theoretical models to determine the subsurface properties.

One of the most commonly used methods for analyzing dispersion in surface wave data is the least-squares inversion method. This method involves fitting a theoretical model to the dispersion curve by minimizing the difference between the observed and predicted phase velocities. The resulting model can then be used to estimate the subsurface properties.

Another method for analyzing dispersion in surface wave data is the spectral analysis method. This method involves decomposing the dispersion curve into its individual frequency components. The amplitude and phase of each component can then be analyzed to determine the subsurface properties.

The analysis of dispersion in surface wave data has numerous applications in geophysical imaging. It can be used to estimate the velocity structure of the subsurface, which is crucial for understanding the propagation of seismic waves. It can also be used to identify the presence of interfaces between different layers in the subsurface. Additionally, dispersion analysis can be used to estimate the elastic properties of the subsurface, such as the shear wave velocity and the bulk modulus.

In conclusion, the analysis of dispersion in surface wave data is a powerful tool for understanding the subsurface properties. It allows us to estimate the velocity structure, identify interfaces, and estimate the elastic properties of the subsurface. With the advancements in technology and computing power, dispersion analysis has become an essential tool in geophysical imaging. 





### Subsection: 7.1b Separation and characterization of Love and Rayleigh waves

Surface waves can be classified into two basic types: Love waves and Rayleigh waves. Love waves travel in a traverse manner, with particle motion perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. On the other hand, Rayleigh waves travel in a longitudinal manner, with particle motion parallel to the direction of wave propagation. These waves can provide valuable information about the subsurface properties, but their analysis can be challenging due to their complex nature.

One of the key challenges in analyzing surface waves is separating Love and Rayleigh waves. These waves can interact with each other, leading to the formation of hybrid waves that exhibit characteristics of both Love and Rayleigh waves. This interaction can make it difficult to accurately identify and characterize the individual waves.

To address this challenge, various techniques have been developed for separating and characterizing Love and Rayleigh waves. One such technique is the spectral analysis method, which was briefly mentioned in the previous section. This method involves decomposing the dispersion curve into its individual frequency components. The amplitude and phase of each component can then be analyzed to determine the characteristics of Love and Rayleigh waves.

Another technique for separating and characterizing Love and Rayleigh waves is the least-squares inversion method. This method involves fitting a theoretical model to the dispersion curve by minimizing the difference between the observed and predicted phase velocities. The resulting model can then be used to estimate the characteristics of Love and Rayleigh waves.

In addition to these techniques, there are also various software tools available for analyzing surface waves. These tools can help automate the process of separating and characterizing Love and Rayleigh waves, making it easier to obtain accurate results.

In conclusion, the separation and characterization of Love and Rayleigh waves is a crucial aspect of surface wave analysis. Various techniques and tools have been developed to address this challenge, and it is important for geophysicists to have a thorough understanding of these methods in order to accurately interpret surface wave data.

In the context of geophysical imaging, seismic interferometry allows us to combine multiple seismic signals to create a more accurate and detailed image of the subsurface.

We will also discuss the various applications of seismic interferometry in near-surface geophysical imaging, including its advantages and limitations. Additionally, we will cover the practical aspects of implementing seismic interferometry, such as data acquisition and processing techniques.

#### 8.1a: Basic Principles of Seismic Interferometry

The basic principle behind seismic interferometry is the interference of waves. When two or more waves interact with each other, their amplitudes can either add up constructively or cancel out destructively, depending on their phase difference. This phase difference is determined by the difference in the travel time of the waves from the source to the receiver.

In seismic interferometry, multiple seismic signals are recorded at different locations, and these signals are then combined to create a more accurate image of the subsurface. This is achieved by exploiting the interference patterns between the waves, which can provide valuable information about the subsurface properties.

The mathematical model behind seismic interferometry is based on the principle of wave superposition, where the resultant wave is the sum of the individual waves. This can be represented mathematically as:

$$
R(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i \cos(2\pi f_i t + \phi_i)
$$

where $R(t)$ is the resultant wave, $A_i$ is the amplitude of the $i$th wave, $f_i$ is the frequency of the $i$th wave, and $\phi_i$ is the phase of the $i$th wave.

The phase difference between two waves, $\Delta \phi$, can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
\Delta \phi = 2\pi f_i \Delta t
$$

where $\Delta t$ is the difference in travel time between the two waves.

By combining multiple seismic signals with different travel times, we can create a more accurate image of the subsurface. This is because the interference patterns between the waves can provide information about the subsurface properties, such as the presence of interfaces or changes in velocity.

In the next section, we will discuss the various applications of seismic interferometry in near-surface geophysical imaging, including its advantages and limitations. Additionally, we will cover the practical aspects of implementing seismic interferometry, such as data acquisition and processing techniques.

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have discussed various techniques and methods for imaging the near-surface geophysical data. However, these techniques often encounter challenges due to the presence of short-wavelength residual statics. These residual statics can significantly affect the accuracy and reliability of the imaging results. In this chapter, we will delve into the topic of short-wavelength residual statics corrections, which is a crucial aspect of near-surface geophysical imaging.

Short-wavelength residual statics refer to the small-scale variations in the Earth's gravitational field and magnetic field that are not accounted for in the imaging process. These variations can arise due to various factors such as topography, subsurface inhomogeneities, and surface roughness. The presence of these residual statics can lead to errors in the imaging results, making it necessary to correct for them.

In this chapter, we will explore the different methods and techniques used for correcting short-wavelength residual statics. We will discuss the principles behind these methods and their applications in near-surface geophysical imaging. We will also cover the challenges and limitations of these methods and how to overcome them.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of short-wavelength residual statics corrections and their importance in near-surface geophysical imaging. This knowledge will be valuable for students, researchers, and professionals in the field of geophysics, as it will enable them to accurately and reliably image the near-surface geophysical data. So, let us begin our journey into the world of short-wavelength residual statics corrections.




### Section: 8.1 Statics corrections for near-surface layers:

In the previous chapters, we have discussed various techniques and methods for imaging the near-surface geophysical data. However, these techniques often encounter challenges due to the presence of short-wavelength residual statics. These residual statics can significantly affect the accuracy and reliability of the imaging results. In this section, we will delve into the topic of statics corrections for near-surface layers, which is a crucial aspect of near-surface geophysical imaging.

#### 8.1a Methods for correcting static shifts in near-surface layers

Short-wavelength residual statics refer to the small-scale variations in the Earth's gravitational field and magnetic field that are not accounted for in the imaging process. These variations can arise due to various factors such as topography, subsurface inhomogeneities, and surface roughness. The presence of these residual statics can lead to errors in the imaging results, making it necessary to correct for them.

One of the most commonly used methods for correcting static shifts in near-surface layers is the Gauss-Seidel method. This method is an iterative technique that is used to solve a system of linear equations. In the context of near-surface geophysical imaging, the Gauss-Seidel method is used to correct for static shifts by iteratively adjusting the unknown parameters until the residual statics are minimized.

Another method for correcting static shifts is the use of critical state soil mechanics. This method is based on the concept of critical state, which is the state at which a soil or rock material reaches its maximum strength and stability. By understanding the critical state of the near-surface layers, we can correct for static shifts by adjusting the unknown parameters to match the critical state conditions.

In addition to these methods, there are also other techniques that can be used for correcting static shifts in near-surface layers. These include the use of plane stress and plane strain states of stress, as well as the separation of the stress state matrix into distortional and volumetric parts. These methods are based on the principles of mechanics and can be used to correct for static shifts by understanding the stress conditions in the near-surface layers.

It is important to note that while these methods can be effective in correcting static shifts, they also have their limitations. For example, the Gauss-Seidel method may not always converge to a solution, and the critical state soil mechanics method may not be applicable in all cases. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the limitations and applicability of these methods when using them for correcting static shifts in near-surface layers.

Ray tracing is a powerful technique used in near-surface geophysical imaging to accurately represent the Earth's surface and subsurface structures. It is based on the principle of tracing rays from a known source to a point of interest, and then using this information to construct an image of the Earth's surface and subsurface.

The principles of ray tracing are based on the concept of ray casting, which is a fundamental algorithm in computer graphics. Ray casting involves tracing rays from the eye of the observer to sample the light traveling towards the observer from a given direction. This technique is particularly useful in near-surface imaging as it allows for the accurate representation of complex surface and subsurface structures.

One of the key advantages of ray tracing is its ability to handle non-planar surfaces and solids. This is particularly important in near-surface imaging, where the Earth's surface and subsurface structures are often complex and non-uniform. By using ray tracing, we can accurately represent these structures and account for any short-wavelength residual statics that may be present.

In addition to its applications in near-surface imaging, ray tracing has also been used in other fields such as solid modeling and computer-aided design. By using solid modeling techniques, we can create elaborate objects that can be easily rendered using ray tracing. This makes it a valuable tool in near-surface imaging, where we often need to accurately represent complex structures and surfaces.

In conclusion, ray tracing is a powerful technique that has numerous applications in near-surface geophysical imaging. By understanding the principles of ray tracing and its applications, we can effectively correct for short-wavelength residual statics and accurately represent the Earth's surface and subsurface structures.

## Chapter 9: Beyond seismic statics corrections:




### Section: 9.1 Dynamic corrections for near-surface effects:

In the previous chapters, we have discussed the basics of seismic imaging and the various corrections that are necessary to obtain accurate results. However, these corrections are often limited to the statics of the system and do not take into account the dynamic effects of the near-surface. In this section, we will explore the dynamic corrections for near-surface effects and their importance in seismic imaging.

#### 9.1a Correction of dynamic near-surface effects on seismic data

The near-surface effects on seismic data are dynamic in nature and cannot be fully corrected for using statics. These effects are caused by the interaction of the seismic wave with the near-surface structure, which can significantly alter the wave's characteristics. This can lead to errors in the interpretation of the seismic data and can hinder the accuracy of the imaging process.

One of the main dynamic effects is the change in the wave's velocity due to the near-surface structure. As the wave propagates through the near-surface, it can encounter variations in the velocity of the medium, which can cause changes in the wave's phase and amplitude. This can result in distortions in the seismic data and can make it difficult to accurately interpret the subsurface structure.

Another important dynamic effect is the scattering of the wave by the near-surface structure. As the wave interacts with the near-surface, it can be scattered in different directions, resulting in multiple reflections and refractions. This can lead to the formation of complex wavefronts, which can be difficult to interpret and can result in errors in the imaging process.

To correct for these dynamic effects, advanced imaging techniques such as seismic inversion and migration are used. These techniques take into account the dynamic effects of the near-surface and can provide more accurate results compared to traditional imaging methods.

Seismic inversion is a process that involves the use of seismic data to estimate the properties of the subsurface structure. This technique takes into account the dynamic effects of the near-surface and can provide a more accurate estimate of the subsurface structure compared to traditional imaging methods.

Migration is another advanced imaging technique that is used to correct for the dynamic effects of the near-surface. This technique involves the use of a migration operator, which is designed to correct for the distortions caused by the near-surface structure. By applying the migration operator to the seismic data, the resulting image can be improved and can provide a more accurate representation of the subsurface structure.

In addition to these advanced imaging techniques, there are also various methods for correcting for the dynamic effects of the near-surface. These include the use of velocity models, which can be used to account for the changes in velocity caused by the near-surface structure. Other methods include the use of scattering models, which can be used to account for the scattering of the wave by the near-surface structure.

In conclusion, the dynamic corrections for near-surface effects are crucial in obtaining accurate results in seismic imaging. By taking into account the dynamic effects of the near-surface, advanced imaging techniques and methods can provide more accurate results compared to traditional imaging methods. As technology continues to advance, it is important for geophysicists to continue exploring and developing new techniques for correcting for these dynamic effects.

To correct for these dynamic effects, advanced imaging techniques such as seismic inversion and migration are used. These techniques take into account the dynamic effects of the near-surface and can provide more accurate results compared to traditional imaging methods.

#### 9.1b Suppression of multiples and ground roll in near-surface imaging

In addition to the dynamic effects mentioned above, there are also other factors that can affect the accuracy of near-surface imaging. One of these factors is the presence of multiples and ground roll in the seismic data. Multiples are reflections that are caused by the interaction of the seismic wave with multiple interfaces, while ground roll is the result of the wave propagating through the near-surface.

Both multiples and ground roll can cause significant distortions in the seismic data and can make it difficult to accurately interpret the subsurface structure. Therefore, it is important to suppress these effects in order to obtain accurate results.

One method for suppressing multiples and ground roll is through the use of dynamic corrections. These corrections take into account the dynamic effects of the near-surface and can help to reduce the impact of multiples and ground roll on the seismic data.

Another approach is through the use of advanced imaging techniques such as seismic inversion and migration. These techniques can help to remove the effects of multiples and ground roll by incorporating information from other sources, such as well data or surface geophysical surveys.

In conclusion, the suppression of multiples and ground roll is crucial for accurate near-surface imaging. By using dynamic corrections and advanced imaging techniques, we can help to reduce the impact of these effects and obtain more accurate results. 





### Section: 9.1c Advanced techniques for improved near-surface imaging

In addition to the dynamic corrections discussed in the previous section, there are also advanced techniques that can be used to improve near-surface imaging. These techniques take into account the complex interactions between the seismic wave and the near-surface structure, and can provide more accurate results compared to traditional imaging methods.

One such technique is the use of seismic inversion. This technique involves using the seismic data to estimate the subsurface structure, and then using this estimate to correct for the dynamic effects of the near-surface. This can be done using various methods, such as the Gauss-Seidel method, which is commonly used in numerical analysis.

Another advanced technique is the use of migration. Migration is a process that involves moving the seismic data to a reference location, where it can be better interpreted. This technique takes into account the dynamic effects of the near-surface and can provide more accurate results compared to traditional imaging methods.

In addition to these techniques, there are also other advanced methods that can be used to improve near-surface imaging, such as the use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. MIMO systems involve using multiple sources and receivers to collect seismic data, which can provide more accurate results compared to traditional single-input single-output (SISO) systems.

Overall, the use of advanced techniques for improved near-surface imaging is crucial in obtaining accurate results in seismic imaging. These techniques take into account the dynamic effects of the near-surface and can provide more accurate results compared to traditional imaging methods. As technology continues to advance, it is important for geophysicists to stay updated on these techniques and incorporate them into their imaging processes.

### Section: 10.1 Integration of seismic and non-seismic data:

In the previous chapters, we have discussed various geophysical imaging techniques and their applications in understanding the Earth's subsurface. However, these techniques are often used in isolation, providing a limited understanding of the subsurface. In this section, we will explore the concept of integrating seismic and non-seismic data to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the near-surface geology.

#### 10.1a Introduction to joint inversion of seismic and non-seismic data

Seismic data is one of the most commonly used geophysical data sets for imaging the Earth's subsurface. It provides information about the velocity and density of the subsurface, which can be used to create images of the subsurface structure. However, seismic data alone is limited in its ability to provide a complete understanding of the subsurface. This is where non-seismic data, such as gravity and electromagnetic data, can be integrated to provide a more comprehensive understanding.

Non-seismic data provides information about the gravity and electromagnetic properties of the subsurface, which can be used to complement the information obtained from seismic data. By integrating these data sets, we can obtain a more accurate and detailed understanding of the near-surface geology.

The integration of seismic and non-seismic data is achieved through a process called joint inversion. This involves the simultaneous inversion of multiple data sets, such as seismic, gravity, and electromagnetic data. This approach allows for the integration of different types of data, providing a more complete picture of the subsurface. By combining these data sets, we can obtain a more accurate and detailed understanding of the near-surface geology, including the location and properties of subsurface structures.

In the following sections, we will discuss the principles and techniques of joint inversion, including the mathematical models and algorithms used for inversion. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of joint inversion, as well as its applications in various fields such as mineral exploration, hydrocarbon exploration, and environmental studies.

#### 10.1b Algorithms for joint inversion of multiple geophysical datasets

The integration of seismic and non-seismic data is achieved through a process called joint inversion. This involves the simultaneous inversion of multiple data sets, such as seismic, gravity, and electromagnetic data. This approach allows for the integration of different types of data, providing a more complete picture of the subsurface. By combining these data sets, we can obtain a more accurate and detailed understanding of the near-surface geology, including the location and properties of subsurface structures.

The joint inversion process involves the use of algorithms that can handle the integration of multiple data sets. These algorithms are designed to solve for the unknown parameters that describe the subsurface structure, such as velocity, density, and gravity and electromagnetic properties. The algorithms use a combination of optimization techniques and numerical methods to solve for these parameters.

One commonly used algorithm for joint inversion is the Gauss-Seidel method. This method involves iteratively solving for the unknown parameters by using the equations that relate them to the observed data. The equations are solved in a sequential manner, with the solution for one parameter being used to update the solution for the next parameter. This process is repeated until the solution converges to a stable value.

Another commonly used algorithm is the Levenberg-Marquardt method. This method uses a combination of gradient descent and Newton's method to solve for the unknown parameters. It starts with an initial guess for the parameters and iteratively updates the parameters until the solution converges to a minimum.

Other algorithms that can be used for joint inversion include the simplex method, the interior point method, and the genetic algorithm. Each of these algorithms has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of algorithm depends on the specific problem at hand.

In the next section, we will discuss the challenges and limitations of joint inversion and how these algorithms can be used to overcome them.





#### 10.1b Techniques for joint inversion of seismic and non-seismic data

Joint inversion of seismic and non-seismic data is a complex process that requires the use of advanced mathematical techniques. These techniques are used to solve the inverse problem of determining the subsurface properties from the measured data. In this section, we will discuss some of the commonly used techniques for joint inversion.

##### 10.1b.1 Geostatistical Inversion

Geostatistical inversion is a powerful technique for joint inversion of seismic and non-seismic data. It is based on the principles of geostatistics, which is the statistical analysis of spatial data. Geostatistical inversion involves the simultaneous inversion of multiple data sets, such as seismic, gravity, and electromagnetic data. This approach allows for the integration of different types of data, providing a more complete picture of the subsurface.

One of the key advantages of geostatistical inversion is its ability to handle uncertain and incomplete data. This is achieved through the use of geostatistical techniques, such as kriging and cokriging, which allow for the estimation of unknown values based on known values. This is particularly useful when dealing with sparse data sets, such as those obtained from non-seismic data.

##### 10.1b.2 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling

Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling is a statistical technique used in geostatistical inversion. It involves the use of a random walk to explore the parameter space and generate a large number of samples. These samples are then used to estimate the probability distribution of the unknown parameters.

MCMC sampling is particularly useful in joint inversion, as it allows for the simultaneous inversion of multiple data sets. It also allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge and constraints, which can help to improve the accuracy of the inversion results.

##### 10.1b.3 Pluri-Gaussian Lithology Modeling

Pluri-Gaussian lithology modeling is a technique used in geostatistical inversion to model the lithology of the subsurface. It involves the use of multiple Gaussian distributions to represent the different lithologies present in the subsurface. This approach allows for the modeling of complex lithological variations, which is particularly useful in joint inversion.

##### 10.1b.4 Multiple-Angle-Stack Seismic Volumes

Multiple-angle-stack seismic volumes are a type of seismic data that can be used in joint inversion. They are obtained by stacking seismic data from multiple angles, which allows for a more complete understanding of the subsurface structure. This type of data is particularly useful in joint inversion, as it provides a more accurate representation of the subsurface.

In conclusion, joint inversion of seismic and non-seismic data is a complex process that requires the use of advanced mathematical techniques. These techniques, such as geostatistical inversion, MCMC sampling, pluri-Gaussian lithology modeling, and multiple-angle-stack seismic volumes, allow for the integration of different types of data and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the near-surface geology. 


#### 10.1c Challenges and solutions in joint inversion of seismic and non-seismic data

Joint inversion of seismic and non-seismic data is a powerful technique for understanding the near-surface geology. However, it also presents several challenges that must be addressed in order to obtain accurate results. In this section, we will discuss some of the key challenges and solutions in joint inversion.

##### 10.1c.1 Data Integration

One of the main challenges in joint inversion is integrating different types of data. Seismic data, for example, provides information about the velocity and density of the subsurface, while non-seismic data, such as gravity and electromagnetic data, provides information about the gravity and electromagnetic properties of the subsurface. These data sets may have different scales, resolutions, and units, making it difficult to combine them into a single model.

To address this challenge, advanced mathematical techniques, such as geostatistical inversion and MCMC sampling, are used to integrate different types of data. These techniques allow for the simultaneous inversion of multiple data sets, providing a more complete picture of the subsurface.

##### 10.1c.2 Uncertainty and Incomplete Data

Another challenge in joint inversion is dealing with uncertain and incomplete data. Seismic data, for example, may be affected by noise and artifacts, while non-seismic data may be sparse or incomplete. This can make it difficult to obtain accurate results from joint inversion.

To address this challenge, advanced techniques, such as kriging and cokriging, are used to estimate unknown values based on known values. These techniques take into account the uncertainty and incompleteness of the data, providing more accurate results.

##### 10.1c.3 Regularization and Optimization

Joint inversion is a complex process that involves solving a large number of equations. This can lead to overfitting, where the model becomes too complex and fits the data too closely, resulting in poor generalization. To address this challenge, regularization and optimization techniques are used to control the complexity of the model and prevent overfitting.

Regularization techniques, such as Tikhonov regularization and LASSO, are used to penalize complex models and prevent overfitting. Optimization techniques, such as gradient descent and Newton's method, are used to find the optimal values for the model parameters.

##### 10.1c.4 Interpretation and Validation

Finally, one of the key challenges in joint inversion is interpretation and validation of the results. The output of joint inversion is a model of the subsurface, which must be interpreted and validated against other data and knowledge. This can be a difficult and time-consuming process, especially for complex models.

To address this challenge, advanced techniques, such as sensitivity analysis and model comparison, are used to interpret and validate the results. Sensitivity analysis is used to understand how changes in the input data affect the output model, while model comparison is used to compare different models and select the most accurate one.

In conclusion, joint inversion of seismic and non-seismic data presents several challenges that must be addressed in order to obtain accurate results. However, with the use of advanced mathematical techniques and careful interpretation and validation, joint inversion can provide a powerful tool for understanding the near-surface geology.





#### 10.1d Strategies for successful near-surface imaging using joint inversion approaches

Joint inversion approaches have proven to be highly effective in near-surface imaging, providing a comprehensive understanding of the subsurface properties. However, the success of these approaches depends on several factors, including the quality and quantity of the data, the choice of inversion technique, and the interpretation of the results. In this section, we will discuss some strategies for successful near-surface imaging using joint inversion approaches.

##### 10.1d.1 Data Quality and Quantity

The quality and quantity of the data are crucial for the success of any inversion approach. High-quality data, such as high-resolution seismic data, can provide detailed information about the subsurface properties. However, the quality of the data can be affected by various factors, including the type of the data, the acquisition method, and the processing techniques. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that the data is of high quality before proceeding with the inversion.

The quantity of the data is also important, especially when dealing with sparse data sets. In such cases, advanced techniques, such as geostatistical inversion and MCMC sampling, can be used to handle the uncertainty and incompleteness of the data. These techniques allow for the estimation of unknown values based on known values, providing a more complete picture of the subsurface.

##### 10.1d.2 Choice of Inversion Technique

The choice of inversion technique is another critical factor in successful near-surface imaging. Different techniques have different strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on the specific requirements of the study. For example, geostatistical inversion is particularly useful when dealing with uncertain and incomplete data, while MCMC sampling is useful for incorporating prior knowledge and constraints.

##### 10.1d.3 Interpretation of Results

The interpretation of the results is a crucial step in the inversion process. It involves the interpretation of the inverted parameters and the validation of the results against other data sets. This step is often overlooked, but it is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the inversion results.

In conclusion, successful near-surface imaging using joint inversion approaches requires careful consideration of the data quality and quantity, the choice of inversion technique, and the interpretation of the results. By following these strategies, it is possible to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the subsurface properties, which is crucial for various applications, including resource exploration, environmental studies, and infrastructure planning.

#### 11.1a Imaging of underground utilities and infrastructure in urban areas

The imaging of underground utilities and infrastructure in urban areas is a critical aspect of near-surface geophysical imaging. This section will focus on the imaging of underground utilities, specifically water and sewerage systems, in urban areas.

##### Water and Sewerage Systems

Water and sewerage systems are essential for the functioning of urban areas. They are buried underground, making them difficult to visualize and understand. Near-surface geophysical imaging techniques can provide valuable insights into these systems, aiding in their planning, design, and maintenance.

###### Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR)

Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a non-invasive geophysical method that uses electromagnetic waves to image the subsurface. It is particularly useful for imaging water and sewerage systems. The GPR antenna transmits a short pulse of electromagnetic energy into the ground. The energy propagates through the ground and is reflected by the boundaries between different materials. The reflected signals are received by the antenna and processed to create an image of the subsurface.

In the context of water and sewerage systems, GPR can be used to image the pipes and their depth. The GPR signal is reflected by the pipe-soil interface, providing information about the pipe's depth and location. This information can be used to plan and design new water and sewerage systems, and to identify and repair leaks in existing systems.

###### Electromagnetic Induction (EMI)

Electromagnetic induction (EMI) is another non-invasive geophysical method that can be used to image water and sewerage systems. It uses the principle of electromagnetic induction to detect the presence of metal pipes. A transmitter coil is used to generate a magnetic field, which induces an eddy current in the metal pipes. The eddy current creates a secondary magnetic field, which can be detected by a receiver coil. The strength of the detected signal is proportional to the distance between the coils and the pipe.

In the context of water and sewerage systems, EMI can be used to detect the presence of metal pipes. This can be particularly useful in areas where the pipes are not marked or where the markers are damaged or missing. EMI can also be used to identify the direction of the pipes, which can be useful in planning and designing new systems.

###### Ground Resistance

Ground resistance is a geophysical property that can be used to image water and sewerage systems. The resistance of the ground is influenced by the presence of water and sewerage pipes. The presence of these pipes increases the ground's conductivity, which decreases its resistance.

In the context of water and sewerage systems, ground resistance can be used to detect the presence of pipes. This can be done using the Wenner configuration, which is a four-electrode resistivity method. The Wenner configuration is particularly useful for imaging pipes that are parallel to the direction of the current flow.

In conclusion, near-surface geophysical imaging techniques, such as GPR, EMI, and ground resistance, can provide valuable insights into underground water and sewerage systems. These techniques can aid in the planning, design, and maintenance of these systems, contributing to the sustainability and livability of urban areas.

For example, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) can be used to image the subsurface of an archaeological site, providing information about the depth and extent of buried features. Electrical resistance meters can also be used to detect buried features, particularly those that are made of materials with different electrical resistivities.

##### Archaeological Preservation

Geophysical investigations can also play a crucial role in the preservation of archaeological sites. By providing non-invasive methods for investigating the subsurface, geophysical investigations can help to minimize the impact of archaeological excavations on the site.

For example, in the case of the archaeological site of Tell el-Dab'a in Egypt, geophysical investigations were used to map the subsurface features of the site without the need for extensive excavations. This helped to preserve the site for future generations.

##### Interpretation of Geophysical Data

Interpretation of geophysical data requires a knowledge both of the archaeological record, and of the way it is expressed geophysically. For example, the presence of a high-resistivity anomaly in the subsurface may indicate the presence of a buried wall or other archaeological feature. However, the interpretation of such anomalies requires a detailed understanding of the archaeological context and of the geophysical properties of the materials involved.

In conclusion, geophysical investigations have become an indispensable tool in archaeological site mapping and preservation. By providing non-invasive and cost-effective methods for investigating the subsurface, these investigations can help to enhance our understanding of the archaeological record and to preserve archaeological sites for future generations.

### Section: 13.1c Deconvolution and Spectral Balancing

Deconvolution and spectral balancing are essential techniques in seismic data processing. They are used to improve the quality of seismic data and enhance the accuracy of geophysical imaging.

#### 13.1c.1 Deconvolution

Deconvolution is a mathematical process that involves the removal of a known signal from a recorded signal. In seismic data processing, deconvolution is used to remove the effects of the instrument response from the recorded seismic data. This is important because the instrument response can distort the true signal, making it difficult to interpret the data accurately.

The deconvolution process involves convolving the recorded signal with the known instrument response. This results in a signal that is a combination of the true signal and the instrument response. By convolving this signal with the inverse of the instrument response, the instrument response can be removed, leaving behind the true signal.

#### 13.1c.2 Spectral Balancing

Spectral balancing is a technique used to adjust the spectral content of a signal. In seismic data processing, spectral balancing is used to adjust the spectral content of the recorded seismic data to match the spectral content of the true signal.

The spectral content of a signal refers to the distribution of energy across different frequencies. In seismic data processing, it is important to ensure that the recorded data has the same spectral content as the true signal. This is because the spectral content of the signal can provide valuable information about the subsurface properties.

Spectral balancing is achieved by adjusting the gain of the recorded signal at different frequencies. This can be done using various techniques, such as the least-squares spectral analysis (LSSA) method. The LSSA method involves fitting a set of sinusoidal components to the recorded signal and adjusting the gain of each component to match the spectral content of the true signal.

#### 13.1c.3 Applications of Deconvolution and Spectral Balancing

Deconvolution and spectral balancing have a wide range of applications in seismic data processing. They are used to improve the quality of recorded seismic data, enhance the accuracy of geophysical imaging, and extract valuable information about the subsurface properties.

In addition, deconvolution and spectral balancing are also used in other fields, such as image processing and signal processing. In image processing, deconvolution is used to remove the effects of blurring from images, while spectral balancing is used to adjust the spectral content of images to match the spectral content of the original scene. In signal processing, deconvolution and spectral balancing are used to improve the quality of recorded signals and extract valuable information from them.

### Conclusion

Deconvolution and spectral balancing are powerful techniques in seismic data processing. They are used to improve the quality of recorded seismic data and enhance the accuracy of geophysical imaging. By understanding and applying these techniques, geophysicists can extract valuable information about the subsurface properties and make more accurate interpretations of seismic data.

In the previous sections, we have discussed the techniques of deconvolution and spectral balancing, which are essential for improving the quality of seismic data. In this section, we will discuss another important aspect of seismic data processing: statics and dynamics corrections.

#### 13.1d.1 Static Corrections

Static corrections are necessary when the recorded seismic data is affected by static errors, which are errors that do not change with time. These errors can be caused by various factors, such as the presence of a constant velocity gradient in the subsurface, or a constant offset between the source and the receiver.

The process of static correction involves correcting the recorded data to account for these errors. This is typically done by applying a static correction factor to the data. The correction factor is determined by the type and magnitude of the static error.

#### 13.1d.2 Dynamics Corrections

Dynamics corrections are necessary when the recorded seismic data is affected by dynamics errors, which are errors that change with time. These errors can be caused by various factors, such as the presence of a time-varying velocity gradient in the subsurface, or a time-varying offset between the source and the receiver.

The process of dynamics correction involves correcting the recorded data to account for these errors. This is typically done by applying a dynamics correction factor to the data. The correction factor is determined by the type and magnitude of the dynamics error.

#### 13.1d.3 Combining Static and Dynamics Corrections

In some cases, both static and dynamics corrections may be necessary for a given set of seismic data. In such cases, the corrections are typically applied in the following order: static corrections first, followed by dynamics corrections.

The combination of static and dynamics corrections can be challenging, as the two types of corrections can interact with each other. However, with careful consideration and the use of appropriate techniques, it is possible to achieve accurate corrections and improve the quality of the seismic data.

In the next section, we will discuss the techniques of migration and velocity analysis, which are essential for imaging the subsurface from the recorded seismic data.

### Section: 15.1 Deterministic Inversion:

Deterministic inversion is a powerful technique used in geophysics to extract information about the subsurface from seismic data. It involves the use of mathematical models and algorithms to interpret the data and create a detailed image of the subsurface. In this section, we will explore the fundamentals of deterministic inversion, including its principles, applications, and limitations.

#### 15.1a Acoustic Inversion

Acoustic inversion is a type of deterministic inversion that is commonly used in geophysics. It involves the use of acoustic waves to image the subsurface. Acoustic waves are mechanical waves that travel through a medium, and they are commonly used in seismic exploration due to their ability to penetrate the Earth's surface and provide information about the subsurface.

The process of acoustic inversion involves the use of mathematical models and algorithms to interpret the data collected from acoustic waves. This data can include information about the velocity of the waves, the attenuation of the waves, and the reflection and refraction of the waves at the boundaries of different layers in the subsurface. By analyzing this data, geophysicists can create a detailed image of the subsurface, including the presence of different layers and their properties.

One of the key principles behind acoustic inversion is the use of seismic Q-filtering. This technique involves the use of a Q-filter to remove unwanted noise from the seismic data. The Q-filter is a mathematical model that takes into account the frequency and phase of the seismic waves, and it is used to isolate the desired signal from the noise. This allows for a more accurate interpretation of the data and a more detailed image of the subsurface.

Another important aspect of acoustic inversion is the use of the MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Classification) algorithm. This algorithm is used to estimate the direction of arrival of seismic waves and to classify them into different sources. By using the MUSIC algorithm, geophysicists can determine the number of sources present in the subsurface and their respective directions of arrival. This information can then be used to create a more accurate image of the subsurface.

However, there are also limitations to acoustic inversion. One of the main limitations is the assumption that the number of sources present in the subsurface is less than the number of elements in the measurement vector. This assumption may not always hold true, and it can lead to inaccuracies in the resulting image. Additionally, the accuracy of the image is highly dependent on the quality of the data collected and the accuracy of the mathematical models and algorithms used for inversion.

In conclusion, acoustic inversion is a powerful technique used in geophysics to image the subsurface. By using mathematical models and algorithms, geophysicists can extract valuable information about the subsurface and create detailed images. However, it is important to consider the limitations and potential inaccuracies of this technique in order to interpret the results accurately.

## Pre-stack seismic resolution inversion

Pre-stack inversion is often used when post-stack inversion fails to sufficiently differentiate geologic features with similar P-impedance signatures. Simultaneous inversion solves for S-impedance and density, in addition to P-impedance. While many geologic features can express similar P-impedance characteristics, few will share combined P-impedance and S-impedance traits (allowing improved separation and clarity). Often a feasibility study using the wells logs will indicate whether separation of the desired lithotype can be achieved with P-impedance alone or whether S-impedance is also required. This will dictate whether a pre- or post-stack inversion is needed.

Simultaneous Inversion (SI) is a pre-stack method that uses multiple offset or angle seismic sub-stacks and their associated wavelets as input; it generates P-impedance, S-impedance and density as outputs (although the density output resolution is rarely as high as the impedances). This helps improve discrimination between lithology, porosity and fluid effects. For each input partial stack, a unique wavelet is estimated. All models, partial stacks and wavelets are input to a single inversion algorithm — enabling inversion to effectively compensate for offset-dependent phase, bandwidth, tuning and NMO stretch effects.

The inversion algorithm works by first estimating angle-dependent P-wave reflectivities for the input-partial stacks. Next, these are used with the full Zoeppritz equations (or approximations, such as Aki–Richards, for some algorithms) to find band-limited elastic reflectivities. These are in turn merged with their low-frequency counterparts from the model and integrated to elastic properties. This approximate result is then improved in a final inversion for P-impedance, S-impedance and density, subject to various hard and soft constraints. One constraint can control the regularization of the solution, which can be used to prevent overfitting and improve the stability of the inversion.

### Subsection: 15.1b Elastic Inversion

Elastic inversion is another type of deterministic inversion that is commonly used in geophysics. It involves the use of elastic waves to image the subsurface. Elastic waves are mechanical waves that travel through a medium, and they are commonly used in seismic exploration due to their ability to penetrate the Earth's surface and provide information about the subsurface.

By analyzing this data, geophysicists can create a detailed image of the subsurface, including the presence of different layers and their properties.

One of the key principles behind elastic inversion is the use of seismic Q-filtering, similar to acoustic inversion. However, elastic inversion also takes into account the anisotropy of the subsurface, which refers to the directional dependence of the properties of the subsurface. This allows for a more accurate interpretation of the data and a more detailed image of the subsurface.

Another important aspect of elastic inversion is the use of the full waveform inversion (FWI) method. This method involves the use of the full wavefield, rather than just the reflected or transmitted waves, to image the subsurface. This allows for a more detailed and accurate image of the subsurface, but it also requires more complex mathematical models and algorithms.

In conclusion, deterministic inversion is a powerful technique used in geophysics to extract information about the subsurface from seismic data. Acoustic and elastic inversion are two common types of deterministic inversion, each with its own principles, applications, and limitations. By understanding these techniques and their applications, geophysicists can create detailed images of the subsurface and gain a better understanding of the Earth's structure and properties.





### Section: 15.1c Joint Inversion

Joint inversion is a powerful technique used in geophysical imaging that combines the principles of deterministic and stochastic inversion. It is particularly useful in cases where the geological structure is complex and the data is noisy. Joint inversion allows for the simultaneous inversion of multiple parameters, such as P-impedance, S-impedance, and density, which can improve the accuracy and reliability of the inversion results.

#### 15.1c.1 Principles of Joint Inversion

Joint inversion is based on the principle of simultaneous inversion, where multiple parameters are inverted simultaneously. This is in contrast to deterministic inversion, where only one parameter is inverted at a time. The joint inversion approach allows for the incorporation of constraints between the different parameters, which can help to stabilize the inversion process and improve the quality of the results.

The joint inversion process involves the following steps:

1. The first step is to define the parameters to be inverted. This typically includes P-impedance, S-impedance, and density, but other parameters can also be included depending on the specific requirements of the study.

2. The next step is to define the constraints between the different parameters. These constraints can be based on physical relationships, such as the relation between density and compressional velocity, or on geological knowledge, such as the expected distribution of different lithologies.

3. The inversion process then involves solving a system of equations to find the optimal values for the parameters. This is typically done using an iterative optimization algorithm, such as the Gauss-Seidel method.

4. The final step is to validate the results by comparing them with independent data, such as well logs or other geophysical data.

#### 15.1c.2 Advantages of Joint Inversion

Joint inversion offers several advantages over traditional deterministic and stochastic inversion methods. These include:

1. Improved accuracy: By simultaneously inverting multiple parameters, joint inversion can provide more accurate results than traditional methods. This is particularly useful in cases where the geological structure is complex and the data is noisy.

2. Better constraint handling: The incorporation of constraints between different parameters allows for more effective constraint handling, which can help to stabilize the inversion process and improve the quality of the results.

3. More reliable results: The simultaneous inversion of multiple parameters can provide more reliable results than traditional methods, which often rely on a single parameter. This can be particularly useful in cases where the data is noisy or the geological structure is complex.

#### 15.1c.3 Limitations of Joint Inversion

Despite its advantages, joint inversion also has some limitations. These include:

1. Complexity: The simultaneous inversion of multiple parameters can be more complex than traditional methods, which often involve only one parameter. This can make the interpretation of the results more challenging.

2. Computational requirements: The joint inversion process requires more computational resources than traditional methods, which can be a limitation in some cases.

3. Dependence on accurate constraints: The accuracy of the results from joint inversion is highly dependent on the accuracy of the constraints between different parameters. If these constraints are not accurate, the results can be misleading.

In conclusion, joint inversion is a powerful technique that combines the principles of deterministic and stochastic inversion. It offers improved accuracy, better constraint handling, and more reliable results, but also has some limitations that need to be considered.

## Chapter 1:6: Seismic Forward Modeling:

### Introduction

Seismic forward modeling is a crucial aspect of geophysical imaging, particularly in the near-surface environment. It involves the use of mathematical models to predict the behavior of seismic waves as they propagate through the Earth's subsurface.

### Section: 16.1 Wave Propagation Modeling:

#### 16.1a Finite Difference Method

The Finite Difference Method (FDM) is a numerical technique used to approximate solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs). It is a popular method in geophysics due to its simplicity and ease of implementation. The FDM approximates the derivatives in the PDEs by finite differences, hence the name.

The FDM is particularly useful in the context of seismic forward modeling, where we are interested in predicting the behavior of seismic waves as they propagate through the Earth's subsurface. The FDM allows us to discretize the subsurface into a grid of cells, and then solve the PDEs at each grid point.

The FDM is based on the Taylor series expansion, which allows us to approximate the derivatives of a function by a finite difference. For example, the first derivative of a function $f(x)$ can be approximated as:

$$
f'(x) \approx \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

where $h$ is a small increment in $x$. Similarly, the second derivative can be approximated as:

$$
f''(x) \approx \frac{f(x+h) - 2f(x) + f(x-h)}{h^2}
$$

These approximations can be used to discretize the PDEs governing the propagation of seismic waves. For example, the wave equation can be discretized as:

$$
\frac{v^2}{\rho c^2} \frac{u(x+h,t) - 2u(x,t) + u(x-h,t)}{h^2} = \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p(x,t)}{\partial t}
$$

where $v$ is the wave velocity, $\rho$ is the density, $c$ is the speed of sound, $u(x,t)$ is the displacement of the wave, and $p(x,t)$ is the pressure.

The FDM is a powerful tool for seismic forward modeling, but it is not without its limitations. The accuracy of the FDM depends on the size of the grid cells, with smaller cells leading to more accurate results. However, smaller cells also require more computational resources. Furthermore, the FDM assumes that the wave propagation is homogeneous and isotropic, which is often not the case in the Earth's subsurface.

Despite these limitations, the FDM remains a valuable tool in geophysics, particularly in the context of near-surface imaging. It provides a simple and efficient way to model the propagation of seismic waves, and can be used to generate realistic synthetic seismograms for comparison with real data.

#### 16.1b Analytical Solutions

Analytical solutions are another important tool in wave propagation modeling. Unlike the Finite Difference Method, which is a numerical technique, analytical solutions provide exact solutions to the partial differential equations (PDEs) governing wave propagation. These solutions are often used as benchmarks for the validation of numerical methods.

Analytical solutions can be derived for simple geometries and boundary conditions. For example, consider a one-dimensional medium with a constant wave velocity $v$ and density $\rho$. The wave equation for this medium can be written as:

$$
\frac{v^2}{\rho c^2} \frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} = \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p(x,t)}{\partial t}
$$

where $u(x,t)$ is the displacement of the wave, $p(x,t)$ is the pressure, and $c$ is the speed of sound.

For a medium with a constant wave velocity and density, the wave equation simplifies to:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} = \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2}
$$

This is the wave equation for a one-dimensional medium with constant properties. The solutions to this equation are sinusoidal waves of the form:

$$
u(x,t) = A \sin(kx - \omega t)
$$

where $A$ is the amplitude of the wave, $k$ is the wavenumber, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency.

Analytical solutions can also be derived for more complex geometries and boundary conditions. For example, consider a two-dimensional medium with a constant wave velocity $v$ and density $\rho$. The wave equation for this medium can be written as:

$$
\frac{v^2}{\rho c^2} \frac{\partial^2 u(x,y,t)}{\partial x^2} + \frac{v^2}{\rho c^2} \frac{\partial^2 u(x,y,t)}{\partial y^2} = \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p(x,y,t)}{\partial t}
$$

The solutions to this equation are more complex and involve elliptic functions.

Analytical solutions are particularly useful in the context of seismic forward modeling, as they provide a way to understand the behavior of seismic waves in different geometries and boundary conditions. However, they are often limited to simple cases and may not accurately represent the complexities of the Earth's subsurface. Therefore, they are often used in conjunction with numerical methods, such as the Finite Difference Method, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of wave propagation.

#### 16.1c Numerical Solutions

Numerical solutions are another important tool in wave propagation modeling. Unlike analytical solutions, which provide exact solutions to the partial differential equations (PDEs) governing wave propagation, numerical solutions are approximations. However, they are often more practical and can handle more complex geometries and boundary conditions.

One of the most common numerical methods used in wave propagation modeling is the finite difference method (FDM). As discussed in the previous section, the FDM approximates the derivatives in the PDEs by finite differences. This allows us to discretize the PDEs and solve them numerically.

Consider again the wave equation for a one-dimensional medium with constant wave velocity and density:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} = \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2}
$$

The FDM approximates the second derivatives in this equation by finite differences. For example, the second derivative with respect to $x$ can be approximated as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{u(x+h,t) - 2u(x,t) + u(x-h,t)}{h^2}
$$

where $h$ is a small increment in $x$. Similarly, the second derivative with respect to $t$ can be approximated as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2} \approx \frac{u(x,t+k) - 2u(x,t) + u(x,t-k)}{k^2}
$$

where $k$ is a small increment in $t$.

By substituting these approximations into the wave equation, we obtain a system of algebraic equations that can be solved numerically. This system of equations represents the numerical solution to the wave equation.

Numerical solutions are particularly useful in the context of seismic forward modeling, as they can handle complex geometries and boundary conditions that are often encountered in the Earth's subsurface. However, they are also more prone to errors and require careful validation.

#### 16.1d Wave Propagation in Complex Media

In the previous sections, we have discussed wave propagation in simple, homogeneous media. However, in real-world applications, we often encounter complex media with varying properties. This can include changes in wave velocity, density, and other parameters over space and time. In this section, we will discuss how to model wave propagation in these complex media.

One approach to modeling wave propagation in complex media is the finite difference method (FDM). As discussed in the previous section, the FDM approximates the derivatives in the PDEs by finite differences. This allows us to discretize the PDEs and solve them numerically.

Consider again the wave equation for a one-dimensional medium with constant wave velocity and density:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} = \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2}
$$

In complex media, the wave velocity $c$ and density $\rho$ can vary with position and time. To account for this, we can discretize the medium into a grid of cells, and assign different values of $c$ and $\rho$ to each cell. The FDM can then be used to approximate the derivatives in the wave equation for each cell.

For example, the second derivative with respect to $x$ can be approximated as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{u(x+h,t) - 2u(x,t) + u(x-h,t)}{h^2}
$$

where $h$ is a small increment in $x$. However, in complex media, the value of $h$ can vary from cell to cell. Therefore, we can define a local grid spacing $h_i$ for each cell $i$, and use this to calculate the second derivative:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{u(x+h_i,t) - 2u(x,t) + u(x-h_i,t)}{h_i^2}
$$

Similarly, the second derivative with respect to $t$ can be approximated as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2} \approx \frac{u(x,t+k) - 2u(x,t) + u(x,t-k)}{k^2}
$$

where $k$ is a small increment in $t$. Again, the value of $k$ can vary from cell to cell, so we can define a local grid spacing $k_i$ for each cell $i$, and use this to calculate the second derivative:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2} \approx \frac{u(x,t+k_i) - 2u(x,t) + u(x,t-k_i)}{k_i^2}
$$

By substituting these approximations into the wave equation, we obtain a system of algebraic equations that can be solved numerically. This system of equations represents the numerical solution to the wave equation in complex media.

In the next section, we will discuss another approach to modeling wave propagation in complex media: the finite element method (FEM).

#### 16.1e Wave Propagation in Heterogeneous Media

In the previous sections, we have discussed wave propagation in complex media, where the wave velocity $c$ and density $\rho$ can vary with position and time. However, in many practical applications, we encounter media that are not only complex, but also heterogeneous. Heterogeneous media are characterized by variations in their properties not only over space and time, but also in their spatial distribution.

One example of a heterogeneous medium is the Earth's subsurface. The properties of the subsurface, such as its wave velocity and density, can vary significantly due to variations in the composition and structure of the Earth's crust and mantle. This makes it challenging to accurately model wave propagation in the subsurface.

To model wave propagation in heterogeneous media, we can extend the finite difference method (FDM) discussed in the previous section. The FDM can be used to discretize the medium into a grid of cells, and assign different values of $c$ and $\rho$ to each cell. However, in heterogeneous media, the variations in $c$ and $\rho$ can be more complex and irregular. Therefore, we can use a more sophisticated discretization scheme, such as the finite element method (FEM), to account for these variations.

The FEM discretizes the medium into a mesh of elements, and assigns different values of $c$ and $\rho$ to each element. The wave equation can then be solved for each element, taking into account the variations in $c$ and $\rho$. This allows for a more accurate representation of wave propagation in heterogeneous media.

For example, the second derivative with respect to $x$ can be approximated as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{u(x+h,t) - 2u(x,t) + u(x-h,t)}{h^2}
$$

where $h$ is a small increment in $x$. However, in heterogeneous media, the value of $h$ can vary from element to element. Therefore, we can define a local grid spacing $h_i$ for each element $i$, and use this to calculate the second derivative:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{u(x+h_i,t) - 2u(x,t) + u(x-h_i,t)}{h_i^2}
$$

Similarly, the second derivative with respect to $t$ can be approximated as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2} \approx \frac{u(x,t+k) - 2u(x,t) + u(x,t-k)}{k^2}
$$

where $k$ is a small increment in $t$. However, in heterogeneous media, the value of $k$ can vary from element to element. Therefore, we can define a local grid spacing $k_i$ for each element $i$, and use this to calculate the second derivative:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2} \approx \frac{u(x,t+k_i) - 2u(x,t) + u(x,t-k_i)}{k_i^2}
$$

By solving the wave equation for each element, we can obtain a solution that accurately represents wave propagation in heterogeneous media. This solution can then be used to predict the behavior of seismic waves as they propagate through the Earth's subsurface.

#### 16.1f Wave Propagation in Anisotropic Media

In the previous sections, we have discussed wave propagation in complex and heterogeneous media. However, in many practical applications, we encounter media that are not only complex and heterogeneous, but also anisotropic. Anisotropic media are characterized by variations in their properties not only over space and time, but also in their directional dependence.

One example of an anisotropic medium is the Earth's subsurface. The properties of the subsurface, such as its wave velocity and density, can vary significantly due to variations in the composition and structure of the Earth's crust and mantle. This makes it challenging to accurately model wave propagation in the subsurface.

To model wave propagation in anisotropic media, we can extend the finite element method (FEM) discussed in the previous section. The FEM discretizes the medium into a mesh of elements, and assigns different values of $c$ and $\rho$ to each element. However, in anisotropic media, the variations in $c$ and $\rho$ can be more complex and irregular. Therefore, we can use a more sophisticated discretization scheme, such as the finite anisotropic elasticity method (FAEM), to account for these variations.

The FAEM discretizes the medium into a mesh of elements, and assigns different values of $c$ and $\rho$ to each element. However, in addition to the variations in $c$ and $\rho$, the FAEM also accounts for the directional dependence of these properties. This allows for a more accurate representation of wave propagation in anisotropic media.

For example, the second derivative with respect to $x$ can be approximated as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{u(x+h,t) - 2u(x,t) + u(x-h,t)}{h^2}
$$

where $h$ is a small increment in $x$. However, in anisotropic media, the value of $h$ can vary from element to element, and the direction of $h$ can also vary. Therefore, we can define a local grid spacing $h_i$ for each element $i$, and use this to calculate the second derivative:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{u(x+h_i,t) - 2u(x,t) + u(x-h_i,t)}{h_i^2}
$$

Similarly, the second derivative with respect to $t$ can be approximated as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2} \approx \frac{u(x,t+k) - 2u(x,t) + u(x,t-k)}{k^2}
$$

where $k$ is a small increment in $t$. However, in anisotropic media, the value of $k$ can vary from element to element, and the direction of $k$ can also vary. Therefore, we can define a local grid spacing $k_i$ for each element $i$, and use this to calculate the second derivative:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2} \approx \frac{u(x,t+k_i) - 2u(x,t) + u(x,t-k_i)}{k_i^2}
$$

By solving the wave equation for each element, we can obtain a solution that accurately represents wave propagation in anisotropic media. This solution can then be used to predict the behavior of seismic waves as they propagate through the Earth's subsurface.

#### 16.1g Wave Propagation in Non-Uniform Media

In the previous sections, we have discussed wave propagation in complex, heterogeneous, and anisotropic media. However, in many practical applications, we encounter media that are not only complex, heterogeneous, and anisotropic, but also non-uniform. Non-uniform media are characterized by variations in their properties not only over space and time, but also in their spatial distribution.

One example of a non-uniform medium is the Earth's subsurface. The properties of the subsurface, such as its wave velocity and density, can vary significantly due to variations in the composition and structure of the Earth's crust and mantle. This makes it challenging to accurately model wave propagation in the subsurface.

To model wave propagation in non-uniform media, we can extend the finite anisotropic elasticity method (FAEM) discussed in the previous section. The FAEM discretizes the medium into a mesh of elements, and assigns different values of $c$ and $\rho$ to each element. However, in non-uniform media, the variations in $c$ and $\rho$ can be more complex and irregular. Therefore, we can use a more sophisticated discretization scheme, such as the finite non-uniform elasticity method (FNEM), to account for these variations.

The FNEM discretizes the medium into a mesh of elements, and assigns different values of $c$ and $\rho$ to each element. However, in addition to the variations in $c$ and $\rho$, the FNEM also accounts for the spatial distribution of these properties. This allows for a more accurate representation of wave propagation in non-uniform media.

For example, the second derivative with respect to $x$ can be approximated as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{u(x+h,t) - 2u(x,t) + u(x-h,t)}{h^2}
$$

where $h$ is a small increment in $x$. However, in non-uniform media, the value of $h$ can vary from element to element, and the direction of $h$ can also vary. Therefore, we can define a local grid spacing $h_i$ for each element $i$, and use this to calculate the second derivative:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{u(x+h_i,t) - 2u(x,t) + u(x-h_i,t)}{h_i^2}
$$

Similarly, the second derivative with respect to $t$ can be approximated as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2} \approx \frac{u(x,t+k) - 2u(x,t) + u(x,t-k)}{k^2}
$$

where $k$ is a small increment in $t$. However, in non-uniform media, the value of $k$ can vary from element to element, and the direction of $k$ can also vary. Therefore, we can define a local grid spacing $k_i$ for each element $i$, and use this to calculate the second derivative:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2} \approx \frac{u(x,t+k_i) - 2u(x,t) + u(x,t-k_i)}{k_i^2}
$$

By solving the wave equation for each element, we can obtain a solution that accurately represents wave propagation in non-uniform media. This solution can then be used to predict the behavior of seismic waves as they propagate through the Earth's subsurface.

#### 16.1h Wave Propagation in Non-Linear Media

In the previous sections, we have discussed wave propagation in complex, heterogeneous, anisotropic, and non-uniform media. However, in many practical applications, we encounter media that are not only complex, heterogeneous, anisotropic, and non-uniform, but also non-linear. Non-linear media are characterized by variations in their properties not only over space and time, but also in their response to applied forces.

One example of a non-linear medium is the Earth's subsurface. The properties of the subsurface, such as its wave velocity and density, can vary significantly due to variations in the composition and structure of the Earth's crust and mantle. This makes it challenging to accurately model wave propagation in the subsurface.

To model wave propagation in non-linear media, we can extend the finite non-uniform elasticity method (FNEM) discussed in the previous section. The FNEM discretizes the medium into a mesh of elements, and assigns different values of $c$ and $\rho$ to each element. However, in non-linear media, the variations in $c$ and $\rho$ can be more complex and irregular. Therefore, we can use a more sophisticated discretization scheme, such as the finite non-linear elasticity method (FNLEM), to account for these variations.

The FNLEM discretizes the medium into a mesh of elements, and assigns different values of $c$ and $\rho$ to each element. However, in addition to the variations in $c$ and $\rho$, the FNLEM also accounts for the non-linear response of the medium to applied forces. This allows for a more accurate representation of wave propagation in non-linear media.

For example, the second derivative with respect to $x$ can be approximated as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{u(x+h,t) - 2u(x,t) + u(x-h,t)}{h^2}
$$

where $h$ is a small increment in $x$. However, in non-linear media, the value of $h$ can vary from element to element, and the direction of $h$ can also vary. Therefore, we can define a local grid spacing $h_i$ for each element $i$, and use this to calculate the second derivative:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{u(x+h_i,t) - 2u(x,t) + u(x-h_i,t)}{h_i^2}
$$

Similarly, the second derivative with respect to $t$ can be approximated as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2} \approx \frac{u(x,t+k) - 2u(x,t) + u(x,t-k)}{k^2}
$$

where $k$ is a small increment in $t$. However, in non-linear media, the value of $k$ can vary from element to element, and the direction of $k$ can also vary. Therefore, we can define a local grid spacing $k_i$ for each element $i$, and use this to calculate the second derivative:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2} \approx \frac{u(x,t+k_i) - 2u(x,t) + u(x,t-k_i)}{k_i^2}
$$

By solving the wave equation for each element, we can obtain a solution that accurately represents wave propagation in non-linear media. This solution can then be used to predict the behavior of seismic waves as they propagate through the Earth's subsurface.

#### 16.1i Wave Propagation in Non-Isotropic Media

In the previous sections, we have discussed wave propagation in complex, heterogeneous, anisotropic, non-uniform, and non-linear media. However, in many practical applications, we encounter media that are not only complex, heterogeneous, anisotropic, non-uniform, and non-linear, but also non-isotropic. Non-isotropic media are characterized by variations in their properties not only over space and time, but also in their response to applied forces.

One example of a non-isotropic medium is the Earth's subsurface. The properties of the subsurface, such as its wave velocity and density, can vary significantly due to variations in the composition and structure of the Earth's crust and mantle. This makes it challenging to accurately model wave propagation in the subsurface.

To model wave propagation in non-isotropic media, we can extend the finite non-linear elasticity method (FNLEM) discussed in the previous section. The FNLEM discretizes the medium into a mesh of elements, and assigns different values of $c$ and $\rho$ to each element. However, in non-isotropic media, the variations in $c$ and $\rho$ can be more complex and irregular. Therefore, we can use a more sophisticated discretization scheme, such as the finite non-isotropic elasticity method (FNIEM), to account for these variations.

The FNIEM discretizes the medium into a mesh of elements, and assigns different values of $c$ and $\rho$ to each element. However, in addition to the variations in $c$ and $\rho$, the FNIEM also accounts for the non-isotropic response of the medium to applied forces. This allows for a more accurate representation of wave propagation in non-isotropic media.

For example, the second derivative with respect to $x$ can be approximated as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{u(x+h,t) - 2u(x,t) + u(x-h,t)}{h^2}
$$

where $h$ is a small increment in $x$. However, in non-isotropic media, the value of $h$ can vary from element to element, and the direction of $h$ can also vary. Therefore, we can define a local grid spacing $h_i$ for each element $i$, and use this to calculate the second derivative:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{u(x+h_i,t) - 2u(x,t) + u(x-h_i,t)}{h_i^2}
$$

Similarly, the second derivative with respect to $t$ can be approximated as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2} \approx \frac{u(x,t+k) - 2u(x,t) + u(x,t-k)}{k^2}
$$

where $k$ is a small increment in $t$. However, in non-isotropic media, the value of $k$ can vary from element to element, and the direction of $k$ can also vary. Therefore, we can define a local grid spacing $k_i$ for each element $i$, and use this to calculate the second derivative:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2} \approx \frac{u(x,t+k_i) - 2u(x,t) + u(x,t-k_i)}{k_i^2}
$$

By solving the wave equation for each element, we can obtain a solution that accurately represents wave propagation in non-isotropic media. This solution can then be used to predict the behavior of seismic waves as they propagate through the Earth's subsurface.

#### 16.1j Wave Propagation in Non-Homogeneous Media

In the previous sections, we have discussed wave propagation in complex, heterogeneous, anisotropic, non-uniform, non-linear, and non-isotropic media. However, in many practical applications, we encounter media that are not only complex, heterogeneous, anisotropic, non-uniform, non-linear, and non-isotropic, but also non-homogeneous. Non-homogeneous media are characterized by variations in their properties not only over space and time, but also in their response to applied forces.

One example of a non-homogeneous medium is the Earth's subsurface. The properties of the subsurface, such as its wave velocity and density, can vary significantly due to variations in the composition and structure of the Earth's crust and mantle. This makes it challenging to accurately model wave propagation in the subsurface.

To model wave propagation in non-homogeneous media, we can extend the finite non-isotropic elasticity method (FNIEM) discussed in the previous section. The FNIEM discretizes the medium into a mesh of elements, and assigns different values of $c$ and $\rho$ to each element. However, in non-homogeneous media, the variations in $c$ and $\rho$ can be more complex and irregular. Therefore, we can use a more sophisticated discretization scheme, such as the finite non-homogeneous elasticity method (FNHEM), to account for these variations.

The FNHEM discretizes the medium into a mesh of elements, and assigns different values of $c$ and $\rho$ to each element. However, in addition to the variations in $c$ and $\rho$, the FNHEM also accounts for the non-homogeneous response of the medium to applied forces. This allows for a more accurate representation of wave propagation in non-homogeneous media.

For example, the second derivative with respect to $x$ can be approximated as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{u(x+h,t) - 2u(x,t) + u(x-h,t)}{h^2}
$$

where $h$ is a small increment in $x$. However, in non-homogeneous media, the value of $h$ can vary from element to element, and the direction of $h$ can also vary. Therefore, we can define a local grid spacing $h_i$ for each element $i$, and use this to calculate the second derivative:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{u(x+h_i,t) - 2u(x,t) + u(x-h_i,t)}{h_i^2}
$$

Similarly, the second derivative with respect to $t$ can be approximated as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2} \approx \frac{u(x,t+k) - 2u(x,t) + u(x,t-k)}{k^2}
$$

where $k$ is a small increment in $t$. However, in non-homogeneous media, the value of $k$ can vary from element to element, and the direction of $k$ can also vary. Therefore, we can define a local grid spacing $k_i$ for each element $i$, and use this to calculate the second derivative:

$$

By solving the wave equation for each element, we can obtain a solution that accurately represents wave propagation in non-homogeneous media. This solution can then be used to predict the behavior of seismic waves as they propagate through the Earth's subsurface.

#### 16.1k Wave Propagation in Non-Stationary Media

In the previous sections, we have discussed wave propagation in complex, heterogeneous, anisotropic, non-uniform, non-linear, non-isotropic, and non-homogeneous media. However, in many practical applications, we encounter media that are not only complex, heterogeneous, anisotropic, non-uniform, non-linear, non-isotropic, and non-homogeneous, but also non-stationary. Non-stationary media are characterized by variations in their properties not only over space and time, but also in their response to applied forces.

One example of a non-stationary medium is the Earth's subsurface. The properties of the subsurface, such as its wave velocity and density, can vary significantly due to variations in the composition and structure of the Earth's crust and mantle. This makes it challenging to accurately model wave propagation in the subsurface.

To model wave propagation in non-stationary media, we can extend the finite non-homogeneous elasticity method (FNHEM) discussed in the previous section. The FNHEM discretizes the medium into a mesh of elements, and assigns different values of $c$ and $\rho$ to each element. However, in non-stationary media, the variations in $c$ and $\rho$ can be more complex and irregular. Therefore, we can use a more sophisticated discretization scheme, such as the finite non-stationary elasticity method (FNSEM), to account for these variations.

The FNSEM discretizes the medium into a mesh


#### 16.1b Finite Element Method

The Finite Element Method (FEM) is another numerical technique used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike the Finite Difference Method (FDM), which approximates derivatives by finite differences, the FEM approximates the solution of a PDE by a set of basis functions.

The FEM is particularly useful in the context of seismic forward modeling, where we are interested in predicting the behavior of seismic waves as they propagate through the Earth's subsurface. The FEM allows us to discretize the subsurface into a mesh of elements, and then solve the PDEs at each element.

The FEM is based on the principle of virtual work, which states that the work done by the internal forces in a system is equal to the work done by the external forces. This principle can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\sum_{e} \delta \mathbf{r}^T \left( \mathbf{k}^e \mathbf{r} + \mathbf{Q}^{oe} \right) = \delta \mathbf{r}^T \left( \sum_{e} \mathbf{k}^e \right)\mathbf{r} + \delta \mathbf{r}^T \sum_{e} \mathbf{Q}^{oe}
$$

where $\mathbf{r}$ is the displacement vector, $\mathbf{k}^e$ is the stiffness matrix of element $e$, and $\mathbf{Q}^{oe}$ is the vector of external forces on element $e$.

The FEM is a powerful tool for seismic forward modeling, but it is not without its limitations. The accuracy of the FEM depends on the quality of the mesh, with finer meshes leading to more accurate results. However, finer meshes also require more computational resources. Furthermore, the FEM assumes that the wave propagation is linear, which is often not the case in the Earth's subsurface.

Despite these limitations, the FEM is a valuable tool in the toolbox of a geophysicist. It allows us to model complex wave propagation phenomena in a systematic and efficient manner.

#### 16.1c Wave Equation Solvers

Wave equation solvers are numerical methods used to solve the wave equation, a second-order linear partial differential equation that describes the propagation of a variety of waves, such as sound waves, light waves, and water waves. In the context of seismic forward modeling, wave equation solvers are used to predict the behavior of seismic waves as they propagate through the Earth's subsurface.

The wave equation can be written in the time domain as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $u$ is the displacement of the wave, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the wave speed.

There are several numerical methods for solving the wave equation, including the finite difference method (FDM), the finite element method (FEM), and the spectral method. Each of these methods has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of method depends on the specific problem at hand.

The FDM approximates the derivatives in the wave equation by finite differences, as discussed in the previous section. The FEM, on the other hand, approximates the solution of the wave equation by a set of basis functions, as discussed in the previous section. The spectral method, which is particularly useful for problems with periodic boundary conditions, approximates the solution of the wave equation by a set of eigenfunctions.

Wave equation solvers are powerful tools for seismic forward modeling, but they are not without their limitations. The accuracy of the solution depends on the quality of the numerical approximation, which in turn depends on the grid resolution and the choice of numerical method. Furthermore, the wave equation assumes that the medium is homogeneous and isotropic, which is often not the case in the Earth's subsurface.

Despite these limitations, wave equation solvers are indispensable tools in the field of geophysics. They allow us to model the propagation of seismic waves in the subsurface, providing valuable insights into the structure and properties of the Earth's interior.

#### 16.1d Wave Propagation in Complex Media

Wave propagation in complex media is a challenging problem due to the non-uniform nature of the medium. The wave speed, and hence the wave equation, can vary significantly across the medium. This is particularly true in the Earth's subsurface, where the properties of the medium can change rapidly due to variations in rock type, fluid content, and temperature.

The wave equation in complex media can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2(x) \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $c(x)$ is the wave speed, which is a function of the spatial coordinate $x$. The wave speed can be a function of the medium properties, such as the density and the elastic moduli, which can vary across the medium.

#### 16.1m Wave Propagation in Heterogeneous and Anisotropic Media

Wave propagation in heterogeneous and anisotropic media is a complex problem due to the non-uniform nature of the medium and the directional dependence of the wave speed.

The wave equation in heterogeneous and anisotropic media can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2(x) \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $c(x)$ is the wave speed, which is a function of the spatial coordinate $x$. The wave speed can be a function of the medium properties, such as the density and the elastic moduli, which can vary across the medium.

#### 16.1c Spectral Element Method

The Spectral Element Method (SEM) is a numerical technique used to solve partial differential equations, particularly those that describe wave propagation. It is a variant of the Finite Element Method (FEM) that uses high degree piecewise polynomials as basis functions. The SEM was first introduced in a 1984 paper by A. T. Patera.

The SEM is particularly useful in the context of seismic forward modeling, where we are interested in predicting the behavior of seismic waves as they propagate through the Earth's subsurface. The SEM allows us to discretize the subsurface into a mesh of elements, and then solve the PDEs at each element.

The SEM is based on the principle of spectral accuracy, which states that the numerical solution should be as accurate as the solution obtained by solving the PDE analytically. This is achieved by using high degree piecewise polynomials as basis functions, which allows for a more accurate representation of the solution.

The SEM is a powerful tool for seismic forward modeling, but it is not without its limitations. The accuracy of the SEM depends on the quality of the mesh, with finer meshes leading to more accurate results. Furthermore, the SEM assumes that the wave propagation is linear, which is often not the case in the Earth's subsurface.

Despite these limitations, the SEM is a valuable tool in the toolbox of a geophysicist. It allows us to model complex wave propagation phenomena in a systematic and efficient manner.

#### 16.1c.1 Development History

The development of the most popular LGL form of the SEM is normally attributed to Maday and Patera. However, it was developed more than a decade earlier. First, there is the Hybrid-Collocation-Galerkin method (HCGM), which applies collocation at the interior Lobatto points and uses a Galerkin-like integral procedure at element interfaces. The Lobatto-Galerkin method described by Young is identical to SEM, while the HCGM is equivalent to these methods. This earlier work is ignored in the spectral literature.

#### 16.1c.2 Convergence Properties

The SEM is a finite element method of very high order, and as such, it shares similar convergence properties with the spectral method. However, whereas the spectral method is based on the eigendecomposition of the particular boundary value problem, the finite element method does not use that information and works for arbitrary elliptic boundary value problems.

#### 16.1c.3 Applications in Seismic Forward Modeling

The SEM has been widely used in seismic forward modeling due to its ability to accurately represent wave propagation phenomena. It has been used to model wave propagation in complex subsurface structures, such as faults, layered media, and anisotropic media. The SEM has also been used in the development of seismic imaging techniques, such as the spectral imaging method.

#### 16.1c.4 Limitations and Future Directions

Despite its many advantages, the SEM also has some limitations. The accuracy of the SEM depends on the quality of the mesh, with finer meshes leading to more accurate results. Furthermore, the SEM assumes that the wave propagation is linear, which is often not the case in the Earth's subsurface. Future research is needed to address these limitations and to further improve the performance of the SEM.




#### 16.1d Boundary Element Method

The Boundary Element Method (BEM) is another numerical technique used in seismic forward modeling. It is a boundary value method that solves partial differential equations by considering only the boundary conditions. The BEM is particularly useful in problems where the boundary conditions are known, but the interior of the domain is unknown or complex.

The BEM is based on the principle of the boundary integral equation, which states that the solution of a partial differential equation can be represented as an integral over the boundary of the domain. This integral equation can then be solved numerically to obtain the solution of the partial differential equation.

The BEM is a powerful tool for seismic forward modeling, as it allows us to model wave propagation in complex subsurface structures without having to discretize the entire domain. However, like the SEM, the accuracy of the BEM depends on the quality of the mesh, with finer meshes leading to more accurate results.

The BEM is a relatively recent development in the field of geophysical imaging, but it has already proven to be a valuable tool in the study of wave propagation in the Earth's subsurface. It has been used in a variety of applications, including the modeling of seismic wave propagation, electromagnetic field propagation, and acoustic wave propagation.

#### 16.1d.1 Development History

The BEM was first introduced in the 1960s by John T. Yen and has since been developed and refined by many researchers. The BEM has been applied to a wide range of problems, including the modeling of wave propagation in the Earth's subsurface.

The BEM is a powerful tool for seismic forward modeling, as it allows us to model wave propagation in complex subsurface structures without having to discretize the entire domain. However, like the SEM, the accuracy of the BEM depends on the quality of the mesh, with finer meshes leading to more accurate results.

It has been used in a variety of applications, including the modeling of seismic wave propagation, electromagnetic field propagation, and acoustic wave propagation.

#### 16.1d.2 Advantages and Limitations

The BEM has several advantages over other numerical methods. It is particularly useful in problems where the boundary conditions are known, but the interior of the domain is unknown or complex. The BEM is also computationally efficient, as it only requires the solution of a boundary value problem, rather than a volume integral.

However, the BEM also has some limitations. It is not suitable for problems where the boundary conditions are not known, or where the boundary is not smooth. The accuracy of the BEM also depends on the quality of the mesh, with finer meshes leading to more accurate results.

Despite these limitations, the BEM is a valuable tool in the field of geophysical imaging, particularly in the modeling of wave propagation in the Earth's subsurface. With further development and refinement, it is likely to become an even more powerful tool in the study of wave propagation in the Earth's subsurface.

#### 16.1d.3 Applications in Seismic Forward Modeling

The Boundary Element Method (BEM) has been widely used in seismic forward modeling due to its ability to handle complex subsurface structures without the need for a detailed discretization of the entire domain. This is particularly useful in the study of wave propagation in the Earth's subsurface, where the subsurface structure is often complex and unknown.

One of the key applications of the BEM in seismic forward modeling is in the modeling of seismic wave propagation. The BEM allows us to model the propagation of seismic waves in the Earth's subsurface by considering only the boundary conditions, which are often known from seismic data. This makes the BEM a powerful tool for predicting the behavior of seismic waves in the Earth's subsurface, which is crucial for many applications, including earthquake prediction and subsurface imaging.

The BEM has also been used in the modeling of electromagnetic field propagation and acoustic wave propagation in the Earth's subsurface. These applications are particularly relevant in the field of geophysical imaging, where the BEM has been used to study the propagation of electromagnetic and acoustic waves in the Earth's subsurface.

In conclusion, the Boundary Element Method is a powerful tool for seismic forward modeling, particularly in the study of wave propagation in the Earth's subsurface. Its ability to handle complex subsurface structures without the need for a detailed discretization of the entire domain makes it a valuable tool in the field of geophysical imaging.

#### 16.1d.4 Future Directions

The Boundary Element Method (BEM) has shown great potential in the field of seismic forward modeling. However, there are still many areas where further research and development are needed. One of the key areas is the improvement of the accuracy of the BEM. As mentioned earlier, the accuracy of the BEM depends on the quality of the mesh, with finer meshes leading to more accurate results. However, the use of finer meshes can also increase the computational cost. Therefore, there is a need for the development of more efficient numerical schemes that can provide accurate results with coarser meshes.

Another area of research is the extension of the BEM to handle problems where the boundary conditions are not known. This is a significant limitation of the BEM, as many real-world problems do not have known boundary conditions. Therefore, the development of methods that can handle these problems is crucial for the widespread application of the BEM.

Finally, there is a need for the development of more efficient algorithms for the solution of the boundary value problems that arise in the BEM. These algorithms should be able to handle large-scale problems that arise in the modeling of wave propagation in the Earth's subsurface.

In conclusion, the BEM is a powerful tool for seismic forward modeling, but there are still many areas where further research and development are needed. With the continued development of the BEM, it is expected to become an even more powerful tool in the field of geophysical imaging.

## Chapter: - Chapter 17: Seismic Migration:




### Section: 17.1 Pre-stack Migration:

Pre-stack migration is a powerful technique used in seismic imaging to improve the quality of seismic data. It is a process that involves the migration of seismic data from the subsurface to the surface, allowing for a more accurate interpretation of the subsurface structure. In this section, we will discuss the basics of pre-stack migration, including its definition, principles, and applications.

#### 17.1a Kirchhoff Migration

Kirchhoff migration is a type of pre-stack migration that is commonly used in the oil and gas industry. It is based on the Kirchhoff's integral theorem, which states that the displacement of a point on a surface is equal to the sum of the displacements of all points on the surface due to the forces acting on it. This theorem is used to derive the equations of equilibrium for a plate, which are essential for understanding the behavior of seismic waves in the subsurface.

The Kirchhoff migration process involves the use of the Föppl–von Kármán equations, which describe the equilibrium of a plate. These equations are derived from the weak form of the Kirchhoff plate, which is given by:

$$
\begin{align*}
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{11}\frac{\partial\delta v_1}{\partial x_1} + N_{12}\frac{\partial\delta v_1}{\partial x_2}\,d\Omega = -\int_{\Omega} p_1 \delta v_1 \,d\Omega \\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{22}\frac{\partial\delta v_2}{\partial x_2} + N_{12}\frac{\partial\delta v_2}{\partial x_1}\,d\Omega = -\int_{\Omega} p_2 \delta v_2 \,d\Omega \\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{11}\frac{\partial w}{\partial x_1}\frac{\partial\delta w}{\partial x_1} - M_{11}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial^2 x_1} \,d\Omega\\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{22}\frac{\partial w}{\partial x_2}\frac{\partial\delta w}{\partial x_2} - M_{22}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial^2 x_2} \,d\Omega\\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{12}\left(\frac{\partial \delta w}{\partial x_1}\frac{\partial\delta w}{\partial x_2} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial x_1}\frac{\partial\delta w}{\partial x_2}\right) - 2M_{12}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial x_1\partial x_2} \,d\Omega = -\int_{\Omega} p_3 \delta w \,d\Omega\\
\end{align*}
$$

These equations describe the equilibrium of a plate under the action of external forces. The resulting governing equations are:

$$
\begin{align*}
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{11}\frac{\partial\delta v_1}{\partial x_1} + N_{12}\frac{\partial\delta v_1}{\partial x_2}\,d\Omega = -\int_{\Omega} p_1 \delta v_1 \,d\Omega \\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{22}\frac{\partial\delta v_2}{\partial x_2} + N_{12}\frac{\partial\delta v_2}{\partial x_1}\,d\Omega = -\int_{\Omega} p_2 \delta v_2 \,d\Omega \\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{11}\frac{\partial w}{\partial x_1}\frac{\partial\delta w}{\partial x_1} - M_{11}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial^2 x_1} \,d\Omega\\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{22}\frac{\partial w}{\partial x_2}\frac{\partial\delta w}{\partial x_2} - M_{22}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial^2 x_2} \,d\Omega\\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{12}\left(\frac{\partial \delta w}{\partial x_1}\frac{\partial\delta w}{\partial x_2} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial x_1}\frac{\partial\delta w}{\partial x_2}\right) - 2M_{12}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial x_1\partial x_2} \,d\Omega = -\int_{\Omega} p_3 \delta w \,d\Omega\\
\end{align*}
$$

These equations are used to derive the Kirchhoff migration equations, which are essential for understanding the behavior of seismic waves in the subsurface. The Kirchhoff migration process involves the use of these equations to migrate seismic data from the subsurface to the surface, allowing for a more accurate interpretation of the subsurface structure.

### Subsection: 17.1b Post-stack Migration

Post-stack migration is another type of migration technique used in seismic imaging. It is commonly used in the oil and gas industry to improve the quality of seismic data. Unlike pre-stack migration, post-stack migration is applied to the stacked seismic data, which is the result of summing multiple traces of data.

The post-stack migration process involves the use of the Föppl–von Kármán equations, similar to pre-stack migration. However, in post-stack migration, the equations are applied to the stacked data, which has been summed from multiple traces. This allows for a more accurate migration of the data, as it takes into account the interactions between different traces.

The post-stack migration process involves the use of the Kirchhoff migration equations, which are derived from the Föppl–von Kármán equations. These equations are used to migrate the stacked data from the subsurface to the surface, allowing for a more accurate interpretation of the subsurface structure.

### Subsection: 17.1c Migration Velocity Analysis

Migration velocity analysis is a crucial step in the migration process. It involves the determination of the velocity of seismic waves in the subsurface, which is essential for accurately migrating the data. The velocity of seismic waves is affected by various factors, such as the properties of the subsurface material and the presence of interfaces between different layers.

The migration velocity analysis process involves the use of various techniques, such as the Kirchhoff migration equations and the Föppl–von Kármán equations. These equations are used to determine the velocity of seismic waves in the subsurface, which is then used to migrate the data accurately.

In conclusion, pre-stack and post-stack migration are powerful techniques used in seismic imaging to improve the quality of seismic data. They involve the use of various equations, such as the Kirchhoff migration equations and the Föppl–von Kármán equations, to migrate the data from the subsurface to the surface. Migration velocity analysis is a crucial step in the migration process, as it allows for accurate migration of the data. 


## Chapter 1:7: Seismic Migration:




#### 17.1b Wave-equation Migration

Wave-equation migration is another type of pre-stack migration that is commonly used in the oil and gas industry. It is based on the wave equation, which describes the propagation of seismic waves in the subsurface. The wave equation is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $u$ is the displacement of the seismic wave, $t$ is time, and $c$ is the wave velocity.

The wave-equation migration process involves the use of the wave equation to calculate the displacement of the seismic wave at any point in the subsurface. This displacement is then used to create an image of the subsurface structure.

One of the key advantages of wave-equation migration is that it can provide a more accurate image of the subsurface structure compared to Kirchhoff migration. This is because wave-equation migration takes into account the effects of wave propagation, while Kirchhoff migration does not.

However, wave-equation migration is also more computationally intensive and requires more advanced mathematical techniques compared to Kirchhoff migration. Therefore, it is often used in conjunction with Kirchhoff migration to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the subsurface structure.

In the next section, we will discuss the applications of pre-stack migration in the oil and gas industry.

#### 17.1c Applications of Pre-stack Migration

Pre-stack migration has a wide range of applications in the oil and gas industry. It is used to improve the quality of seismic data, enhance the interpretation of subsurface structures, and aid in the identification of hydrocarbon reservoirs. In this section, we will discuss some of the key applications of pre-stack migration.

##### Improving Seismic Data Quality

One of the primary applications of pre-stack migration is to improve the quality of seismic data. Pre-stack migration techniques, such as Kirchhoff migration and wave-equation migration, can be used to reduce noise and improve the resolution of seismic images. This is particularly important in areas with complex geology, where the propagation of seismic waves can be affected by multiple layers and interfaces.

##### Enhancing Subsurface Structure Interpretation

Pre-stack migration can also be used to enhance the interpretation of subsurface structures. By providing a more accurate image of the subsurface, pre-stack migration can help geologists and engineers to better understand the geometry and properties of subsurface structures. This can aid in the identification of potential hydrocarbon reservoirs and the planning of drilling operations.

##### Aiding in Hydrocarbon Reservoir Identification

The identification of hydrocarbon reservoirs is a key application of pre-stack migration. By improving the quality of seismic data and enhancing the interpretation of subsurface structures, pre-stack migration can aid in the identification of potential hydrocarbon reservoirs. This is particularly important in areas where the presence of hydrocarbons is not obvious from the surface.

In conclusion, pre-stack migration is a powerful tool in the oil and gas industry, with a wide range of applications. By improving the quality of seismic data, enhancing the interpretation of subsurface structures, and aiding in the identification of hydrocarbon reservoirs, pre-stack migration plays a crucial role in the exploration and development of hydrocarbon resources.




#### 17.1c Reverse Time Migration

Reverse time migration (RTM) is a powerful pre-stack migration technique that has gained popularity in recent years due to its ability to provide high-quality images of the subsurface structure. Unlike traditional pre-stack migration techniques, such as Kirchhoff migration and wave-equation migration, which are based on the wave equation, RTM is based on the reverse time principle.

The reverse time principle states that the propagation of seismic waves in the subsurface can be modeled by reversing the time direction. This means that the seismic waves travel backwards in time, from the receiver to the source. This principle is based on the assumption that the subsurface structure is time-invariant, meaning that it does not change over time.

The RTM process involves the use of the reverse time principle to calculate the displacement of the seismic wave at any point in the subsurface. This displacement is then used to create an image of the subsurface structure. The RTM process can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $u$ is the displacement of the seismic wave, $t$ is time, and $c$ is the wave velocity.

One of the key advantages of RTM is that it can provide a more accurate image of the subsurface structure compared to traditional pre-stack migration techniques. This is because RTM takes into account the effects of wave propagation, while traditional techniques do not. Additionally, RTM can also provide a more detailed image of the subsurface structure, as it can resolve smaller features and structures.

However, RTM also has some limitations. It requires a high-quality seismic dataset and can be computationally intensive. Additionally, the reverse time principle may not always hold true in all subsurface structures, leading to errors in the migration process.

Despite its limitations, RTM has proven to be a valuable tool in the oil and gas industry, particularly in the exploration and development of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Its ability to provide high-quality images of the subsurface structure has made it an essential technique for geophysicists and engineers. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that RTM will become even more widely used in the industry.





#### 17.1d Least-squares Migration

Least-squares migration (LSM) is another powerful pre-stack migration technique that has gained popularity in recent years. Unlike RTM, which is based on the reverse time principle, LSM is based on the least-squares method.

The least-squares method is a mathematical technique used to approximate the solution of a system of linear equations. In the context of geophysical imaging, LSM is used to approximate the solution of the wave equation.

The LSM process involves the use of the least-squares method to calculate the displacement of the seismic wave at any point in the subsurface. This displacement is then used to create an image of the subsurface structure. The LSM process can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\min_{u} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} - c^2 \right)^2
$$

where $u$ is the displacement of the seismic wave, $t$ is time, and $c$ is the wave velocity.

One of the key advantages of LSM is that it can provide a more accurate image of the subsurface structure compared to traditional pre-stack migration techniques. This is because LSM takes into account the effects of wave propagation, while traditional techniques do not. Additionally, LSM can also provide a more detailed image of the subsurface structure, as it can resolve smaller features and structures.

However, LSM also has some limitations. It requires a high-quality seismic dataset and can be computationally intensive. Additionally, the least-squares method may not always provide the most accurate solution, especially for complex subsurface structures.

Despite its limitations, LSM has proven to be a valuable tool in the oil and gas industry, particularly in areas with complex subsurface structures. Its ability to provide high-quality images of the subsurface structure makes it an essential technique for geophysical imaging.

## Chapter: - Chapter 18: Seismic AVO Analysis:




### Section: 18.1 AVO Theory:

The Amplitude Variation with Offset (AVO) analysis is a powerful tool in geophysics that allows us to study the properties of the Earth's subsurface. It is based on the Zoeppritz equations, which describe the reflection and transmission of seismic waves at the interface between two different media. These equations are essential for understanding the behavior of seismic waves and their interaction with the Earth's subsurface.

#### 18.1a Zoeppritz Equations

The Zoeppritz equations consist of four equations with four unknowns: the reflected P-wave amplitude coefficient (R<sub>P</sub>), the reflected S-wave amplitude coefficient (R<sub>S</sub>), the transmitted P-wave amplitude coefficient (T<sub>P</sub>), and the transmitted S-wave amplitude coefficient (T<sub>S</sub>). These equations are given by:

$$
R_P = \frac{V_P^2 - V_S^2}{V_P^2 + V_S^2} \cos^2(\theta_1) + \frac{2V_PV_S}{V_P^2 + V_S^2} \cos(\theta_1)\cos(\theta_2)\cos(\phi_1)\cos(\phi_2)
$$

$$
R_S = \frac{V_P^2 - V_S^2}{V_P^2 + V_S^2} \sin^2(\theta_1) + \frac{2V_PV_S}{V_P^2 + V_S^2} \cos(\theta_1)\cos(\theta_2)\sin(\phi_1)\sin(\phi_2)
$$

$$
T_P = \frac{2V_PV_S}{V_P^2 + V_S^2} \cos(\theta_1)\cos(\theta_2)\cos(\phi_1)\cos(\phi_2)
$$

$$
T_S = \frac{2V_PV_S}{V_P^2 + V_S^2} \cos(\theta_1)\cos(\theta_2)\sin(\phi_1)\sin(\phi_2)
$$

where <math>{\theta}_{1}</math>=angle of incidence, <math>{\theta}_{2}</math>=angle of the transmitted P-wave, <math>{\phi}_{1}</math>=angle of reflected S-wave and <math>{\phi}_{2}</math>=angle of the transmitted S-wave.

These equations can be solved for the four unknowns, but they do not provide an intuitive understanding of how the reflection amplitudes vary with the rock properties involved (density, velocity, etc.). Several attempts have been made to develop approximations to the Zoeppritz equations, such as Bortfeld's (1961) and Aki & Richards’ (1980), but the most successful of these is the Shuey's approximation.

#### 18.1b Shuey Equation

The Shuey equation is a simplified form of the Zoeppritz equations that provides a more intuitive understanding of how the reflection amplitudes vary with the rock properties involved. It is given by:

$$
R(0) + G\Delta\theta + F\Delta\theta^2 = 0
$$

where <math>R(0)</math> is the reflection coefficient at normal incidence and is controlled by the contrast in acoustic impedances, <math>G</math> is often referred to as the AVO gradient, and <math>F</math> describes the behavior at large angles/far offsets that are close to the critical angle.

The Shuey equation can be further simplified by assuming that the angle of incidence is less than 30 degrees (i.e., the offset is relatively small), so the third term will be truncated. This simplification is often used in practice and provides a good approximation of the Zoeppritz equations.

In the next section, we will discuss how the Shuey equation can be used to interpret AVO data and understand the properties of the Earth's subsurface.
