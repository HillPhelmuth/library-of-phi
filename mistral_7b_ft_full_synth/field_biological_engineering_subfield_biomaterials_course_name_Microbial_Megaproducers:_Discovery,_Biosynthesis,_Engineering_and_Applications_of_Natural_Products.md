#### 2.3b Biosynthesis of RiPPs

The biosynthesis of RiPPs is a complex process that involves multiple steps and enzymes. The process begins with the synthesis of a precursor peptide by the ribosome. This precursor peptide is then modified post-translationally by a series of enzymes, resulting in the formation of the mature RiPP.

##### Bacterial Biosynthesis

In bacteria, the biosynthesis of RiPPs is often carried out by a multi-enzyme complex known as the RiPP biosynthesis complex. This complex is composed of a set of enzymes that are responsible for the synthesis and modification of the RiPP. The genes encoding these enzymes are often clustered together in the bacterial genome, forming the RiPP biosynthesis gene cluster.

The biosynthesis of capidermicin, a novel bacteriocin produced by Staphylococcus capitis, provides an example of bacterial RiPP biosynthesis. The biosynthesis of capidermicin involves the synthesis of a precursor peptide by the ribosome. This precursor peptide is then modified post-translationally by a series of enzymes, resulting in the formation of the mature capidermicin.

##### Fungal Biosynthesis

In fungi, the biosynthesis of RiPPs is also a complex process. However, unlike bacteria, fungi do not possess a dedicated RiPP biosynthesis complex. Instead, the biosynthesis of RiPPs in fungi is carried out by a set of enzymes that are responsible for the synthesis and modification of a variety of natural products, including RiPPs.

One of the most common strategies in the engineering of RiPP production is the overexpression of the genes involved in RiPP biosynthesis. This can be achieved by inserting additional copies of the genes into the genome of the producer organism, or by expressing the genes from a plasmid. Overexpression can increase the amount of RiPP produced, but it can also lead to toxic effects if the overexpression is too high. Therefore, careful control of the overexpression levels is necessary.

In the case of capidermicin production by Staphylococcus capitis, overexpression of the genes involved in capidermicin biosynthesis has been shown to increase the amount of capidermicin produced. However, high levels of overexpression can lead to cell death, highlighting the need for careful control.

##### Modification of RiPP Biosynthesis Pathways

Another strategy in the engineering of RiPP production is the modification of the RiPP biosynthesis pathways. This can involve the insertion of new genes, the deletion of unnecessary genes, or the modification of existing genes. These modifications can alter the pathway in ways that increase the amount of RiPP produced, or alter the properties of the RiPP.

In the case of capidermicin production, the biosynthesis pathway has been modified by the insertion of a new gene that increases the amount of the precursor peptide synthesized by the ribosome. This modification has been shown to increase the amount of capidermicin produced.

##### Optimization of Culture Conditions

The optimization of culture conditions is another important aspect of the engineering of RiPP production. This can involve the optimization of temperature, pH, and other environmental factors, as well as the optimization of the medium used for growth. These optimizations can increase the amount of RiPP produced, as well as improve the quality of the RiPP.

In the case of capidermicin production, the culture conditions have been optimized to increase the amount of capidermicin produced. This has involved the optimization of temperature, pH, and the medium used for growth.

### Subsection: 3.1 Genomic-based approaches

#### 3.1a Genome architecture mapping

Genome architecture mapping (GAM) is a powerful tool that has been used to study the three-dimensional structure of the genome. This method provides three key advantages over traditional 3C-based methods: it is more sensitive, it can detect long-range interactions, and it can provide a more detailed view of the genome architecture.

GAM is based on the concept of genome architecture, which refers to the three-dimensional organization of the genome. This organization is crucial for the proper functioning of the genome, as it allows for the correct spatial arrangement of DNA and proteins. GAM provides a way to study this organization in detail, by mapping the interactions between different regions of the genome.

The GAM method involves the use of a special type of DNA probe, known as a capture probe, which is designed to bind to a specific region of the genome. This probe is then used to capture the DNA from that region, and the resulting DNA-probe complex is sequenced. By comparing the sequenced DNA with the known genome sequence, it is possible to identify the regions of the genome that are interacting with the capture probe.

One of the key advantages of GAM is its sensitivity. Unlike traditional 3C-based methods, which can only detect interactions between regions that are in close proximity, GAM can detect interactions between regions that are separated by large distances. This allows for the detection of long-range interactions, which can provide valuable insights into the organization of the genome.

Another advantage of GAM is its ability to provide a more detailed view of the genome architecture. Traditional 3C-based methods can only provide a snapshot of the genome at a specific time point, while GAM can provide a dynamic view of the genome architecture over time. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the genome organization and its changes under different conditions.

In the context of RiPP discovery, GAM can be a valuable tool. By studying the genome architecture of RiPP-producing microorganisms, it is possible to identify the regions of the genome that are involved in RiPP biosynthesis and post-translational modification. This can provide insights into the mechanisms of RiPP production and can aid in the discovery of new RiPPs.

The enzymes involved in the synthesis of the peptide backbone are typically ribosomal proteins. These proteins are responsible for catalyzing the formation of peptide bonds between specific amino acids. The specificity of these enzymes is crucial for the formation of the desired peptide sequence.

The enzymes involved in the post-translational modifications are typically located in the cytoplasm or in specific organelles. These enzymes can be further classified into two categories: those that are involved in the addition of specific modifications, and those that are involved in the removal of certain modifications. The specificity of these enzymes is crucial for the formation of the desired modifications.

The mechanism of action of these enzymes is highly dependent on the specific modifications that they catalyze. For example, enzymes involved in the addition of sugar residues typically use sugar nucleotides as substrates, while enzymes involved in the formation of cyclic structures typically use specific amino acids as substrates. The mechanism of action of these enzymes can be further understood through the use of computational models and molecular dynamics simulations.

In conclusion, the biosynthesis of RiPPs is a complex process that involves multiple enzymes and pathways.

In this chapter, we will focus on a specific type of natural product, the ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), and will explore the engineering aspects involved in their production.

RiPPs are a diverse group of natural products that are synthesized by ribosomes and then modified post-translationally. They are produced by a wide range of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and archaea. The biosynthesis of RiPPs involves a series of complex chemical reactions that are carried out by a variety of enzymes. These reactions result in the production of a wide range of structures, including linear and cyclic peptides, as well as more complex structures such as polyketides and terpenes.

The engineering of RiPPs involves the manipulation of these biosynthetic pathways to produce new natural products with desired properties. This can be achieved through the introduction of new genes or the modification of existing genes. The goal of this engineering is to produce new natural products with improved properties, such as increased potency, selectivity, or stability.

In this chapter, we will explore the various aspects of RiPP engineering, including the identification of target genes, the design and construction of gene clusters, and the optimization of biosynthetic pathways.

### Section: 7.1 Biosynthesis and Enzyme Function/Mechanism

#### 7.1a Enzyme Mechanism

The biosynthesis of non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) is a complex process that involves a series of enzymatic reactions. These reactions are catalyzed by a family of enzymes known as non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). NRPSs are large, multi-modular enzymes that are responsible for the assembly of NRPs from a variety of amino acid building blocks.

The mechanism of NRPS-catalyzed reactions is highly conserved across different NRPSs. The catalytic mechanism involves the sequential binding and activation of amino acid building blocks, followed by their condensation to form the peptide backbone. This process is carried out by a series of modular domains within the NRPS, each of which is responsible for a specific step in the biosynthesis process.

The first step in the NRPS-catalyzed reaction is the binding of the amino acid building block to the adenylation (A) domain. This domain is responsible for the activation of the amino acid, which is achieved by the formation of a thioester bond between the amino acid and the ATP. The activated amino acid is then transferred to the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain, which serves as a mobile carrier for the growing peptide chain.

The next step is the condensation of the activated amino acid with the peptide chain on the PCP domain. This is achieved by the action of the condensation (C) domain, which catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond between the amino acid and the peptide chain. The newly formed peptide is then transferred back to the A domain, where the process is repeated for the next amino acid building block.

The final step in the NRPS-catalyzed reaction is the release of the completed NRP from the PCP domain. This is achieved by the action of the hydrolysis (H) domain, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of the thioester bond, releasing the NRP and regenerating the PCP domain for the next round of biosynthesis.

The biosynthesis of NRPs is a highly regulated process, and the activity of NRPSs is influenced by a variety of factors, including the availability of nutrients, the presence of specific signal molecules, and the activity of other enzymes involved in the biosynthesis process. Understanding the enzyme mechanism and the factors that influence NRPS activity is crucial for the engineering of NRPs for specific applications.

#### 7.1b Enzyme Inhibition

Enzyme inhibition is a crucial aspect of non-ribosomal peptide biosynthesis. It involves the regulation of enzyme activity by specific molecules, which can either enhance or inhibit the enzyme's activity. This section will focus on the inhibition of NRPSs, which is a key regulatory mechanism in the biosynthesis of NRPs.

NRPSs are inhibited by a variety of molecules, including other enzymes, signal molecules, and metabolites. These inhibitors can bind to specific sites on the NRPS, preventing the enzyme from carrying out its catalytic function. This can result in the accumulation of intermediates or the complete inhibition of biosynthesis.

One example of an NRPS inhibitor is the enzyme DapA, which is involved in the biosynthesis of lysine. DapA inhibits the activity of NRPSs by binding to the A domain, preventing the activation of amino acid building blocks. This results in the accumulation of aspartic acid semialdehyde, a key intermediate in lysine biosynthesis.

Another example of an NRPS inhibitor is the enzyme DapB, which is also involved in lysine biosynthesis. DapB inhibits the activity of NRPSs by binding to the PCP domain, preventing the transfer of the peptide chain to the A domain. This results in the accumulation of diaminopimelate (DAP), another key intermediate in lysine biosynthesis.

The inhibition of NRPSs is a highly regulated process, and the activity of these enzymes can be modulated by a variety of factors. For example, the activity of NRPSs can be enhanced by the presence of specific signal molecules, which can increase the affinity of the enzyme for its substrates. Conversely, the activity of NRPSs can be inhibited by the presence of other metabolites, which can compete with the substrates for binding to the enzyme.

Understanding the mechanisms of enzyme inhibition is crucial for the engineering of NRPs. By manipulating the activity of NRPSs, it is possible to control the biosynthesis of NRPs, allowing for the production of specific compounds for various applications. This includes the production of NRPs for use as drugs, agrochemicals, and other bioactive compounds.

#### 7.1c Enzyme Engineering

Enzyme engineering is a powerful tool in the manipulation of non-ribosomal peptide biosynthesis. It involves the modification of enzymes to alter their catalytic function, substrate specificity, or regulatory properties. This section will focus on the engineering of NRPSs, which is a key strategy in the production of novel NRPs.

NRPSs are large, multi-modular enzymes that are responsible for the assembly of NRPs. Each module within an NRPS is responsible for the addition of a specific amino acid to the growing peptide chain. By manipulating the structure and function of these modules, it is possible to engineer NRPSs to produce novel NRPs with desired properties.

One approach to NRPS engineering is the insertion of new modules into the enzyme. This can be achieved through genetic engineering, where new genes encoding for the desired modules are inserted into the NRPS gene cluster. Alternatively, existing modules can be modified to produce different amino acids or to alter the order of amino acid addition.

Another approach to NRPS engineering is the modification of the enzyme's regulatory properties. This can be achieved by mutating specific amino acids within the enzyme, which can alter the enzyme's sensitivity to inhibitors or signal molecules. For example, mutations in the DapA and DapB enzymes can alter their affinity for aspartic acid semialdehyde and diaminopimelate, respectively, leading to changes in the regulation of NRPS activity.

Enzyme engineering also involves the optimization of enzyme activity for specific applications. This can be achieved by selecting for mutations that increase the enzyme's catalytic efficiency, or by optimizing the enzyme's substrate specificity. For example, mutations in the A domain of NRPSs can increase the affinity of the enzyme for specific amino acids, leading to the production of NRPs with specific amino acid sequences.

In conclusion, enzyme engineering is a powerful tool in the manipulation of non-ribosomal peptide biosynthesis. By modifying the structure and function of NRPSs, it is possible to produce novel NRPs with desired properties for a variety of applications.

#### 7.2a Biosynthesis of NRPs

The biosynthesis of non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) is a complex process that involves the coordinated action of multiple enzymes. This section will focus on the biosynthesis of NRPs, with a particular emphasis on the role of NRPSs and PKSs.

NRPs are synthesized by a family of enzymes known as non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs). These enzymes are responsible for the assembly of NRPs from a variety of building blocks, including amino acids, fatty acids, and other small molecules.

NRPSs are large, multi-modular enzymes that are responsible for the assembly of NRPs. Each module within an NRPS is responsible for the addition of a specific building block to the growing peptide chain. The order of addition is determined by the sequence of modules within the enzyme.

PKSs, on the other hand, are responsible for the synthesis of polyketides, which are a class of molecules that include many important natural products. PKSs catalyze the condensation of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to form a polyketide chain. The length of the chain is determined by the number of repeating units in the PKS.

The biosynthesis of NRPs involves the coordinated action of NRPSs and PKSs. For example, the biosynthesis of tabtoxin, a non-ribosomal peptide produced by Pseudomonas tabaci, involves the action of both an NRPS and a PKS. The NRPS is responsible for the assembly of the peptide backbone, while the PKS is responsible for the addition of the polyketide side chain.

The biosynthesis of NRPs is a highly regulated process, and the activity of NRPSs and PKSs is influenced by a variety of factors, including the availability of building blocks, the presence of regulatory molecules, and the activity of other enzymes. For example, the biosynthesis of tabtoxin is influenced by the availability of L-threonine and L-aspartate, which are used to form the peptide backbone, and by the presence of pyruvic acid and the methyl group of L-methionine, which are used to form the polyketide side chain.

In conclusion, the biosynthesis of NRPs is a complex process that involves the coordinated action of multiple enzymes. Understanding the mechanisms of NRP biosynthesis is crucial for the discovery and optimization of NRP production.

#### 7.3a Structure of NRPs

Non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) are a diverse class of natural products that are synthesized by a family of enzymes known as non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). The structure of NRPs is determined by the specific modules within the NRPS enzyme, which are responsible for the addition of specific building blocks to the growing peptide chain.

The structure of NRPs can be broadly categorized into two types: linear and cyclic. Linear NRPs are synthesized by NRPSs with a linear arrangement of modules, while cyclic NRPs are synthesized by NRPSs with a cyclic arrangement of modules.

Linear NRPs are typically composed of a series of amino acids, fatty acids, and other small molecules. The order of addition of these building blocks is determined by the sequence of modules within the NRPS enzyme.

## Chapter 9: Med NPs (natural products):




### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fascinating world of natural products (NPs) and their production by microbial megaproducers. We have delved into the discovery, biosynthesis, and engineering of these compounds, and their applications in various fields. In this chapter, we will focus on the culture-dependent and metagenomic methods of NP discovery from complex environments.

The discovery of NPs is a critical step in the process of drug development. It is the first step that leads to the identification of potential drug candidates. The discovery of NPs can be achieved through two main methods: culture-dependent and metagenomic. 

Culture-dependent methods involve the isolation and cultivation of microorganisms from a complex environment. These microorganisms are then screened for the production of NPs. This method has been the traditional approach to NP discovery, but it has several limitations. For instance, many microorganisms are difficult to culture, and some may not grow under laboratory conditions. 

Metagenomic methods, on the other hand, do not require the isolation and cultivation of microorganisms. Instead, they directly analyze the genetic material present in a complex environment. This approach has the potential to discover NPs that are produced by microorganisms that are difficult to culture. However, it also has its challenges, such as the need for sophisticated bioinformatics tools to analyze the large amounts of genetic data generated.

In this chapter, we will explore these two methods in detail, discussing their advantages and limitations, and their applications in NP discovery. We will also discuss the role of bioinformatics in NP discovery and how it can be used to overcome the challenges associated with metagenomic methods. 

Join us as we delve deeper into the world of microbial megaproducers and the discovery of natural products from complex environments.




### Subsection: 9.1a Culture-dependent methods for NP discovery

Culture-dependent methods for natural product (NP) discovery have been the traditional approach in the field. These methods involve the isolation and cultivation of microorganisms from a complex environment, followed by screening for the production of NPs. This approach has been successful in the discovery of many NPs, but it also has several limitations.

#### Isolation and Cultivation of Microorganisms

The first step in culture-dependent methods is the isolation and cultivation of microorganisms from a complex environment. This can be a challenging task due to the diversity of microorganisms present in these environments and their often fastidious growth requirements. 

Many microorganisms are difficult to culture due to their slow growth rates, fastidious nutritional requirements, or the presence of inhibitory substances in the environment. For instance, the discovery of the antibiotic penicillin was made possible by the isolation and cultivation of the fungus *Penicillium chrysogenum* from a rotting cantaloupe. However, the isolation of this fungus required the use of a selective medium and careful manipulation of the growth conditions.

#### Screening for NP Production

Once the microorganisms are isolated and cultivated, they are screened for the production of NPs. This is typically done by extracting the metabolites produced by the microorganisms and testing them for biological activity. 

The screening process can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially when dealing with large numbers of microorganisms. Furthermore, not all NPs are active against the test organisms used in the screening process, limiting the sensitivity of this approach.

#### Advantages and Limitations

Despite its limitations, culture-dependent methods have several advantages. They allow for the manipulation of the growth conditions to optimize NP production, and they provide a means to study the biosynthesis of NPs by the isolated microorganisms.

However, the success of culture-dependent methods depends on the ability to isolate and cultivate the microorganisms of interest. This can be a significant challenge in complex environments where many microorganisms are present and where the growth requirements of the microorganisms are not well understood.

In the next section, we will explore metagenomic methods for NP discovery, which offer a promising alternative to culture-dependent methods.

### Subsection: 9.1b Metagenomic methods for NP discovery

Metagenomic methods for natural product (NP) discovery offer a promising alternative to culture-dependent methods. These methods do not require the isolation and cultivation of microorganisms, but instead directly analyze the genetic material present in a complex environment. This approach has the potential to discover NPs that are produced by microorganisms that are difficult to culture.

#### Direct Analysis of Genetic Material

The first step in metagenomic methods is the direct analysis of the genetic material present in a complex environment. This can be done using various techniques, including high-throughput sequencing, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics.

High-throughput sequencing allows for the identification of the genetic material present in a complex environment. This can provide insights into the diversity of microorganisms present and their potential for NP production.

Metatranscriptomics involves the analysis of the RNA present in a complex environment. This can provide information about the active genes and metabolic pathways present, which can be indicative of NP production.

Metaproteomics involves the analysis of the proteins present in a complex environment. This can provide information about the enzymes and metabolic pathways present, which can be indicative of NP production.

#### Screening for NP Production

Once the genetic material is analyzed, the next step is to screen for the production of NPs. This can be done by identifying the genes and metabolic pathways involved in NP production, and then synthesizing the NPs in the laboratory.

The screening process can be more efficient than in culture-dependent methods, as it can be done without the need to isolate and cultivate the microorganisms. Furthermore, it can be more sensitive, as it can detect NPs that are not active against the test organisms used in the screening process.

#### Advantages and Limitations

Despite its advantages, metagenomic methods for NP discovery also have limitations. They require sophisticated bioinformatics tools to analyze the large amounts of genetic data generated. Furthermore, they can only discover NPs that are produced by microorganisms that are present in the complex environment analyzed.

In conclusion, both culture-dependent and metagenomic methods have their advantages and limitations. The choice between these methods depends on the specific research question and the characteristics of the complex environment under study.

One of the main advantages of culture-dependent methods is that they allow for the manipulation of the growth conditions to optimize NP production. This can be particularly useful when dealing with microorganisms that have fastidious growth requirements. Furthermore, culture-dependent methods allow for the study of the biosynthesis of NPs by the isolated microorganisms.

However, the success of culture-dependent methods depends on the ability to isolate and cultivate the microorganisms of interest. This can be a significant challenge in complex environments where many microorganisms are present and where the growth requirements of the microorganisms are not well understood.

#### Metagenomic Methods

Metagenomic methods offer a promising alternative to culture-dependent methods. These methods do not require the isolation and cultivation of microorganisms, but instead directly analyze the genetic material present in a complex environment. This approach has the potential to discover NPs that are produced by microorganisms that are difficult to culture.

One of the main advantages of metagenomic methods is that they can provide insights into the diversity of microorganisms present in a complex environment and their potential for NP production. Furthermore, metagenomic methods can be more efficient and sensitive than culture-dependent methods in the screening for NP production.

However, metagenomic methods also have limitations. They require sophisticated bioinformatics tools to analyze the large amounts of genetic data generated. Furthermore, they can only discover NPs that are produced by microorganisms that are present in the complex environment analyzed.

In conclusion, both culture-dependent and metagenomic methods have their unique advantages and limitations. The choice between these methods depends on the specific research question and the characteristics of the complex environment under study.

### Subsection: 9.2a Metagenomic approaches for NP discovery

These approaches involve the direct analysis of the genetic material present in a complex environment, without the need for isolating and cultivating individual microorganisms.

#### Metagenomic Sequencing

The first step in metagenomic approaches is the sequencing of the genetic material present in a complex environment. This can be done using various techniques, including high-throughput sequencing, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics. High-throughput sequencing allows for the identification of the genetic material present in a complex environment, providing insights into the diversity of microorganisms present and their potential for NP production.

#### Bioinformatics Analysis

Once the genetic material is sequenced, bioinformatics tools are used to analyze the data. This involves identifying the genes and metabolic pathways present in the sequenced material, which can provide clues about the potential for NP production. For example, the presence of certain biosynthetic gene clusters can indicate the potential for NP production.

#### Synthesis and Testing of NPs

The final step in metagenomic approaches is the synthesis and testing of the predicted NPs. This involves using the genetic information obtained from the sequencing and bioinformatics analysis to synthesize the NPs in the laboratory. The synthesized NPs are then tested for their biological activity, providing a means to validate the predictions made from the sequencing and bioinformatics analysis.

#### Advantages and Limitations

Metagenomic approaches for NP discovery offer several advantages over traditional culture-dependent methods. They allow for the discovery of NPs that are produced by microorganisms that are difficult to culture, and they can provide insights into the diversity of microorganisms present in a complex environment. Furthermore, metagenomic approaches can be more efficient and sensitive than culture-dependent methods in the screening for NP production.

However, metagenomic approaches also have limitations. They require sophisticated bioinformatics tools to analyze the large amounts of genetic data generated. Furthermore, they can only discover NPs that are produced by microorganisms that are present in the complex environment analyzed.

In conclusion, metagenomic approaches for NP discovery offer a promising alternative to traditional culture-dependent methods. They have the potential to uncover a wealth of new NPs, but their successful implementation requires a deep understanding of both microbial ecology and bioinformatics.

### Subsection: 9.2b Applications of metagenomic approaches in NP discovery

These approaches allow for the discovery of NPs that are produced by microorganisms that are difficult to culture, and they can provide insights into the diversity of microorganisms present in a complex environment. Furthermore, metagenomic approaches can be more efficient and sensitive than traditional culture-dependent methods in the screening for NP production.

However, these approaches also have limitations. They require sophisticated bioinformatics tools to analyze the large amounts of genetic data generated. Furthermore, the success of these approaches depends on the quality of the sample collected and the accuracy of the bioinformatics analysis.

### Subsection: 9.2c Future directions in metagenomic approaches for NP discovery

As metagenomic approaches continue to evolve and improve, they are expected to play an increasingly important role in the discovery of natural products (NPs). Here are some of the future directions that these approaches are likely to take:

#### Integration of Metagenomic and Culture-Dependent Approaches

While metagenomic approaches have proven to be powerful tools for NP discovery, they are not without their limitations. For instance, they often fail to capture the full diversity of microorganisms present in a complex environment. To address this issue, researchers are exploring ways to integrate metagenomic and culture-dependent approaches. This could involve using metagenomic sequencing to identify promising microorganisms, followed by culture-dependent methods to isolate and study these microorganisms in more detail (Qin et al., 2010).

### Subsection: 9.2a Metagenomic approaches for NP discovery

Metagenomic approaches have emerged as a powerful tool for the discovery of natural products (NPs) from complex environments. Unlike culture-dependent methods, metagenomic approaches do not require the isolation and cultivation of microorganisms. Instead, they directly analyze the genetic material present in a complex environment, providing a more comprehensive view of the microbial diversity and the potential for NP production.

#### DNA Extraction and Sequencing

The first step in metagenomic approaches is the extraction of DNA from the complex environment. This DNA can then be sequenced using high-throughput sequencing technologies, such as Illumina sequencing or 454 pyrosequencing. The resulting sequence data provides a snapshot of the genetic diversity present in the environment.

#### Bioinformatics Analysis

The next step is the bioinformatics analysis of the sequence data. This involves the assembly of the sequences into larger fragments, known as contigs, and the annotation of these contigs to identify genes and gene clusters that are involved in NP biosynthesis. This can be a challenging task due to the large amount of sequence data and the presence of many unknown genes.

#### Identification of NP Gene Clusters

One of the key advantages of metagenomic approaches is the ability to identify NP gene clusters directly from the sequence data. These clusters often contain multiple genes that work together to produce a specific NP. By identifying these clusters, researchers can gain insights into the biosynthesis of NPs and potentially engineer these processes for the production of new NPs.

#### Limitations and Future Directions

Despite its potential, metagenomic approaches for NP discovery also have several limitations. One of the main challenges is the interpretation of the sequence data, which often contains many unknown genes and gene clusters. Advances in bioinformatics and machine learning are expected to address this issue in the future.

Another limitation is the lack of experimental validation of the predicted NP gene clusters. While computational predictions can provide valuable leads, experimental validation is often necessary to confirm the production of specific NPs. This can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process, but it is essential for the successful discovery and development of new NPs.

In conclusion, metagenomic approaches offer a promising avenue for the discovery of natural products from complex environments. By combining high-throughput sequencing technologies with bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation, these approaches have the potential to revolutionize the field of natural product discovery.

### Subsection: 9.1b Metagenomic sequencing and analysis for natural product discovery

#### Metagenomic Sequencing

Metagenomic sequencing is a powerful tool for the discovery of natural products (NPs) from complex environments. It allows for the direct analysis of the genetic material present in a complex environment, providing a more comprehensive view of the microbial diversity and the potential for NP production. The first step in metagenomic sequencing is the extraction of DNA from the complex environment. This DNA can then be sequenced using high-throughput sequencing technologies, such as Illumina sequencing or 454 pyrosequencing. The resulting sequence data provides a snapshot of the genetic diversity present in the environment.

#### Bioinformatics Analysis

The next step in metagenomic sequencing is the bioinformatics analysis of the sequence data. This involves the assembly of the sequences into larger fragments, known as contigs, and the annotation of these contigs to identify genes and gene clusters that are involved in NP biosynthesis. This can be a challenging task due to the large amount of sequence data and the presence of many unknown genes. However, advances in bioinformatics tools and algorithms have made it possible to identify these genes and gene clusters with a high degree of accuracy.

#### Identification of NP Gene Clusters

One of the key advantages of metagenomic sequencing is the ability to identify NP gene clusters directly from the sequence data. These clusters often contain multiple genes that work together to produce a specific NP. By identifying these clusters, researchers can gain insights into the biosynthesis of NPs and potentially engineer these processes for the production of new NPs.

#### Limitations and Future Directions

Despite its potential, metagenomic sequencing for NP discovery also has several limitations. One of the main challenges is the interpretation of the sequence data, which often contains many unknown genes and gene clusters. This requires the development of advanced bioinformatics tools and algorithms to accurately identify and annotate these genes and gene clusters. Additionally, the cost of high-throughput sequencing technologies can be a barrier to widespread use of metagenomic sequencing for NP discovery. However, as the cost of sequencing continues to decrease, metagenomic sequencing is expected to become an increasingly important tool for the discovery of new NPs.

## Chapter: - Chapter 13: Advanced Genomic Approaches in NP Discovery:

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the discovery, biosynthesis, and engineering of natural products (NPs) from microbial megaproducers. We have also discussed the applications of these NPs in various fields, including medicine, agriculture, and industry. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the advanced genomic approaches used in NP discovery.

The discovery of NPs has been a crucial aspect of drug development, with many NPs being used as lead compounds for drug design. However, the traditional methods of NP discovery, such as bioassay-guided fractionation, have limitations in terms of efficiency and scalability. Therefore, there has been a growing need for advanced genomic approaches that can aid in the discovery of NPs.

One such approach is the use of comparative genomics, which involves comparing the genomes of different organisms to identify genetic differences that may be responsible for the production of NPs. This approach has been used to identify genes involved in the biosynthesis of NPs, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms of NP production.

Another advanced genomic approach is the use of metagenomics, which involves studying the genetic material present in a particular environment. This approach has been used to discover NPs from previously unexplored environments, such as deep-sea sediments and hot springs. By analyzing the genetic material present in these environments, researchers can identify potential NP-producing organisms and their corresponding genes.

In addition to comparative genomics and metagenomics, other advanced genomic approaches, such as transcriptomics and proteomics, have also been used in NP discovery. Transcriptomics involves studying the expression of genes in an organism, while proteomics focuses on the study of proteins and their functions. These approaches have been used to identify key genes and proteins involved in NP biosynthesis, providing a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind NP production.

In this chapter, we will explore these advanced genomic approaches in more detail and discuss their applications in NP discovery. We will also touch upon the challenges and future directions in this field, as well as the potential impact of these approaches on drug discovery and development.

### Subsection: 13.1 Metagenomic Library Construction

Metagenomic library construction is a powerful approach for discovering new natural products (NPs). This method involves isolating and cloning the genetic material present in a particular environment, known as the metagenome, into a library of DNA fragments. These fragments can then be screened for the presence of genes involved in NP biosynthesis.

The first step in metagenomic library construction is to extract the genetic material from the environment of interest. This can be done using various methods, such as DNA extraction kits or by directly sequencing the environment using next-generation sequencing technologies.

Once the genetic material is extracted, it is fragmented into smaller pieces using techniques such as sonication or restriction enzyme digestion. These fragments are then cloned into a vector, such as a plasmid or a bacteriophage, which is then transformed into a host cell.

The resulting library of DNA fragments can then be screened for the presence of genes involved in NP biosynthesis. This can be done using various methods, such as bioassays, which involve testing the activity of the cloned DNA fragments on a target organism. Alternatively, the DNA fragments can be sequenced and compared to known NP biosynthesis genes to identify potential candidates.

One of the advantages of metagenomic library construction is that it allows for the discovery of NPs from previously unexplored environments. This approach has been used to discover NPs from a variety of environments, including the human gut microbiome, the ocean, and even the atmosphere.

However, there are also challenges associated with metagenomic library construction. One of the main challenges is the high level of noise and redundancy present in metagenomic data. This is due to the fact that metagenomic data often contains fragmented data representing as many as 10,000 species. This makes it difficult to extract useful biological information from the data.

To address this challenge, various computational methods have been developed for pre-filtering metagenomic data. These methods involve removing redundant, low-quality sequences and sequences of probable eukaryotic origin. This helps to reduce the amount of noise and redundancy in the data, making it easier to identify potential NP-producing genes.

In conclusion, metagenomic library construction is a powerful approach for discovering new natural products. By isolating and cloning the genetic material present in a particular environment, researchers can identify potential NP-producing genes and further investigate their biosynthesis. However, this approach also presents challenges, which can be addressed through various computational methods. 





### Subsection: 13.2 Functional Metagenomics

Functional metagenomics is a powerful approach for discovering new natural products (NPs) and understanding the genetic basis of their biosynthesis. This method involves screening a metagenomic library for functional activities, such as NP biosynthesis, and then identifying the genes responsible for these activities.

The first step in functional metagenomics is to construct a metagenomic library, as described in the previous section. Once the library is constructed, it is screened for functional activities using various methods. One common method is the use of bioassays, which involve testing the activity of the cloned DNA fragments on a target organism. This can be done by transforming the library into the target organism and then screening for phenotypes of interest.

Another approach is to use functional screens, which involve testing the activity of the cloned DNA fragments in a high-throughput manner. This can be done using techniques such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or mass spectrometry. These methods allow for the rapid screening of large numbers of DNA fragments, increasing the chances of discovering new NPs.

Once a functional activity is identified, the next step is to identify the genes responsible for this activity. This can be done by sequencing the DNA fragments that exhibit the desired activity and comparing them to known genes involved in NP biosynthesis. Alternatively, the DNA fragments can be transformed into a host organism and the genes responsible for the activity can be identified through genetic mapping or mutational analysis.

One of the advantages of functional metagenomics is that it allows for the discovery of new NPs and the identification of their biosynthetic genes. This approach has been used to discover new NPs from a variety of environments, including the human gut microbiome, the ocean, and even the atmosphere.

However, there are also challenges associated with functional metagenomics. One of the main challenges is the high level of noise and redundancy present in metagenomic data. This is due to the fact that metagenomic data often contains fragmented data representing as many as 10,000 species. This makes it difficult to extract useful biological information from the data.

Another challenge is the difficulty in identifying the genes responsible for a particular functional activity. This is because many genes involved in NP biosynthesis are not well understood and may not have known functions. Additionally, the presence of multiple copies of the same gene in a metagenomic library can make it difficult to identify the specific gene responsible for a particular activity.

Despite these challenges, functional metagenomics remains a powerful approach for discovering new NPs and understanding the genetic basis of their biosynthesis. With advancements in sequencing technology and bioinformatics tools, these challenges can be overcome, leading to a better understanding of the complex world of microbial natural products.





### Subsection: 13.2b Applications of functional metagenomics

Natural products have been a rich source of drug leads, with many drugs currently on the market being derived from natural sources. Functional metagenomics allows for the rapid screening of large metagenomic libraries, increasing the chances of discovering new natural products with potential drug activity. By identifying the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of these natural products, researchers can then manipulate these genes to produce larger quantities of the desired compound for further testing and development.

#### Biotechnology

Functional metagenomics also has applications in biotechnology. By identifying the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of natural products, researchers can engineer these genes to produce new compounds with desired properties. This can be particularly useful in the production of high-value compounds, such as pharmaceuticals or biofuels. Additionally, functional metagenomics can be used to identify new enzymes with unique catalytic activities, which can be useful in various biotechnological processes.

### Section: 14.1 Machine Learning in NP Discovery

Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, has been increasingly used in the field of natural product discovery due to its ability to analyze large and complex datasets. In this section, we will explore the various machine learning techniques used in NP discovery, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

#### 14.1a Machine Learning Techniques in NP Discovery

Machine learning techniques in NP discovery can be broadly categorized into three types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

##### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from a labeled dataset. In the context of NP discovery, this involves training the algorithm on a dataset of known NPs and their biosynthetic pathways. The algorithm then learns to predict the presence of NPs in a given organism based on its genomic, metabolomic, and phenotypic data.

One of the most commonly used supervised learning algorithms in NP discovery is support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs work by creating a hyperplane that separates the data points into different classes. In the context of NP discovery, the classes could be positive (NP present) and negative (NP absent). The hyperplane is then used to classify new data points.

Another popular supervised learning algorithm is decision trees. Decision trees work by creating a tree-like structure where each node represents a test on a feature of the data. The path from the root node to a leaf node represents a classification of the data. In NP discovery, decision trees can be used to classify organisms based on their genomic, metabolomic, and phenotypic data.

##### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from an unlabeled dataset. In the context of NP discovery, this involves analyzing a dataset of organisms and their associated genomic, metabolomic, and phenotypic data without any prior knowledge of the presence or absence of NPs.

One of the most commonly used unsupervised learning techniques in NP discovery is clustering. Clustering algorithms work by grouping similar data points together. In the context of NP discovery, this can be used to identify clusters of organisms that produce similar NPs.

Another popular unsupervised learning technique is dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality reduction algorithms work by reducing the number of features in a dataset while preserving the important information. In NP discovery, this can be useful for reducing the complexity of the data and making it easier to analyze.

##### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from its own experiences. In the context of NP discovery, this could involve training the algorithm on a dataset of known NPs and their biosynthetic pathways, and then allowing it to explore and learn from new data.

One of the most commonly used reinforcement learning algorithms in NP discovery is deep reinforcement learning. Deep reinforcement learning combines deep learning with reinforcement learning to create a powerful learning algorithm. This can be particularly useful in NP discovery as it allows the algorithm to learn from large and complex datasets.

In conclusion, machine learning techniques have proven to be valuable tools in the field of natural product discovery. By leveraging the power of data analysis and machine learning algorithms, researchers can uncover new NPs and their biosynthetic pathways, leading to the development of new drugs and other applications. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more sophisticated machine learning techniques being used in NP discovery.





### Section: 14.2 Artificial Intelligence in NP Discovery

Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool in the field of natural product discovery. AI algorithms, such as machine learning and deep learning, have been used to analyze large and complex datasets, leading to the discovery of new NPs and their biosynthetic pathways.

#### 14.2a Application of artificial intelligence in NP discovery

Artificial intelligence has been applied in various aspects of natural product discovery, including data preprocessing, feature selection, classification, and clustering.

##### Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in AI-based NP discovery. It involves cleaning, transforming, and reducing the size of the dataset to improve the performance of the AI algorithm. In the context of NP discovery, data preprocessing can involve removing noise from the data, handling missing values, and reducing the dimensionality of the data.

One common technique for data preprocessing is principal component analysis (PCA), which is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the information. This can be particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets, such as those found in metabolomics.

### Subsection: 15.1 Novel RiPPs Biosynthetic Pathways

#### 15.1a Discovery of Novel RiPPs Biosynthetic Pathways

The discovery of novel RiPPs biosynthetic pathways has been a significant breakthrough in the field of microbial natural products. These pathways have been identified through a combination of experimental studies and computational analysis. 

Experimental studies involve the isolation and characterization of RiPPs from various microbial sources. This is typically done through the use of chromatographic techniques to separate the RiPPs from other metabolites, followed by mass spectrometry to determine the molecular weight and structure of the RiPPs. The biosynthetic pathways of these RiPPs can then be inferred from the sequence of the genes encoding the enzymes responsible for their synthesis.

Computational analysis, on the other hand, involves the use of bioinformatics tools to identify potential RiPP biosynthetic gene clusters in microbial genomes. These tools include HMMs (Hidden Markov Models) that can identify the presence of specific enzymes or enzyme domains in a genome sequence. For example, antiSMASH (Antibiotic Gene Cluster Mining System) and RiPP-PRISM (RiPP Cluster Finder) use HMMs to predict the presence of RiPP biosynthetic gene clusters.

One of the most significant advancements in the discovery of novel RiPPs biosynthetic pathways has been the development of machine learning tools. These tools, such as RiPPMiner, use a combination of HMMs and machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of RiPPs and their biosynthetic pathways. RiPPMiner, for instance, uses a support-vector machine model trained on 513 RiPPs to identify and subclass them. This approach has been shown to have high sensitivity, specificity, precision, and MCC values, indicating its effectiveness in identifying and classifying RiPPs.

The discovery of novel RiPPs biosynthetic pathways has opened up new avenues for the production of microbial natural products. These pathways can be engineered to produce novel RiPPs with desired properties, such as increased potency or reduced toxicity. Furthermore, the biosynthetic pathways of RiPPs can serve as models for the biosynthesis of other natural products, providing insights into the mechanisms of natural product synthesis and paving the way for the development of new drugs and other bioactive compounds.

One approach to engineering RiPPs biosynthetic pathways is through the use of synthetic biology. Synthetic biology involves the design and construction of new biological systems, or the redesign of existing ones, to perform specific functions. In the context of RiPPs, synthetic biology can be used to create new RiPPs with desired properties, such as increased potency or reduced toxicity.

For example, the biosynthetic pathway of the RiPP, lanthipeptide, has been engineered to produce a variant with improved antibiotic activity. This was achieved by modifying the gene encoding the lanthionine synthetase, an enzyme responsible for the post-translational modification of lanthipeptides. The modified gene was then inserted into the genome of a bacterial strain, resulting in the production of the desired variant.

Another approach to engineering RiPPs biosynthetic pathways is through the use of metabolic engineering. Metabolic engineering involves the manipulation of metabolic pathways to increase the production of desired products. In the context of RiPPs, metabolic engineering can be used to increase the yield of RiPPs or to alter the composition of RiPPs produced by a microorganism.

For instance, the biosynthetic pathway of the RiPP, sactipeptide, has been engineered to increase the yield of sactipeptides. This was achieved by overexpressing the gene encoding the sactipeptide synthetase, an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of sactipeptides. The overexpression of this gene resulted in a significant increase in the yield of sactipeptides.

The engineering of novel RiPPs biosynthetic pathways has the potential to revolutionize the field of microbial natural products. It offers a way to produce new RiPPs with desired properties, and to increase the yield of existing RiPPs. Furthermore, the principles and techniques used in the engineering of RiPPs biosynthetic pathways can be applied to the engineering of other biosynthetic pathways, opening up new avenues for research and discovery.

### Subsection: 15.2 Challenges in Elucidating RiPPs Biosynthetic Pathways

The discovery of novel RiPPs biosynthetic pathways has been a significant breakthrough in the field of microbial natural products. However, the elucidation of these pathways has not been without its challenges. 

#### 15.2a Challenges in Identifying RiPPs Biosynthetic Gene Clusters

One of the primary challenges in elucidating RiPPs biosynthetic pathways is the identification of the biosynthetic gene clusters. These clusters are typically located within the genome of the microorganism and are responsible for the synthesis of the RiPPs. However, the identification of these clusters can be a complex task due to the presence of multiple genes and enzymes involved in the synthesis of RiPPs.

Traditional methods of gene cluster identification, such as the use of antibiotic resistance genes, have been largely unsuccessful due to the lack of specificity. Many RiPPs do not rely on antibiotic resistance genes for their synthesis, making these methods ineffective. 

More recent methods, such as antiSMASH and RiPP-PRISM, have been developed to address this challenge. These methods use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to identify the presence of specific enzymes or enzyme domains in a genome sequence. However, these methods also have their limitations. For instance, antiSMASH has been found to have a high false positive rate, identifying gene clusters that do not actually exist. 

#### 15.2b Challenges in Predicting RiPPs Biosynthetic Pathways

Once the biosynthetic gene clusters have been identified, the next challenge is predicting the biosynthetic pathways of the RiPPs. This involves determining the sequence of enzymatic reactions that transform the precursor molecule into the final RiPP product.

Traditional methods of pathway prediction, such as the use of metabolic pathway databases, have been largely unsuccessful due to the lack of specificity. Many RiPPs do not follow traditional metabolic pathways, making these methods ineffective.

More recent methods, such as machine learning tools like RiPPMiner, have been developed to address this challenge. These tools use a combination of HMMs and machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of RiPPs and their biosynthetic pathways. However, these methods also have their limitations. For instance, RiPPMiner has been found to have a high false negative rate, missing RiPPs that actually exist.

#### 15.2c Challenges in Experimental Validation of RiPPs Biosynthetic Pathways

The final challenge in elucidating RiPPs biosynthetic pathways is the experimental validation of these pathways. This involves confirming the predicted pathways through experimental studies.

Traditional methods of pathway validation, such as the use of mutant strains, have been largely unsuccessful due to the complexity of the RiPPs biosynthetic pathways. Many RiPPs are synthesized through complex networks of enzymes, making it difficult to identify the specific enzymes or enzyme domains responsible for their synthesis.

More recent methods, such as the use of synthetic biology techniques, have been developed to address this challenge. These techniques allow for the manipulation of the RiPPs biosynthetic pathways, providing a means to confirm the predicted pathways through experimental studies. However, these methods also have their limitations. For instance, the manipulation of these pathways can be a complex and time-consuming process.

In conclusion, the elucidation of RiPPs biosynthetic pathways has been a significant breakthrough in the field of microbial natural products. However, the challenges in identifying biosynthetic gene clusters, predicting biosynthetic pathways, and experimentally validating these pathways have made this a complex and ongoing research area. Future research is needed to address these challenges and further our understanding of these important natural products.

Machine learning approaches have been particularly useful in overcoming the challenges of RiPPs biosynthetic pathway elucidation. These approaches use algorithms to analyze large datasets of gene sequences and identify patterns that are indicative of RiPPs biosynthetic pathways.

For instance, the RiPPMiner software, developed by researchers at the National Institute of Immunology of New Delhi, India, uses a machine learning model trained with 513 RiPPs to predict the RiPP subclass. This software defines 12 subclasses of RiPPs, predicting the cleavage site of the leader peptide and the final cross-link of the RiPP chemical structure.

#### 15.2c.2 Genome Mining

Genome mining is another strategy that has been used to overcome the challenges of RiPPs biosynthetic pathway elucidation. This approach involves systematically searching a genome for genes that are involved in RiPPs biosynthesis.

For example, the RiPPMiner web server, in addition to its machine learning capabilities, also includes a database of RiPPs (RiPPDB). This database can be used for genome mining, allowing researchers to search for genes that are similar to those found in known RiPPs.

#### 15.2c.3 Experimental Approaches

Experimental approaches, such as genetic knockouts and overexpression studies, have also been used to elucidate RiPPs biosynthetic pathways. These approaches involve manipulating the genes involved in RiPPs biosynthesis and observing the effects on the production of the RiPPs.

For instance, researchers at the University of California, San Diego, have used a combination of genetic knockouts and overexpression studies to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of the RiPP, surfactin. This approach involved identifying the genes involved in surfactin biosynthesis and then manipulating their expression levels to observe the effects on surfactin production.

In conclusion, while the elucidation of RiPPs biosynthetic pathways presents significant challenges, these challenges have been largely overcome through the development of new strategies and tools. These include machine learning approaches, genome mining, and experimental approaches. These strategies have allowed researchers to make significant progress in understanding the complex biosynthetic pathways of RiPPs.

### Section: 16.1 Novel RiPPs Enzyme Functions

#### 16.1a New RiPPs Enzyme Functions

The discovery of novel RiPPs enzyme functions has been a significant breakthrough in the field of natural product research. These enzymes, which are responsible for the post-translational modification of RiPPs, have been found to exhibit a wide range of unique and complex functions. In this section, we will explore some of these novel enzyme functions and their implications for the biosynthesis and applications of RiPPs.

One of the most intriguing aspects of RiPPs enzymes is their ability to catalyze the formation of complex chemical structures. For instance, the enzyme Pks11, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of the RiPP cyclic peptide, cyclo(L-Leu-L-Phe), has been found to exhibit a unique mechanism of action. Pks11 catalyzes the formation of the cyclic peptide through a series of oxidative decarboxylation reactions, which are mediated by a novel active site motif (HXXXD). This motif is responsible for the binding and activation of the substrate, as well as the subsequent oxidative decarboxylation reactions.

Another novel enzyme function that has been discovered in RiPPs is the ability of certain enzymes to catalyze the formation of thioether bonds. Thioether bonds are a common feature of many RiPPs, and their formation is catalyzed by enzymes known as thioesterases. These enzymes have been found to exhibit a unique mechanism of action, which involves the use of a cysteine residue to activate the thiol group of the substrate. This activation step is followed by the formation of a thioester intermediate, which is then attacked by the amino group of the substrate to form the thioether bond.

In addition to these novel enzyme functions, RiPPs enzymes have also been found to exhibit a wide range of other unique properties. For instance, certain enzymes have been found to exhibit substrate specificity, where they are able to selectively modify specific amino acids within a peptide sequence. This substrate specificity is often determined by the presence of specific amino acid motifs within the enzyme active site.

The discovery of these novel enzyme functions has opened up new avenues for the engineering of RiPPs. By manipulating these enzyme functions, researchers can design new RiPPs with desired properties, such as increased potency or selectivity. This has significant implications for the development of new drugs and therapeutics, as well as for our understanding of the underlying biosynthetic pathways.

### Decodification of RiPPs chemical structures

The increase of experimentally characterized ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), together with the availability of information on their sequence and chemical structure, selected from databases such as BAGEL, BACTIBASE, MIBIG, and THIOBASE, provide the opportunity to develop machine learning tools to decode the chemical structure and classify them.

In 2017, researchers at the National Institute of Immunology of New Delhi, India, developed RiPPMiner software, a bioinformatics resource for decoding RiPP chemical structures by genome mining. The RiPPMiner web server consists of a query interface and the RiPPDB database. RiPPMiner defines 12 subclasses of RiPPs, predicting the cleavage site of the leader peptide and the final cross-link of the RiPP chemical structure.

#### Identification of RiPPs and prediction of RiPP Class

RiPPs analysis tools such as antiSMASH and RiPP-PRISM use HMM of modifying enzymes present in biosynthetic gene clusters in RiPP to predict the RiPP subclass. Unlike these tools, RiPPMiner uses a machine learning model, trained with 513 RiPPs, that uses the amino acid sequence of the RiPP gene uniquely to identify and subclass them. RiPPMiner differentiates RiPPs from other proteins and peptides using a support-vector machine model trained on 293 experimentally characterized RiPPs as a positive data set, and 8140 genomes encoded non-RiPPs polypeptides as negative data set. The negative data set included SWISSProt entries similar in length to RiPPs, e.g., 30s ribosomal proteins, matrix proteins, cytochrome B proteins, etc. The support vectors consist of amino acid composition and dipeptide frequencies.

Benchmarking on an independent dataset of 100 RiPPs showed that RiPPMiner achieved an accuracy of 90%, a sensitivity of 85%, and a specificity of 95%. This performance is comparable to other tools such as antiSMASH and RiPP-PRISM, which achieved accuracies of 85% and 80%, respectively. However, RiPPMiner has the advantage of being able to identify and subclass RiPPs without relying on the presence of specific modifying enzymes, making it more versatile and applicable to a wider range of RiPPs.

#### Prediction of RiPP Chemical Structure

RiPPMiner also predicts the chemical structure of RiPPs, which is crucial for understanding their biological activity. The prediction is based on the amino acid sequence of the RiPP gene, which is used to identify the cleavage site of the leader peptide and the final cross-link of the RiPP chemical structure. This prediction is achieved through a support-vector machine model, trained with 513 RiPPs.

Benchmarking on an independent dataset of 100 RiPPs showed that RiPPMiner achieved an accuracy of 85%, a sensitivity of 80%, and a specificity of 85%. This performance is comparable to other tools such as antiSMASH and RiPP-PRISM, which achieved accuracies of 80% and 75%, respectively. However, RiPPMiner has the advantage of being able to predict the chemical structure of a wider range of RiPPs, including those that are not covered by the training dataset.

In conclusion, RiPPMiner is a powerful tool for decoding the chemical structure and classifying RiPPs. Its use of machine learning and unique identification of RiPPs make it a valuable resource for researchers in the field of RiPPs.

However, the applications of these natural products have been largely limited to the realm of medicine, with a focus on their use as antibiotics, anticancer agents, and immunomodulators.

In this chapter, we will expand our exploration of microbial megaproducers to include their applications in agriculture. The use of natural products in agriculture is not a new concept. For centuries, farmers have been using natural products such as manure, compost, and plant extracts to enhance soil fertility and crop growth. However, with the advent of modern agriculture, the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides has become the norm, leading to a host of environmental and health concerns.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of natural products in sustainable agriculture. This has led to the discovery of a plethora of microbial megaproducers that can produce natural products with agricultural applications. These natural products can serve as alternatives to synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, reducing the environmental impact of agriculture while maintaining or even improving crop yields.

In this chapter, we will explore the discovery, biosynthesis, and engineering of these natural products, and their potential applications in agriculture.

In this chapter, we will delve into the advanced biosynthetic processes of NRPs, exploring the intricate mechanisms and challenges involved in their production.

The biosynthesis of NRPs is a multistep process that involves the assembly of amino acids into complex peptide structures. This process is catalyzed by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), a family of enzymes that are responsible for the sequential addition of amino acids to a growing peptide chain. The biosynthesis of NRPs is also influenced by various environmental factors, including pH, temperature, and nutrient availability.

One of the key challenges in understanding NRP biosynthetic processes is the lack of complete genomic information.

### Subsection: 20.1b Techniques for optimizing NRPs

Natural product biosynthesis is a complex process that involves multiple enzymes and pathways. Optimizing the production of natural products (NPs) requires a deep understanding of these processes and the ability to manipulate them effectively. In this section, we will discuss some of the techniques that have been used to optimize NP production.

#### 20.1b.1 Genetic Engineering

Genetic engineering is a powerful tool for optimizing NP production. By manipulating the genes involved in NP biosynthesis, researchers can increase the production of desired NPs or reduce the production of unwanted byproducts. This can be achieved through techniques such as overexpression of key biosynthetic genes, knockout of genes involved in competing pathways, or the introduction of new genes from other organisms.

For example, the biosynthesis of the natural product tetracycline involves several enzymes, including the enzyme 6-deoxy-D-talose-1-phosphate synthase (DtpS). By overexpressing the gene encoding DtpS, researchers have been able to increase the production of tetracycline in the producing organism (1).

#### 20.1b.2 Metabolic Engineering

Metabolic engineering is another powerful technique for optimizing NP production. This approach involves manipulating the metabolic pathways of the producing organism to favor the production of desired NPs. This can be achieved through techniques such as the introduction of new enzymes, the modification of existing enzymes, or the manipulation of metabolite levels.

For example, the biosynthesis of the natural product penicillin involves the enzyme acyl-CoA:penicillin acyltransferase (PAT). By introducing a mutated version of PAT that has a higher affinity for acetyl-CoA, researchers have been able to increase the production of penicillin in the producing organism (2).

#### 20.1b.3 Process Optimization

In addition to genetic and metabolic engineering, process optimization is another important aspect of optimizing NP production. This involves optimizing the conditions under which the NP is produced, such as temperature, pH, and nutrient levels. By carefully optimizing these conditions, researchers can increase the efficiency of NP production and reduce the production of unwanted byproducts.

For example, the production of the natural product erythromycin involves a complex process that includes several fermentation steps. By optimizing the conditions of each step, researchers have been able to increase the overall yield of erythromycin (3).

In conclusion, optimizing NP production requires a combination of genetic engineering, metabolic engineering, and process optimization.
