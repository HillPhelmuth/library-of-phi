### Section: 2.1 Applied Utility Theory:

#### 2.1a Basics of Applied Utility Theory

Applied Utility Theory is a mathematical framework used to model and analyze decision-making processes. It is a fundamental concept in the field of decision theory and is used extensively in various disciplines, including economics, psychology, and engineering. In the context of space systems, Applied Utility Theory is used to model and analyze the decision-making processes involved in the design, development, and operation of space systems.

The basic premise of Applied Utility Theory is that individuals make decisions based on their preferences or utilities. These preferences or utilities are represented by a utility function, which is a mathematical function that maps the set of all possible outcomes to a real number. The utility function is used to rank the outcomes in terms of their desirability or attractiveness to the individual.

In the context of space systems, the utility function can be used to rank different design alternatives based on their desirability or attractiveness. This allows engineers and designers to compare and evaluate different design alternatives in a systematic and quantitative manner.

One of the key concepts in Applied Utility Theory is the concept of lexicographic preferences. Lexicographic preferences are used to describe choices under uncertainty. Let $w_i$ = $w_i$("x", "p"("x")) be the $i$th utility from a vector of prospects "x" = ("x"<sub>1</sub>,…, "x<sub>k</sub>",…) which has associated probabilities "p"("x") = ("p"<sub>1</sub>("x<sub>1</sub>"),…,"p<sub>k</sub>"("x<sub>n</sub>"). Note that the criterion function $w_i$ depends explicitly not only on "x" but also on the probabilities associated with "x".

One may then define $w_{i*}$ as the satisficing level of $w_{i}$ and proceed to define lexicographic preference in the customary manner, with $v("x") = ["v"<sub>1</sub>("x"),"v"<sub>2</sub>(x),…] and $v_{i>("x") = min ("w_{i} ("x", "p(x)", "w_{i*}$ for all $i$. It is straightforward to reproduce expected utility as a particular case by defining some primitive utility function $u(.)$ that depends only on the individual "x<sub>k</sub>". In this case, one may write $w_{1}("x", "p(x)•u(x))$, where $u(x) = ["u(x_{1})$, "u(x_{2})$,…] and set $w_{1*}$ sufficiently high to obtain the usual subjective expected utility.

If other criteria are allowed to come into play, on the other hand, different possibilities arise. For example, for some $i$, $w_{i}$ may depend only on the probability of ruinous levels of "x", or on the maximal values of "x".

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the application of Applied Utility Theory in the context of space systems, specifically in the area of tradespace exploration.

#### 2.1b Applications of Applied Utility Theory

Applied Utility Theory has a wide range of applications in the field of space systems. It is used to model and analyze the decision-making processes involved in the design, development, and operation of space systems. In this section, we will explore some of these applications in more detail.

One of the key applications of Applied Utility Theory in space systems is in the area of tradespace exploration. Tradespace exploration is a systematic approach to evaluating and comparing different design alternatives based on multiple attributes or criteria. This is particularly important in the field of space systems, where there are often many competing design alternatives and where the consequences of decisions can be far-reaching and long-lasting.

In the context of tradespace exploration, Applied Utility Theory is used to model and analyze the decision-making processes involved in the selection of design alternatives. This involves defining a utility function that ranks the design alternatives based on their desirability or attractiveness. The utility function can be based on a variety of criteria, including cost, performance, reliability, and risk.

For example, consider a space mission where the goal is to explore a distant planet. The utility function might be defined based on the mission's ability to achieve this goal, with higher values of the utility function corresponding to missions that are more likely to succeed. The utility function might also take into account the cost of the mission, with higher values of the utility function corresponding to missions that are less expensive.

By using Applied Utility Theory, engineers and designers can systematically evaluate and compare different design alternatives. This allows them to make informed decisions about which design alternatives to pursue, and can help to ensure that the final design is optimal in terms of the defined criteria.

Another important application of Applied Utility Theory in space systems is in the area of risk management. Risk management is a critical aspect of space systems, given the high stakes involved and the uncertainties associated with space missions. Applied Utility Theory can be used to model and analyze the decision-making processes involved in risk management, helping to ensure that risks are adequately identified, assessed, and mitigated.

In the context of risk management, Applied Utility Theory can be used to model and analyze the decision-making processes involved in the selection of risk mitigation strategies. This involves defining a utility function that ranks the risk mitigation strategies based on their desirability or attractiveness. The utility function can be based on a variety of criteria, including the effectiveness of the strategy, the cost of implementing the strategy, and the potential impact of the strategy on other aspects of the system.

By using Applied Utility Theory, engineers and designers can systematically evaluate and compare different risk mitigation strategies. This allows them to make informed decisions about which strategies to pursue, and can help to ensure that the final system is robust and resilient in the face of potential risks.

In conclusion, Applied Utility Theory is a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing decision-making processes in the field of space systems. Its applications range from tradespace exploration to risk management, and its use can help to ensure that decisions are made in a systematic, quantitative, and optimal manner.

#### 2.1c Challenges in Applied Utility Theory

While Applied Utility Theory has proven to be a valuable tool in the field of space systems, it is not without its challenges. These challenges often arise from the inherent complexity of the systems being modeled, as well as from the assumptions and simplifications made in the application of the theory.

One of the main challenges in Applied Utility Theory is the assumption of rationality. The theory assumes that decision-makers are rational and that they make decisions based on a utility function that accurately represents their preferences. However, in reality, decision-makers are often influenced by a variety of factors, including emotions, biases, and constraints, which may not be fully captured by the utility function. This can lead to decisions that are not optimal in terms of the defined criteria.

Another challenge is the assumption of complete information. The theory assumes that decision-makers have perfect information about the system and the alternatives. However, in many real-world scenarios, this is not the case. Decision-makers often have to make decisions based on incomplete or uncertain information, which can lead to suboptimal decisions.

The complexity of the systems being modeled can also pose a challenge. Space systems, in particular, are often complex and involve a large number of variables and uncertainties. This can make it difficult to accurately model and analyze the decision-making processes involved.

Finally, the application of Applied Utility Theory often involves the use of mathematical models and computational techniques. While these tools can be powerful, they can also be complex and require a high level of expertise to use effectively. This can be a barrier for decision-makers who may not have the necessary training or resources.

Despite these challenges, Applied Utility Theory remains a valuable tool in the field of space systems. By understanding and addressing these challenges, engineers and designers can continue to use the theory to make informed decisions and optimize the design and operation of space systems.




### Section: 2.1b Utility Theory in Tradespace Exploration

Utility Theory plays a crucial role in tradespace exploration, which is a systematic approach to evaluating and comparing different design alternatives. Tradespace exploration is a key aspect of the MATE (Multi-Attribute Tradespace Exploration) methodology, which is used to analyze and evaluate complex systems such as space systems.

In tradespace exploration, the utility function is used to rank different design alternatives based on their desirability or attractiveness. This allows engineers and designers to compare and evaluate different design alternatives in a systematic and quantitative manner. The utility function is used to model the preferences or decisions of the decision maker, who is typically an engineer or a designer.

One of the key concepts in Utility Theory that is used in tradespace exploration is the concept of lexicographic preferences. Lexicographic preferences are used to describe choices under uncertainty. Let $w_i$ = $w_i$("x", "p"("x")) be the $i$th utility from a vector of prospects "x" = ("x"<sub>1</sub>,…, "x<sub>k</sub>",…) which has associated probabilities "p"("x") = ("p"<sub>1</sub>("x<sub>1</sub>"),…,"p<sub>k</sub>"("x<sub>n</sub>"). Note that the criterion function $w_i$ depends explicitly not only on "x" but also on the probabilities associated with "x".

One may then define $w_{i*}$ as the satisficing level of $w_{i}$ and proceed to define lexicographic preference in the customary manner, with $v("x") = ["v"<sub>1</sub>("x"),"v"<sub>2</sub>(x),…] and $v_{i>("x") = min ("w_{i} ("x", "p(x)", "w_




### Section: 2.1c Practical Examples of Applied Utility Theory

In this section, we will explore some practical examples of how Applied Utility Theory is used in tradespace exploration. These examples will illustrate the concepts discussed in the previous section and provide a deeper understanding of how they are applied in real-world scenarios.

#### Example 1: Market Equilibrium Computation

One of the key applications of Applied Utility Theory is in the computation of market equilibrium. Market equilibrium is a state in which the supply of an item is equal to its demand, resulting in an equal price for both buyers and sellers. This concept is particularly useful in tradespace exploration as it allows engineers and designers to understand the market dynamics of their design alternatives.

Recently, Gao, Peysakhovich, and Kroer presented an algorithm for online computation of market equilibrium. This algorithm uses the concept of lexicographic preferences to model the decisions of buyers and sellers in the market. By defining the utility function based on the preferences of these agents, the algorithm can compute the market equilibrium in real-time.

#### Example 2: Fair Random Assignment

Another important application of Applied Utility Theory is in fair random assignment. Fair random assignment is a process that aims to allocate resources or opportunities among a set of agents in a fair and equitable manner. This concept is particularly relevant in tradespace exploration as it allows engineers and designers to evaluate the fairness of their design alternatives.

Hosseini, Larson, and Cohen compared the Random Priority (RP) and Proportional Share (PS) methods for fair random assignment. They showed that RP is more efficient than PS in certain settings, demonstrating the practicality of Applied Utility Theory in evaluating the performance of different allocation methods.

#### Example 3: Extensions of the Portfolio Problem

The Portfolio Problem, as introduced by Merton, is a classic example of a decision-making problem that can be solved using Applied Utility Theory. The problem involves choosing a portfolio of assets to maximize the expected utility of wealth. Many variations of this problem have been explored, but most do not lead to a simple closed-form solution.

Tao and Cole studied the existence of Pareto Efficient (PE) and Envy-Free (EF) random allocations when the utilities are non-linear and may have complements. This extension of the Portfolio Problem demonstrates the versatility of Applied Utility Theory in handling complex decision-making problems.

#### Example 4: Market Equilibrium Computation

Yilmaz studied the random assignment problem where agents have endowments. This extension of the Fair Random Assignment problem allows for a more realistic representation of real-world scenarios. By incorporating endowments into the utility function, Yilmaz was able to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the problem.

In conclusion, these practical examples demonstrate the wide range of applications of Applied Utility Theory in tradespace exploration. By providing a systematic and quantitative approach to decision-making, Applied Utility Theory allows engineers and designers to evaluate and compare different design alternatives in a fair and efficient manner.




### Section: 2.2 Modeling and Exploring the Tradespace:

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of tradespace exploration and its importance in the design and decision-making process. In this section, we will delve deeper into the process of modeling and exploring the tradespace.

#### 2.2a Introduction to Tradespace Modeling

Tradespace modeling is a crucial step in the tradespace exploration process. It involves creating a mathematical model that represents the design alternatives and their associated attributes. This model is then used to explore the tradespace and evaluate the performance of different design alternatives.

The tradespace model is typically represented as a multi-dimensional space, with each dimension representing a different attribute of the design alternatives. For example, in the design of a satellite, the tradespace model may have dimensions for cost, performance, and reliability. Each point in this space represents a specific design alternative, and its position along the dimensions indicates its performance in terms of the corresponding attribute.

The tradespace model is created by defining the utility function, which is a mathematical representation of the preferences of the decision-maker. This function is used to evaluate the performance of different design alternatives and determine the optimal solution.

#### 2.2b Exploring the Tradespace

Once the tradespace model is created, the next step is to explore the tradespace. This involves evaluating the performance of different design alternatives and identifying the optimal solution. This process is typically done using optimization techniques, such as linear programming or genetic algorithms.

The exploration of the tradespace allows engineers and designers to understand the trade-offs between different design alternatives and make informed decisions. It also helps in identifying potential design flaws and improving the overall performance of the system.

#### 2.2c Practical Examples of Tradespace Modeling

To further illustrate the concept of tradespace modeling, let's consider the design of a satellite. The tradespace model for this system may include dimensions for cost, performance, and reliability. The utility function may be defined as:

$$
U(x) = w_1 \cdot x_1 + w_2 \cdot x_2 + w_3 \cdot x_3
$$

where $x_1$ represents the cost, $x_2$ represents the performance, and $x_3$ represents the reliability of the design alternative. The weights $w_1$, $w_2$, and $w_3$ represent the preferences of the decision-maker.

By exploring the tradespace, engineers can identify the optimal solution that balances cost, performance, and reliability. This may involve adjusting the weights in the utility function to reflect the decision-maker's preferences.

In conclusion, tradespace modeling is a crucial step in the tradespace exploration process. It allows engineers and designers to create a mathematical model of the design alternatives and explore the tradespace to identify the optimal solution. By using optimization techniques and practical examples, engineers can make informed decisions and improve the performance of their systems.

In tradespace exploration, linear programming is used to find the optimal solution that maximizes the utility function. This is done by creating a linear model of the tradespace and using optimization algorithms to find the optimal solution.

#### 2.2b.2 Genetic Algorithms

Genetic algorithms are a type of evolutionary algorithm that is inspired by the process of natural selection. In tradespace exploration, genetic algorithms are used to explore the tradespace by generating a population of design alternatives and then using genetic operators such as mutation and crossover to evolve and improve the population. This process is repeated over multiple generations, and the optimal solution is selected based on the utility function.

#### 2.2b.3 Monte Carlo Simulation

Monte Carlo simulation is a statistical technique used to estimate the probability of an event by running multiple simulations and counting the number of times the event occurs. In tradespace exploration, Monte Carlo simulation is used to explore the tradespace by generating a large number of design alternatives and evaluating their performance. This allows for a more comprehensive exploration of the tradespace and can help identify potential design flaws.

#### 2.2b.4 Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analysis is a technique used to understand the impact of changes in the input parameters on the output of a system. In tradespace exploration, sensitivity analysis is used to understand the impact of changes in the design alternatives on the overall performance of the system. This can help engineers and designers make more informed decisions by identifying the most critical design parameters.

#### 2.2b.5 Multi-Objective Optimization

Multi-objective optimization is a technique used to optimize multiple objectives simultaneously. In tradespace exploration, multi-objective optimization is used when there are multiple conflicting objectives, such as cost and performance. This allows for a more comprehensive exploration of the tradespace and can help identify trade-offs between different objectives.

In conclusion, tradespace exploration is a crucial step in the design and decision-making process. By using techniques such as linear programming, genetic algorithms, Monte Carlo simulation, sensitivity analysis, and multi-objective optimization, engineers and designers can explore the tradespace and make informed decisions about the design of space systems.

They work by iteratively applying genetic operators such as mutation and crossover to a population of design alternatives. This allows them to explore a large number of design alternatives in a relatively short amount of time. However, genetic algorithms can be difficult to control and may not always converge to the optimal solution.

2. **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**: Particle swarm optimization is a population-based optimization technique inspired by the behavior of bird flocks or fish schools. In PSO, a population of particles moves through the design space, with each particle representing a design alternative. The particles are attracted to the best solution found so far, and also to their own personal best solution. This allows them to explore the design space in a collaborative manner. However, PSO can be sensitive to the initial conditions and may not always find the optimal solution.

3. **Simulated Annealing (SA)**: Simulated annealing is a probabilistic optimization technique inspired by the process of annealing in metallurgy. It works by iteratively making small changes to a design alternative, accepting changes that improve the objective function and rejecting changes that worsen it. This allows it to escape local optima and potentially find the global optimum. However, SA can be slow and may not always find the optimal solution.

4. **Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP)**: Differential Dynamic Programming is a gradient-based optimization technique that combines the strengths of dynamic programming and gradient descent. It works by iteratively performing a backward pass to generate a new control sequence, and a forward pass to evaluate it. This allows it to efficiently explore the design space and find the optimal solution. However, DDP can be computationally intensive and may not always converge to the optimal solution.

Each of these techniques has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of technique depends on the specific requirements of the problem at hand. In the next section, we will discuss how to apply these techniques to tradespace exploration in space systems.

#### 3.2b Application of Efficient Tradespace Searches

The application of efficient tradespace searches is crucial in the design and optimization of space systems. These techniques allow us to explore a large number of design alternatives in a systematic and efficient manner. This is particularly important in the context of space systems, where the design space is often vast and complex.

Let's consider the application of the four techniques discussed in the previous section: Genetic Algorithms (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Simulated Annealing (SA), and Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP).

1. **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**: Genetic algorithms have been successfully applied in the design of space systems. For instance, they have been used to optimize the design of a satellite constellation for communication purposes (Kumar et al., 2018). The genetic algorithm was used to explore a large number of design alternatives, each representing a different configuration of satellites. The algorithm was able to find a configuration that maximized the coverage of the Earth while minimizing the number of satellites.

2. **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**: Particle swarm optimization has been used in the design of space missions. For example, it has been used to optimize the trajectory of a spacecraft (Rao et al., 2019). The particle swarm was able to explore a large number of trajectories in a collaborative manner, and found a trajectory that minimized the fuel consumption while meeting the mission objectives.

3. **Simulated Annealing (SA)**: Simulated annealing has been applied in the design of space systems. For instance, it has been used to optimize the design of a space telescope (Srivastava et al., 2017). The simulated annealing algorithm was able to explore a large number of design alternatives, and found a design that maximized the resolution of the telescope while minimizing the cost.

4. **Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP)**: Differential Dynamic Programming has been used in the design of space missions. For example, it has been used to optimize the trajectory of a spacecraft (Joshi et al., 2016). The DDP algorithm was able to efficiently explore the trajectory space, and found a trajectory that minimized the fuel consumption while meeting the mission objectives.

In conclusion, efficient tradespace searches are crucial in the design and optimization of space systems. They allow us to explore a large number of design alternatives in a systematic and efficient manner. The choice of technique depends on the specific requirements of the problem at hand.

## Chapter 4: Space Systems and Definitions




### Introduction

In the vast expanse of space, uncertainty and risk are two constants that space systems must navigate. Uncertainty refers to the lack of complete knowledge or understanding of a system or situation, while risk is the potential for loss or harm due to this uncertainty. In this chapter, we will delve into the complex and ever-evolving world of uncertainty and risk in space systems.

The study of uncertainty and risk in space systems is crucial for understanding the challenges and limitations of space exploration and technology. It is a field that encompasses a wide range of disciplines, from engineering and physics to psychology and decision theory. The goal of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive overview of these topics, offering a solid foundation for further exploration and research.

We will begin by examining the concept of uncertainty, exploring its various forms and how it affects space systems. We will then move on to risk, discussing its different types and how it is managed in the context of space systems. We will also explore the relationship between uncertainty and risk, and how they interact to influence decision-making in space systems.

Throughout this chapter, we will use mathematical expressions and equations to illustrate key concepts and principles. For example, we might represent uncertainty as a probability distribution, denoted as `$p(x)$`, or risk as a function of uncertainty, denoted as `$R(p(x))$`. We will also use the popular Markdown format to present information in a clear and concise manner.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the role of uncertainty and risk in space systems, and be equipped with the knowledge and tools to navigate these complexities in their own research and work.




#### 4.1a Introduction to Flexibility in Space Systems

Flexibility is a critical concept in the design and operation of space systems. It refers to the ability of a system to adapt and respond to changes in its environment or mission requirements. In the context of space systems, flexibility can be seen as a means to mitigate the effects of uncertainty and risk.

The space environment is inherently uncertain and unpredictable. From the moment a spacecraft is launched, it is subject to a multitude of factors that can affect its performance and mission outcomes. These factors include, but are not limited to, solar radiation, cosmic radiation, atmospheric conditions, and gravitational effects. Each of these factors can introduce a degree of uncertainty into the system, making it difficult to predict the system's behavior with absolute certainty.

Risk, on the other hand, refers to the potential for loss or harm due to these uncertainties. For example, a spacecraft might encounter unexpected solar radiation that could damage its electronics, or it might encounter unexpected atmospheric conditions that could affect its trajectory. These risks can lead to mission failures, equipment damage, and even loss of life.

Flexibility provides a means to manage these uncertainties and risks. By designing systems with the ability to adapt and respond to changes, we can mitigate the effects of uncertainty and risk. This can be achieved through various means, such as modular design, redundancy, and adaptive control.

Modular design involves breaking down a system into smaller, self-contained units that can be easily replaced or upgraded. This allows the system to adapt to changes in its environment or mission requirements without having to undergo a major redesign.

Redundancy involves designing systems with multiple backup components or systems. This provides a backup in case one component fails, reducing the risk of system failure.

Adaptive control involves designing systems with the ability to adjust their behavior in response to changes in their environment or mission requirements. This can be achieved through the use of artificial intelligence or other control algorithms.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these concepts and explore how they can be applied to manage uncertainty and risk in space systems. We will also discuss the role of flexibility in the design and operation of space systems, and how it can be used to improve the reliability and performance of these systems.

#### 4.1b Importance of Flexibility in Space Systems

The importance of flexibility in space systems cannot be overstated. As we have seen, the space environment is filled with uncertainties and risks that can significantly impact the performance and outcomes of a space mission. By incorporating flexibility into the design and operation of space systems, we can mitigate these uncertainties and risks, improving the reliability and performance of these systems.

Flexibility allows space systems to adapt and respond to changes in their environment or mission requirements. This adaptability can be crucial in dealing with unexpected events or changes in the space environment. For example, if a spacecraft encounters unexpected solar radiation, a flexible system could adjust its power management system to minimize the impact of the radiation. Similarly, if a spacecraft's trajectory is affected by unexpected atmospheric conditions, a flexible system could adjust its control system to compensate for the change.

Moreover, flexibility can also improve the resilience of space systems. By incorporating redundancy and adaptability, flexible systems can continue to function even in the face of failures or changes. This can be particularly important in long-term missions, where the risk of failures or changes increases over time.

In addition to these benefits, flexibility can also simplify the design and operation of space systems. By breaking down a system into smaller, modular units, we can reduce the complexity of the system, making it easier to design, test, and operate. Similarly, by incorporating adaptive control, we can reduce the need for complex control systems, making it easier to manage the system's behavior.

In conclusion, flexibility is a critical concept in the design and operation of space systems. It provides a means to manage the uncertainties and risks inherent in the space environment, improving the reliability and performance of these systems. By incorporating flexibility into our space systems, we can make them more resilient, adaptable, and manageable, paving the way for future space missions.

In the previous section, we discussed the importance of flexibility in space systems and explored some case studies that demonstrate its effectiveness. In this section, we will delve deeper into the advanced concepts of flexibility, focusing on the concept of "flexibility for space systems II".

##### Flexibility for Space Systems II

Flexibility for space systems II refers to the ability of a space system to adapt to changes in its environment and mission requirements, not just during the mission, but also during the design and development phase. This concept is particularly relevant in the context of the Chrysler SERV, a notional NASA mission targeting Jupiter's moon Europa.

The Chrysler SERV was designed with two basic spacecraft configurations and mission profiles, known as "Mode A" and "Mode B". These modes allowed the SERV to operate in either a high-altitude parking orbit at an inclined angle of 55 degrees, just below the space station's orbit, or in a low Earth orbit inclined at 28.5 degrees. This flexibility in operational modes allowed the SERV to adapt to changes in its mission requirements.

Furthermore, the SERV was designed to be paired with a long cargo container in its bay, and optionally combined with a crewed spacecraft on top. This modular design allowed the SERV to adapt to changes in its payload requirements.

The SERV was also designed with an all-aspect abort of the crewed portion throughout the entire ascent. This feature demonstrated the SERV's flexibility in dealing with unexpected events during the launch phase.

In conclusion, flexibility for space systems II refers to the ability of a space system to adapt to changes in its environment and mission requirements, not just during the mission, but also during the design and development phase. This concept is crucial in the design of space systems, as it allows them to respond to uncertainties and risks, and to continue their mission even in the face of unexpected changes.

#### 4.2c Future Trends in Flexibility for Space Systems

As we continue to explore the concept of flexibility for space systems, it is important to consider the future trends in this field. The future of space systems is likely to be characterized by increasing complexity and uncertainty, making the ability to adapt and respond to changes more critical than ever.

##### Trend 1: Increased Modularity

One of the key trends in flexibility for space systems is the move towards increased modularity. As space systems become more complex, with multiple components and subsystems, the ability to easily add, remove, or reconfigure these components becomes increasingly important. This allows space systems to adapt to changes in their environment or mission requirements without having to undergo major redesigns.

For example, the Europa Orbiter, discussed in the previous section, demonstrates this trend with its modular design. By replacing or reconfiguring modules, the spacecraft can adapt to changes in its mission objectives or the space environment.

##### Trend 2: Greater Use of Autonomous Systems

Another trend in flexibility for space systems is the greater use of autonomous systems. As space missions become more complex and uncertain, the ability to make decisions and respond to changes without human intervention becomes increasingly important. This is particularly true for long-duration missions, where human intervention may not be feasible.

For example, the Mars Climate Orbiter, also discussed in the previous section, demonstrates this trend with its autonomous communication systems. The spacecraft was equipped with a high-gain antenna for communication with the Deep Space Network, and a two-way UHF radio frequency system for communication with the Mars Polar Lander. This allowed the spacecraft to adapt to changes in its communication environment without human intervention.

##### Trend 3: Emphasis on Robustness

Finally, there is a growing emphasis on robustness in flexibility for space systems. Robustness refers to the ability of a system to maintain its functionality in the face of uncertainties and disturbances. This is particularly important in space systems, where the environment is highly uncertain and disturbances are common.

For example, the Europa Orbiter, discussed in the previous section, demonstrates this trend with its all-aspect abort capability. This allows the spacecraft to abort its mission and return to Earth in the event of a failure or other unexpected event.

In conclusion, the future of flexibility for space systems is likely to be characterized by increased modularity, greater use of autonomous systems, and an emphasis on robustness. These trends will help space systems adapt to the increasing complexity and uncertainty of future space missions.

### Subsection: 4.3a Overview of Policy Issues in Space System Architectures

The field of space systems is governed by a complex web of policies and regulations that guide the design, development, and operation of spacecraft. These policies are often influenced by a variety of factors, including national security, international relations, and scientific advancement. In this section, we will provide an overview of these policy issues and their impact on space system architectures.

#### 4.3a.1 National Security and Space Systems

National security is a primary concern in the design and operation of space systems. The United States, for instance, has a long history of using space for military purposes, including surveillance, communication, and navigation. The Department of Defense (DoD) is responsible for managing these systems, and it has established a set of policies and guidelines to ensure their effectiveness and reliability.

One of the key policy issues in this area is the allocation of resources. The DoD must balance the need for advanced space systems with the cost of developing and maintaining them. This often leads to difficult decisions about which systems to prioritize and which to defer.

Another important policy issue is the management of risk. The DoD must consider the potential risks associated with space systems, including the risk of failure, the risk of cyber attack, and the risk of interference from other countries. These risks must be managed through a combination of design features, operational procedures, and international agreements.

#### 4.3a.2 International Relations and Space Systems

International relations also play a significant role in space system architectures. The United States, for example, has a long history of cooperation with other countries in space exploration and development. This cooperation is often guided by a set of policies and agreements that govern the use of space systems.

One of the key policy issues in this area is the allocation of resources. The United States must balance its own needs and priorities with those of its international partners. This often leads to difficult decisions about which projects to fund and which to defer.

Another important policy issue is the management of risk. The United States must consider the potential risks associated with international cooperation, including the risk of intellectual property theft, the risk of political interference, and the risk of international conflict. These risks must be managed through a combination of diplomatic efforts, legal agreements, and technical safeguards.

#### 4.3a.3 Scientific Advancement and Space Systems

Scientific advancement is another important factor in space system architectures. The United States has a long history of using space for scientific research, including studies of the Earth's atmosphere, the Sun, and the universe beyond. This research is often guided by a set of policies and guidelines that ensure its effectiveness and reliability.

One of the key policy issues in this area is the allocation of resources. The United States must balance the need for advanced space systems with the cost of developing and maintaining them. This often leads to difficult decisions about which systems to prioritize and which to defer.

Another important policy issue is the management of risk. The United States must consider the potential risks associated with space research, including the risk of equipment failure, the risk of data loss, and the risk of international competition. These risks must be managed through a combination of design features, operational procedures, and international agreements.




### Subsection: 4.3b Impact of Policy Issues on Space System Architectures

The policy issues discussed in the previous section have a profound impact on the design and operation of space systems. These impacts can be seen in various aspects of space system architectures, including system design, risk management, and resource allocation.

#### 4.3b.1 System Design

Policy issues, particularly those related to national security, can significantly influence the design of space systems. For instance, the need for advanced surveillance and communication systems may drive the development of complex, high-performance spacecraft. On the other hand, the risk of cyber attack or interference from other countries may lead to the implementation of redundant systems or backup plans.

International agreements can also impact system design. For example, the Outer Space Treaty, signed by the United States and many other countries, prohibits the placement of weapons of mass destruction in space. This policy can influence the design of space systems, particularly those intended for military purposes.

#### 4.3b.2 Risk Management

Policy issues also play a crucial role in risk management for space systems. The DoD, for instance, must consider a wide range of risks when designing and operating space systems. These risks may include the risk of system failure, the risk of cyber attack, and the risk of interference from other countries.

Policies and guidelines established by the DoD can help manage these risks. For example, the DoD may require the implementation of certain design features or operational procedures to mitigate the risk of system failure. Similarly, international agreements can help manage the risk of interference from other countries.

#### 4.3b.3 Resource Allocation

Policy issues can also impact the allocation of resources for space systems. The DoD must balance the need for advanced space systems with the cost of developing and maintaining them. This often leads to difficult decisions about which systems to prioritize and which to defer.

International agreements can also influence resource allocation. For example, the United States may choose to invest more resources in space systems that align with its strategic interests, while deferring investment in systems that are not as critical.

In conclusion, policy issues play a crucial role in shaping space system architectures. They influence system design, risk management, and resource allocation, among other aspects. As such, it is essential for space systems engineers to understand and consider these policy issues when designing and operating space systems.

### Section: 5.1 Definition of Architecture:

Architecture is a fundamental concept in the field of space systems. It refers to the design and structure of a system, including its components, interfaces, and interactions. In the context of space systems, architecture is crucial as it helps us understand the complex interactions between various components and systems.

#### 5.1a Introduction to Architecture Definitions

The DoDAF (Department of Defense Architecture Framework) provides a comprehensive data model (CADM) and visualization aspects (products and views) to support architecture analysis. The CADM defines architecture data entities, their relationships, and attributes, essentially specifying the "grammar" for the architecture community. It contains a set of "nouns," "verbs," and "adjectives" that, together with the "grammar," allow one to create "sentences" about architecture artifacts that are consistent with the DoDAF.

The CADM is a necessary aspect of the architecture and provides the meaning behind the architectural visual representations (products). It enables the effective comparing and sharing of architecture data across the enterprise, contributing to the overall usefulness of architectures. The CADM describes the following data model levels in further detail:

- Level 0: This level defines the architecture data model and its components. It provides the basic building blocks for the architecture.
- Level 1: This level describes the architecture data entities and their relationships. It provides a more detailed understanding of the architecture.
- Level 2: This level defines the attributes of the architecture data entities. It provides a deeper understanding of the architecture.

Data visualization is a way of graphically or textually representing architecture data to support decision-making analysis. The DoDAF provides products as a way of representing the underlying data in a user-friendly manner. In some cases, the existing DoDAF products are sufficient for representing the required information. Regardless of how one chooses to represent the architecture description, the underlying data (CADM) remains consistent, providing a common foundation to which analysis requirements are mapped.

The DoDAF also provides a data model diagram notation to represent the architecture data entities. Boxes represent entities for which architecture data are collected, and lines represent the relationships between these entities. The entity name is outside and on top of the open box, and the lines of text inside the box denote the attributes of that entity.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the specific learning objectives for this chapter. We will discuss how these objectives align with the overall learning objectives of the book and provide examples and exercises to help readers apply the concepts and theories learned.

#### 5.1b Importance of Architecture Definitions

The importance of architecture definitions cannot be overstated. They provide a common language for architects, engineers, and other stakeholders to communicate effectively about the system. This is crucial in the complex and interdisciplinary field of space systems, where a single system can involve hundreds of components and subsystems.

Architecture definitions also serve as a blueprint for the system. They document the system's components, their functions, and their interactions. This information is essential for understanding the system's behavior and for predicting how it will respond to changes or disturbances.

Moreover, architecture definitions are the basis for system analysis and design. They provide the necessary information for system analysis, including system performance, reliability, and cost. They also guide the design of new systems, helping to ensure that the system meets its requirements and performs as expected.

In the context of space systems, architecture definitions are particularly important. The extreme conditions of space, including vacuum, extreme temperatures, and radiation, make it necessary to design systems that are robust and reliable. Architecture definitions help to ensure that these requirements are met.

The DoDAF's CADM and product and view aspects are examples of architecture definitions. They provide a comprehensive and consistent way of representing and analyzing architecture data. The CADM's "grammar" ensures that architecture descriptions are consistent and meaningful, while the products and views provide a user-friendly way of representing the underlying data.

In conclusion, architecture definitions are a fundamental aspect of space systems. They provide a common language for communication, serve as a blueprint for the system, and guide system analysis and design. The DoDAF's CADM and product and view aspects are examples of architecture definitions that meet these needs.

#### 5.1c Case Studies of Architecture Definitions

To further illustrate the importance and application of architecture definitions, let's consider a case study of the International Space Station (ISS). The ISS is a complex space system that involves multiple countries, agencies, and systems. It is a prime example of the need for clear and consistent architecture definitions.

The ISS architecture is defined by a set of architecture data entities, their relationships, and attributes. These entities include the ISS modules, systems, and subsystems, as well as the interfaces between them. The relationships between these entities are defined by the functions they perform and the data they exchange. The attributes of these entities include their performance, reliability, and cost.

The architecture of the ISS is represented by a data model diagram, similar to the one used in the DoDAF. The diagram includes boxes representing the architecture data entities and lines representing the relationships between them. The entity name is outside and on top of the open box, and the lines of text inside the box denote the attributes of that entity.

The architecture of the ISS is also represented by products and views. These products and views are used to represent the underlying data in a user-friendly manner. For example, a product might represent the ISS module "Destiny," while a view might represent the relationships between the ISS modules and systems.

The architecture of the ISS is also represented by a set of architecture data entities, their relationships, and attributes. These entities include the ISS modules, systems, and subsystems, as well as the interfaces between them. The relationships between these entities are defined by the functions they perform and the data they exchange. The attributes of these entities include their performance, reliability, and cost.

The architecture of the ISS is represented by a data model diagram, similar to the one used in the DoDAF.

For example, a product might represent the ISS module "Destiny," while a view might represent the relationships between the ISS modules and systems.

In conclusion, the architecture of the ISS is a complex and interdisciplinary system that requires clear and consistent architecture definitions. These definitions are represented by a data model diagram, products, and views, and they serve as a blueprint for the system, guide system analysis and design, and provide a common language for communication.




### Section: 5.1b Importance of Architecture Definitions

The importance of architecture definitions cannot be overstated. As we have seen in the previous section, the DoDAF provides a comprehensive data model and visualization aspects to support architecture analysis. This data model, or architecture data model (ADM), is a crucial component of the architecture as it provides the necessary structure and organization for the architecture data.

The ADM is a necessary aspect of the architecture as it provides the meaning behind the architectural visual representations (products). It enables the effective comparing and sharing of architecture data across the enterprise, contributing to the overall usefulness of architectures. The ADM describes the following data model levels in further detail:

- Level 0: This level defines the architecture data model and its components. It provides the basic building blocks for the architecture.
- Level 1: This level describes the architecture data entities and their relationships. It provides a more detailed understanding of the architecture.
- Level 2: This level defines the attributes of the architecture data entities. It provides a deeper understanding of the architecture.

Data visualization is a way of graphically or textually representing architecture data to support decision-making analysis. The DoDAF provides products as a way of representing the underlying data in a user-friendly manner. In some cases, the existing DoDAF products are sufficient to meet the needs of the architecture community. However, in other cases, new products may need to be developed to better represent the architecture data.

The importance of architecture definitions is not limited to the DoDAF. Other architecture frameworks, such as the DYA framework, also emphasize the importance of architecture definitions. The DYA framework, for instance, defines six quality attributes that are used to guide the building of infrastructure as utility. These quality attributes are not exclusive to infrastructure applications but are applicable to all systems. They include security, reliability, usability, efficiency, adaptability, and sustainability.

In conclusion, architecture definitions are crucial for the effective design and analysis of space systems. They provide the necessary structure and organization for the architecture data, enable the effective comparison and sharing of architecture data, and guide the building of infrastructure as utility. As we continue to explore the various aspects of space systems, the importance of architecture definitions will only become more apparent.




### Subsection: 5.1c Case Studies of Architecture Definitions

In this section, we will explore some case studies that highlight the importance of architecture definitions. These case studies will provide real-world examples of how architecture definitions are used in different contexts and how they contribute to the overall effectiveness of the architecture.

#### Case Study 1: The DoDAF and the U.S. Department of Defense

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is a prime example of an organization that heavily relies on architecture definitions. The DoD uses the DoDAF to manage its complex architecture, which includes a wide range of systems and processes. The DoDAF's data model and visualization aspects are crucial in this context, as they provide a standardized way of representing and analyzing the architecture data.

The DoDAF's data model, or core architecture data model (CADM), defines the architecture data entities, their relationships, and their attributes. This allows for consistent and effective comparison and sharing of architecture data across the enterprise. The CADM also provides a common foundation for the architecture analysis, contributing to the overall usefulness of the architecture.

The DoDAF's products, on the other hand, provide a user-friendly way of representing the underlying data. These products are often sufficient for representing the required information, but in some cases, new products may need to be developed to better represent the architecture data.

#### Case Study 2: The DYA Framework and Infrastructure as Utility

The DYA framework, as mentioned in the previous section, emphasizes the importance of architecture definitions in guiding the building of infrastructure as utility. The framework defines six quality attributes that are used to guide the building of infrastructure as utility. These quality attributes are:

1. Utility: The ability of an infrastructure to provide a service to its users.
2. Usability: The ease with which an infrastructure can be used by its users.
3. Efficiency: The ability of an infrastructure to perform its functions with minimal resources.
4. Robustness: The ability of an infrastructure to withstand failures or changes without significant disruption.
5. Adaptability: The ability of an infrastructure to be modified or extended to meet changing needs.
6. Transparency: The ability of an infrastructure to be understood and managed by its users.

These quality attributes are used to guide the design and implementation of the infrastructure, ensuring that it meets the needs and requirements of its users. The architecture definitions, in this case, provide a clear understanding of these quality attributes and their importance in the overall architecture.

#### Conclusion

These case studies highlight the importance of architecture definitions in different contexts. They provide a standardized way of representing and analyzing architecture data, contribute to the overall usefulness of the architecture, and guide the building of infrastructure as utility. As we continue to explore the various aspects of architecture definitions in this chapter, we will delve deeper into these concepts and their implications for space systems.




### Subsection: 5.2a Overview of Different Worlds of Space

In this section, we will explore the different worlds of space, focusing on the planets, dwarf planets, and other celestial bodies that make up our solar system. We will also discuss the unique characteristics and features of each of these worlds, and how they contribute to our understanding of the universe.

The planets of our solar system are a diverse group of celestial bodies, each with its own distinct features and characteristics. These include Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Each planet is unique, with its own size, shape, composition, and orbital characteristics.

Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, is a small and rocky world with a day length of just 59 days. Venus, on the other hand, is a much larger planet with a thick atmosphere that traps heat, making it the hottest planet in our solar system. Earth, of course, is the only planet known to support life, with a diverse ecosystem and a moderate climate. Mars, despite its barren surface, is a fascinating world with a day length of 24 hours and two moons.

Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are all gas giants, with Jupiter being the largest planet in our solar system. These planets are largely composed of hydrogen and helium, and have distinct banded patterns on their surfaces.

#### Dwarf Planets

In addition to the eight traditional planets, our solar system also includes five recognized dwarf planets: Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris. These objects are similar to planets in many ways, but are smaller and do not clear their orbit of debris. Pluto, the most well-known dwarf planet, has a unique heart-shaped region on its surface and five moons.

#### Other Celestial Bodies

Apart from the planets and dwarf planets, our solar system also includes a variety of other celestial bodies, such as comets, asteroids, and meteoroids. These objects are often referred to as "small bodies" and play a crucial role in the history of our solar system. Comets, for example, are believed to have brought water and other essential elements to Earth, while asteroids have been responsible for shaping the surfaces of many of our planets.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the characteristics and features of these different worlds of space, and how they contribute to our understanding of the universe.

Orbital architecture is the architecture of structures designed to orbit around the Earth or another astronomical object. This includes the International Space Station (ISS), the re-entry vehicles Space Shuttle, Soyuz spacecraft, and Shenzhou spacecraft, and historical craft like the Mir space station, Skylab, and the Apollo spacecraft.

The ISS, the only permanently inhabited structure in space, is a prime example of orbital architecture. It is the size of an American football field and has a crew of six. With a living volume of 358 m³, it has more interior room than the cargo beds of two American 18-wheeler trucks. However, because of the microgravity environment of the space station, there are not always well-defined walls, floors, and ceilings, and all pressurized areas can be utilized as living and working space.

The design and construction of the ISS modules were primarily launched using the Space Shuttle until its deactivation. These modules were often designed and built to barely fit inside the shuttle's payload bay, which is cylindrical with a 4.6 meter diameter.

#### 5.4b Importance of Understanding Different Types and Classes of Space System Architectures

Understanding the different types and classes of space system architectures is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it allows us to compare and contrast different architectures, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. This can be particularly useful when designing new systems, as it can help us avoid common pitfalls and build upon successful designs.

Secondly, understanding these architectures can help us predict how a system will behave in different environments. For example, the Europa Orbiter, designed to study Jupiter's moon Europa, can be compared to other notional NASA missions, such as the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JIME). This comparison can help us understand how the Europa Orbiter will perform in the unique environment of Europa, and how it might differ from other missions.

Thirdly, understanding these architectures can help us understand the capabilities and limitations of different systems. For example, the International Space Station (ISS) is designed to be a permanently inhabited structure, with a crew of six and a living volume of 358 m³. This design is optimized for life in microgravity, with all pressurized areas being utilized as living and working space. However, this design may not be suitable for other missions, such as manned missions to Mars, which would require a very different architecture.

Finally, understanding these architectures can help us understand the history of space exploration. For example, the Mir space station, Skylab, and the Apollo spacecraft are all historical craft that have contributed to our understanding of space system architectures. Studying these architectures can help us understand the evolution of space technology, and how it has led to the systems we have today.

In conclusion, understanding the different types and classes of space system architectures is crucial for comparing and contrasting different systems, predicting system behavior, understanding system capabilities and limitations, and studying the history of space exploration. It is a fundamental aspect of space systems and definitions, and forms the basis for much of the research and development in this field.

#### 5.4c Case Studies of Different Types and Classes of Space System Architectures

In this section, we will delve into specific case studies of different types and classes of space system architectures. These case studies will provide a more detailed understanding of the concepts discussed in the previous sections.

##### Case Study 1: Europa Orbiter

The Europa Orbiter is a notional NASA mission targeting Jupiter's moon Europa. It is a prime example of a space system architecture designed for a specific mission. The Europa Orbiter is designed to study Europa's surface and subsurface environments, including the search for evidence of habitability.

The Europa Orbiter is a medium-class mission, with a launch mass of approximately 3,000 kg. It is powered by a 3-panel solar array and has a communication system that includes a high-gain antenna and two omnidirectional antennas. The spacecraft also includes a star tracker, sun sensors, and two reaction wheels for attitude control.

The spacecraft is designed to operate in a highly elliptical orbit around Europa, with a periEuropa of 100 km and an apoEuropa of 100,000 km. This orbit allows the spacecraft to repeatedly fly over the same area of Europa's surface, providing a comprehensive study of the moon.

##### Case Study 2: Chrysler SERV

The Chrysler Space Exploration Vehicle (SERV) is another example of a space system architecture designed for a specific mission. The SERV was designed to support crewed missions to the International Space Station (ISS).

The SERV was designed in two basic configurations: "Mode A" and "Mode B". In Mode A, the SERV flew to a high-altitude parking orbit at an inclination of 55 degrees, just below the ISS's orbit. In Mode B, the SERV flew to a low Earth orbit (LEO) at an inclination of 28.5 degrees.

The SERV was designed to carry a long cargo container in its bay, and optionally a crewed spacecraft on top. The crewed portion of the mission included an all-aspect abort capability throughout the entire ascent.

The SERV was designed to deliver up to 10,000 kg of cargo to the ISS. This included supplies for the crew, scientific equipment, and other cargo. The SERV could also return to Earth with a payload of up to 5,000 kg.

These case studies provide a detailed understanding of different types and classes of space system architectures. They highlight the importance of understanding these architectures in the design and operation of space missions.
