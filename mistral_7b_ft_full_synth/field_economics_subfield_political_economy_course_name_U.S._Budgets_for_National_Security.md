# U.S. Budgets for National Security: A Comprehensive Analysis":


## Foreward

Welcome to "U.S. Budgets for National Security: A Comprehensive Analysis". This book aims to provide a thorough examination of the United States' budgets for national security, with a particular focus on the years 2021 and 2022. As we delve into the intricacies of these budgets, we will explore the various factors that influence them, the decisions that shape them, and the implications they have for the nation's security.

The United States' defense budget is a complex and multifaceted entity, encompassing a wide range of expenses and considerations. It is not merely a monetary figure, but a reflection of the nation's strategic priorities, technological advancements, and geopolitical realities. As such, it is a critical component of the nation's overall security strategy.

In the fiscal year 2022, the President's defense budget request was $715 billion, a slight increase from the previous year's $705 billion. This budget request, however, was not without its challenges. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved a budget $25 billion greater than the President's defense budget request, reflecting the complex interplay between political considerations and strategic needs.

The National Defense Authorization Act, which budgeted $740 billion for defense, was signed into law on 27 December 2021. This act, among other things, established the Space Force as a separate branch of the military, reflecting the growing importance of space-based technologies in modern warfare.

As we delve into the details of these budgets, we will also explore the concept of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), which was replaced in the FY2022 budget request by 'direct war and enduring costs'. This shift in terminology reflects the evolving nature of modern warfare and the challenges it presents for budget planning and allocation.

This book is intended for advanced undergraduate students at MIT, but it is also a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding the complexities of U.S. budgets for national security. We hope that this comprehensive analysis will provide you with a deeper understanding of these budgets and their implications for the nation's security.

### Section 1.1:  Money is Policy:

In the realm of national security, budgets are not just a reflection of policy, but they are also a tool for shaping policy. The allocation of resources and the prioritization of certain programs and initiatives are all decisions that are made through the budgeting process. These decisions, in turn, have a significant impact on the country's security and its ability to protect its citizens and interests.

#### 1.1a Definition of Policy

Policy, in the context of national security, refers to the guidelines and principles that guide decision-making within the government. These policies are often established by the executive branch, with input from the legislative branch, and are implemented by various departments and agencies. They are designed to achieve specific objectives and are often expressed in terms of goals, objectives, and strategies.

Policies can be broad or narrow, depending on the scope of their application. For example, a broad policy might be to reduce the risk of terrorism, while a narrow policy might be to increase surveillance at specific airports. Policies can also be hierarchical, with higher-level policies guiding lower-level policies. For instance, a policy to reduce the risk of terrorism might be supported by a policy to increase surveillance and a policy to improve intelligence gathering.

Policies can be formal or informal, depending on their level of formality. Formal policies are often documented and communicated to all relevant parties, while informal policies may be communicated verbally or through unwritten practices. Both types of policies can have a significant impact on the budget, as they guide the allocation of resources and the prioritization of initiatives.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the relationship between budgets and policies, exploring how budget decisions are influenced by policy and how policy is shaped by budget constraints.

#### 1.1b Role of Money in Policy

Money plays a pivotal role in the policy-making process, particularly in the realm of national security. The allocation of resources, the prioritization of initiatives, and the implementation of policies are all influenced by budgetary considerations. 

The budget is a statement of the government's financial plan, outlining the expected revenue and expenditure for a given period. It is a tool for translating policy into action, as it provides the necessary resources for implementing policies. Without adequate funding, even the most well-conceived policies can fail to achieve their objectives.

The budget also serves as a mechanism for prioritizing policies. Policies that are deemed more important or urgent are typically allocated more resources. This can lead to a cycle of policy reinforcement, where policies that are successful in achieving their objectives are rewarded with more resources, further enhancing their effectiveness. Conversely, policies that fail to meet their objectives may be subject to budget cuts, potentially leading to their failure.

Moreover, the budget can also serve as a tool for policy change. By adjusting the budget, policymakers can signal a change in policy direction. For instance, increasing funding for a particular program can indicate a policy shift towards prioritizing that program. Conversely, reducing funding can signal a policy shift away from that program.

In the context of national security, the budget plays a crucial role in shaping policy. The allocation of resources for defense, intelligence, and other security-related initiatives can have a significant impact on the country's ability to protect its citizens and interests. Therefore, understanding the relationship between money and policy is essential for comprehending the budgets for national security.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the relationship between budgets and policies, exploring how budget decisions are influenced by policy and how policy is shaped by budget constraints.

#### 1.1c Case Studies

To further illustrate the relationship between money and policy, let's examine two case studies: the U.S. military budget and the U.S. intelligence budget.

##### U.S. Military Budget

The U.S. military budget is one of the largest in the world, and it plays a crucial role in shaping the country's national security policy. The budget is used to fund a wide range of military activities, including the maintenance of military bases, the purchase of weapons and equipment, and the salaries of military personnel.

The budget is also used to fund specific policies, such as the "war on terror." For instance, the budget provides funding for military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as for intelligence gathering and analysis related to these operations.

The budget also serves as a tool for policy change. For example, in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the U.S. government significantly increased its military budget, reflecting a policy shift towards prioritizing defense and security.

##### U.S. Intelligence Budget

The U.S. intelligence budget is another example of how money influences policy. The budget is used to fund various intelligence agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

The budget is also used to fund specific policies, such as the "war on terror." For instance, the budget provides funding for intelligence gathering and analysis related to terrorist threats.

The budget also serves as a tool for policy change. For example, in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the U.S. government significantly increased its intelligence budget, reflecting a policy shift towards prioritizing intelligence gathering and analysis.

These case studies illustrate the crucial role that money plays in shaping policy. The allocation of resources, the prioritization of initiatives, and the implementation of policies are all influenced by budgetary considerations. Therefore, understanding the relationship between money and policy is essential for comprehending the budgets for national security.




#### 1.1b Role of Money in Policy Making

Money plays a pivotal role in policy making, particularly in the realm of national security. It is the medium through which policies are implemented and objectives are achieved. The allocation of resources, the hiring of personnel, and the acquisition of equipment and technology are all decisions that are made through the budgeting process. These decisions, in turn, have a significant impact on the country's security and its ability to protect its citizens and interests.

The budget is not just a reflection of policy, but it is also a tool for shaping policy. The allocation of resources and the prioritization of certain programs and initiatives are all decisions that are made through the budgeting process. These decisions, in turn, have a significant impact on the country's security and its ability to protect its citizens and interests.

For instance, consider the policy of reducing the risk of terrorism. This policy might be supported by a budget allocation for increased surveillance at specific airports. The budget allocation is not just a reflection of the policy, but it is also a tool for implementing the policy. By allocating resources to increased surveillance, the policy is being put into action.

Similarly, consider the policy of improving intelligence gathering. This policy might be supported by a budget allocation for advanced technology and personnel training. The budget allocation is not just a reflection of the policy, but it is also a tool for implementing the policy. By allocating resources to advanced technology and personnel training, the policy is being put into action.

In conclusion, money is not just a resource in policy making, but it is also a tool for shaping policy. The allocation of resources and the prioritization of certain programs and initiatives are all decisions that are made through the budgeting process. These decisions, in turn, have a significant impact on the country's security and its ability to protect its citizens and interests.

#### 1.1c Case Studies of Money in Policy

To further illustrate the role of money in policy making, let's delve into some case studies. These examples will provide a more concrete understanding of how money is used to implement policies and achieve objectives in the realm of national security.

##### Case Study 1: The U.S. Department of Defense

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is responsible for implementing a wide range of policies related to national security. One of these policies is the development and maintenance of a strong and capable military. The DoD achieves this through a complex budgeting process that involves allocating resources to various military branches and programs.

For instance, the DoD might allocate a certain amount of money to the Army for the development of new weapons systems. This budget allocation is not just a reflection of the policy, but it is also a tool for implementing the policy. By allocating resources to the development of new weapons systems, the policy is being put into action.

Similarly, the DoD might allocate a certain amount of money to the Navy for the maintenance of its fleet. This budget allocation is not just a reflection of the policy, but it is also a tool for implementing the policy. By allocating resources to the maintenance of the fleet, the policy is being put into action.

##### Case Study 2: The U.S. Department of Homeland Security

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for implementing policies related to domestic security. One of these policies is the protection of the U.S. border. The DHS achieves this through a complex budgeting process that involves allocating resources to various border security programs.

For instance, the DHS might allocate a certain amount of money to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for the construction of a border wall. This budget allocation is not just a reflection of the policy, but it is also a tool for implementing the policy. By allocating resources to the construction of a border wall, the policy is being put into action.

Similarly, the DHS might allocate a certain amount of money to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for the hiring of additional border patrol agents. This budget allocation is not just a reflection of the policy, but it is also a tool for implementing the policy. By allocating resources to the hiring of additional border patrol agents, the policy is being put into action.

In conclusion, these case studies illustrate the crucial role of money in policy making. Money is not just a resource in policy making, but it is also a tool for shaping policy. The allocation of resources and the prioritization of certain programs and initiatives are all decisions that are made through the budgeting process. These decisions, in turn, have a significant impact on the country's security and its ability to protect its citizens and interests.




#### 1.1c Impact of Budget on Policy

The budget has a profound impact on policy, particularly in the realm of national security. The allocation of resources, the hiring of personnel, and the acquisition of equipment and technology are all decisions that are made through the budgeting process. These decisions, in turn, have a significant impact on the country's security and its ability to protect its citizens and interests.

The budget is not just a reflection of policy, but it is also a tool for shaping policy. The allocation of resources and the prioritization of certain programs and initiatives are all decisions that are made through the budgeting process. These decisions, in turn, have a significant impact on the country's security and its ability to protect its citizens and interests.

For instance, consider the policy of reducing the risk of terrorism. This policy might be supported by a budget allocation for increased surveillance at specific airports. The budget allocation is not just a reflection of the policy, but it is also a tool for implementing the policy. By allocating resources to increased surveillance, the policy is being put into action.

Similarly, consider the policy of improving intelligence gathering. This policy might be supported by a budget allocation for advanced technology and personnel training. The budget allocation is not just a reflection of the policy, but it is also a tool for implementing the policy. By allocating resources to advanced technology and personnel training, the policy is being put into action.

However, it is important to note that the budget is not a static entity. It is a dynamic and evolving document that reflects the changing needs and priorities of the nation. As such, the impact of the budget on policy is not static either. It can change and evolve over time, reflecting the changing circumstances and challenges faced by the nation.

In conclusion, the budget plays a crucial role in shaping policy, particularly in the realm of national security. It is a dynamic and evolving document that reflects the changing needs and priorities of the nation. By allocating resources and prioritizing certain programs and initiatives, the budget helps to implement policy and achieve national security objectives.




#### 1.2a Overview of Federal Budget

The federal budget is a comprehensive financial plan that outlines the proposed revenues and expenditures of the United States government for a specific fiscal year. It is a critical tool for managing the nation's finances and implementing policy decisions. The budget process begins with the President's budget proposal, which is then reviewed and revised by Congress before being enacted into law.

The federal budget is divided into two main categories: mandatory spending and discretionary spending. Mandatory spending includes items such as Social Security, Medicare, and interest on the national debt, which are set by law and do not require annual appropriations. Discretionary spending, on the other hand, includes items such as defense, education, and transportation, which are proposed by the President and approved by Congress each year.

The budget also includes a section for off-budget items, which are expenses that are not included in the main budget but are still considered part of the government's financial obligations. These items include the Social Security trust funds and the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities.

The budget is also accompanied by a budget message, which provides an overview of the budget and explains the President's budget priorities. This message is often used to justify the proposed budget decisions and to outline the President's vision for the future.

The budget is a dynamic and evolving document that reflects the changing needs and priorities of the nation. It is a tool for implementing policy decisions and managing the nation's finances. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the components of the federal budget and explore how they are used to shape policy and manage the nation's security.

#### 1.2b Budget Process

The budget process in the United States is a complex and iterative one, involving multiple stages and actors. It begins with the President's budget proposal, which is then reviewed and revised by Congress before being enacted into law. This process is guided by the Budget Act of 1974, which sets forth the timeline and procedures for the budget process.

The President's budget proposal is typically released in February of each year, and it outlines the proposed revenues and expenditures for the upcoming fiscal year. This proposal is based on the President's policy priorities and is designed to balance the budget over a specified period, typically 10 years.

Once the President's budget proposal is released, it is referred to the Congress, where it is reviewed and revised by the House and Senate Budget Committees. These committees are responsible for ensuring that the budget complies with the Budget Act and for making any necessary adjustments.

After the budget is approved by the Budget Committees, it is then considered by the full House and Senate. During this stage, the budget may be amended to reflect the priorities of the respective chambers.

Once the budget is passed by both the House and Senate, it is sent to the President for his signature. If the President approves the budget, it becomes law. If he vetoes it, it is returned to Congress, where it may be amended and resubmitted for the President's consideration.

The budget process is not a one-time event, but rather an ongoing one. Throughout the fiscal year, the budget is monitored and adjusted as necessary to reflect changes in the economy and policy decisions. This process is known as budget reconciliation and is governed by the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985.

In conclusion, the budget process is a complex and iterative one that involves multiple stages and actors. It is a critical tool for managing the nation's finances and implementing policy decisions. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the components of the federal budget and explore how they are used to shape policy and manage the nation's security.

#### 1.2c Role of Budgets in Policy

Budgets play a crucial role in policy-making, particularly in the realm of national security. They serve as a roadmap for the allocation of resources and the implementation of policy decisions. In this section, we will explore the role of budgets in policy, focusing on the U.S. federal budget and its impact on national security.

The federal budget is a comprehensive financial plan that outlines the proposed revenues and expenditures of the United States government for a specific fiscal year. It is a critical tool for managing the nation's finances and implementing policy decisions. The budget process begins with the President's budget proposal, which is then reviewed and revised by Congress before being enacted into law.

The budget is a reflection of the government's policy priorities. It allocates resources to various programs and initiatives based on these priorities. For instance, the 2013 Australian federal budget, as mentioned in the related context, included a number of policy decisions related to social security, welfare, infrastructure, transport, and energy. These decisions were reflected in the budget, which outlined the proposed expenditures for these areas.

Budgets also play a crucial role in policy implementation. They provide the necessary funding for policy initiatives and programs. For example, the 2013 Australian federal budget included an increase in the Family Tax Benefit Part A scheme, which was intended to spread the wealth of the mining boom. This increase was funded by the budget.

However, budgets also impose constraints on policy-making. They limit the amount of resources available for new initiatives and programs. This can lead to difficult decisions about which programs to fund and which to cut. For instance, the 2013 Australian federal budget also included a number of budget cuts, including a reduction in funding for the public service and an increase in the cost of higher education.

In conclusion, budgets play a crucial role in policy-making. They reflect the government's policy priorities, provide the necessary funding for policy initiatives, and impose constraints on policy-making. Understanding the budget process and the role of budgets in policy is therefore essential for anyone studying national security.




#### 1.2b Budget Process

The budget process in the United States is a complex and iterative one, involving multiple stages and actors. It begins with the President's budget proposal, which is then reviewed and revised by Congress before being enacted into law. This process is governed by the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, which requires the President to submit a budget to Congress for each fiscal year.

The President's budget proposal is formulated over a period of months with the assistance of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The budget request includes funding requests for all federal executive departments and independent agencies. These requests are accompanied by detailed information on spending and revenue proposals, along with policy proposals and initiatives with significant budgetary implications. The President's budget proposal is a comprehensive document that outlines the administration's intended revenue and spending plans for the following fiscal year.

Once the President's budget proposal is submitted to Congress, it undergoes a rigorous review process. Congress has the power to modify the budget proposal, and often does so to reflect its own priorities and concerns. This process can involve hearings, negotiations, and amendments. The final budget is then enacted into law, typically through a process known as reconciliation.

The budget process is a critical tool for managing the nation's finances and implementing policy decisions. It allows the President and Congress to shape the government's spending and revenue plans, and to allocate resources in a way that reflects their priorities. The budget process is also a key component of the nation's economic policy, as it sets the stage for future economic growth and stability.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the components of the federal budget and explore how they are used to shape policy and manage the nation's security.

#### 1.2c Role of Budgets in Policy

Budgets play a crucial role in policy-making, particularly in the realm of national security. They are the financial blueprint that guides the government's spending and revenue plans, and they are used to implement policy decisions. In the context of national security, budgets are used to allocate resources and prioritize spending in a way that reflects the government's strategic objectives.

The budget process is a critical tool for managing the nation's finances and implementing policy decisions. It allows the President and Congress to shape the government's spending and revenue plans, and to allocate resources in a way that reflects their priorities. This is particularly important in the realm of national security, where decisions about spending and resource allocation can have a direct impact on the nation's ability to protect its citizens and achieve its strategic objectives.

The budget process begins with the President's budget proposal, which is then reviewed and revised by Congress. This process allows for a thorough examination of the government's spending and revenue plans, and provides an opportunity for Congress to modify the budget proposal to reflect its own priorities and concerns. This process can involve hearings, negotiations, and amendments, and it is a key component of the nation's economic policy.

The final budget is then enacted into law, typically through a process known as reconciliation. This process allows for a simple majority vote in the Senate, which can be particularly important in the context of national security, where there may be a need for quick action.

Budgets are also used to track and manage the government's financial performance. The OMB's Monthly Treasury Statement, for example, provides a comprehensive overview of the government's financial position, including its cash and debt balances, revenue and spending trends, and budgetary balances. This information is crucial for understanding the government's financial health and for making informed policy decisions.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the components of the federal budget and explore how they are used to shape policy and manage the nation's security.




#### 1.2c Budget Analysis

Budget analysis is a critical component of the budget process. It involves the examination of the budget proposal, including its revenue and spending plans, to assess its impact on the nation's economy and security. This analysis is typically conducted by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), an independent agency that provides budgetary and economic information to Congress.

The CBO's analysis of the President's budget proposal includes an assessment of its impact on the deficit, the national debt, and the economy. The CBO also provides alternative projections of the budget deficit and the national debt under current law, which can be used to compare with the President's budget proposal.

The CBO's analysis also includes an examination of the budget proposal's impact on various sectors of the economy, including defense, health care, and social security. This analysis can provide valuable insights into the budget's implications for national security and other policy areas.

In addition to its analysis of the President's budget proposal, the CBO also conducts its own budget projections. These projections are based on current law and assumptions about future economic conditions, and they provide a baseline for evaluating the budget proposals of the President and Congress.

The CBO's budget projections and analysis are crucial tools for policymakers. They provide a nonpartisan and objective assessment of the budget, which can help inform policy decisions. They also serve as a basis for further analysis and debate, as policymakers and the public consider the budget's implications for the nation's economy and security.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the components of the federal budget and explore how they are used to shape policy and manage the nation's security.

### Section: 2.1 Composition of the Defense Budget:

The defense budget is a crucial component of the overall national security budget. It is responsible for funding the military and related defense activities. In this section, we will explore the composition of the defense budget, including its various components and how they are allocated.

#### 2.1a Breakdown of Defense Budget

The defense budget is a complex and multifaceted entity, with numerous components and subcomponents. In this subsection, we will break down the defense budget into its main categories, providing a comprehensive understanding of its composition.

The defense budget can be broadly categorized into two main components: the base budget and the overseas contingency operations (OCO) budget. The base budget is the regular budget for the Department of Defense, while the OCO budget is a supplemental budget that is used to fund ongoing military operations and contingencies.

The base budget is further divided into several subcategories, including personnel, operations and maintenance, research and development, and procurement. Personnel costs make up a significant portion of the base budget, covering the salaries and benefits of military personnel. Operations and maintenance costs cover the expenses for training, equipment, and facilities. Research and development costs are used to fund new technologies and advancements in military capabilities. Procurement costs are used to purchase new equipment and weapons.

The OCO budget, on the other hand, is used to fund ongoing military operations and contingencies. This includes costs for troops, equipment, and supplies deployed in combat zones, as well as costs for training and preparing forces for potential future conflicts.

In addition to the base budget and OCO budget, there are also several other budgetary accounts that are used to fund specific defense activities. These include the Defense Health Program, which covers the healthcare costs of military personnel and their families, and the Defense Working Capital Fund, which is used to finance the purchase of goods and services for the Department of Defense.

The composition of the defense budget is influenced by a variety of factors, including national security priorities, global events, and budget constraints. As such, the allocation of funds within the defense budget can change significantly from year to year.

In the next section, we will explore the historical context of the defense budget, examining how it has evolved over time and the factors that have influenced its development.

### Section: 5.2 Assessing the Financial Burden on National Security Budgets:

The war in Iraq has had a significant impact on the United States' national security budget. The costs of the war have been a major factor in the growing national debt and have had a significant impact on the U.S. economy. In this section, we will assess the financial burden of the war on national security budgets and explore the various economic aspects of the war.

#### 5.2a War Cost and National Security Budget

The war in Iraq has been a costly endeavor for the United States. The direct costs of military operations, reconstruction efforts, and other expenses related to the war have been a major factor in the growing national debt. According to the Costs of War Project at Brown University's Watson Institute, the War on Terror, which includes the war in Iraq, will have cost $8 trillion for operations between 2001 and 2022 plus $2.2 trillion in future costs of veterans' care over the next 30 years. Out of this number, $2.313 trillion is for Afghanistan, $2.058 trillion for Iraq and Syria, and $355 billion was spent on other warzones. The remainder was for DHS ($1.1 trillion).

The war in Iraq has also had a significant impact on the U.S. economy. The United States Department of Defense reports spending $1.547 trillion from 2001 to February 2020 in war costs in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan. This spending has contributed to the growing national debt, which has reached over $22 trillion as of February 2020. The war has also had indirect economic consequences, such as the loss of jobs and the displacement of civilians, which have further impacted the U.S. economy.

The war in Iraq has also had a significant impact on the U.S. budget. The war has been a major factor in the increasing defense spending in the U.S. budget. According to the GAO, during FY 2009, the U.S. government incurred approximately $683 billion in expenses for the Department of Defense (DoD) and $54 billion for Homeland Security, a total of $737 billion. The GAO financial statements present data on an accrual basis, meaning as expenses are incurred rather than actual cash outlays. This means that the true cost of the war may be even higher than what is reported in the budget.

In addition to the direct costs of the war, there are also indirect costs that are not always accounted for in the budget. These include the cost of caring for veterans, the cost of rebuilding and stabilizing Iraq, and the cost of dealing with the aftermath of the war, such as the ongoing threat of terrorism. These costs are difficult to quantify and can have a significant impact on the U.S. budget.

In conclusion, the war in Iraq has had a significant financial burden on the United States' national security budget. The direct and indirect costs of the war have contributed to the growing national debt and have had a significant impact on the U.S. economy. The war has also played a major role in the increasing defense spending in the U.S. budget, and the true cost of the war may be even higher than what is reported in the budget. It is important for policymakers to consider the long-term economic consequences of the war when making decisions about future military operations.

The war has led to a decrease in consumer spending, an increase in unemployment, and a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar.

The war has also had a significant impact on the U.S. stock market. The stock market has been volatile since the start of the war, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping over 1,000 points in the first week of the invasion. The war has also led to a decrease in foreign investment in the U.S., as investors become more cautious about investing in a country engaged in a costly and unpopular war.

The war has also had a significant impact on the U.S. housing market. The war has led to an increase in interest rates, making it more difficult for Americans to afford homes. This has led to a decrease in home sales and a decline in housing prices.

#### 5.2c Strategies for Financial Management

In order to address the financial burden of the war in Iraq, the U.S. government has implemented various strategies for financial management. These strategies include increasing taxes, cutting government spending, and borrowing money.

The U.S. government has increased taxes in order to generate more revenue to fund the war. This has led to an increase in the federal income tax rate and the implementation of new taxes, such as the 10% surcharge on personal income taxes.

The U.S. government has also cut government spending in order to reduce the deficit. This has led to a decrease in funding for various government programs, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure.

The U.S. government has also borrowed money in order to fund the war. This has led to an increase in the national debt, which is currently over $22 trillion. The U.S. government has also implemented various financial management strategies, such as budgeting and accounting, in order to better track and manage its finances.

In conclusion, the war in Iraq has had a significant financial burden on the United States' national security budget.

### Subsection: 6.1a Homeland Security Budget Analysis

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a critical component of the United States' national security apparatus. It is responsible for protecting the nation from terrorist threats, natural disasters, and other emergencies. The DHS's budget is a significant portion of the federal government's overall budget, and it is subject to rigorous scrutiny and analysis.

#### The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2014

The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2014, was a key piece of legislation that set the funding levels for the DHS for the fiscal year 2014. This act was passed by the United States Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama on December 16, 2013.

The act provided a total of $39.1 billion in discretionary funding for the DHS, an increase of $1.3 billion over the previous year's funding level. This increase was largely due to the growing threats posed by terrorism and other national security concerns.

#### Fiscal Year 2018 Budget Oversight

In June 2017, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly testified before the House Committee on Homeland Security regarding the DHS's piece of President Trump's Fiscal Year 2018 Budget. During the hearing, members of the committee from both parties expressed opposition to the Trump administration's proposed budget that would cut funding for training and deployment for local security programs by as much as 30 percent next year.

The president's budget for 2018 would also increase overall funding for the department by almost seven percent. However, these increases were largely offset by the proposed cuts to local security programs.

#### Critical Infrastructure Research and Development Advancement Act of 2013

The Critical Infrastructure Research and Development Advancement Act of 2013, also known as the CIRDA Act, was another key piece of legislation that impacted the DHS's budget. This act was passed by the United States Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama on October 29, 2013.

The CIRDA Act required the DHS to establish a research and development program to protect critical infrastructure from cyber and physical threats. This program was funded at a level of $100 million per year for five years, starting in fiscal year 2014.

#### Congressional Budget Office Report

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that implementing the CIRDA Act would have discretionary costs totaling less than $500,000 in each of fiscal years 2014 and 2015. Enacting the legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.

The CBO's report also noted that the DHS would be required to submit a plan to Congress outlining the research and development activities to be conducted under the program. This plan would need to be approved by Congress before the DHS could begin implementing the program.

#### Conclusion

The Department of Homeland Security's budget is a complex and ever-evolving entity. It is subject to numerous pieces of legislation and is constantly under scrutiny and analysis. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2014, and the Critical Infrastructure Research and Development Advancement Act of 2013 are just two examples of the many laws that impact the DHS's budget. The Congressional Budget Office's report on the CIRDA Act provides valuable insights into the costs and implications of this legislation. As the DHS continues to evolve and face new challenges, so too will its budget and the laws that govern it.




### Subsection: 6.1b Budget Priorities for Homeland Security

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) faces a complex and ever-evolving set of challenges in its mission to protect the nation from terrorist threats, natural disasters, and other emergencies. These challenges necessitate a comprehensive and strategic approach to budget planning and allocation. In this section, we will explore the key budget priorities for the DHS, as outlined in the Critical Infrastructure Research and Development Advancement Act of 2013 (CIRDA Act) and the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2014.

#### Critical Infrastructure Research and Development Advancement Act of 2013

The CIRDA Act, passed by the United States Congress in 2013, provides a framework for the DHS to prioritize its research and development efforts. The act mandates that the DHS conduct research and development activities that are directly related to the protection of critical infrastructure. This includes infrastructure that is vital to the nation's security, economy, and public health, such as energy, transportation, and communication systems.

The CIRDA Act also establishes the Critical Infrastructure Research and Development Advisory Committee, a group of experts from various fields who advise the DHS on its research and development efforts. This committee plays a crucial role in helping the DHS prioritize its budget allocation for research and development.

#### Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2014

The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2014, provides the funding necessary for the DHS to carry out its mission. This act sets the overall funding level for the DHS and allocates funds to specific programs and activities.

The act also includes provisions for the DHS to conduct risk assessments and vulnerability analyses of critical infrastructure. These assessments help the DHS identify potential threats and vulnerabilities, and prioritize its budget allocation accordingly.

#### Budget Priorities for Homeland Security

Based on the provisions of the CIRDA Act and the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2014, the DHS has established the following budget priorities:

1. Protecting critical infrastructure: The DHS prioritizes its budget allocation to protect critical infrastructure, such as energy, transportation, and communication systems, from terrorist threats and natural disasters.

2. Conducting research and development: The DHS invests in research and development activities that are directly related to the protection of critical infrastructure. This includes developing new technologies and strategies to detect and respond to threats.

3. Conducting risk assessments and vulnerability analyses: The DHS conducts risk assessments and vulnerability analyses of critical infrastructure to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities, and prioritize its budget allocation accordingly.

4. Supporting local security programs: The DHS provides funding for local security programs, such as first responder training and deployment, to enhance the nation's overall security.

By prioritizing these areas, the DHS can effectively allocate its budget to address the complex and ever-evolving challenges it faces in protecting the nation.




### Subsection: 6.1c Impact of Budget on Homeland Security

The budget of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a significant impact on the agency's ability to carry out its mission of protecting the nation from terrorist threats, natural disasters, and other emergencies. The budget not only determines the resources available to the DHS, but also shapes its priorities and strategies.

#### Budget Allocation and Priorities

The budget allocation for the DHS is a reflection of the agency's priorities. As mentioned in the previous section, the Critical Infrastructure Research and Development Advisory Committee plays a crucial role in helping the DHS prioritize its budget allocation for research and development. The committee's advice is invaluable in guiding the DHS towards the most effective use of its resources.

The budget allocation also reflects the DHS's priorities in terms of its operational activities. For instance, the DHS's budget for 2018 proposed by President Trump includes a significant increase in funding for border security, reflecting the administration's priority of controlling illegal immigration. However, this increase was met with opposition from both parties in Congress, who expressed concerns about the impact of the cuts on local security programs.

#### Impact on Homeland Security Operations

The budget of the DHS directly impacts its operations. The agency's ability to carry out its mission is largely dependent on the resources it has at its disposal. For instance, the DHS's budget for 2018 proposed by President Trump includes a significant increase in funding for border security, reflecting the administration's priority of controlling illegal immigration. However, this increase was met with opposition from both parties in Congress, who expressed concerns about the impact of the cuts on local security programs.

The budget also impacts the DHS's ability to respond to emergencies. For instance, the agency's budget for disaster relief and recovery is crucial in its ability to respond to natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires. Any shortfall in this budget can hinder the DHS's ability to provide timely and effective assistance to affected communities.

#### Future Trends in Homeland Security Budgeting

The future of homeland security budgeting is likely to be shaped by several factors, including the evolving nature of terrorist threats, advancements in technology, and changes in government priorities. As the nature of terrorist threats continues to evolve, the DHS will need to adapt its budget allocation to effectively counter these threats. Advancements in technology, such as artificial intelligence and big data analytics, could also impact the DHS's budget allocation, as these technologies could potentially enhance the agency's capabilities.

Changes in government priorities could also have a significant impact on the DHS's budget. For instance, if the government prioritizes cybersecurity, the DHS's budget allocation could shift towards this area. Similarly, if the government prioritizes immigration reform, the DHS's budget allocation could shift towards this area as well.

In conclusion, the budget of the Department of Homeland Security plays a crucial role in shaping the agency's ability to carry out its mission. It determines the agency's priorities, operational activities, and ability to respond to emergencies. As the nature of terrorist threats, technology, and government priorities continue to evolve, the DHS's budget will need to adapt to effectively carry out its mission.

### Subsection: 6.2a Evaluation of Homeland Security Investments

The evaluation of homeland security investments is a critical aspect of the budget process. It involves assessing the effectiveness of the investments made in terms of achieving the agency's objectives. This evaluation is crucial in ensuring that the resources are being used efficiently and effectively.

#### Methods of Evaluation

There are several methods used to evaluate homeland security investments. These include cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, and performance measurement.

Cost-benefit analysis is a method used to evaluate the effectiveness of an investment by comparing the costs incurred with the benefits derived. This method takes into account all the costs associated with the investment, including the initial cost, maintenance costs, and any other costs that may arise during the lifetime of the investment. The benefits are also quantified and compared with the costs. If the benefits outweigh the costs, the investment is considered to be cost-effective.

Cost-effectiveness analysis, on the other hand, focuses on the relationship between the costs and the outcomes of an investment. This method does not require the benefits to be quantified. Instead, it focuses on whether the costs are reasonable given the outcomes achieved.

Performance measurement is a method used to evaluate the effectiveness of an investment by measuring its performance against pre-determined performance standards. This method involves setting clear and measurable performance standards for the investment and then measuring its performance against these standards.

#### Challenges in Evaluating Homeland Security Investments

Evaluating homeland security investments is not without its challenges. One of the main challenges is the difficulty in quantifying the benefits of some investments. For instance, the benefits of investments in research and development may not be easily quantifiable. This makes it difficult to conduct a cost-benefit analysis.

Another challenge is the difficulty in establishing clear and measurable performance standards for some investments. For instance, the performance of investments in intelligence gathering may be difficult to measure due to the nature of the information gathered.

Despite these challenges, it is important to conduct a thorough evaluation of homeland security investments. This ensures that the resources are being used efficiently and effectively to achieve the agency's objectives.

#### Conclusion

The evaluation of homeland security investments is a critical aspect of the budget process. It involves assessing the effectiveness of the investments made in terms of achieving the agency's objectives. While there are challenges in conducting this evaluation, it is crucial in ensuring that the resources are being used efficiently and effectively.

One of the main challenges is the difficulty in quantifying the benefits of some investments. For instance, the benefits of investments in research and development may not be easily quantifiable. This makes it difficult to conduct a cost-benefit analysis.

Another challenge is the difficulty in determining the appropriate performance standards for some investments. For instance, the performance of an investment in border security may be difficult to measure, as there is no clear benchmark for what constitutes an acceptable level of security.

Finally, there is the challenge of attribution. In many cases, it is difficult to determine whether a particular investment has been effective in achieving its intended objectives. This is because there are often multiple factors at play, and it can be difficult to isolate the impact of a single investment.

Despite these challenges, it is crucial to continue to develop and refine methods for measuring the effectiveness of homeland security investments. This will help to ensure that resources are being allocated in a way that maximizes the protection of the nation's security.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the assessment of the effectiveness of homeland security investments is a critical aspect of the U.S. budget process. It is essential to ensure that the resources allocated to homeland security are being used efficiently and effectively. The methods used to assess effectiveness, such as cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, and performance measurement, provide a systematic approach to evaluating the impact of these investments. However, it is also important to note that these methods have their limitations and may not capture the full complexity of homeland security operations. Therefore, it is crucial to continuously review and refine these methods to ensure that they remain relevant and effective in assessing the effectiveness of homeland security investments.

However, there are still concerns about the adequacy of the military aid budget. The U.S. government faces significant fiscal challenges, including a growing national debt and competing budgetary priorities. This has led to calls for a more comprehensive review of the military aid budget, to ensure that it is adequately resourced to meet the U.S. government's military aid objectives.

In addition to these budgetary concerns, there have been significant changes in the geographic distribution of U.S. military aid. For instance, the share of U.S. military aid going to the Middle East has increased significantly in recent years, reflecting the growing importance of this region in U.S. foreign policy.

The budget for military aid also includes funding for the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), a U.S. government agency that manages the FMS program. The DSCA budget has increased in recent years, reflecting the growing importance of the FMS program in U.S. military aid strategy.

In conclusion, the budget for military aid is a critical component of the U.S. federal budget. It is through this budget that the U.S. government allocates resources to support military operations, training, and equipment in foreign countries. Despite the challenges it faces, the budget for military aid has shown some positive trends, reflecting the growing importance of military aid in U.S. national security strategy.

### Section: 7.1 Budget Priorities for Diplomacy:

#### 7.1b Budget Priorities for Diplomacy

The budget for diplomacy is a critical component of the U.S. federal budget. It is through this budget that the U.S. government allocates resources to maintain and enhance its global standing and influence. The budget for diplomacy is not a static entity but rather a dynamic one, influenced by a variety of factors including global events, policy changes, and budgetary constraints.

The budget for diplomacy is managed by the Department of State, which is responsible for conducting the foreign affairs of the United States. The Department of State's budget includes funding for a variety of activities, including diplomatic missions, international aid, and global security initiatives.

The budget for diplomacy is also influenced by the National Security Strategy, a document that outlines the U.S. government's approach to national security. The National Security Strategy identifies key priorities for diplomacy, including promoting U.S. economic interests, protecting U.S. citizens abroad, and preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction.

The budget for diplomacy is also influenced by the U.S. government's fiscal situation. The U.S. government operates under a system of annual appropriations, meaning that it must pass a new budget each year. This can lead to fluctuations in the diplomacy budget, as changes in the overall budget can impact the allocation of resources to diplomacy.

In recent years, the budget for diplomacy has faced significant challenges. The U.S. government has been operating under a series of continuing resolutions, which have maintained funding at previous levels. This has led to concerns about the ability of the U.S. government to effectively carry out its diplomatic missions.

Despite these challenges, the budget for diplomacy remains a critical tool for advancing U.S. national security interests. By understanding the dynamics of the diplomacy budget, we can better understand the priorities and challenges faced by the U.S. government in its diplomatic efforts.

#### 7.1c Case Studies of Diplomacy Budgets

To further illustrate the importance and complexity of diplomacy budgets, let's examine two case studies: the United States' diplomacy budget in 2015 and the budget for the United Nations Mission in Sudan.

In fiscal year 2015, the U.S. government allocated approximately $161 million to the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs (PM), which is responsible for managing a significant portion of the U.S. diplomacy budget. This budget included funding for diplomatic missions, international aid, and global security initiatives.

The PM's total foreign assistance funding for fiscal year 2015 was approximately $7 billion. This funding was allocated to a variety of programs and initiatives, including support for democracy and human rights, economic development, and counterterrorism efforts.

The budget for the United Nations Mission in Sudan provides another example of the complexity and importance of diplomacy budgets. The mission's budget for the one-year period between July 1, 2006, and June 30, 2007, was approved by the United Nations Security Council and was funded through a combination of assessed contributions from member states and voluntary contributions.

The budget for the United Nations Mission in Sudan was approximately $1,079,530,000. This budget was used to support the mission's peacekeeping operations, which included monitoring and verifying the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, as well as providing support for humanitarian and development activities.

These case studies highlight the complexity and importance of diplomacy budgets. They also underscore the need for careful management and allocation of resources to ensure the effective execution of U.S. diplomatic missions.




### Subsection: 7.1c Impact of Budget on Diplomacy

The budget for diplomacy plays a crucial role in shaping the U.S. government's ability to conduct its foreign affairs. The budget not only determines the resources available for diplomatic missions but also influences the strategic priorities and objectives of the U.S. government.

#### 7.1c.1 Resource Allocation

The budget for diplomacy is a significant portion of the overall U.S. federal budget. It is used to fund a variety of diplomatic activities, including diplomatic missions, international aid, and global security initiatives. The allocation of resources within the diplomacy budget can have a profound impact on the U.S. government's ability to achieve its diplomatic objectives.

### Subsection: 7.2a Foreign Aid Budget Analysis

The budget for foreign aid is a critical component of the U.S. government's diplomacy budget. It is used to support a variety of initiatives aimed at promoting stability, security, and economic development in other countries. The allocation of resources within the foreign aid budget can have a profound impact on the U.S. government's ability to achieve its diplomatic objectives.

#### 7.2a.1 Resource Allocation

The budget for foreign aid is a significant portion of the overall U.S. federal budget. It is used to fund a variety of initiatives, including humanitarian assistance, economic development, and military aid. The allocation of resources within the foreign aid budget can have a profound impact on the U.S. government's ability to achieve its diplomatic objectives.

For instance, a larger budget for humanitarian assistance can enable the U.S. government to respond more effectively to crises such as natural disasters or conflicts, enhancing its ability to save lives and reduce suffering. Conversely, a smaller budget can limit the U.S. government's ability to provide humanitarian assistance, potentially exacerbating crises and damaging its reputation.

#### 7.2a.2 Strategic Priorities

The budget for foreign aid also influences the strategic priorities and objectives of the U.S. government. The National Security Strategy, which outlines the U.S. government's approach to national security, is a key document that guides the allocation of resources within the foreign aid budget.

The National Security Strategy identifies key priorities for foreign aid, including promoting economic development, countering terrorism, and addressing global health issues. The budget for foreign aid is then allocated in a way that supports these priorities. For example, a larger budget for economic development can reflect a strategic priority of promoting U.S. economic interests, while a larger budget for counterterrorism efforts can reflect a priority of protecting U.S. national security.

#### 7.2a.3 Fiscal Situation

The U.S. government's fiscal situation can also impact the allocation of resources within the foreign aid budget. As noted in the related context, the U.S. government has been running large budget deficits in recent years, which can limit its ability to increase spending on foreign aid. This can be particularly challenging given the growing demand for humanitarian assistance and other forms of foreign aid in the face of global crises such as the Syrian civil war and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

In addition, the U.S. government's fiscal situation can also influence its ability to provide long-term development assistance, which is often more costly than humanitarian assistance. This can limit the U.S. government's ability to address the root causes of global problems and promote sustainable development.

### Subsection: 7.2b Impact of Foreign Aid on National Security

Foreign aid, particularly in the form of military aid, plays a crucial role in enhancing U.S. national security. The provision of military aid can strengthen alliances, deter potential adversaries, and contribute to regional stability. However, the effectiveness of foreign aid in achieving these objectives can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the recipient country's political stability, economic development, and military capabilities.

#### 7.2b.1 Alliances and Deterrence

Military aid can serve to strengthen alliances with friendly countries, thereby enhancing U.S. national security. For instance, the U.S. has long been a major supplier of military aid to Israel, a key ally in the Middle East. This aid has helped to ensure Israel's military superiority, thereby deterring potential adversaries and enhancing regional stability.

However, the effectiveness of military aid as a tool for alliance building and deterrence can be influenced by a variety of factors. For instance, the recipient country's political stability can impact its ability to effectively use military aid. Similarly, the recipient country's economic development and military capabilities can influence its need for and ability to use military aid.

#### 7.2b.2 Regional Stability

Military aid can also contribute to regional stability by helping to prevent the spread of instability and conflict. For instance, the U.S. has provided military aid to various countries in Africa as part of its efforts to combat terrorism and promote regional stability. This aid has helped to build the military capabilities of these countries, thereby enhancing their ability to address internal and external threats.

However, the effectiveness of military aid in promoting regional stability can be influenced by a variety of factors. For instance, the recipient country's political stability and economic development can impact its ability to effectively use military aid. Similarly, the regional context can influence the effectiveness of military aid in promoting stability. For instance, the provision of military aid to a country in a region characterized by ongoing conflicts and instability may not be as effective in promoting stability as it would be in a more stable region.

#### 7.2b.3 Fiscal Situation

The U.S. government's fiscal situation can also impact the effectiveness of foreign aid in enhancing national security. As noted in the related context, the U.S. government has been running large budget deficits in recent years, which can limit its ability to increase spending on foreign aid. This can be particularly challenging given the growing demand for military aid in the face of ongoing global conflicts and instability.

In addition, the U.S. government's fiscal situation can also influence the effectiveness of military aid in enhancing national security. For instance, the provision of military aid can be more effective in enhancing national security when the U.S. government has a strong fiscal position, as this can enable it to provide more generous and sustained aid. Conversely, a weak fiscal position can limit the U.S. government's ability to provide adequate military aid, thereby reducing its effectiveness in enhancing national security.

In 2011, the U.S. allocated $11.5 billion for military aid to Afghanistan, representing a significant portion of the total U.S. foreign aid budget. This aid was used to train and equip the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), with the goal of building their capacity to provide security and stability in the country.

However, the effectiveness of this aid in enhancing U.S. national security has been influenced by a variety of factors. For instance, the political stability and economic development of Afghanistan have impacted the ANSF's ability to effectively use the provided aid. Similarly, the ongoing conflicts and instability in the country have challenged the U.S. military strategy and the effectiveness of the aid in promoting regional stability.

#### 7.2c.2 U.S. Foreign Aid Budget for Israel

The U.S. has been a major supplier of military aid to Israel since the 1960s. This aid has been a key component of the U.S.-Israel alliance and has contributed to Israel's military superiority in the region.

In 2011, the U.S. allocated $3 billion for military aid to Israel, representing a significant portion of the total U.S. foreign aid budget. This aid has helped to maintain Israel's qualitative military edge, thereby deterring potential adversaries and enhancing regional stability.

However, the effectiveness of this aid in enhancing U.S. national security has been influenced by a variety of factors. For instance, the political stability and economic development of Israel have impacted its ability to effectively use the provided aid. Similarly, the regional context, characterized by ongoing conflicts and instability, has challenged the effectiveness of the aid in promoting regional stability.

These case studies highlight the complex interplay between foreign aid budgets and national security. They underscore the importance of considering a variety of factors, including the recipient country's political stability, economic development, and regional context, when analyzing the effectiveness of foreign aid in enhancing national security.

### Conclusion

Foreign aid plays a crucial role in U.S. national security. It is a tool that can be used to achieve strategic objectives, promote stability, and enhance the U.S.'s reputation and influence in the international community. However, the impact of foreign aid on national security is not always straightforward.

#### 7.2b.1 Stability and Security

Foreign aid can contribute to stability and security in several ways. For instance, humanitarian assistance can help to alleviate crises and reduce the risk of instability. Economic development assistance can promote economic growth and reduce poverty, which can contribute to stability. Military aid can enhance the capabilities of U.S. allies and partners, which can contribute to security.

However, foreign aid can also have unintended consequences that can undermine stability and security. For example, unconditionally and unenforced aid can cause systemic corruption and rent-seeking behavior, which can undermine economic growth and contribute to instability. Similarly, large inflows of aid can increase inflation, which can undermine economic stability.

#### 7.2b.2 Reputation and Influence

Foreign aid can also impact the U.S.'s reputation and influence in the international community. Providing humanitarian assistance can enhance the U.S.'s reputation as a global leader and promote goodwill. Similarly, economic development assistance can enhance the U.S.'s reputation as a responsible global power.

However, the impact of foreign aid on the U.S.'s reputation and influence can be complex and multifaceted. For instance, the U.S.'s decision to provide military aid to certain countries can be seen as hypocritical, particularly if the U.S. is also criticizing those countries for human rights abuses. Similarly, the U.S.'s decision to withhold aid can be seen as punitive and can damage its reputation.

#### 7.2b.3 Strategic Priorities

The allocation of resources within the foreign aid budget can also impact the U.S.'s strategic priorities and objectives. For instance, a larger budget for counterterrorism efforts can reflect a strategic priority of promoting U.S. national security. However, if this comes at the expense of other priorities, such as economic development or humanitarian assistance, it can undermine the U.S.'s ability to achieve its broader strategic objectives.

### Section: 8.1 Analyzing Alternative Plans and Their Policy Implications:

#### 8.1a Analysis of Alternative National Security Plans

The analysis of alternative national security plans is a critical aspect of the decision-making process. It allows for a comprehensive evaluation of different strategies and policies, providing a platform for informed decision-making. This section will explore the various alternative national security plans that have been presented, their key features, and the factors that influence their development and presentation.

One of the most significant alternative plans to the Obama Administration's deficit reduction plan and the "Defense Strategic Guidance" document is the "Lean Product Development" approach. This approach, which has been widely adopted in the private sector, emphasizes the need for efficiency and cost-effectiveness in the development and implementation of national security plans. It advocates for a streamlined and data-driven approach, where decisions are based on empirical evidence and performance metrics.

The Lean Product Development approach aligns with the Obama Administration's emphasis on evidence-based decision-making and the use of data to inform policy. It also aligns with the Administration's focus on efficiency and cost-effectiveness, particularly in the context of the defense budget. By applying Lean principles to the development and implementation of national security plans, the Administration can ensure that resources are used effectively and efficiently, and that plans are continuously improved based on data and performance metrics.

However, the Lean Product Development approach also faces criticism. Some argue that it may lead to a narrow focus on efficiency and cost-effectiveness, potentially at the expense of other important considerations such as strategic objectives and long-term planning. Others argue that it may not be applicable to the complex and often unpredictable nature of national security, where decisions must be made in the face of uncertainty and incomplete information.

Despite these criticisms, the Lean Product Development approach offers a valuable perspective on the development and implementation of national security plans. It emphasizes the importance of efficiency and cost-effectiveness, and provides a framework for making decisions based on empirical evidence and performance metrics. As such, it is an important alternative plan to consider in the analysis of national security policies.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the budgetary considerations that accompany the presentation of alternative national security plans, providing a comprehensive analysis of the financial aspects of these plans.

#### 8.1b Policy Implications of Alternative Plans

The policy implications of alternative national security plans are far-reaching and complex. They not only impact the allocation of resources and the implementation of strategies, but also have significant implications for the overall direction of U.S. national security policy.

The Lean Product Development approach, for instance, has important policy implications. By emphasizing efficiency and cost-effectiveness, it aligns with the Obama Administration's focus on fiscal responsibility and deficit reduction. However, it also raises questions about the trade-offs between efficiency and other important considerations, such as strategic objectives and long-term planning.

The Lean Product Development approach also has implications for the role of data and performance metrics in decision-making. By prioritizing empirical evidence and performance metrics, it aligns with the Administration's emphasis on evidence-based decision-making. However, it also raises questions about the potential for a narrow focus on efficiency, which could lead to a neglect of other important considerations.

Moreover, the Lean Product Development approach has implications for the role of the defense budget. By advocating for a streamlined and data-driven approach, it aligns with the Administration's focus on efficiency and cost-effectiveness in the defense budget. However, it also raises questions about the potential for a reduction in the defense budget, which could have significant implications for U.S. military capabilities and readiness.

In conclusion, the analysis of alternative national security plans is crucial for understanding the policy implications of these plans. It allows for a comprehensive evaluation of different strategies and policies, providing a platform for informed decision-making. The Lean Product Development approach, for instance, offers a valuable perspective on the development and implementation of national security plans, but also raises important questions about the trade-offs between efficiency and other important considerations.

This approach has been particularly useful in the development of new technologies and systems, where the Army has been able to streamline the development process and reduce costs.

However, the application of Lean Product Development in national security also raises important policy considerations. For instance, the Army's implementation of Lean Product Development has been criticized for potentially neglecting strategic objectives and long-term planning. This is because the focus on efficiency and cost-effectiveness can lead to a narrow focus on the immediate task at hand, potentially at the expense of broader strategic considerations.

##### Case Study 2: The Role of Data and Performance Metrics in National Security

The role of data and performance metrics in decision-making is another important policy consideration. For instance, the U.S. intelligence agencies have been criticized for their reliance on data and performance metrics in the lead-up to the Iraq War. This reliance on data and metrics was used to justify the invasion, but was later found to be based on flawed intelligence.

This case study highlights the importance of a balanced approach to decision-making, where data and performance metrics are used in conjunction with other considerations. It also underscores the need for a critical evaluation of the data and metrics used in decision-making, to ensure their accuracy and relevance.

##### Case Study 3: The Impact of Alternative Plans on the Defense Budget

The impact of alternative plans on the defense budget is a critical policy consideration. For instance, the U.S. Navy's "Force Structure Assessment" (FSA) has been criticized for its potential impact on the Navy's budget. The FSA, which was developed in response to the "Quadrennial Defense Review" (QDR), has been accused of overstating the Navy's needs and thereby justifying an increase in the Navy's budget.

This case study highlights the importance of a transparent and rigorous process for developing alternative plans, to ensure that these plans are based on sound assumptions and projections. It also underscores the need for a careful evaluation of the budgetary implications of alternative plans, to ensure that these plans are affordable and sustainable.

In conclusion, these case studies illustrate the complex and multifaceted nature of alternative national security plans. They highlight the importance of a balanced and rigorous approach to decision-making, to ensure that these plans are effective, efficient, and sustainable.

## Chapter: Chapter 9: The Role of Congress in National Security Budgeting

### Introduction

The role of Congress in national security budgeting is a critical aspect of the U.S. budget process. This chapter will delve into the intricacies of this role, exploring how Congress exercises its oversight and decision-making powers in the allocation of resources for national security. 

The U.S. Constitution vests the power of the purse in Congress, and this power extends to national security budgeting. The President, as Commander-in-Chief, is responsible for the execution of the budget, but Congress has the authority to appropriate funds and oversee their use. This dynamic creates a complex interplay between the executive and legislative branches, with each playing a crucial role in the budgeting process.

In this chapter, we will explore the various ways in which Congress exercises its role in national security budgeting. We will examine the processes and procedures through which Congress approves, modifies, and rejects budget proposals. We will also discuss the role of Congressional committees and subcommittees in the budget process, and how they contribute to the overall budget picture.

Furthermore, we will delve into the political dynamics that shape national security budgeting. We will examine how partisan politics, ideological differences, and electoral considerations influence budget decisions. We will also discuss the role of public opinion and media in shaping budget debates and outcomes.

Finally, we will analyze the impact of Congress's role in national security budgeting on the overall budget process. We will discuss the challenges and opportunities that Congress's role presents, and how these can influence the effectiveness and efficiency of the budget process.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the role of Congress in national security budgeting, shedding light on the complex dynamics that shape the allocation of resources for national security in the U.S.




### Subsection: 8.1b Policy Implications of Alternative Plans

The policy implications of alternative national security plans are far-reaching and complex. Each plan presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities, and their implementation can have significant impacts on various aspects of national security. In this section, we will explore the policy implications of some of the alternative plans that have been presented.

#### 8.1b.1 Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)

The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is a complex and controversial aspect of the U.S. tax code. It was introduced in 1969 as a way to ensure that high-income individuals and corporations paid a minimum amount of tax, regardless of the deductions and exemptions they claimed. However, over time, the AMT has become increasingly complex and has affected an increasing number of taxpayers.

One of the key policy implications of the AMT is its impact on the budget. The AMT was originally intended to raise a certain amount of revenue, but due to its complexity and the need for frequent adjustments, it has often failed to meet this target. This has led to debates about its effectiveness and the need for reform.

#### 8.1b.2 AMT Reform

There have been various proposals for reforming the AMT. One such proposal, put forth by Len Burman and Greg Leiserson of The Tax Policy Center, suggests a revenue-neutral, highly progressive replacement for the AMT. This plan would replace the AMT with an "add-on tax" of 4% of adjusted gross income above certain thresholds. This plan aims to address the criticisms of the AMT while maintaining its original goal of ensuring a certain level of taxation for high earners.

However, there are also arguments against repealing the AMT. Some argue that the AMT needs to be changed, but that its outright repeal is not the best solution. The Cato Institute, for example, suggests that the AMT could be effectively repealed by correcting the deficiencies in the regular tax code. This approach aligns with the Lean Product Development approach, which emphasizes the need for efficiency and cost-effectiveness in the development and implementation of national security plans.

#### 8.1b.3 Policy Implications of AMT Reform

The policy implications of AMT reform are significant. If the AMT is reformed or repealed, it could have a significant impact on the budget and the tax code. It could also affect the way national security plans are developed and implemented. For example, if the AMT is reformed or repealed, it could free up resources that could be used for other aspects of national security. It could also lead to changes in the way tax incentives are used in national security plans, potentially aligning with the Lean Product Development approach.

In conclusion, the policy implications of alternative national security plans are complex and far-reaching. Each plan presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities, and their implementation can have significant impacts on various aspects of national security. The AMT is just one example of an alternative plan that has significant policy implications for the U.S. budget and national security.

### Subsection: 8.1c Evaluation of Alternative Plans

The evaluation of alternative national security plans is a crucial step in the decision-making process. It allows policymakers to compare and contrast different plans, and to make informed decisions about which plan best meets the nation's security needs. In this section, we will discuss the key factors that should be considered when evaluating alternative plans.

#### 8.1c.1 Cost

The cost of a plan is a significant factor to consider. The U.S. government has a limited budget, and it is important to ensure that resources are allocated efficiently. Therefore, plans should be evaluated based on their cost-effectiveness. This involves considering not only the initial cost of implementing the plan, but also the ongoing costs and potential savings that may result from the plan.

#### 8.1c.2 Feasibility

The feasibility of a plan refers to its practicality and the likelihood of its successful implementation. This includes considering the resources and capabilities required to implement the plan, as well as any potential obstacles that may arise. For example, the implementation of the AMT has been hindered by its complexity and the need for frequent adjustments. Therefore, it is important to consider the feasibility of a plan when evaluating its effectiveness.

#### 8.1c.3 Impact on Other Policies

When evaluating alternative plans, it is important to consider their potential impact on other policies. For example, the AMT has been criticized for its impact on other tax policies, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit. Therefore, it is important to consider the potential ripple effects of a plan on other policies and to ensure that these effects are carefully considered and addressed.

#### 8.1c.4 Policy Implications

The policy implications of a plan refer to its potential impact on various aspects of national security. This includes considering the plan's potential effects on the budget, as well as its potential impact on other policies and programs. For example, the AMT has had significant implications for the U.S. tax code and has led to debates about its effectiveness and the need for reform. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the policy implications of a plan when evaluating its effectiveness.

#### 8.1c.5 Public Acceptance

Finally, it is important to consider public acceptance when evaluating alternative plans. Public acceptance refers to the level of support and acceptance of a plan by the general public. This can be influenced by various factors, such as the plan's cost, feasibility, and potential impact on other policies. Therefore, it is important to consider public acceptance when evaluating the effectiveness of a plan.

In conclusion, the evaluation of alternative plans is a crucial step in the decision-making process. It allows policymakers to compare and contrast different plans, and to make informed decisions about which plan best meets the nation's security needs. By considering factors such as cost, feasibility, impact on other policies, and public acceptance, policymakers can make informed decisions about which plan is most effective for the nation's security.

### Section: 8.2 Comparisons of Different Approaches to National Security:

In this section, we will delve into the various approaches to national security and compare them to understand their strengths and weaknesses. The U.S. has a long history of national security planning, and over the years, different approaches have been adopted to address the changing nature of security threats. These approaches can be broadly categorized into two main schools of thought: the traditional approach and the alternative approach.

#### 8.2a Comparison of National Security Approaches

The traditional approach to national security is rooted in the concept of state sovereignty and the use of military power to protect national interests. This approach is often associated with the Cold War era, when the U.S. and the Soviet Union were engaged in a global power struggle. The traditional approach emphasizes the use of military force to deter and defeat adversaries, and it is often criticized for its reliance on violence and its potential to escalate conflicts.

On the other hand, the alternative approach to national security is more focused on non-military means of addressing security threats. This approach emphasizes the use of diplomacy, economic tools, and international cooperation to prevent and manage conflicts. It is often associated with the post-Cold War era, when the nature of security threats changed from traditional state-on-state conflicts to non-state actors and transnational threats.

The alternative approach is often criticized for its perceived weakness and lack of effectiveness in dealing with serious security threats. However, it is also seen as a more sustainable and cost-effective approach, as it does not rely on the use of military force.

#### 8.2b Comparison of National Security Approaches

To better understand the differences between these two approaches, let's compare them in terms of their key principles, strategies, and outcomes.

##### Principles

The traditional approach is based on the principle of state sovereignty, which emphasizes the right of states to govern themselves without interference from external powers. This principle is often used to justify the use of military force to protect national interests.

The alternative approach, on the other hand, is based on the principle of international cooperation, which emphasizes the need for states to work together to address common security threats. This principle is often used to justify the use of non-military means, such as diplomacy and economic tools, to manage conflicts.

##### Strategies

The traditional approach to national security relies heavily on military strategies, such as deterrence and containment, to protect national interests. These strategies involve the use of military force to deter potential adversaries and contain their actions.

The alternative approach, on the other hand, relies on non-military strategies, such as diplomacy and economic tools, to address security threats. These strategies involve the use of diplomatic efforts to prevent conflicts and economic tools to manage them.

##### Outcomes

The traditional approach has been criticized for its reliance on military force, which can lead to escalation of conflicts and unintended consequences. It has also been criticized for its lack of effectiveness in dealing with non-state actors and transnational threats.

The alternative approach, on the other hand, has been criticized for its perceived weakness and lack of effectiveness in dealing with serious security threats. However, it has also been seen as a more sustainable and cost-effective approach, as it does not rely on the use of military force.

In conclusion, the comparison of these two approaches to national security highlights their strengths and weaknesses, and underscores the need for a comprehensive and balanced approach to address the changing nature of security threats. The U.S. must continue to adapt and evolve its national security strategies to effectively protect its interests in the ever-changing global landscape.

#### 8.2c Case Studies of Alternative Approaches

To further illustrate the differences between the traditional and alternative approaches to national security, let's examine some case studies. These case studies will provide real-world examples of how these approaches have been applied and their outcomes.

##### Case Study 1: The Traditional Approach - The Cold War

During the Cold War, the U.S. and the Soviet Union engaged in a global power struggle, with each side using military force to protect its national interests. The traditional approach was heavily relied upon, with both sides building up their military capabilities and engaging in proxy wars in various parts of the world.

The U.S. used its military power to contain Soviet influence and protect its allies, often through direct military intervention. This approach was criticized for its reliance on violence and its potential to escalate conflicts. For example, the U.S. intervention in Vietnam resulted in a prolonged and costly war, with significant human and economic costs.

##### Case Study 2: The Alternative Approach - The War on Terror

After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the U.S. shifted its focus to addressing non-state actors and transnational threats. This marked a shift towards the alternative approach, which emphasizes the use of non-military means to address security threats.

The U.S. has used diplomatic efforts to prevent conflicts and economic tools to manage them. For example, the U.S. has engaged in diplomatic efforts to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and has used economic sanctions to pressure countries like Iran and North Korea.

However, the alternative approach has also faced criticism for its perceived weakness and lack of effectiveness. For example, the U.S. has faced challenges in addressing the root causes of terrorism and has faced criticism for its use of drone strikes, which have resulted in civilian casualties.

##### Conclusion

These case studies highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the traditional and alternative approaches to national security. The traditional approach, while effective in certain situations, can lead to escalation of conflicts and unintended consequences. The alternative approach, while more sustainable and cost-effective, has faced criticism for its perceived weakness and lack of effectiveness. The U.S. must continue to adapt and evolve its national security strategies to effectively address the changing nature of security threats.

### Section: 8.2 Comparisons of Different Approaches to National Security:

In this section, we will delve into the various approaches to national security and compare them to understand their strengths and weaknesses. The U.S. has a long history of national security planning, and over the years, different approaches have been adopted to address the changing nature of security threats. These approaches can be broadly categorized into two main schools of thought: the traditional approach and the alternative approach.

#### 8.2a Comparison of National Security Approaches

The traditional approach to national security is rooted in the concept of state sovereignty and the use of military power to protect national interests. This approach is often associated with the Cold War era, when the U.S. and the Soviet Union were engaged in a global power struggle. The traditional approach emphasizes the use of military force to deter and defeat adversaries, and it is often criticized for its reliance on violence and its potential to escalate conflicts.

On the other hand, the alternative approach to national security is more focused on non-military means of addressing security threats. This approach emphasizes the use of diplomacy, economic tools, and international cooperation to prevent and manage conflicts. It is often associated with the post-Cold War era, when the nature of security threats changed from traditional state-on-state conflicts to non-state actors and transnational threats.

The alternative approach is often criticized for its perceived weakness and lack of effectiveness in dealing with serious security threats. However, it is also seen as a more sustainable and cost-effective approach, as it does not rely on the use of military force.

#### 8.2b Comparison of National Security Approaches

To better understand the differences between these two approaches, let's compare them in terms of their key principles, strategies, and outcomes.

##### Principles

The traditional approach to national security is based on the principle of state sovereignty, which emphasizes the right of a state to govern itself without interference from external powers. This principle is rooted in the Westphalian model of international relations, where states are considered equal and have the right to determine their own internal and external affairs. The traditional approach also emphasizes the use of military power as the primary means of protecting national interests and deterring adversaries.

On the other hand, the alternative approach is based on the principle of interdependence, which recognizes the interconnectedness of states and the need for cooperation and collaboration in addressing security threats. This approach emphasizes the use of non-military means, such as diplomacy, economic tools, and international cooperation, to prevent and manage conflicts. It also recognizes the role of non-state actors and transnational threats in security issues and seeks to address them through multilateral efforts.

##### Strategies

The traditional approach to national security relies heavily on military strategies, such as deterrence and containment, to protect national interests. Deterrence involves using military power to deter potential adversaries from attacking, while containment involves containing and limiting the impact of a security threat. These strategies are often criticized for their reliance on violence and their potential to escalate conflicts.

The alternative approach, on the other hand, emphasizes the use of non-military strategies, such as diplomacy, economic tools, and international cooperation, to address security threats. Diplomacy involves using diplomatic channels to resolve conflicts and prevent them from escalating. Economic tools, such as sanctions and trade agreements, can be used to incentivize or disincentivize certain behaviors. International cooperation, through organizations such as the United Nations, can help address global security threats in a coordinated and effective manner.

##### Outcomes

The traditional approach to national security has often resulted in the use of military force, which can have significant human and economic costs. It has also been criticized for its lack of effectiveness in addressing long-term security threats, such as terrorism and cyber attacks.

The alternative approach, on the other hand, has been seen as more effective in addressing long-term security threats. By using non-military means, it can help prevent conflicts from escalating and address the root causes of security threats. However, it has also been criticized for its perceived weakness and lack of immediate results.

In conclusion, the traditional and alternative approaches to national security have their own strengths and weaknesses. The traditional approach relies heavily on military power, while the alternative approach emphasizes non-military means. Both approaches have their own merits and demerits, and it is important for policymakers to carefully consider the strengths and weaknesses of each approach when making decisions about national security.





### Section: 8.2 Comparisons of Different Approaches to National Security:

## Chapter: Chapter 18: Budgeting for Defense Research and Development

### Introduction

The United States' defense budget is a complex and multifaceted entity, encompassing a wide range of expenditures from personnel salaries to military equipment and operations. One of the most critical areas of this budget is the allocation for defense research and development (R&D). This chapter, "Budgeting for Defense Research and Development," delves into the intricacies of this crucial aspect of national security spending.

Defense R&D is a vital component of the U.S. military's ability to maintain its technological superiority and adapt to evolving threats. It involves the development of new weapons systems, technologies, and strategies, as well as the improvement of existing ones. The budget for defense R&D is a reflection of the U.S. military's strategic priorities and its commitment to maintaining its edge in the ever-changing landscape of modern warfare.

In this chapter, we will explore the various factors that influence the allocation of funds for defense R&D. We will examine the processes involved in budgeting for this area, including the role of various stakeholders and the challenges they face. We will also delve into the strategic considerations that guide these budgeting decisions, such as the balance between near-term operational needs and long-term technological advancement.

Furthermore, we will analyze the trends in defense R&D budgeting over time, including the impact of major events and policy changes. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities that these trends present for the U.S. military and its defense industry partners.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a comprehensive understanding of the budgeting process for defense R&D, the factors that influence it, and the strategic considerations that guide it. This knowledge will provide a solid foundation for further exploration of the U.S. defense budget and its role in national security.




### Section: 17.2c Impact of Budget on Defense Health Care:

The budget for defense health care has a significant impact on the health care services provided to the beneficiaries of the Department of Defense. The budget allocations determine the resources available for the Defense Health Agency (DHA), the Military Health System (MHS), and the health care facilities and services provided to active-duty personnel, retirees, and their dependents.

#### 17.2c.1 Budget Allocations and Health Care Services

The budget allocations for defense health care are directly linked to the health care services provided to the beneficiaries. For instance, the budget allocations for the MHS determine the number of health care facilities that can be operated, the number of health care professionals that can be employed, and the types of health care services that can be provided.

The budget allocations also determine the quality of health care services. For example, if the budget allocations are insufficient, it may not be possible to maintain the standards of health care services, leading to delays in treatment, shortages of medical supplies, and a decline in the overall quality of health care.

#### 17.2c.2 Budget Allocations and Health Care Innovations

The budget allocations for defense health care also impact the ability of the Department of Defense to implement health care innovations. These innovations can include new technologies, new treatment methods, and new health care delivery models.

For instance, the budget allocations for the DHA determine the resources available for research and development of new technologies and treatment methods. If the budget allocations are insufficient, it may not be possible to invest in these innovations, leading to a lag in the adoption of new technologies and treatment methods.

Similarly, the budget allocations for the military departments determine the resources available for the implementation of new health care delivery models. If the budget allocations are insufficient, it may not be possible to implement these models, leading to a lack of efficiency in the delivery of health care services.

#### 17.2c.3 Budget Allocations and Health Care Workforce

The budget allocations for defense health care also impact the health care workforce. The budget allocations determine the number of health care professionals that can be employed, the salaries of these professionals, and the training and development opportunities available to them.

If the budget allocations are insufficient, it may not be possible to employ the required number of health care professionals, leading to shortages in the health care workforce. This can result in delays in treatment, a decline in the quality of health care services, and a lack of efficiency in the delivery of health care services.

Furthermore, if the budget allocations are insufficient, it may not be possible to provide the necessary training and development opportunities to the health care professionals, leading to a lack of skills and knowledge among these professionals. This can further impact the quality of health care services and the efficiency of the health care delivery system.

In conclusion, the budget for defense health care has a significant impact on the health care services provided to the beneficiaries, the ability to implement health care innovations, and the health care workforce. Therefore, it is crucial for the Department of Defense to carefully manage the budget allocations to ensure the provision of high-quality health care services to the beneficiaries.

### Section: 18.1b Role of Defense Family Support in National Security

The role of defense family support in national security is a critical one. The well-being and morale of defense families directly impacts the readiness and effectiveness of the military. A family that is financially stable and emotionally supported is more likely to be resilient and able to cope with the challenges of military life. This, in turn, contributes to the overall readiness and effectiveness of the military.

Defense family support plays a crucial role in maintaining the military's ability to carry out its missions. The provision of financial assistance, social and emotional support services, and other benefits helps to alleviate the financial and emotional stressors that defense families often face. This, in turn, allows them to focus on their roles as spouses and parents, and to support their service member in their military duties.

Moreover, defense family support also contributes to the recruitment and retention of military personnel. The provision of benefits and services that support defense families can make the military a more attractive career option for potential recruits. Similarly, the availability of these benefits can help to retain current service members, thereby contributing to the overall strength and stability of the military.

In addition to these direct impacts, defense family support also plays a role in national security by contributing to the overall resilience of the military. By providing support to defense families, the military is able to better prepare and adapt to the challenges and uncertainties of modern warfare. This includes the ability to bounce back from setbacks, adapt to changing circumstances, and maintain a high level of performance under stress.

In conclusion, defense family support plays a crucial role in national security. It contributes to the readiness and effectiveness of the military, helps to recruit and retain military personnel, and enhances the overall resilience of the military. As such, it is a critical component of the defense budget and requires careful consideration and allocation of resources.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the budgeting for defense family support is a critical aspect of national security. It is not just about providing financial assistance, but also about ensuring the well-being and resilience of the defense families. The budget allocation for defense family support should be seen as an investment in the future of the nation, as it directly impacts the readiness and effectiveness of the military.
