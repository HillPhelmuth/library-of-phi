# The Once and Future City: Exploring Urban Spaces and Processes":


## Foreward

Welcome to "The Once and Future City: Exploring Urban Spaces and Processes". This book aims to delve into the complex and ever-evolving world of urban spaces and processes, and to provide a comprehensive understanding of the city as a dynamic and multifaceted entity.

As we embark on this journey, it is important to acknowledge the rich history and evolution of urban spaces. The city, as we know it, has been shaped by a myriad of factors, from political ideologies to social dynamics, economic forces, and technological advancements. Each of these elements has left its indelible mark on the urban landscape, creating a tapestry of stories and narratives that are woven into the fabric of the city.

In the context of public space, the city has been a site of both critique and redefinition. As Michael Sorkin and Mike Davis have noted, modern society has withdrawn from public life, leading to the 'narrative of loss' within the public sphere. This sentiment has been echoed by others, who argue that the concepts of public, space, democracy, and citizenship are being redefined by people through lived experience.

However, this does not mean that public space is devoid of meaning or significance. On the contrary, it is precisely this flux and change that informs how contemporary public art has evolved. Temporal art in public spaces has been a long established practice, but the presence of public art has become increasingly prevalent and important within our contemporary cities. Temporal public art is so important because of its ability to reflect and respond to the ever-changing nature of the city, and to provide a platform for expression and dialogue.

In this book, we will explore these themes in depth, examining the complex interplay between urban spaces and processes, and the role of public art in shaping the city. We will also delve into the concept of the 'smart city', a term that has gained significant traction in recent years. The smart city, as we will explore, is not just about technology and data, but also about creating a more livable, sustainable, and inclusive urban environment.

As we navigate through the city, we will also be mindful of the historical and cultural context of urban spaces. The city is not just a physical entity, but also a repository of memories, traditions, and values. Understanding these aspects is crucial to a comprehensive exploration of urban spaces and processes.

In the spirit of exploration and discovery, let us embark on this journey together, delving into the once and future city, and uncovering the stories and narratives that make it a vibrant and dynamic entity.

### Subsection: 1.1b Historical Approaches to Reading Cities

The study of urban spaces and processes is not a new concept. Throughout history, scholars and urban planners have been fascinated by the city and its complexities. In this section, we will explore some of the historical approaches to reading cities, and how they have influenced our understanding of urban spaces and processes.

#### The City as a Reflection of Society

One of the earliest approaches to reading cities is the idea that the city is a reflection of the society that inhabits it. This approach, known as the "mirror of society" theory, suggests that the city's physical form and organization are a direct reflection of the social, economic, and cultural values of its inhabitants. For example, the ancient Roman city of Pompeii, with its grid-like streets and grand public buildings, reflects the military and political power of the Roman Empire.

#### The City as a Machine

Another historical approach to reading cities is the idea that the city is a machine, with each component working together to create a functioning urban system. This approach, known as the "urban machine" theory, suggests that the city is a complex system of interconnected parts, each with its own function and purpose. For example, the medieval city of Venice, with its intricate network of canals and bridges, is often described as a "machine of the sea," with each component working together to facilitate trade and transportation.

#### The City as a Living Organism

A more recent approach to reading cities is the idea that the city is a living organism, with its own life cycle and evolutionary processes. This approach, known as the "urban ecology" theory, suggests that the city is a dynamic and ever-changing entity, shaped by natural and social processes. For example, the city of Curitiba, Brazil, is often cited as an example of an "urban ecosystem," with its green spaces, pedestrian-friendly streets, and public transportation system working together to create a sustainable and livable city.

#### The City as a Palimpsest

Finally, the concept of the "urban palimpsest" is a historical approach that emphasizes the layers of history and culture that are embedded in the city. This approach suggests that the city is a palimpsest, a term used in paleography to describe a document that has been written over multiple times, with each layer of writing visible beneath the surface. In the context of urban spaces, the palimpsest metaphor suggests that the city is a layered and complex entity, with each layer representing a different time period and cultural influence.

These historical approaches to reading cities have all contributed to our understanding of urban spaces and processes. By examining the city through different lenses, we can gain a deeper understanding of its history, its present state, and its potential future. In the following sections, we will explore these approaches in more detail and discuss their implications for urban analysis.





### Subsection: 1.1c Contemporary Approaches to Reading Cities

As our understanding of urban spaces and processes continues to evolve, so too do our approaches to reading and interpreting cities. In this section, we will explore some of the contemporary approaches to reading cities, and how they build upon and challenge historical approaches.

#### The City as a Network

One of the most influential contemporary approaches to reading cities is the idea that the city is a network. This approach, inspired by the field of network theory, suggests that the city is a complex web of interconnected elements, each with its own influence and impact on the city as a whole. For example, the city of Singapore, with its extensive public transportation system and interconnected urban planning, can be seen as a network of interconnected nodes and links.

#### The City as a Palimpsest

Another contemporary approach to reading cities is the idea that the city is a palimpsest, a term borrowed from the world of manuscripts. This approach suggests that the city is a layered and complex entity, with each layer representing a different time period or cultural influence. For example, the city of Istanbul, with its layers of Byzantine, Ottoman, and modern architecture, can be seen as a palimpsest of different cultural and historical influences.

#### The City as a Smart City

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the concept of the "smart city," a city that uses technology and data to improve the quality of life for its inhabitants. This approach to reading cities focuses on the use of technology and data to understand and improve urban spaces and processes. For example, the city of Barcelona, with its extensive use of sensors and data analytics, can be seen as a model for a smart city.

#### The City as a Living Laboratory

Finally, there is the approach of reading cities as living laboratories, a concept inspired by the field of urban ecology. This approach suggests that cities are ideal places for studying and understanding urban spaces and processes, as they are constantly evolving and adapting to the needs and desires of their inhabitants. For example, the city of Curitiba, Brazil, with its innovative urban planning and sustainable practices, can be seen as a living laboratory for studying and understanding urban spaces and processes.

In conclusion, the contemporary approaches to reading cities build upon and challenge historical approaches, offering new ways of understanding and interpreting urban spaces and processes. By exploring these approaches, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities and nuances of the city, and how it continues to evolve and adapt in the modern world.





### Subsection: 1.2a Urban Processes: Physical and Social Forces

The city is a complex and dynamic entity, shaped by a multitude of physical and social forces. These forces interact with each other in intricate ways, creating a constantly evolving urban landscape. In this section, we will explore the physical and social forces that shape the city, and how they interact to create the urban spaces we experience.

#### Physical Forces

Physical forces play a crucial role in shaping the city. These forces include natural phenomena such as climate, topography, and geology, as well as human-made structures such as buildings, roads, and infrastructure. For example, the city of Boston, with its harbor and hilly topography, has been shaped by the physical forces of the ocean and erosion. The city's grid layout and extensive public transportation system are human-made structures that have been shaped by the physical forces of urban planning and development.

#### Social Forces

Social forces are another important aspect of urban shaping. These forces include social, economic, and cultural influences that shape the city. For example, the city of New York, with its diverse population and bustling economy, has been shaped by the social forces of immigration, economic development, and cultural exchange. The city's grid layout and extensive public transportation system are also shaped by social forces, as they are designed to accommodate the needs and movements of the city's inhabitants.

#### Interactions between Physical and Social Forces

The physical and social forces that shape the city are not separate entities, but rather interconnected and interdependent. For example, the physical force of climate can influence the social force of economic development. In a city like Miami, with its warm climate, the tourism industry is a major contributor to the city's economy. The physical force of climate also influences the social force of urban planning, as the city must adapt to the challenges posed by extreme weather events such as hurricanes.

Similarly, the social force of immigration can shape the physical force of urban development. In cities like Los Angeles and New York, immigration has led to the development of diverse and vibrant neighborhoods, each with its own unique physical characteristics. The social force of immigration also influences the physical force of urban planning, as cities must accommodate the needs and preferences of their diverse populations.

#### The Once and Future City

The physical and social forces that shape the city are not static, but rather constantly evolving. As cities continue to grow and change, they are shaped by new physical and social forces, while also being influenced by the forces that have shaped them in the past. This dynamic process of urban shaping is what makes the city a living and evolving entity.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of the "once and future city," and how the physical and social forces that shape the city create a sense of continuity and change over time. We will also discuss the role of urban planning and development in shaping the city, and how it must adapt to the ever-changing physical and social forces that shape urban spaces.

#### Federal Government

The federal government also plays a role in urban development, particularly in areas such as housing, transportation, and economic development. Federal policies and programs, such as the Community Development Block Grant and the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, provide funding and incentives for local governments and developers to create affordable housing and revitalize neighborhoods. The federal government also plays a role in transportation planning and funding, particularly for large-scale projects such as highways and mass transit systems.

#### Policy Implementation

The implementation of policies is a critical aspect of urban development. Policies can only be effective if they are properly implemented and enforced. This requires collaboration between different levels of government, as well as between government agencies and the private sector. For example, the implementation of a new transportation policy may require cooperation between the local government, the state department of transportation, and private developers.

#### Challenges and Opportunities

Despite the importance of government and policies in urban development, there are also challenges and opportunities. One challenge is the fragmentation of local governments in metropolitan areas, which can lead to inefficient and conflicting policies. Another challenge is the limited funding available for public services and infrastructure, particularly in urban areas. However, there are also opportunities for innovation and collaboration, such as the use of self-healing technology and zero-energy buildings.

In conclusion, the role of government and policies in urban development is crucial. They shape the city in numerous ways, from physical infrastructure to social services. However, there are also challenges and opportunities that must be addressed to ensure the efficient and sustainable development of our cities.

#### Understanding Patterns of Change

Patterns of change in urban areas refer to the observable trends and patterns in the evolution of urban spaces over time. These patterns can be spatial, temporal, or thematic, and they can provide valuable insights into the underlying processes that shape urban environments.

Spatial patterns of change refer to the distribution and movement of urban phenomena across space. For instance, the expansion of urban areas, the concentration of population in certain areas, or the displacement of certain land use types can all be considered spatial patterns of change.

Temporal patterns of change, on the other hand, refer to the changes in urban phenomena over time. These can be long-term trends, such as the gradual increase in population density, or short-term fluctuations, such as the seasonal variations in land use.

Thematic patterns of change refer to the changes in the characteristics or attributes of urban phenomena. For example, the transformation of a residential area into a commercial zone, or the shift from single-family homes to multi-family dwellings can be considered thematic patterns of change.

#### Identifying Patterns of Change

Identifying patterns of change in urban areas involves a careful analysis of urban data over time. This can be done using various methods, including GIS, statistical analysis, and qualitative analysis.

GIS, as discussed in the previous section, can be used to visualize and analyze spatial patterns of change. It can also be used to perform temporal analysis, by creating time series maps that show how urban phenomena change over time.

Statistical analysis can be used to identify temporal patterns of change. This can involve the use of various statistical techniques, such as regression analysis, time series analysis, and trend analysis.

Qualitative analysis, on the other hand, can be used to identify thematic patterns of change. This can involve the use of qualitative research methods, such as interviews, observations, and document analysis, to understand the underlying processes that drive urban change.

#### Analyzing Patterns of Change

Once patterns of change have been identified, they need to be analyzed to understand the underlying processes that drive urban change. This can involve the use of various analytical techniques, such as causal analysis, system dynamics, and scenario planning.

Causal analysis involves identifying the causes of urban change. This can be done by examining the relationships between different urban phenomena and the factors that influence these relationships.

System dynamics involves modeling the complex interactions between different urban phenomena over time. This can help to understand the long-term trends and patterns in urban change.

Scenario planning involves developing and evaluating different scenarios of future urban change. This can help to understand the potential impacts of different urban development strategies and policies.

In the next section, we will explore some of the key patterns of change that have emerged from our analysis of MIT sites.




### Subsection: 3.4b Analyzing Spatial and Temporal Trends in Urban Transformation

In the previous section, we discussed the identification of patterns of change in urban areas. In this section, we will focus on the analysis of these patterns, particularly the spatial and temporal trends in urban transformation.

#### Analyzing Spatial Trends

Spatial trends in urban transformation refer to the changes in the distribution and movement of urban phenomena across space. These trends can be analyzed using GIS, which allows for the visualization and analysis of spatial data.

For instance, the expansion of urban areas can be analyzed using GIS to identify the areas of greatest expansion and the factors driving this expansion. Similarly, the concentration of population in certain areas can be analyzed to identify the factors influencing this concentration, such as job opportunities, access to services, or housing affordability.

#### Analyzing Temporal Trends

Temporal trends in urban transformation refer to the changes in urban phenomena over time. These trends can be analyzed using statistical methods, such as time series analysis, which allows for the identification of long-term trends and short-term fluctuations.

For example, the gradual increase in population density can be analyzed using time series analysis to identify the factors driving this increase, such as natural increase, migration, or urbanization. Similarly, seasonal variations in land use can be analyzed to identify the factors influencing these variations, such as changes in economic activity, weather patterns, or policy interventions.

#### Analyzing Thematic Trends

Thematic trends in urban transformation refer to the changes in the characteristics or attributes of urban phenomena. These trends can be analyzed using qualitative methods, such as case studies or ethnographic research, which allow for a deeper understanding of the underlying processes driving these changes.

For instance, the transformation of a residential area into a commercial zone can be analyzed using a case study to identify the factors influencing this transformation, such as changes in land use policies, economic conditions, or community preferences. Similarly, the shift from single-family homes to multi-family dwellings can be analyzed using ethnographic research to understand the social, economic, and cultural factors driving this shift.

In conclusion, the analysis of spatial and temporal trends in urban transformation is crucial for understanding the underlying processes shaping urban environments. By combining GIS, statistical analysis, and qualitative analysis, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of these trends and their implications for urban planning and policy.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the urban spaces and processes at MIT, exploring the patterns that emerge from these complex systems. We have seen how these patterns are shaped by a multitude of factors, including but not limited to, urban climatology, spatial planning, and public health. The MIT sites serve as a microcosm of the larger urban landscape, providing a unique opportunity to study and understand the dynamics of urban spaces.

The patterns that emerge from these sites are not static, but rather dynamic and ever-changing. They are influenced by a myriad of factors, both internal and external, and their evolution is a testament to the complexity of urban systems. The weighted urban proliferation method, as discussed in this chapter, provides a useful tool for understanding and analyzing these patterns.

As we move forward, it is important to remember that the patterns we observe in these urban spaces are not just abstract concepts, but have real-world implications. They impact the lives of people, the health of communities, and the sustainability of our cities. By studying these patterns, we can gain valuable insights into the workings of our urban spaces and potentially influence their future development.

## Chapter 4: The Future City: What Will It Look Like?

### Introduction

As we delve into the fourth chapter of "The Once and Future City: Exploring Urban Spaces and Processes", we shift our focus from the past and present to the future. The future city is a concept that is as exciting as it is uncertain. It is a city that is yet to be built, a city that is still being imagined. But it is also a city that is being shaped by the decisions we make today.

In this chapter, we will explore the future city, not as a fixed entity, but as a dynamic and evolving space. We will look at the forces that are shaping this future city, the challenges it will face, and the opportunities it presents. We will also examine the role of urban planning and design in creating a city that is sustainable, livable, and resilient.

The future city is not just a physical space, but a complex web of social, economic, and environmental systems. It is a city where technology and innovation will play a crucial role, but also a city where human needs and values will be paramount. It is a city that will need to adapt to a changing climate, a growing population, and a rapidly evolving world.

As we explore the future city, we will also look at the role of urban spaces and processes in shaping this future. We will examine how urban spaces, such as parks, plazas, and streets, will be designed and used in the future city. We will also look at the processes that will shape the city, such as migration, gentrification, and urban sprawl.

In this chapter, we will not make predictions about the future city. Instead, we will explore the possibilities and challenges of the future city, and the decisions we need to make today to create a city that is truly sustainable and livable. We will also look at the role of urban spaces and processes in shaping this future city.

### Subsection: 3.5a Building a Persuasive Argument on Urban Change

In this section, we will discuss how to build a persuasive argument on urban change. This involves identifying the key factors driving urban change, analyzing the patterns of change, and making an argument about the future of urban spaces.

#### Identifying Key Factors

The first step in building a persuasive argument on urban change is to identify the key factors driving urban change. These factors can be spatial, temporal, or thematic, as discussed in the previous section. For instance, the expansion of urban areas can be driven by factors such as economic growth, population increase, or policy interventions. Similarly, the concentration of population in certain areas can be driven by factors such as job opportunities, access to services, or housing affordability.

#### Analyzing Patterns of Change

Once the key factors have been identified, the next step is to analyze the patterns of change. This involves examining the spatial, temporal, and thematic trends in urban transformation. For example, the expansion of urban areas can be analyzed using GIS to identify the areas of greatest expansion and the factors driving this expansion. Similarly, the concentration of population in certain areas can be analyzed to identify the factors influencing this concentration.

#### Making an Argument About the Future of Urban Spaces

The final step in building a persuasive argument on urban change is to make an argument about the future of urban spaces. This involves extrapolating from the current patterns of change to predict future trends. For instance, if the current trends indicate a rapid expansion of urban areas, one could argue that this expansion will continue in the future, leading to increased urbanization. Similarly, if the current trends indicate a concentration of population in certain areas, one could argue that this concentration will continue, leading to increased inequality.

In conclusion, building a persuasive argument on urban change involves identifying the key factors driving urban change, analyzing the patterns of change, and making an argument about the future of urban spaces. This process is crucial for understanding and managing urban transformation.




### Subsection: 3.5b Supporting Claims with Data and Evidence

In the previous section, we discussed how to build a persuasive argument on urban change. Now, we will delve into the importance of supporting these arguments with data and evidence. This involves collecting and analyzing data, and using this data to support your claims.

#### Collecting and Analyzing Data

The first step in supporting your claims with data is to collect relevant data. This can be done through various methods, such as surveys, interviews, observations, and secondary data analysis. For instance, to support a claim about the expansion of urban areas, one could collect data on population growth, land use changes, and economic indicators.

Once the data has been collected, it needs to be analyzed. This involves using statistical methods to make sense of the data and identify patterns and trends. For example, one could use regression analysis to examine the relationship between population growth and urban expansion.

#### Using Data to Support Claims

After the data has been collected and analyzed, it can be used to support your claims. This involves using the data to illustrate your arguments and provide evidence for your claims. For instance, if you are arguing that urban expansion is driven by economic growth, you could use data on economic indicators to support this claim.

It's important to note that data and evidence should be used to support your claims, not to make them. Your arguments should be based on a thorough understanding of the urban change process, and data and evidence should be used to reinforce and illustrate these arguments.

#### The Role of Data and Evidence in Urban Planning

Data and evidence play a crucial role in urban planning. They provide the basis for understanding urban change and inform decision-making processes. By using data and evidence, urban planners can make informed decisions about land use, transportation, and infrastructure, among other things.

In the context of the MIT sites, data and evidence can be used to understand the patterns of urban change that have emerged over time. This can help us to identify the key factors driving urban change and make predictions about the future of these urban spaces.

In conclusion, supporting claims with data and evidence is a crucial aspect of urban planning and research. It allows us to make informed decisions and develop effective strategies for managing urban spaces.

4. **Data Collection**: Data collection involves systematically recording information about artifacts and traces. This can include information about the physical characteristics of the artifact or trace, as well as its context within the urban space. This can be done using paper forms or digital databases.

5. **Surveying**: Surveying involves measuring and mapping the urban space. This can be useful for documenting the layout of streets, buildings, and other features.

#### The Single Context Recording Method

The single context recording method is a specific strategy for documenting artifacts and traces in urban spaces. This method involves drawing each feature individually in plan and then relating its position to the site grid. This allows for a detailed and systematic documentation of the urban space.

The single context recording method was first developed by Ed Harris and Patrick Ottaway in 1976, and has since been refined and expanded upon by the Museum of London and the York Archaeological Trust. It involves excavating the urban space down to the first significant layer of archaeology and features, and then recording these features as single contexts. This process continues until the natural deposits are reached.

By using the single context recording method, we can create a detailed and comprehensive record of the urban space. This can be particularly useful for understanding the history and development of a city, neighborhood, or park.

#### Conclusion

Documenting artifacts and traces in urban spaces is a crucial part of urban archaeology. By using strategies such as photography, drawing and sketching, note-taking, data collection, and the single context recording method, we can create a detailed and comprehensive record of the urban space. This allows us to understand the history and development of a city, neighborhood, or park, and to piece together the story of the urban space.

### Subsection: 9.2a The Concept of Affordable Housing

Affordable housing is a critical component of urban spaces and processes. It is a concept that encompasses a wide range of housing options, from emergency shelters to affordable home ownership, all of which are designed to meet the needs of households with varying income levels. The concept of affordable housing is not static; it evolves in response to changes in economic, social, and psychological factors.

#### 9.2a.1 Definitions of Affordable Housing

The definition of affordable housing can vary depending on the context. In Australia, for instance, the National Affordable Housing Summit Group defines affordable housing as housing that is "...reasonably adequate in standard and location for lower or middle income households and does not cost so much that a household is unlikely to be able to meet other basic needs on a sustainable basis." In the United Kingdom, affordable housing includes "social rented and intermediate housing, provided to specified eligible households whose needs are not met by the market." 

In some contexts, affordable housing may only mean subsidized or public housing, while in others it may include naturally occurring affordable housing or "affordable" by different income levels from no income households to moderate income but cost-burdened households.

#### 9.2a.2 Median Multiple Approach

The median multiple indicator is a commonly used method for defining and measuring affordable housing. This approach compares the median housing price or rent to the median household income. A median multiple of 3 or less is generally considered affordable, while a median multiple of 5 or more is considered unaffordable.

#### 9.2a.3 Affordable Housing and Housing Choice

Housing choice is a complex process that is influenced by a variety of factors. Some households may choose to spend more on housing because they feel they can afford to, while others may not have a choice due to limited income options. Affordable housing provides households with a range of housing options that are within their financial means, allowing them to make informed choices about their living arrangements.

#### 9.2a.4 Affordable Housing and Urban Spaces

Affordable housing plays a crucial role in shaping urban spaces. It influences the type of neighborhoods that are developed, the quality of public spaces, and the overall livability of a city. Affordable housing can also contribute to the economic vitality of a city by providing housing options for a diverse range of households, including low-income earners, students, and young professionals.

In the next section, we will explore the various strategies and policies that can be used to address the issue of affordable housing in urban spaces.




### Subsection: 9.2b Strategies for Providing Affordable Housing

Affordable housing is a critical component of urban spaces and processes. It is a concept that encompasses a wide range of housing options, from emergency shelters to affordable home ownership, all of which are designed to meet the needs of households with varying income levels. The concept of affordable housing is not static; it evolves in response to changes in economic, social, and psychological factors.

#### 9.2b.1 Market-Based Approaches

One potential means of addressing affordable housing is through public policy instruments that focus on the demand side of the market. These programs aim to help households reach financial benchmarks that make housing affordable. This can include approaches that simply promote economic growth in general, hoping that a stronger economy, higher employment rates, and higher wages will increase the ability of households to acquire housing at market prices.

Federal government policies define banking and mortgage lending practices, tax and regulatory measures affecting building materials, professional practices (ex. real estate transactions). The purchasing power of individual households can be enhanced through tax and fiscal policies that result in reducing the cost of mortgages and the cost of borrowing. Public policies may include the implementation of subsidy programs and incentive patterns for average households. For the most vulnerable groups, such as seniors, single-parent families, the disabled, etc., some form of publicly funded allowance strategy can be implemented providing individual households with adequate income to afford housing.

#### 9.2b.2 Supply-Side Strategies

Currently, policies that facilitate production on the supply side include favorable land use policies such as inclusionary zoning, relaxation of environmental regulations, and the enforcement of affordable housing quotas in new developments.

In some countries, such as Canada and the United States, municipal governments began to play a greater role in developing and implementing policies regarding form and density of municipal housing in residential districts, as early as the 1950s. At the municipal level, promoted policy tools include zoning permissions for diverse housing types or missing middle housing types such as duplexes, cottages, rowhouses, fourplexes, and accessory dwelling units. Some municipalities have also reduced the amount of parking that must be built for a new structure, as parking requirements can significantly increase the cost of housing.

#### 9.2b.3 Mixed-Income Housing

Mixed-income housing is a strategy that combines affordable housing with market-rate housing in the same development. This approach can help to address the issue of affordability by providing a mix of housing options for households with varying income levels. Mixed-income housing can also help to create more diverse and inclusive communities.

#### 9.2b.4 Housing Vouchers

Housing vouchers are a form of rental assistance that can help low-income households afford housing. These vouchers are provided by the government and can be used to cover a portion of the rent, making housing more affordable for these households. Housing vouchers can be used in both private and public housing developments.

#### 9.2b.5 Affordable Housing Trust Funds

Affordable Housing Trust Funds are a source of funding for affordable housing developments. These funds are typically established by local or state governments and are used to provide subsidies for affordable housing developments. The funds can be used to cover the cost of land, construction, or operating expenses for affordable housing developments.

#### 9.2b.6 Community Land Trusts

Community Land Trusts are a model of affordable housing that involves the creation of a non-profit organization that owns and manages land for the purpose of providing affordable housing. The land is held in trust and is not subject to market forces, ensuring that the housing remains affordable for future generations.

#### 9.2b.7 Inclusive Housing

Inclusive housing is a strategy that aims to create communities where all households, regardless of income, have access to safe, decent, and affordable housing. This can be achieved through a combination of market-based approaches and supply-side strategies, as well as policies that promote diversity and inclusion in housing developments.




### Subsection: 9.2c Case Studies of Affordable Housing

Affordable housing is a critical component of urban spaces and processes. It is a concept that encompasses a wide range of housing options, from emergency shelters to affordable home ownership, all of which are designed to meet the needs of households with varying income levels.

#### 9.2c.2 Case Study 2: The Evergreen Sustainability Development Standard

The Evergreen Sustainability Development Standard is a set of standards and guidelines developed by the state of Washington in the United States. This standard is applied to all publicly subsidized affordable housing projects in the state. It requires that all buildings that receive public funding meet 79 criteria that safeguard health and safety, increase durability, promote sustainable living, preserve the environment, and increase energy and water efficiency.

The potential problem with sustainability standards is that projects will be more costly and projects will become cost prohibitive. While units that are built will be higher efficiency, the number of available units could decrease because of costs. A 2009 study prepared by Davis Langdon examines the effect of green standards on the costs of affordable housing projects in Seattle and Portland. This study compared "standard housing projects" (i.e. projects with no explicit sustainability goals) and projects attempting to achieve Built Green or LEED certification. The study includes both public and private affordable housing projects. At the time of the study, both cities had high sustainability standards for public projects, and Washington has only increased that standard since then. Construction cost analysis (in terms of cost per square foot) showed that green standards added 2-3% to the cost of affordable housing projects.

#### 9.2c.3 Case Study 3: The Green Affordable Housing Coalition's Standards for New Housing

The Green Affordable Housing Coalition has developed a set of standards for new affordable housing projects. These standards are designed to ensure that new projects are sustainable and cost-effective. The coalition recommends that new affordable housing projects be built to the LEED Platinum standard, which is the highest level of certification for green buildings. This standard requires that projects meet a set of criteria related to energy efficiency, water conservation, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, and innovation.

The coalition also recommends that new affordable housing projects be built to the Passive House standard, which is a European standard for energy-efficient buildings. This standard requires that buildings be designed and constructed to achieve a very high level of energy efficiency, with a focus on reducing heating and cooling needs.

In addition to these standards, the coalition also recommends that new affordable housing projects be built to the WELL Building Standard, which is a standard for buildings that prioritize the health and well-being of their occupants. This standard includes criteria related to air quality, water quality, light, acoustics, and more.

By adopting these standards, affordable housing projects can be designed and constructed in a way that not only meets the needs of households with varying income levels but also promotes sustainability and the health and well-being of residents.

In this section, we will explore the different types of urban economic systems and how they are shaped by these factors.

#### 12.1a Types of Urban Economic Systems

There are three main types of urban economic systems: the traditional economy, the modern economy, and the post-modern economy. Each of these systems is characterized by different economic structures and processes.

The traditional economy is based on agriculture and subsistence farming. In this system, the majority of the population is engaged in farming and other agricultural activities. The economy is largely self-sufficient, with little trade or exchange of goods and services. The traditional economy is often found in developing countries and is characterized by a low level of economic development.

The modern economy, on the other hand, is based on industry and manufacturing. In this system, the majority of the population is employed in factories and other industrial activities. The economy is highly interconnected and relies on trade and exchange of goods and services. The modern economy is often found in developed countries and is characterized by a high level of economic development.

The post-modern economy is a blend of the traditional and modern economies. It is characterized by a mix of agricultural and industrial activities, as well as a growing service sector. The post-modern economy is often found in developing countries and is characterized by a transition from a traditional to a modern economy.

The type of urban economic system present in a city is influenced by a variety of factors, including the city's history, culture, and geography. For example, cities with a strong agricultural tradition may still have a significant traditional economy, while cities with a history of industrialization may have a more modern economy.

In many cases, the cost of implementing smart city technologies can be prohibitive for low-income residents and neighborhoods. This can further exacerbate the digital divide and create a sense of exclusion for those who are unable to access these technologies.

#### 12.3b.3 Future of Technology in Urban Economy

As we look towards the future, it is important to consider how technology will continue to shape urban economies. One potential solution to the digital divide is the implementation of universal basic income (UBI). This concept, which has gained traction in recent years, proposes that all citizens receive a basic income regardless of their employment status.

UBI has the potential to address the digital divide by providing all residents with the means to access technology and digital resources. This could lead to increased opportunities for economic growth and development, as well as a more equitable distribution of wealth.

Another potential solution is the implementation of a guaranteed minimum income (GMI). This concept is similar to UBI, but is targeted towards specific groups, such as low-income residents or those with disabilities. GMI has the potential to address the digital divide by providing these groups with the means to access technology and digital resources, while also addressing other social and economic inequalities.

In addition to addressing the digital divide, technology will also continue to play a crucial role in driving economic growth and development in urban areas. This includes the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to optimize services and resources, as well as the development of new industries and job opportunities.

As we move towards a more technologically advanced future, it is important to consider the potential implications and challenges that may arise. By addressing issues such as the digital divide and implementing policies such as UBI and GMI, we can ensure that technology continues to benefit all members of the urban community.

Social inequalities can have profound impacts on urban development. They can contribute to the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities, leading to disparities in health, education, employment, and other key areas. They can also exacerbate social vulnerability, as marginalized groups may be less able to prepare for, cope with, and recover from hazards due to their social and economic disadvantages.

#### 13.1b.3 Social Resilience

Social resilience is a key factor in urban development. It refers to the ability of a community or society to withstand and recover from adverse events or conditions. Social resilience is often a function of social cohesion, social capital, and social support, which can help to buffer the impacts of hazards and other challenges.

Social resilience can play a crucial role in urban development. It can help to mitigate the impacts of social vulnerability and social inequalities, by enhancing the ability of communities to prepare for, cope with, and recover from hazards. It can also contribute to the overall resilience of urban systems, helping to ensure that they can continue to function effectively in the face of challenges.

In conclusion, social issues play a crucial role in urban development. They shape the character and quality of cities in profound ways, influencing everything from the distribution of resources and opportunities, to the ability of communities to prepare for, cope with, and recover from hazards.
