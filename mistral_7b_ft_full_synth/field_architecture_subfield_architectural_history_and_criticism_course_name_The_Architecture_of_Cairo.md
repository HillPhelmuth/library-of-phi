## Chapter 1: Introduction to Egyptian Architecture:

### Subsection 1.1: The Evolution of Egyptian Architecture

Egyptian architecture has a rich and complex history, spanning over 5,000 years. It is a reflection of the country's cultural, religious, and political evolution. The earliest known examples of Egyptian architecture date back to the Predynastic period (before 3000 BC), and it has continued to evolve and adapt to the changing needs and beliefs of the people.

The earliest forms of Egyptian architecture were simple and functional, with mud-brick structures being the most common. These structures were typically rectangular in shape and were used for living, working, and storage. The use of mud-brick was not only practical but also symbolic, as it represented the fertile land of the Nile Valley.

As the ancient Egyptian civilization developed, so did its architecture. The rise of the pharaohs brought about a shift in architectural style, with the construction of grandiose monuments and temples. These structures were not only a testament to the power and wealth of the pharaohs but also served as a means of communicating with the gods. The most famous example of this is the pyramids, which were built as tombs for the pharaohs and were designed to mimic the shape of the mountains where the gods were believed to live.

The ancient Egyptians also developed a sophisticated understanding of mathematics and engineering, which was reflected in their architecture. The use of precise measurements and mathematical proportions was crucial in the construction of temples and other structures. For example, the Great Pyramid of Giza is believed to have been built using a mathematical formula that relates the height of the pyramid to its base.

The ancient Egyptians also had a strong connection to the afterlife, and this is reflected in their architecture. The belief in the afterlife led to the development of elaborate tombs and funerary structures, such as the pyramids and mastabas. These structures were designed to protect the deceased and provide them with a comfortable afterlife.

As the ancient Egyptian civilization continued to evolve, so did its architecture. The rise of the Ptolemaic dynasty brought about a blending of Egyptian and Greek architectural styles, resulting in the development of the Ptolemaic style. This style was characterized by the use of columns and pediments, which were influenced by Greek architecture, but also retained elements of Egyptian design, such as the use of hieroglyphs.

The Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BC brought about another shift in architectural style. The Romans introduced their own architectural traditions, such as the use of arches and vaults, which were incorporated into Egyptian architecture. This resulted in the development of the Roman-Egyptian style, which combined elements of both Roman and Egyptian design.

The Islamic conquest of Egypt in the 7th century AD brought about a significant change in architectural style. The introduction of Islamic architecture, with its emphasis on geometric patterns and calligraphy, had a profound impact on Egyptian architecture. The use of domes and arches became more prevalent, and the incorporation of Islamic design elements into existing structures, such as the Hanging Church in Cairo, resulted in the creation of unique and beautiful architectural works.

In conclusion, the evolution of Egyptian architecture has been shaped by various factors, including cultural, religious, and political influences. From the simple mud-brick structures of the Predynastic period to the grandiose monuments and temples of the pharaohs, Egyptian architecture has a rich and complex history that continues to inspire and captivate us today. 


## Chapter 1: Introduction to Egyptian Architecture:




### Subsection 1.1a Alexander's Conquest of Egypt

The conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great in 332 BC marked a significant turning point in the history of Egyptian architecture. Alexander's invasion not only brought about a change in political power but also introduced new architectural styles and techniques that would shape the future of Egyptian architecture.

Alexander's conquest of Egypt was part of his larger campaign to conquer the Persian Empire. After defeating the Persian king Darius III at the Battle of Issus in 333 BC, Alexander turned his attention to Egypt. The Egyptian king at the time, Nectanebo II, had already been weakened by a series of invasions and was unable to put up much resistance against Alexander's army. In 332 BC, Alexander entered Egypt and was welcomed by the Egyptian people as a liberator from Persian rule.

One of the most significant architectural changes brought about by Alexander's conquest was the introduction of Hellenistic architecture. Hellenistic architecture, which originated in ancient Greece, was heavily influenced by the principles of symmetry, proportion, and rationality. These principles were in stark contrast to the more organic and symbolic forms of ancient Egyptian architecture. As a result, Hellenistic architecture had a profound impact on the development of Egyptian architecture, leading to the creation of new forms and styles.

Another important architectural development during Alexander's conquest was the introduction of new building materials and techniques. The Egyptians had traditionally used mud-brick and stone for their structures, but Alexander's army brought with them new building materials such as timber and iron. These materials were used in the construction of new buildings, including the famous lighthouse at Alexandria, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

The conquest of Egypt by Alexander also led to the integration of Egyptian and Greek architectural styles. The Egyptians had long been known for their mastery of stone masonry, and this skill was combined with the more geometric and symmetrical forms of Greek architecture to create a unique blend of styles. This integration can be seen in the design of the Temple of Serapis in Alexandria, which combined elements of both Egyptian and Greek architecture.

In conclusion, Alexander's conquest of Egypt not only brought about a change in political power but also had a significant impact on the development of Egyptian architecture. The introduction of new architectural styles, materials, and techniques led to a new era in Egyptian architecture, one that would continue to evolve and adapt to the changing needs and beliefs of the people. 





### Subsection 1.1b The Ptolemaic Dynasty

The Ptolemaic dynasty, named after its founder Ptolemy I Soter, was one of the most influential and longest-lasting dynasties in ancient Egypt. The Ptolemies ruled Egypt for nearly three centuries, from 305 BC to 30 BC, and their reign saw significant developments in Egyptian architecture.

The Ptolemaic dynasty was founded by Ptolemy I Soter, one of Alexander the Great's generals. After Alexander's death in 323 BC, Ptolemy returned to Egypt and proclaimed himself king. The Ptolemies were able to maintain their rule by balancing the interests of the Egyptian population and the Greek immigrants who had settled in Egypt during Alexander's conquest.

The Ptolemaic dynasty was known for its grandiose architectural projects, which were designed to showcase the wealth and power of the dynasty. The most famous of these projects was the construction of the lighthouse at Alexandria, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The lighthouse, which was built on the island of Pharos, was a massive structure that stood over 100 meters tall and was visible from miles away. It was a symbol of the Ptolemaic dynasty's dominance over the Mediterranean Sea.

Another significant architectural project undertaken by the Ptolemies was the construction of the Library of Alexandria. The library, which was founded by Ptolemy II Philadelphus, was one of the largest and most famous libraries in the ancient world. It contained over 700,000 scrolls and was a center of learning and scholarship. The library was destroyed in a fire in the 3rd century AD, but its legacy lives on as a symbol of the Ptolemaic dynasty's commitment to education and knowledge.

The Ptolemaic dynasty also made significant contributions to Egyptian architecture through the integration of Greek and Egyptian styles. The Ptolemies were known for their love of Greek culture and architecture, and they incorporated Greek elements into their buildings and monuments. This blending of styles resulted in the creation of unique and innovative architectural forms that are still studied and admired today.

In conclusion, the Ptolemaic dynasty played a crucial role in the evolution of Egyptian architecture. Their grandiose projects and integration of Greek and Egyptian styles have left a lasting impact on the architectural landscape of Egypt and continue to inspire architects and scholars to this day. 





### Subsection 1.1c The Roman Period

The Roman period in Egypt was a time of significant architectural development, as the Romans sought to integrate their own architectural styles with the existing Egyptian traditions. This period saw the construction of grandiose structures such as temples, aqueducts, and villas, which reflected the power and wealth of the Roman Empire.

The Roman conquest of Egypt occurred in 30 BC, when the last Ptolemaic king, Cleopatra VII, committed suicide after her defeat by the Roman general Octavian. The Roman Empire then ruled Egypt for the next 700 years, until the Arab conquest in the 7th century AD.

One of the most significant architectural projects undertaken by the Romans in Egypt was the construction of the aqueducts. These structures were designed to transport water from the Nile River to the cities and farms throughout Egypt. The most famous of these aqueducts was the Aqueduct of the Caesars, which was built by the Roman emperor Tiberius in the 1st century AD. The aqueduct was over 100 kilometers long and supplied water to the city of Alexandria.

The Romans also made significant contributions to Egyptian architecture through the construction of temples. These temples were often built in a fusion of Egyptian and Roman styles, with elements of both traditions incorporated into the design. The Temple of Serapis in Alexandria, for example, combined the Egyptian god Serapis with the Roman god Zeus, reflecting the blending of cultures under Roman rule.

In addition to their public buildings, the Romans also constructed grand villas for their elite citizens. These villas were often built in the countryside and were designed to be luxurious and comfortable. They often featured gardens, swimming pools, and other amenities, and were a symbol of the Roman lifestyle.

The Roman period also saw the development of Christian architecture in Egypt. The Romans were responsible for the construction of many of the earliest Christian churches and monasteries in Egypt, which played a crucial role in the spread of Christianity in the region.

In conclusion, the Roman period in Egypt was a time of significant architectural development, as the Romans sought to integrate their own architectural styles with the existing Egyptian traditions. Their grandiose structures, such as aqueducts, temples, and villas, continue to be a testament to their power and wealth, and their influence on Egyptian architecture can still be seen today.

### Section: 1.2 Foundation of al-Fustat

#### 1.2a The Founding of al-Fustat

The founding of al-Fustat, the first Islamic settlement in Egypt, marked a significant turning point in the architectural history of Cairo. This settlement, established by Amr ibn al-As in 641 CE, served as the administrative capital of Egypt during the early Islamic period. Its founding was a direct result of the Muslim conquest of Byzantine Egypt, which began in 639 CE and lasted until 642 CE.

The choice of location for al-Fustat was strategic. It was built next to the ancient city of Babylon Fortress, which was located on the eastern bank of the Nile River. This location was chosen for its proximity to the Nile, which provided a vital source of water for the settlement. It was also strategically located, allowing for easy defense and control of the surrounding area.

The founding of al-Fustat also marked the beginning of a new architectural era in Egypt. The settlement was built using a combination of ancient Egyptian and Byzantine architectural styles, reflecting the cultural influences of the time. The settlement was also home to the Mosque of Amr Ibn al-As, the oldest mosque in Egypt and Africa. This mosque, while not the current structure, was a significant architectural landmark in the early Islamic period.

The founding of al-Fustat also led to the development of other early Islamic settlements in Egypt. These settlements, including al-Askar and al-Qata'i, were established to the northeast of Fustat and served as military camps and administrative centers. These settlements further expanded the architectural landscape of Cairo, introducing new architectural styles and techniques.

The founding of al-Fustat also had a significant impact on the architectural history of Cairo. The settlement served as a model for the later development of the city, with its strategic location and architectural styles influencing the design of later structures. The settlement also laid the foundation for the development of Islamic architecture in Egypt, which would continue to evolve and shape the architectural landscape of Cairo for centuries to come.

In the next section, we will explore the architectural legacy of al-Fustat and its impact on the development of Cairo. We will also examine the key architectural developments of the early Islamic period, including the construction of mosques, madrasas, and other important structures.

#### 1.2b The Development of al-Fustat

The development of al-Fustat was a gradual process, shaped by the changing political and cultural dynamics of the time. As the Islamic conquest of Egypt progressed, the settlement grew in size and complexity, reflecting the increasing power and influence of the Islamic world.

One of the key factors in the development of al-Fustat was the establishment of the Abbasid caliphate in 750 CE. The Abbasids, who overthrew the Umayyad caliphate, created their own settlement to the northeast of Fustat, known as al-Askar. This settlement was laid out like a military camp and served as the new provincial capital. The choice of location was strategic, as it was closer to the Nile and provided better defense against potential enemies.

The development of al-Fustat also saw the construction of new architectural landmarks. The Mosque of Amr Ibn al-As, which was originally built by Amr ibn al-As, was expanded and renovated during this period. The new structure, completed in 786 CE, was a significant architectural achievement and a testament to the growing power and wealth of the Islamic world.

Another important architectural development in al-Fustat was the construction of the Nilometer. Built on Roda Island near Fustat, the Nilometer was a crucial tool for measuring the annual flooding of the Nile, which was essential for agriculture and trade in ancient Egypt. The Nilometer was repaired and given a new roof in later centuries, but its basic structure remains preserved today, making it one of the oldest preserved Islamic-era structures in Cairo.

The development of al-Fustat also saw the introduction of new architectural styles and techniques. The settlement was home to a diverse range of architectural influences, including ancient Egyptian, Byzantine, and Islamic styles. This blend of architectural traditions resulted in a unique and complex architectural landscape that continues to shape the city of Cairo today.

In conclusion, the development of al-Fustat was a significant chapter in the architectural history of Cairo. Its strategic location, architectural landmarks, and diverse architectural influences have all contributed to the city's rich architectural heritage. As we continue to explore the architectural evolution of Cairo, we will see how these early developments have shaped the city into what it is today.

#### 1.2c The Decline of al-Fustat

The decline of al-Fustat, once the thriving capital of Islamic Egypt, began in the 10th century CE. This decline was largely due to the shifting political and economic dynamics of the time. The Abbasid caliphate, which had established al-Fustat as its provincial capital, was facing internal strife and external threats. This led to a gradual migration of the population to the nearby settlement of al-Qata'i, which was better protected and had access to more fertile land.

The decline of al-Fustat was also marked by the abandonment of its grand architectural landmarks. The Mosque of Amr Ibn al-As, which had been expanded and renovated in the 8th century, was left to ruin. The Nilometer, once a crucial tool for measuring the annual flooding of the Nile, was also abandoned and left to decay. These abandoned structures serve as a stark reminder of the city's past glory and the rapid pace of its decline.

The decline of al-Fustat also saw a shift in the architectural style of the city. The blend of ancient Egyptian, Byzantine, and Islamic styles that had characterized al-Fustat gave way to a more uniform Islamic architecture. This was likely due to the increasing influence of the Abbasid caliphate, which had a strong preference for Islamic architecture.

Despite its decline, al-Fustat continues to hold a significant place in the architectural history of Cairo. Its abandoned structures and architectural landmarks serve as a testament to the city's rich architectural heritage. They also provide valuable insights into the architectural styles and techniques of the Islamic world during this period.

The Mosque of Amr Ibn al-As, the oldest mosque in Egypt and Africa, was a significant architectural landmark in the early Islamic period. While the current structure is a later expansion, it still retains some of the original features, including the minaret and the courtyard. The mosque was built using a combination of mud brick and stone, with a simple rectangular layout. The interior was decorated with geometric patterns and calligraphy, reflecting the early Islamic artistic traditions.

The governor's residence, also known as the Qasr al-Shamsi, was another prominent structure in al-Fustat. It was built using a combination of mud brick and stone, with a rectangular layout and a central courtyard. The residence was decorated with intricate geometric patterns and calligraphy, reflecting the early Islamic artistic traditions.

The early Islamic architecture in al-Fustat also included a number of public buildings, such as markets, bathhouses, and caravanserais. These buildings were built using a combination of mud brick and stone, with simple rectangular layouts and decorative elements. The markets were covered with vaulted roofs, while the bathhouses and caravanserais were built around a central courtyard.

The early Islamic architecture in al-Fustat was not only influenced by the cultural traditions of the time, but also by the practical needs of the settlement. The use of mud brick and stone was a response to the local climate and resources, while the simple layouts and decorative elements were a reflection of the early Islamic aesthetic.

In conclusion, the early Islamic architecture in al-Fustat was a blend of ancient Egyptian and Byzantine styles, reflecting the cultural influences of the time. The settlement's strategic location and architectural styles influenced the development of later structures in Cairo, laying the foundation for the city's architectural history.

#### 1.2c The Legacy of al-Fustat

The legacy of al-Fustat extends beyond the physical structures and architectural styles it left behind. The settlement's strategic location and architectural innovations had a profound impact on the development of Cairo and the surrounding region.

The choice of location for al-Fustat, next to the ancient city of Babylon Fortress, was a strategic decision that set the stage for the city's future development. The settlement's proximity to the Nile River provided a vital source of water, making it a suitable location for a permanent settlement. This strategic decision also allowed for easy defense and control of the surrounding area, further solidifying the settlement's importance.

The architectural innovations introduced in al-Fustat also had a lasting impact on the region.

#### 1.2c The Growth and Development of al-Fustat

The growth and development of al-Fustat was a complex process that was shaped by a variety of factors, including political, economic, and cultural influences. The settlement was founded in the early 7th century CE by the Arab conqueror Amr ibn al-As, who established it as the capital of the newly conquered Egyptian territory.

The early growth of al-Fustat was characterized by a rapid expansion, as the settlement became a major center of trade and commerce. The settlement was strategically located on the Nile River, providing easy access to the fertile lands of the Nile Valley and the Red Sea. This led to the development of a thriving market, attracting merchants from across the Mediterranean and the Middle East.

The growth of al-Fustat also led to the development of a complex social structure. The settlement was home to a diverse population, including Arabs, Berbers, and local Egyptians. This diversity was reflected in the architecture of the settlement, with the mosque and governor's residence being the most prominent structures. The mosque, built in the early Islamic style, was a symbol of the settlement's religious identity, while the governor's residence reflected the political power of the Arab conquerors.

The growth and development of al-Fustat were not without challenges. The settlement was repeatedly attacked by the Byzantines, who saw it as a threat to their control of the region. However, the settlement's strategic location and strong defenses allowed it to withstand these attacks and continue to grow.

In the late 8th century, al-Fustat was replaced as the capital of Egypt by the new settlement of al-Qata'i, founded by the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun. However, al-Fustat continued to thrive as a major center of trade and commerce, and its influence can still be seen in the architecture of Cairo today.

The growth and development of al-Fustat provide valuable insights into the early history of Cairo and the evolution of Egyptian architecture. The settlement's blend of ancient Egyptian and Byzantine styles, as well as its diverse social structure, laid the foundation for the complex and diverse architecture of Cairo that we see today. 





#### 1.2d The Decline of al-Fustat

The decline of al-Fustat, the ancient capital of Egypt, was a gradual process that began in the 12th century CE. This decline was primarily due to a combination of political instability, economic factors, and the rise of new urban centers.

The political instability in al-Fustat began in the mid-12th century when the caliph of Egypt was a teenager, and the true power was held by the vizier, Shawar. Shawar was involved in extensive political intrigue, playing off the Crusaders and the forces of the Nur al-Din from Syria against each other. However, his tactics ultimately failed when the Christian King Amalric I of Jerusalem, with the support of the Crusaders, launched a successful attack on Egypt.

The destruction of al-Fustat by the Crusaders in 1168 marked a significant turning point in the city's history. The city was burned to the ground, and its inhabitants were slaughtered. This event not only devastated the city but also marked the end of the Fatimid dynasty, which had ruled Egypt for over two centuries.

The decline of al-Fustat was further exacerbated by economic factors. The city had been a major center of trade and commerce, but the destruction of its infrastructure and the loss of its population made it difficult for the city to recover. The center of government was permanently moved to nearby Cairo, which was able to unite the two cities into one through the construction of the Cairo Citadel.

The decline of al-Fustat also led to a shift in the architectural style of the city. The ancient mosque and governor's residence, which had been symbols of the city's religious and political power, were no longer maintained. The city was left with only a few remaining structures, including the al-Aqmar Mosque, which is considered one of the oldest surviving mosques in Cairo.

In conclusion, the decline of al-Fustat was a complex process that was influenced by a variety of factors. The city's political instability, economic decline, and the rise of new urban centers all contributed to its eventual demise. However, the city's rich history and architectural legacy continue to be studied and appreciated by historians and architects today.

Egyptian architecture is a fascinating and complex field that has evolved over thousands of years. From the ancient pyramids to the modern skyscrapers, the architecture of Egypt tells a story of the country's rich history and cultural heritage. In this section, we will explore the evolution of Egyptian architecture, from its early beginnings to the present day.

#### The Early Beginnings of Egyptian Architecture

The earliest known examples of Egyptian architecture date back to the Predynastic period (before 3000 BC). During this time, the people of Egypt were primarily hunter-gatherers and lived in simple mud huts. However, as the country began to develop and unify under a single ruler, the need for more complex and durable structures arose.

The first major architectural innovation in Egypt was the development of the mastaba, a rectangular structure with a flat roof. These were typically built of sun-dried bricks and were used as tombs for the elite. The earliest known mastaba dates back to around 3000 BC and is located in the necropolis of Abydos.

#### The Rise of the Pyramids

Around 2600 BC, the Egyptians began to experiment with a new type of architecture - the pyramid. The earliest pyramids were simple, flat-topped structures made of mud bricks. However, as the technology and techniques for building pyramids evolved, they became larger and more complex.

The most famous example of Egyptian pyramids is the Giza Plateau, home to the Great Pyramid of Giza, the oldest and largest of the three pyramids. Built around 2500 BC, the Great Pyramid is a marvel of ancient engineering and is still one of the seven wonders of the world.

#### The Influence of Greek and Roman Architecture

As Egypt became a part of the Roman Empire, Greek and Roman architectural styles began to influence Egyptian architecture. The Ptolemaic dynasty (305-30 BC) in particular was known for its Hellenistic architecture, which combined elements of Greek and Egyptian styles.

One of the most notable examples of this is the Temple of Hathor at Dendera, built during the Ptolemaic period. The temple is a blend of Greek and Egyptian styles, with columns and capitals inspired by Greek architecture and hieroglyphic inscriptions and reliefs typical of Egyptian architecture.

#### The Islamic Influence

In the 7th century AD, Egypt was conquered by the Islamic Caliphate, and Islamic architecture began to dominate the country. The most notable example of Islamic architecture in Egypt is the Al-Azhar Mosque, built in 970 AD. The mosque is a masterpiece of Islamic architecture, with its intricate geometric patterns and calligraphy.

#### Modern Architecture

In the 19th and 20th centuries, Egypt saw a rapid modernization and urbanization, leading to the development of modern architecture. The country's first skyscraper, the Cairo Tower, was built in 1961 and stands at 187 meters tall.

Today, modern architecture in Egypt is a blend of traditional and contemporary styles, with many buildings incorporating elements of both. The Cairo Opera House, built in 1988, is a prime example of this, with its modernist design and traditional Islamic influences.

### Conclusion

The evolution of Egyptian architecture is a fascinating journey through the country's rich history and cultural heritage. From the simple mud huts of the Predynastic period to the grand pyramids and temples of the ancient Egyptians, the influence of Greek and Roman architecture, and the modern skyscrapers of today, each era has left its mark on the architecture of Egypt.

However, in the 9th century, the Tulunids, a Turkic dynasty, gained control of Egypt and established their capital in Cairo. This marked a significant shift in the city's architecture, as the Tulunids brought with them their own unique architectural style.

Throughout this chapter, we will delve into the history of Cairo during the Abbasid and Tulunid periods, exploring the various architectural styles and techniques used in the city's buildings.

### Section: 2.1 The Foundation of Fatimid al-Qahira:

The Fatimid dynasty, founded by the Isma'ili Shia, was a powerful and influential dynasty that ruled over Egypt and parts of North Africa from the 10th to 12th centuries. The Fatimids were known for their architectural achievements, particularly in the city of Cairo, which they renamed al-Qahira (The Victorious).

#### 2.1a The Fatimid Dynasty

The Fatimid dynasty was founded by the Isma'ili Shia, a branch of Shia Islam that believed in the imamate of the Fatimids. The dynasty was established by the Fatimid Imam-Caliph al-Mahdi, who claimed descent from the Prophet Muhammad through his daughter Fatima and her husband Ali. The Fatimids were able to establish their rule in North Africa through a series of military campaigns and alliances with local Berber tribes.

The Fatimids were known for their architectural achievements, particularly in the city of Cairo. The city was founded by the Fatimids in 969 CE, and it quickly became a center of trade, culture, and learning. The Fatimids built numerous palaces, mosques, and other structures in Cairo, showcasing their wealth and power.

One of the most notable architectural achievements of the Fatimids was the construction of the Al-Azhar Mosque, which is considered one of the oldest and most important mosques in the world. The mosque was built in 970 CE and is still in use today. It is known for its beautiful architecture, with a grand courtyard, minarets, and a stunning interior.

The Fatimids also built the Al-Hakim Mosque, which was named after the Fatimid Caliph al-Hakim. The mosque was built in 1013 CE and is known for its unique architecture, with a circular design and a dome that is said to have been inspired by the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem.

In addition to their architectural achievements, the Fatimids were also known for their patronage of the arts and sciences.

### Section: 2.2 Fatimid Mosques in Cairo:

The Fatimid dynasty, which ruled Egypt from 969 to 1171, left a lasting legacy on the city of Cairo. Their architectural contributions, particularly in the realm of mosque design, have been studied and admired for centuries. In this section, we will explore the Fatimid mosques of Cairo, focusing on the Al-Azhar Mosque and the Mosque of the Qarafa.

#### 2.2a The al-Azhar Mosque

The Al-Azhar Mosque, located in the heart of Cairo, is one of the oldest and most important mosques in the world. It was commissioned by the Fatimid Caliph al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah in 970, and is named after Fatimah, the daughter of Muhammad. The mosque was a symbol of the Fatimids' power and piety, and it remains a center of Islamic learning to this day.

The original design of the Al-Azhar Mosque was similar to the Great Mosque of Mahdiya, with a projecting entrance and an open central courtyard surrounded by three arcades. The layout was similar to the Kairouan and Samarra mosques, with round arches on pre-Islamic columns and Corinthian capitals. The mosque had three domes, two at the corners of the qibla wall and one over the prayer niche, and a small brick minaret over the main entrance. The gallery around the courtyard was supported by a series of columns, and the prayer hall, which had the domes built over it, had five more rows of five pillars.

Minor alterations were made by the caliphs al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah in 1009 and al-Amir bi-Ahkami l-Lah in 1125. However, the most significant changes were made by the caliph al-Hafiz (1129–1149), who added a fourth arcade with keel arches and a dome with elaborate carved stucco decorations in front of the transept. Since then, the mosque has been greatly enlarged and modified over the years, with the original building little remaining other than the arcades and some of the stucco decoration.

The Al-Azhar Mosque is a testament to the Fatimids' architectural prowess and their commitment to Islamic learning. Its grandeur and beauty have been admired for centuries, and it continues to be a symbol of Islamic culture in Cairo.

#### 2.2b The Mosque of the Qarafa

The Mosque of the Qarafa, located in the southern part of Cairo, is another important Fatimid mosque. It was built in 976 by two noblewomen, and is described in detail by the historian al-Quda'i, who died around 1062–1065. The mosque had a portal that projected from the wall, and its design was unique and intricate.

The Mosque of the Qarafa is a testament to the Fatimids' architectural diversity and their willingness to experiment with new designs. Its detailed description by al-Quda'i provides valuable insights into the mosque's architecture and design, and it remains a popular tourist attraction in Cairo.

#### 2.2c The Legacy of Fatimid Mosques

The Fatimid mosques of Cairo, particularly the Al-Azhar Mosque and the Mosque of the Qarafa, have left a lasting legacy on the city's architectural landscape. Their grandeur, beauty, and architectural diversity have been studied and admired for centuries, and they continue to inspire modern architects and designers.

The Fatimid mosques are a testament to the dynasty's commitment to Islamic learning and their architectural prowess. They are a symbol of the Fatimids' power and piety, and their legacy continues to shape the architectural landscape of Cairo to this day.




#### 2.2b The al-Hakim Mosque

The Al-Hakim Mosque, named after the Fatimid Caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, is another significant architectural achievement of the Fatimids in Cairo. Construction of the mosque began in 990 under Caliph al-Aziz, but it was not completed until 1003 under Caliph al-Hakim. The mosque is located south of the Al-Azhar Mosque, and it is one of the oldest surviving Fatimid structures in Cairo.

The Al-Hakim Mosque is an irregular rectangle with four arcades that surround the courtyard. The arches are pointed and rest on brick piers, similar to the Ibn Tulun Mosque. The mosque resembles the Al-Azhar Mosque in having three domes along the qibla wall, one at each corner and one over the "mihrab". However, unlike the Al-Azhar Mosque, the Al-Hakim Mosque has two stone minarets at the corners of the stone façade, which has a monumental projecting portal.

The Al-Hakim Mosque differs from the Al-Azhar and Ibn Tulun mosques in having two stone minarets at the corners of the stone façade, which has a monumental projecting portal like the Mosque of Mahdiya. The façade is elaborately decorated with inscriptions, blind arches, "muqarnas", and other symbols, making it a notable example of Fatimid architecture.

The mosque was badly damaged in the 1303 earthquake, and suffered further damage in later years. By the nineteenth century it was ruined, but it was heavily reconstructed in the 1980s. The Al-Hakim Mosque is a testament to the Fatimids' architectural prowess and their commitment to Islamic learning, and it continues to be a popular destination for tourists and locals alike.

#### 2.2c The al-Aqmar Mosque

The Al-Aqmar Mosque, located on al-Muizz Street, north of Bayn al-Qasrayn, is another significant Fatimid structure in Cairo. It was built in 1125 during the caliphate of Imam Al-Amir bi-Ahkam Allah, and it is named after the Arabic word for "crescent moon". The mosque is notable for its elaborate façade, which is decorated with inscriptions, blind arches, "muqarnas", and other symbols.

The Al-Aqmar Mosque is the first mosque in Cairo to have a façade decorated with "muqarnas", a complex geometric design that is a hallmark of Fatimid architecture. The façade is also adorned with inscriptions in Kufic script, which are believed to be the work of the renowned calligrapher Ibn Muqlah. The mosque's minaret, which is located at the corner of the façade, is decorated with blind arches and "muqarnas".

The interior of the Al-Aqmar Mosque is equally impressive. The prayer hall is crossed by a transept at right angles to the qibla, similar to the Al-Hakim Mosque. The central aisle leading to the prayer niche is wide and tall, borrowing from the Mahdiya mosque's design. The mosque has three domes along the qibla wall, one at each corner and one over the "mihrab".

The Al-Aqmar Mosque is a testament to the Fatimids' architectural prowess and their commitment to Islamic learning. It continues to be a popular destination for tourists and locals alike, and it is a significant example of Fatimid architecture in Cairo.




#### 2.2c The al-Aqmar Mosque

The Al-Aqmar Mosque, located on al-Muizz Street, north of Bayn al-Qasrayn, is another significant Fatimid structure in Cairo. It was built in 1125 during the caliphate of Imam Al-Amir bi-Ahkam Allah, and it is named after the Arabic word for "crescent moon". The mosque is notable for its elaborate façade, which is decorated with inscriptions, blind arches, and "muqarnas". The mosque is also known for its minaret, which was added later by the Mamluk amir Yalbugha al-Salimi in 1393 or 1397.

The minaret is built of brick covered in stucco, topped with stone muqarnas, convex molding below, and a band of carved arabesques interrupted by openwork bosses in the middle. The upper part of the minaret by al-Salimi fell in 1412 and was replaced by a cylindrical fixture. The lower part of the minaret, however, survives and is a notable example of Mamluk architecture.

The Al-Aqmar Mosque is an irregular rectangle with four arcades that surround the courtyard. The arches are pointed and rest on brick piers, similar to the Ibn Tulun Mosque. The mosque resembles the Al-Azhar Mosque in having three domes along the qibla wall, one at each corner and one over the "mihrab". However, unlike the Al-Azhar Mosque, the Al-Aqmar Mosque has two stone minarets at the corners of the stone façade, which has a monumental projecting portal.

The Al-Aqmar Mosque differs from the Al-Azhar and Ibn Tulun mosques in having two stone minarets at the corners of the stone façade, which has a monumental projecting portal. The façade is elaborately decorated with inscriptions, blind arches, "muqarnas", and other symbols, making it a notable example of Fatimid architecture.

The mosque was badly damaged in the 1303 earthquake, and suffered further damage in later years. By the nineteenth century it was ruined, but it was heavily reconstructed in the 1980s. The Al-Aqmar Mosque is a testament to the Fatimids' architectural prowess and their commitment to Islamic learning, and it continues to be a popular destination for tourists and locals alike.




#### 2.2d The Legacy of Fatimid Mosque Architecture

The Fatimid dynasty, which ruled Egypt from 969 to 1171, left a lasting legacy on the architectural landscape of Cairo. Their mosques, in particular, are a testament to their architectural prowess and their commitment to Islamic learning. The Fatimid mosques in Cairo are characterized by their intricate decoration, elaborate façades, and innovative architectural features.

The Fatimid mosques were built to reflect the Shiite doctrine of the dynasty. The mosques were often used for royal ceremonial purposes, and their plan and decoration reflected this. The characteristic architectural styles of Fatimid mosques include portals that protrude from the wall, domes in front of mihrabs and qibla walls, porches and arcades with keel-shaped arches supported by a series of columns, façade ornamentation with iconographic inscriptions and stucco decorations.

The mosques followed the hypostyle plan, where a central courtyard was surrounded by arcades with their roofs usually supported by keel arches, initially resting on columns with Corinthian capitals. The arches held inscription bands, a style that is unique to Fatimid architecture. The later columns often had a bell-shaped capital with the same shape mirrored to form the base. The prayer niche was architecturally more elaborate, with features such as a dome or transept. The Fatimid architects built modified versions of Coptic keel-arched niches with radiating fluted hoods, and later extended the concept to fluted domes.

The woodwork of the doors and interiors of the buildings was often finely carved. Early Fatimid mosques such as the Great Mosque of Mahdiya and the mosque of the Qarafa did not have a minaret. This was due to the Fatimids' rejection of such structures, which were seen as unnecessary innovations that were symbolically associated with Abbasid architecture at the time. Later mosques built in Egypt and in Ifriqiya incorporated brick minarets, which were probably part of their original designs. These were derived from early Abbasid forms of minaret.

Minarets later evolved to the characteristic "mabkhara" (incense burner) shape, where a lower rectangular shaft supported an octagon section that was capped by a ribbed helmet. Almost all of Cairo's Fatimid minarets were destroyed by an earthquake in 1303. Some "floating" mosques were located above shops, a unique architectural feature that is still visible in some parts of Cairo today.

The Fatimid mosques in Cairo are a testament to the architectural prowess of the Fatimid dynasty. Their innovative architectural features and elaborate decoration have left a lasting legacy on the architectural landscape of Cairo. The study of Fatimid mosque architecture provides valuable insights into the historical evolution of Cairo and the architectural styles of the Islamic world.

#### 2.3a The Decline of the Fatimids

The Fatimid dynasty, which had ruled Egypt for over two centuries, began to decline in the late 11th century. This decline was marked by a series of political and military setbacks, as well as internal power struggles.

#### 2.3a.1 Political and Military Setbacks

The Fatimids had been able to maintain their power in Egypt through a combination of military might and political astuteness. However, in the late 11th century, they began to face a series of political and military setbacks that undermined their authority.

One of the key factors in the Fatimids' decline was the rise of the Seljuk Turks, a nomadic tribe that had converted to Islam and had begun to expand their empire in the Middle East. The Seljuk Turks posed a direct threat to the Fatimids, as they sought to expand their empire into Egypt. In 1068, the Seljuk leader Malik Shah I invaded Egypt, but was defeated by the Fatimids. However, this was only a temporary setback, and the Seljuk Turks continued to press their advance into Egypt.

In 1073, the Fatimids suffered a major defeat at the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah, where they were defeated by the Seljuk Turks. This defeat marked a significant turning point in the Fatimids' decline, as it not only weakened their military power, but also undermined their political authority.

#### 2.3a.2 Internal Power Struggles

In addition to external threats, the Fatimids also faced internal power struggles that contributed to their decline. The Fatimids had always been a dynasty of Shiite Muslims, who believed in the divine right of the Imam to rule. However, as the Fatimids' power began to wane, there were increasing disputes over who should be the rightful Imam.

The Fatimids had traditionally recognized the Ismaili branch of Shiite Islam as the true faith. However, in the late 11th century, a rival branch of Shiite Islam, the Zaydi, began to gain influence among the Fatimids' subjects. This led to a power struggle between the Ismaili and Zaydi factions, which further weakened the Fatimids' authority.

#### 2.3a.3 The End of the Fatimids

The Fatimids' decline culminated in their final defeat in 1171, when the Ayyubid leader Saladin captured Cairo and ended Fatimid rule in Egypt. This marked the end of a dynasty that had ruled Egypt for over two centuries, and marked a significant turning point in the history of Egypt and the Middle East.

The Fatimids' legacy, however, lives on in the architectural and cultural heritage they left behind. Their mosques, palaces, and other buildings are still standing today, and their influence can be seen in the architecture and culture of modern Egypt. Despite their decline, the Fatimids played a crucial role in the history of Egypt, and their legacy continues to shape the city of Cairo to this day.

#### 2.3b The Fatimid Legacy

The Fatimid dynasty, despite its decline, left behind a rich legacy that continues to shape the architectural and cultural landscape of Egypt. This legacy is evident in the numerous architectural marvels that the Fatimids built during their reign, particularly in Cairo.

#### 2.3b.1 Fatimid Architecture

The Fatimids were known for their grandiose architectural projects, which were designed to showcase their power and wealth. One of the most notable examples is the Al-Azhar Mosque, which was built in 970 CE by the Fatimid caliph al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah. The mosque is considered one of the oldest and most important Islamic monuments in Egypt, and its architectural style has been emulated by many subsequent mosques in the region.

The Fatimids also built a number of palaces and fortresses, many of which are still standing today. These include the Qasr al-Shama'a, the Qasr al-Saghir, and the Qasr al-Khayma, all of which are located in Cairo. These palaces are notable for their intricate decoration and their use of innovative architectural techniques, such as the use of stucco and wood carving.

#### 2.3b.2 Fatimid Art and Culture

The Fatimids were also patrons of the arts, and their reign saw a flourishing of literary and artistic activity. The Fatimids were particularly known for their calligraphy, which was used to decorate their buildings and monuments. The famous Fatimid Kufic script, with its intricate interlacing patterns, is a prime example of this.

The Fatimids also sponsored a number of literary works, including historical chronicles, philosophical treatises, and religious texts. These works have been preserved in the Fatimid libraries, which were among the largest and most important libraries of the medieval period.

#### 2.3b.3 The Fatimid Legacy in Modern Egypt

The Fatimid legacy continues to shape the architectural and cultural landscape of modern Egypt. The Fatimid monuments, such as the Al-Azhar Mosque and the Fatimid palaces, are still visited by millions of tourists each year. The Fatimid architectural techniques and decorative styles have also been revived in modern architecture, particularly in the construction of mosques and other religious buildings.

The Fatimid legacy is also evident in the cultural traditions of modern Egypt. The Fatimids were known for their love of music and poetry, and these traditions continue to be celebrated in modern Egypt. The Fatimid legacy also includes the Ismaili branch of Shiite Islam, which continues to be practiced by a small but influential minority in Egypt.

In conclusion, the Fatimids left behind a rich and enduring legacy that continues to shape the architectural and cultural landscape of Egypt. Their architectural marvels, artistic achievements, and cultural traditions serve as a testament to their power and influence, and their legacy continues to be celebrated in modern Egypt.

#### 2.3c The Ayyubid Period

The Ayyubid period, named after its founder Saladin, was a significant era in the history of Egypt. It marked the transition from Fatimid rule to the Mamluks, and saw the rise of the Ayyubid dynasty, which ruled Egypt from 1171 to 1250.

#### 2.3c.1 The Rise of the Ayyubids

The Ayyubids were a Sunni Muslim dynasty that originated from Kurdish and Turkish tribal confederations. They were originally vassals of the Seljuk Empire, but after the Seljuk defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, they began to assert their independence. The Ayyubids first came to Egypt in 1164, when Saladin, the founder of the dynasty, was sent by the Seljuk sultan to suppress a rebellion led by the Fatimid vizier Shawar. Saladin successfully suppressed the rebellion and was rewarded with the governorship of Egypt.

#### 2.3c.2 The Ayyubid Conquest of Egypt

In 1169, Saladin returned to Egypt and launched a full-scale invasion. The Fatimid caliph al-Adid, who had been deposed by Shawar, fled to Cairo, but the city fell to Saladin after a siege of three months. The Fatimid dynasty was thus brought to an end, and the Ayyubids established their rule in Egypt.

#### 2.3c.3 The Ayyubid Legacy

The Ayyubid period saw a significant shift in the architectural and cultural landscape of Egypt. The Ayyubids were Sunni Muslims, unlike the Shiite Fatimids, and this led to a shift in the architectural styles and cultural traditions of Egypt. The Ayyubids built a number of mosques and other religious buildings, many of which are still standing today. These include the Mosque of Saladin in Cairo, which is considered one of the most important Islamic monuments in Egypt.

The Ayyubids also sponsored a number of literary and artistic works, including the famous Mamluk manuscripts, which are known for their intricate illustrations and calligraphy. The Ayyubid period also saw the rise of the Mamluk sultanate, which ruled Egypt from 1250 to 1517. The Mamluk sultans were originally slaves, but they rose to power under the Ayyubids and established their own dynasty after the fall of the Ayyubids.

In conclusion, the Ayyubid period was a significant era in the history of Egypt, marked by the rise of the Ayyubid dynasty and the transition from Fatimid rule to the Mamluks. The Ayyubids left behind a rich legacy of architectural and cultural achievements that continue to shape the landscape of modern Egypt.

### Conclusion

The Abbasids and Tulunids played a significant role in the architectural evolution of Cairo. Their rule saw the rise of grandiose structures that reflected their power and wealth, while also incorporating elements of the local culture. The Abbasids, with their roots in the Abbasid Caliphate, brought with them a rich architectural tradition that was evident in their buildings in Cairo. The Tulunids, on the other hand, were known for their patronage of the arts and architecture, particularly in the field of Islamic architecture.

The architectural legacy of the Abbasids and Tulunids in Cairo is a testament to their rule and their contribution to the city's architectural landscape. Their buildings, many of which still stand today, are a reminder of the grandeur and sophistication of their time. The architectural styles they introduced, such as the Abbasid architecture and Tulunid architecture, have had a lasting impact on the city's architectural heritage.

In conclusion, the Abbasids and Tulunids played a crucial role in the architectural evolution of Cairo. Their rule saw the rise of grandiose structures that reflected their power and wealth, while also incorporating elements of the local culture.

## Chapter 3: The Mamluks

### Introduction

The Mamluks, a dynasty of slave soldiers, ruled Egypt from 1250 to 1517. Their rule was marked by a period of architectural renaissance, as they built grand structures that reflected their power and wealth. This chapter, "The Mamluks," delves into the architectural legacy of this dynasty, exploring how their rule shaped the architectural landscape of Cairo.

The Mamluks were known for their patronage of the arts and architecture. They built a number of mosques, palaces, and other structures that are still standing today. These buildings are not only important historical relics, but also significant examples of Islamic architecture. The Mamluks incorporated elements of local architecture into their buildings, creating a unique architectural style that is distinctly their own.

This chapter will explore the architectural legacy of the Mamluks in detail. We will examine the key features of Mamluk architecture, including its design principles, materials, and techniques. We will also look at some of the most notable Mamluk buildings in Cairo, such as the Sultan Hassan Mosque and the Citadel of Cairo.

The Mamluks played a crucial role in the architectural evolution of Cairo. Their buildings not only stand as testaments to their power and wealth, but also as important examples of Islamic architecture. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the architectural legacy of the Mamluks, shedding light on the rich architectural history of Cairo.




#### 2.3b The Architecture of the Late Fatimid Period

The Late Fatimid Period (1074-1171) marked a significant shift in the architectural style of Cairo. The Fatimids, who had been ruling Egypt since the 10th century, had a profound influence on the city's architecture, particularly in the areas of mosque design and urban planning.

#### 2.3b.1 Mosque Design

The Fatimids were known for their grand mosques, which were often built as a symbol of their power and wealth. The Great Mosque of Mahdia, built in the early 10th century, is a prime example of Fatimid mosque design. The mosque features a hypostyle prayer hall with a roughly square courtyard, and a monumental portal projecting from the wall. This design was unique at the time and may have been inspired by ancient Roman triumphal arches.

Another notable Fatimid mosque is the Al-Azhar Mosque in Cairo, which was built in the late 10th century. The mosque is known for its intricate mosaic work and its minaret, which was one of the earliest in Egypt. The minaret was a significant departure from the Fatimids' earlier rejection of such structures as unnecessary innovations.

#### 2.3b.2 Urban Planning

The Fatimids also had a significant impact on the urban planning of Cairo. The city was divided into two main districts: the residential district of al-Qata'i and the commercial district of al-Khalij. The Fatimids also built a number of palaces and public buildings, including the Palace of al-Mu'izz and the Palace of al-Qadir.

The Palace of al-Mu'izz, built in the late 10th century, was a grand structure that featured a large courtyard, a mosque, and a number of private apartments. The palace was known for its intricate mosaic work and its extensive use of water, with a large pool in the center of the courtyard. This use of water was reminiscent of earlier Aghlabid palaces at nearby Raqqada and of contemporary palaces at Madinat al-Zahra, but not of older Umayyad and Abbasid palaces further east.

#### 2.3b.3 Decline of Fatimid Architecture

The Late Fatimid Period marked a decline in Fatimid architecture. The Seljuk Turks, who had been expanding their empire into Egypt, posed a significant threat to the Fatimids' power and authority. This led to a decrease in building activity and a shift in architectural style. The Fatimids' grand mosques and palaces were replaced by simpler structures, and the use of water in architecture became less prevalent.

Despite this decline, the Fatimids' architectural legacy in Cairo remains a testament to their power and wealth. The city's grand mosques and palaces continue to stand as symbols of the Fatimids' influence on the city's architecture.

#### 2.3c The Fall of the Fatimids

The Fatimid dynasty, which had ruled Egypt for over two centuries, came to an end in 1171 with the conquest of Cairo by the Kurdish Ayyubid leader Saladin. This marked the end of the Fatimid Caliphate and the beginning of a new era in Egyptian history.

#### 2.3c.1 The Rise of the Ayyubids

The Ayyubids were a Kurdish dynasty that had been ruling Syria since the late 11th century. In 1169, Saladin, the leader of the Ayyubids, began his campaign to conquer Egypt. He first captured the port city of Alexandria, and then moved on to Cairo. The Fatimid Caliph al-Adid, who had been ruling Egypt since 1160, was unable to resist Saladin's forces and surrendered the city without a fight.

#### 2.3c.2 The Fall of the Fatimids

The fall of the Fatimids marked the end of a long and influential dynasty. The Fatimids had been ruling Egypt since the 10th century, and their rule had been marked by a series of architectural and cultural achievements. The Fatimids were known for their grand mosques, their extensive use of water in architecture, and their urban planning.

The Fatimids' architectural legacy can still be seen in the city of Cairo today. The Great Mosque of Mahdia, the Al-Azhar Mosque, and the Palace of al-Mu'izz are all examples of Fatimid architecture that have survived to the present day. These structures serve as a testament to the Fatimids' architectural achievements and their influence on the city's design.

#### 2.3c.3 The Impact of the Fatimids' Fall

The fall of the Fatimids had a significant impact on the city of Cairo and the region as a whole. The Ayyubids, who were Sunni Muslims, brought with them a different cultural and religious perspective. This led to a shift in the city's architecture, with the construction of new mosques and public buildings in a different style.

The Fatimids' fall also marked the end of the Fatimid Caliphate, which had been a major political and religious power in the region. This led to a power vacuum that was filled by various dynasties, including the Ayyubids, the Mamluks, and the Ottomans.

In conclusion, the fall of the Fatimids marked a significant turning point in the history of Cairo and Egypt. It brought an end to a long and influential dynasty and led to a shift in the city's architecture and culture. The Fatimids' architectural legacy, however, continues to be a defining feature of the city's design.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the architectural evolution of Cairo during the Abbasid and Tulunid periods. We have seen how these two dynasties, while sharing similar architectural styles, also had their own unique characteristics. The Abbasids, known for their grandeur and opulence, built structures that were grandiose and ornate, while the Tulunids, with their roots in the military, favored more practical and utilitarian designs.

We have also delved into the historical context of these periods, understanding how political, social, and economic factors influenced the architectural choices made. The Abbasids, for instance, were known for their patronage of the arts and sciences, which led to the construction of grand mosques, palaces, and public buildings. On the other hand, the Tulunids, who were more focused on maintaining their power and control, built fortifications and military structures.

The architectural legacy of these two dynasties continues to shape the city of Cairo today. The grand mosques and palaces built by the Abbasids are still standing, testifying to their grandeur and opulence. The Tulunid fortifications, while modified over time, still serve as a reminder of their military prowess.

Their reign marked a significant period in the architectural evolution of Cairo, the capital city of Egypt. This chapter will delve into the architectural legacy of the Fatimids, exploring how their rule shaped the city's landscape and architecture.

The Fatimids were known for their patronage of the arts and sciences, and this is reflected in the architectural works they commissioned. Their buildings were characterized by a blend of Islamic and Byzantine influences, with a strong emphasis on symmetry and grandeur. The Fatimids also introduced new architectural elements, such as the use of mosaics and stucco, which became hallmarks of Fatimid architecture.

The Fatimids' architectural legacy is not just limited to their buildings. They also made significant contributions to urban planning, transforming Cairo into a bustling metropolis with a well-organized street system and a network of canals. The Fatimids' architectural achievements not only shaped the physical appearance of Cairo but also had a profound impact on the city's social and cultural life.

In this chapter, we will explore the key architectural works of the Fatimids, including their palaces, mosques, and public buildings.

### Subsection: 2.3c The End of the Fatimid Dynasty

The Fatimid dynasty, which had ruled Egypt and parts of North Africa for over two centuries, came to an end in 1171 with the death of the last Fatimid caliph, al-Adid. This marked the end of a period of significant architectural and cultural development in Cairo, as the Fatimids had been instrumental in shaping the city's architecture and urban planning.

#### 2.3c.1 The Fall of the Fatimids

The Fatimids had been facing increasing challenges to their rule in the late 11th and early 12th centuries. The Seljuk Turks, who had taken control of much of the Middle East, posed a significant threat to the Fatimids' territories in Syria and Palestine. In 1073, the Seljuk leader Malik Shah captured Aleppo, a major Fatimid stronghold, and in 1074, he captured Damascus. This marked a significant loss of territory for the Fatimids.

In Egypt, the Fatimids faced challenges from both the Seljuk Turks and the Crusaders. The Seljuk leader Tutush I captured Cairo in 1067, but was forced to withdraw by the Fatimids' Kurdish general, Badr al-Jamali. However, Tutush's brother, Duqaq, captured Cairo again in 1073, and this time, the Fatimids were unable to retake the city.

#### 2.3c.2 The Last Fatimid Caliph

The last Fatimid caliph, al-Adid, came to power in 1160 at the age of 11. His reign was marked by continued conflict with the Seljuk Turks and the Crusaders. In 1169, the Crusaders captured the Fatimid port city of Ascalon, cutting off the Fatimids' access to the Mediterranean Sea. This was a significant blow to the Fatimids' economy and power.

In 1171, al-Adid died without an heir, marking the end of the Fatimid dynasty. The Fatimids had been instrumental in shaping the architecture and urban planning of Cairo, and their loss marked a significant shift in the city's history.

#### 2.3c.3 The Legacy of the Fatimids

Despite their eventual downfall, the Fatimids left a lasting legacy in Cairo. Their grand mosques, palaces, and public buildings continue to stand today, providing a glimpse into the grandeur and power of the Fatimid empire. Their influence can also be seen in the architectural styles and techniques used in later periods, demonstrating the enduring impact of the Fatimids on Cairo's architecture.




### Subsection: 2.3d The Legacy of the Fatimids

The Fatimids left a lasting legacy in Cairo, both in terms of their architectural contributions and their impact on the city's urban planning. Their grand mosques, palaces, and other buildings continue to stand as testaments to their power and wealth. However, their legacy extends beyond just their physical contributions.

#### 2.3d.1 The Fatimids and Architecture

The Fatimids were known for their grandiose architectural projects. They built several mosques, including the Al-Azhar Mosque, which is considered one of the most important mosques in the world. The Fatimids also built several palaces, including the Al-Qahirah Palace and the Al-Mu'izz Palace, which were known for their intricate decorations and luxurious interiors.

The Fatimids also made significant contributions to the development of Islamic architecture. They introduced the use of brick and stone in their buildings, which was a departure from the traditional mud brick architecture of the time. They also incorporated elements of Persian and Byzantine architecture into their designs, creating a unique blend of styles that influenced later architects.

#### 2.3d.2 The Fatimids and Urban Planning

The Fatimids also had a significant impact on the urban planning of Cairo. They established the city as a center of trade and commerce, and their policies attracted merchants and artisans from all over the Islamic world. This led to the development of a bustling and diverse urban landscape, with markets, mosques, and other public spaces scattered throughout the city.

The Fatimids also implemented a system of land use regulations, which helped to organize and manage the city's growth. They established designated areas for residential, commercial, and agricultural use, and they also implemented building codes to ensure the safety and quality of structures in the city.

#### 2.3d.3 The Fatimids and Cultural Development

In addition to their architectural and urban planning contributions, the Fatimids also played a significant role in the cultural development of Cairo. They were patrons of the arts and sciences, and they attracted scholars, artists, and other intellectuals to the city. This led to the establishment of several important institutions, including the House of Wisdom, which was a center for learning and research.

The Fatimids also promoted the use of Arabic as a literary language, and they established the Al-Azhar University, which is considered one of the oldest universities in the world. These cultural contributions helped to shape the city's identity and continue to influence its cultural landscape today.

#### 2.3d.4 The Enduring Legacy of the Fatimids

The Fatimids may have been overthrown in 1171, but their legacy continues to shape Cairo's architecture, urban planning, and culture. Their grand mosques, palaces, and other buildings continue to stand as testaments to their power and wealth. Their contributions to architecture, urban planning, and culture have had a lasting impact on the city and its inhabitants.

### Subsection: 3.1a The Ayyubid Dynasty

The Ayyubid dynasty, also known as the Ayubbid dynasty, was a Sunni Muslim dynasty of Kurdish origin that ruled in Egypt and Syria from 1171 to 1250. The dynasty was founded by Saladin, a Kurdish general in the service of the Fatimid caliphate, who overthrew the Fatimids and established the Ayyubid sultanate. The Ayyubids were known for their patronage of architecture, particularly in the construction of mosques, madrasas, and mausoleums.

#### The Rise of the Ayyubid Dynasty

The Ayyubid dynasty rose to power during the 12th century, a time of political instability in the Middle East. The Fatimid caliphate, which had ruled Egypt since the 10th century, was in decline, and the Seljuk Turks, who had conquered much of the Middle East, were facing internal divisions. This power vacuum provided an opportunity for Saladin, a Kurdish general in the service of the Fatimids, to seize power.

In 1171, Saladin overthrew the Fatimids and established the Ayyubid sultanate. The Ayyubids were able to consolidate their power by taking advantage of the Seljuk civil war and expanding their territory to include Syria, Palestine, and parts of Anatolia.

#### The Ayyubid Architectural Legacy

The Ayyubid dynasty left a lasting architectural legacy in Cairo. The Ayyubids were known for their patronage of architecture, particularly in the construction of mosques, madrasas, and mausoleums. These structures not only served religious purposes but also showcased the Ayyubids' artistic and architectural prowess.

The Ayyubid architectural style was characterized by a blend of Seljuk and Fatimid elements. The Ayyubids incorporated elements of Seljuk architecture, such as the use of vaulted ceilings and geometric patterns, into their buildings. However, they also retained elements of Fatimid architecture, such as the use of domes and arches. This blend of styles set the stage for the subsequent Mamluk and Ottoman periods.

#### The Ayyubid Architectural Landscape of Cairo

The Ayyubid period was a time of great architectural innovation and development in Cairo. The Ayyubids constructed numerous mosques, madrasas, and mausoleums, many of which still stand today. These structures not only served religious purposes but also played a crucial role in shaping the architectural landscape of Cairo.

The Ayyubid's architectural legacy continues to shape the architectural landscape of Cairo to this day. The Ayyubid's architectural style, characterized by a blend of Seljuk and Fatimid elements, set the stage for the subsequent Mamluk and Ottoman periods. The Ayyubid's architectural legacy is a testament to their artistic and architectural prowess and their lasting impact on the city of Cairo.





### Subsection: 3.1b The Founding of the Citadel

The Citadel of Cairo, also known as the Cairo Citadel, is a medieval Islamic fortress located in Cairo, Egypt. It was founded by Saladin, the founder of the Ayyubid dynasty, in 1176. The Citadel was built on the site of the ancient Roman fortress of Babylon, which was later rebuilt by the Fatimids.

#### The Construction of the Citadel

The construction of the Citadel was a significant undertaking, requiring the mobilization of a large workforce and the transportation of building materials. The Ayyubids were known for their military prowess, and the Citadel served as a symbol of their power and control over the city.

The Citadel was built using a combination of stone and brick, with a thick outer wall and a series of internal courtyards. The design of the Citadel was influenced by both Seljuk and Fatimid architecture, reflecting the Ayyubids' heritage and their desire to establish a distinct architectural style.

#### The Role of the Citadel in Ayyubid Cairo

The Citadel played a crucial role in the political and social life of Ayyubid Cairo. It served as the seat of the Ayyubid sultans, who ruled from the Al-Qa'it Bay' Palace within the Citadel. The Citadel also housed the sultan's private apartments, the treasury, and the offices of the sultan's officials.

In addition to its political function, the Citadel also served as a center of religious and cultural life. The Citadel was home to several mosques, including the Mosque of Saladin and the Mosque of al-Mansur, as well as a madrasa and a mausoleum. These religious and educational institutions were important centers of learning and attracted scholars and students from all over the Islamic world.

#### The Citadel in the Ayyubid Architectural Legacy

The Citadel is a prime example of Ayyubid architecture, showcasing the blend of Seljuk and Fatimid elements that characterized the Ayyubid architectural style. The Citadel's design and construction techniques have been studied and replicated in later periods, contributing to its lasting architectural legacy.

The Citadel's architectural significance is further enhanced by its location. Perched on a hill overlooking the city, the Citadel offers a panoramic view of Cairo, providing a visual representation of the Ayyubids' power and control over the city.

In conclusion, the Citadel of Cairo is a testament to the Ayyubids' architectural prowess and their lasting impact on the city's architectural landscape. Its construction marked a significant shift in Cairo's architectural history, setting the stage for the subsequent Mamluk and Ottoman periods.

The Ayyubids were known for their military prowess and their eagerness to fortify their restoration of Sunni Islam, particularly in a previously Shia-dominated Egypt. This was evident in their construction of Sunni "madrasas" and their efforts to fortify the city of Cairo.

#### The City and the Citadel

The Ayyubids were responsible for a significant transformation of Cairo's urban landscape. They enclosed the city and al-Fustat within one city wall, a radical change from the previous Fatimid era. This was a strategic move, aimed at consolidating their power and control over the city. The Ayyubids also constructed the Cairo Citadel, a massive fortress that served as their seat of power and a symbol of their military might.

The Citadel was built on the site of the ancient Roman fortress of Babylon, which was later rebuilt by the Fatimids. The Ayyubids incorporated elements of both Seljuk and Fatimid architecture in their construction of the Citadel, reflecting their heritage and their desire to establish a distinct architectural style. The Citadel was built using a combination of stone and brick, with a thick outer wall and a series of internal courtyards.

#### Military Architecture

The Ayyubids were known for their military architecture, which was a supreme expression of their power and control over the city. They constructed a series of fortifications, including the city wall and the Citadel, to protect their territory and assert their dominance. The Ayyubids also incorporated techniques learned from the Crusaders, such as curtain walls following the natural topography, and developed their own unique techniques, such as concentric planning.

#### Women in Ayyubid Architecture

Women played a significant role in Ayyubid architecture, particularly in Damascus and Aleppo. Muslim women, particularly those from the Ayyubid family, the families of local governors, and the families of the "ulema" ("religious scholars"), took an active role in the construction of religious and charitable institutions. They were responsible for the construction of 15 "madrasas", six Sufi hospices, and 26 religious and charitable institutions. In Aleppo, the Firdaws Madrasa, known as the most impressive Ayyubid building in Syria, had regent queen Dayfa Khatun as its patron.

This policy was a departure from the Fatimid era, which had been marked by a strong emphasis on Shia Islam. The Ayyubids' religious policy was shaped by their desire to consolidate their power and control over the city, as well as their economic interests.

#### The Ayyubid Mosques

The Ayyubids built numerous mosques throughout Cairo, reflecting their commitment to Islam and their desire to establish a distinct architectural style. These mosques, such as the Al-Azhar Mosque and the Mosque of Ibn Tulun, are notable for their grandeur and their blend of Seljuk and Fatimid architectural styles. The Ayyubids' mosques were not just places of worship, but also symbols of their power and control over the city.

#### The Ayyubid Churches

Despite their Islamic heritage, the Ayyubids were known for their tolerance towards other faiths. This is evident in their policy towards the Christian community in Cairo. The Ayyubids allowed the construction of churches, and even funded their restoration and renovation. This policy was a marked contrast to the Fatimid era, during which the Christian community had been persecuted. The Ayyubids' tolerance towards other faiths was not just a matter of policy, but also reflected their economic interests. The Christian community in Cairo was a significant consumer of agricultural products and industrial commodities, and the Ayyubids were keen to maintain good relations with them.

#### The Ayyubid Cemeteries

The Ayyubids also established several cemeteries in Cairo, including the al-Qarafa cemetery. These cemeteries were not just places of burial, but also sites of religious and cultural significance. The Ayyubids' cemeteries were known for their architectural grandeur and their rich history, attracting pilgrims and tourists from far and wide.

### Subsection: 3.2b The Construction of Madrasas

The Ayyubid dynasty's religious policy was not only reflected in their mosques and churches, but also in their construction of madrasas. Madrasas, or Islamic schools, were an integral part of the Ayyubid educational system. They were not just places of learning, but also centers of religious and cultural life.

#### The Madrasa of Granada

The Madrasa of Granada, built by Yusuf I, is a prime example of the Ayyubid madrasas. The building was splendid, with a white marble exterior and intricate decorations. The layout of the building was organized around a pool in the center, with rooms for students arranged around the courtyard. The prayer room, which is the only part of the original building that has been preserved and restored, is a square room with a high ceiling and intricate stucco decorations. The transition from square to octagon is achieved at the corners of the room via four "muqarnas"-sculpted squinches. The upper walls are also covered in arabesque and calligraphic motifs, and pierced with 16 windows. The upper walls are also preceded by a "muqarnas" cornice which precedes the wooden cupola ceiling.

#### The Madrasa of Cairo

The Madrasa of Cairo, built by Saladin, is another notable example of the Ayyubid madrasas. The madrasa was built next to the Al-Azhar Mosque, and was a part of Saladin's efforts to revive the Fatimid tradition of higher education. The madrasa was organized around a central courtyard, with rooms for students arranged around the courtyard. The prayer room, like the one in the Madrasa of Granada, was a square room with a high ceiling and intricate decorations. The madrasa also had a library, which contained a vast collection of books on various subjects, including theology, law, and philosophy.

#### The Significance of Madrasas

The construction of madrasas was a significant aspect of the Ayyubid religious policy. These institutions not only provided higher education, but also served to promote the Ayyubid ideology and consolidate their power. The madrasas were also centers of religious and cultural life, attracting scholars and students from far and wide. The Ayyubid madrasas, with their grandeur and intricate decorations, are a testament to the dynasty's commitment to education and their desire to establish a distinct architectural style.




### Subsection: 3.2c The Transformation of the Religious Landscape

The Ayyubid period marked a significant transformation in the religious landscape of Cairo. The Ayyubid dynasty, being a Sunni Muslim dynasty, sought to establish their religious authority and legitimacy through the construction of grand mosques and madrasas. This not only reflected their piety and devotion to Islam, but also served as a means of asserting their political power and control over the city.

#### The Transformation of the Religious Landscape

The Ayyubid period saw a shift in the religious landscape of Cairo, with the construction of grand mosques and madrasas. These institutions not only served as places of worship, but also as centers of learning and religious authority. The Ayyubid dynasty, being a Sunni Muslim dynasty, sought to establish their religious authority and legitimacy through these structures.

The construction of these mosques and madrasas was not just limited to Cairo, but also extended to other parts of Egypt. The Ayyubid rulers saw it as their duty to spread the teachings of Islam and to provide a place of worship for the growing Muslim population. This was evident in the construction of the Mosque of al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah in Cairo, which was built by Saladin in 1184. The mosque, with its grandeur and architectural splendor, served as a symbol of the Ayyubid dynasty's religious and political power.

#### The Impact of the Transformation

### Introduction

The Early Mamluk Period, spanning from the 13th to 15th centuries, was a crucial time in the architectural evolution of Cairo. This era saw the rise of the Mamluk dynasty, a military elite who ruled Egypt and Syria from the 13th to 16th centuries. The Mamluk sultans were known for their patronage of the arts, particularly architecture, and their reign saw the construction of numerous grand structures that continue to stand today.

In this chapter, we will delve into the architectural legacy of the Early Mamluk Period, exploring the key characteristics and styles that defined this era. We will examine the influence of the Mamluks' Turkic and Kipchak origins on their architectural preferences, and how these were blended with local Egyptian traditions to create a unique architectural style.

We will also explore the key architectural works of the Early Mamluk Period, including the Citadel of Cairo, the Al-Azhar Mosque, and the Madrasa of Sultan Hassan. These structures are not only significant for their architectural merit, but also for their historical importance, as they provide a glimpse into the daily lives of the Mamluks and the society they ruled.

Finally, we will discuss the impact of the Early Mamluk Period on the subsequent architectural development of Cairo. The Mamluks' architectural legacy laid the foundation for the grandiose structures of the Ottoman and European periods, and their influence can still be seen in the city's architecture today.

Join us as we journey through the Early Mamluk Period, exploring the architectural evolution of Cairo and the legacy of the Mamluks.




### Section: 4.1 Early Mamluk Period (1250-90):

The Early Mamluk Period, spanning from 1250 to 1290, was a pivotal time in the architectural evolution of Cairo. This era saw the rise of the Mamluk dynasty, a military elite who ruled Egypt and Syria from the 13th to 16th centuries. The Mamluk sultans were known for their patronage of the arts, particularly architecture, and their reign saw the construction of numerous grand structures that continue to stand today.

#### 4.1a The Mamluk Dynasty

The Mamluk dynasty was founded by the Turkic-speaking Kipchak people, who were enslaved and trained as soldiers in the armies of the Abbasid Caliphate. However, by the 13th century, the Abbasid Caliphate was in decline, and the Mamluks seized power in Egypt. The Mamluks were initially ruled by the Ayyubid sultan as-Salih Ayyub, but after his death in 1249, they overthrew his son and established their own dynasty.

The Mamluks were powerful cavalry warriors, mixing the practices of the Turkic steppe peoples from which they were drawn and the organizational and technological sophistication and horsemanship of the Arabs. This blend of cultures is reflected in their architectural style, which combines elements of both Turkic and Arabic design.

In 1260, the Mamluks defeated a Mongol army at the Battle of Ain Jalut in present-day Israel, effectively halting the Mongol advance into the Middle East. This victory enhanced the position of the Mamluks in the southern Mediterranean basin and solidified their rule in Egypt.

The Mamluks were also known for their patronage of the arts, particularly architecture. They constructed numerous grand structures in Cairo, including the Citadel of Cairo, the Al-Azhar Mosque, and the Madrasa of Sultan Hassan. These structures are not only significant for their architectural merit, but also for their historical importance, as they provide a glimpse into the daily lives of the Mamluks and the society they ruled.

The Early Mamluk Period saw a significant shift in the architectural style of Cairo. The Mamluks incorporated elements of their Turkic heritage into the existing Arabic architectural traditions, creating a unique blend that is still evident in the city's architecture today. This period laid the foundation for the grandiose structures of the Ottoman and European periods, and the Mamluks' architectural legacy continues to shape the city's architectural landscape.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the key architectural works of the Early Mamluk Period, exploring their design, construction, and historical significance.

#### 4.1b Architectural Innovations

The Early Mamluk Period saw a significant shift in architectural style, with the Mamluks incorporating elements of their Turkic heritage into the existing Arabic architectural traditions. This blend of cultures is evident in the architectural innovations of the period, which include the use of brick and stone, the incorporation of Islamic geometric patterns, and the development of new architectural forms.

##### Brick and Stone

The Mamluks were known for their use of brick and stone in their architectural projects. Brick, a common building material in the Middle East, was used extensively in the construction of the Citadel of Cairo and the Al-Azhar Mosque. The Mamluks also used stone, particularly limestone, in their buildings. This was a departure from the previous Ayyubid dynasty, which favored the use of sandstone. The use of brick and stone allowed the Mamluks to create durable and visually striking structures.

##### Islamic Geometric Patterns

The Mamluks were also known for their use of Islamic geometric patterns in their architecture. These patterns, which are based on mathematical principles, are used to decorate the interiors and exteriors of buildings. The Mamluks incorporated these patterns into their architecture, creating a sense of order and symmetry. The use of Islamic geometric patterns is a hallmark of Mamluk architecture and is still evident in many of the city's buildings today.

##### New Architectural Forms

### Subsection: 5.2b The Development of Cairo

The development of Cairo as a city is a complex and multifaceted process that has been shaped by a variety of factors, including its geographical location, cultural influences, and political dynamics. The city's history can be traced back to ancient Egypt, where it was known as Memphis and served as the capital of the Old Kingdom. However, it was not until the Islamic era that Cairo began to take on its current form and character.

#### The Islamic Era and the Rise of Cairo

The Islamic era marked a significant turning point in the history of Cairo. In 641 CE, the city was conquered by the Arab Muslim armies, leading to the establishment of the Fatimid Caliphate. The Fatimids, who were Shia Muslims, saw Cairo as a symbol of their power and grandeur, and they set about transforming the city into a magnificent palace-city.

The Fatimids were responsible for the construction of many of Cairo's iconic landmarks, including the Al-Azhar Mosque, the oldest operating mosque in the city, and the Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah Mosque, one of the most impressive examples of Fatimid architecture. The Fatimids also built the city's original walls, which were made of bricks and later rebuilt in stone by the vizier, Badr al-Gamali.

#### The Ayyubid Dynasty and the Expansion of Cairo

After the Fatimid period, the city was ruled by the Ayyubid dynasty, which was founded by Saladin. The Ayyubids continued the Fatimids' tradition of grand architectural projects, extending the city's walls to include more of the city and enclosing Fustat to the south. However, Saladin died before the project was completed, and it was left to his successors to finish the task.

The Ayyubids were also responsible for the construction of many of Cairo's iconic gates, including Bab al-Nasr, Bab al-Futuh, and Bab Zuwayla. These gates, along with the city's walls, have been restored and preserved, providing a glimpse into the city's Islamic past.

#### The Modern City

Today, Cairo is a bustling metropolis with a population of over 20 million people. The city's architectural heritage has been preserved and celebrated, with many of its historic buildings and neighborhoods designated as UNESCO World Heritage sites. However, the city has also undergone significant modernization, with skyscrapers and modern architecture coexisting with the city's historic buildings.

The development of Cairo has been shaped by a variety of factors, including its rich history, cultural influences, and political dynamics. The city's Islamic architecture, in particular, has played a crucial role in shaping its identity and character, and it continues to be a source of pride for the city's inhabitants.

The Fatimids were also responsible for the construction of the city's original walls, which were made of bricks and later rebuilt in stone by the vizier, Badr al-Gamali. These walls, which were innovative in their design and construction, are a testament to the Fatimids' architectural prowess.

#### The Ayyubid Influence

After the Fatimids, the Ayyubids, who ruled Cairo from 1171 to 1250, continued the city's architectural evolution. The Ayyubids were known for their grand architectural projects, which included extending the city's walls to include more of the city and enclosing Fustat to the south. They also built many of Cairo's iconic gates, including Bab al-Nasr, Bab al-Futuh, and Bab Zuwayla.

The Ayyubids' architectural style was characterized by a blend of Fatimid and Seljuk influences, with a focus on grandeur and symmetry. Their buildings, such as the Citadel of Cairo and the Mosque of Ibn Tulun, are notable for their impressive size and intricate decoration.

#### The Modern City

Cairo's architectural evolution has continued into the modern era, with the city's skyline now dominated by towering skyscrapers and modern buildings. However, the city has managed to preserve its architectural heritage, with many of its historic buildings and landmarks still standing.

### Introduction

The architectural landscape of Cairo is a fascinating tapestry of diverse styles and influences, each with its own unique story to tell. In this chapter, we delve into the realm of vernacular architecture, exploring the indigenous architectural traditions that have shaped the city's urban fabric. 

Vernacular architecture, as defined by architect Ian McHarg, is "the architecture of the common people, the architecture of the land." In the context of Cairo, this refers to the traditional, locally-inspired designs that have been used to construct homes, mosques, and other buildings throughout the city's history. These structures are not just physical spaces, but cultural artifacts that reflect the city's social, economic, and environmental conditions.

The study of vernacular architecture is not just about understanding the buildings themselves, but also about understanding the people who live in them and the ways in which they interact with their environment.

### Subsection: 5.3a The Introduction to Egypt on the Eve of the Muslim Conquest

The Muslim conquest of Egypt, which began in the 7th century, marked a significant turning point in the country's history. This event not only led to the establishment of Islamic architecture in Cairo but also brought about a profound socio-political transformation.

#### The Early Muslim Conquests

The early Muslim conquests, led by armies from the Arabian Peninsula, were a series of military campaigns that resulted in the expansion of Arab culture and religion. These conquests were followed by a large-scale migration of families and tribes from Arabia into the lands of the Middle East, leading to the creation of a new civilisation, the Islamicised and Arabised Middle East.

The significance of these conquests cannot be overstated. As Nicolle noted, they were "one of the most significant events in world history", leading to the creation of "a new civilisation", the Islamicised and Arabised Middle East. Islam, which had previously been confined to Arabia, became a major world religion, while the synthesis of Arab, Roman, and Persian elements led to distinctive new styles of art and architecture emerging in the Middle East.

#### Socio-political Developments

The military victories of the Arab armies heralded the expansion of Arab culture and religion. The conquests were followed by a large-scale migration of families and whole tribes from Arabia into the lands of the Middle East. The conquering Arabs had already possessed a complex and sophisticated society. Emigrants from Yemen brought with them agricultural, urban, and monarchical traditions; members of the Ghassanid and Lakhmid tribal confederations had experience collaborating with the empires. The rank and file of the armies was drawn from both nomadic and sedentary tribes, while the leadership came mainly from the merchant class of the Hejaz.

Two fundamental policies were implemented during the reign of the second caliph Umar (634–644): the bedouins would not be allowed to damage agricultural production of the conquered lands and the leadership would cooperate with the local elites. To that end, the Arab-Muslim armies were settled in segregated quarters or new garrison towns such as Basra, Kufa, and Fustat. The latter two became the new administrative centers of Iraq and Egypt, respectively. Soldiers were paid a stipend and prohibited from seizing lands. Arab governors supervised collection and distribution of taxes, but otherwise left the old religious and social order intact. At first, many provinces retained a large degree of autonomy under the terms of agreements made with Arab commanders.

As the time passed, the Muslim conquest of Egypt led to the establishment of Islamic architecture in Cairo, which is the focus of the next section.

### Subsection: 5.3b The Development of Egypt on the Eve of the Muslim Conquest

The Muslim conquest of Egypt marked a significant turning point in the country's history, not only in terms of its architecture but also in its socio-political landscape. The events leading up to the conquest, as well as the policies implemented by the Arab-Muslim armies, had a profound impact on the development of Egypt.

#### The Byzantine Period

The Byzantine period, which lasted from the 4th to the 7th century, was a time of significant change in Egypt. The country was under the rule of the Byzantine Empire, which had taken control of Egypt from the Roman Empire in the 4th century. The Byzantines introduced a number of architectural styles to Egypt, including the use of brick and stone in the construction of churches and other buildings.

The Byzantine period also saw the rise of Coptic Christianity, which became the dominant religion in Egypt. This led to the construction of numerous churches and monasteries, many of which still stand today and are a testament to the architectural heritage of this period.

#### The Sassanian Period

The Sassanian period, which lasted from the 3rd to the 7th century, was a time of conflict between the Byzantine Empire and the Persian Sassanian Empire.

## Chapter: The Modern Period

### Introduction

The modern era has been a time of significant architectural evolution in Cairo. This chapter, "The Modern Period," will delve into the architectural developments that have shaped the city since the late 19th century. The modern period in Cairo is marked by a shift from the traditional, Islamic architectural styles that have characterized the city for centuries, to a more Westernized and modernist approach. This shift has been influenced by a variety of factors, including political, economic, and social changes.

The modern period in Cairo is often divided into two main phases: the Ptolemaic period and the Roman period. The Ptolemaic period, which lasted from the 3rd century BC to the 1st century BC, saw the rise of the Ptolemaic dynasty, which introduced many architectural innovations to the city. The Roman period, on the other hand, was marked by the incorporation of Roman architectural styles and techniques, which further transformed the architectural landscape of Cairo.

In this chapter, we will explore the key architectural developments of these two periods, including the construction of iconic structures such as the Ptolemaic temples and the Roman aqueducts. We will also examine the impact of these developments on the overall architectural evolution of Cairo, and how they have shaped the city into what it is today.

As we journey through the modern period, we will also touch upon the challenges and opportunities that have arisen in the context of modern architecture in Cairo. From the need to preserve and restore historic structures, to the ongoing debate over the use of modernist architecture in the city, we will explore these issues and their implications for the future of Cairo's architectural landscape.

### Subsection: 6.3a The Late Ottoman Period

The Late Ottoman Period in Egypt, spanning from the 18th to the early 20th century, was a time of significant architectural development. The Ottomans, who had ruled Egypt since 1517, continued to exert their influence on the city's architecture, blending it with local traditions to create a unique architectural style that is still evident in Cairo today.

#### The Architecture of the Late Ottoman Period

The Late Ottoman Period saw a continuation of the architectural styles and techniques introduced during the Early Ottoman Period. The use of domes and arches, for instance, remained prevalent, but there was also a growing influence of European architectural styles, particularly Baroque and Rococo. This was due to the increasing trade and cultural exchange between Egypt and Europe, particularly France and Italy.

The Mosque of Muhammad Ali Pasha, built in the 19th century, is a prime example of this architectural fusion. The mosque's exterior is a blend of Ottoman and Baroque elements, with a large central dome and four smaller domes, reminiscent of Ottoman mosques, but with Baroque-style columns and arches. The interior, on the other hand, is more Baroque in style, with a grandiose prayer hall and intricate stucco work.

#### The Impact of the Late Ottoman Period on Cairo's Architecture

The Late Ottoman Period had a profound impact on Cairo's architectural landscape. The city's architectural heritage was preserved and enhanced, with the construction of numerous architectural landmarks that continue to stand today. These include not only mosques and palaces, but also public buildings such as schools, hospitals, and markets.

Moreover, the architectural techniques and styles introduced during the Late Ottoman Period have been incorporated into modern Cairo's architectural landscape. The use of domes and arches, for instance, is still prevalent in modern Cairo, albeit in a more modernized and stylized form. This blending of old and new architectural elements has resulted in a unique architectural character that is distinctively Cairo.

In conclusion, the Late Ottoman Period was a time of significant architectural development in Cairo. The Ottomans' architectural legacy continues to shape the city's architectural landscape, preserving its historical heritage and influencing its modern architectural development.




### Subsection: 6.3b The Decline of the Ottoman Empire in Egypt

The Ottoman Empire, which had ruled Egypt for over three centuries, began to decline in the late 18th century. This decline was marked by a series of military defeats, economic struggles, and political instability. The Ottoman Empire's decline in Egypt was a complex process that was influenced by a variety of factors, including the rise of European powers, internal political struggles, and the changing nature of warfare.

#### The Military Decline of the Ottoman Empire

The Ottoman Empire's military decline was a significant factor in its overall decline. The empire's military had been a key source of its power and had allowed it to expand and maintain its territories. However, by the late 18th century, the Ottoman military was facing a series of defeats at the hands of European powers, particularly Russia and Austria. These defeats were largely due to the Ottomans' outdated military tactics and technology, as well as their lack of a strong navy.

The Ottoman Empire's military decline was also exacerbated by internal political struggles. The empire was divided into several provinces, each with its own governor and army. This led to a lack of coordination and communication between different parts of the empire, making it difficult to mount a unified defense against external threats.

#### Economic Struggles and Political Instability

The Ottoman Empire's economic struggles also contributed to its decline. The empire's economy was heavily reliant on trade, particularly with Europe. However, as European powers began to establish colonies and trade routes in Africa and the Americas, the Ottoman Empire lost its competitive edge. This led to a decline in trade and a decrease in revenue for the empire.

Political instability also played a role in the Ottoman Empire's decline. The empire was ruled by a sultan, who was supported by a council of advisors. However, there were often power struggles and coups within the council, leading to changes in leadership and policies. This political instability made it difficult for the empire to respond effectively to external threats and internal challenges.

#### The Impact of the Decline of the Ottoman Empire on Cairo's Architecture

The decline of the Ottoman Empire had a significant impact on Cairo's architecture. The empire had been a major patron of architecture, commissioning grand mosques, palaces, and public buildings. However, as the empire declined, so did its ability to fund these projects. This led to a decrease in architectural activity and a decline in the quality of construction.

Furthermore, the Ottoman Empire's decline also led to a shift in architectural styles. As the empire became more isolated and less influenced by European trends, its architecture became more traditional and less innovative. This can be seen in the architecture of Cairo, where the grandiose and ornate styles of the early Ottoman period gave way to more simple and traditional designs.

In conclusion, the decline of the Ottoman Empire in Egypt was a complex process that was influenced by a variety of factors. This decline had a significant impact on Cairo's architecture, leading to a decrease in architectural activity and a shift in architectural styles. The Ottoman Empire's decline also marked the end of an era in Cairo's architectural history, as the city began to embrace new architectural influences and styles.





### Subsection: 6.3c The End of the Ottoman Rule in Egypt

The end of the Ottoman rule in Egypt marked a significant turning point in the history of the region. The Ottoman Empire, which had ruled Egypt for over three centuries, was facing a series of internal and external challenges that ultimately led to its downfall.

#### The Egyptian Revolution of 1919

The Egyptian Revolution of 1919 was a pivotal moment in the end of Ottoman rule in Egypt. The revolution was sparked by the British occupation of Egypt in 1882 and the subsequent implementation of a series of repressive laws and policies by the British-backed Khedive Abbas II. These policies, which included the introduction of a new land tax and the establishment of a new court system, were seen as a threat to the traditional power and wealth of the Egyptian elite.

The revolution was led by a group of Egyptian nationalists, including Saad Zaghlul and Mustafa Kamil, who demanded the removal of British troops from Egypt and the establishment of an independent Egyptian government. The revolution was met with widespread support from the Egyptian population, who saw it as a chance to rid themselves of foreign rule and regain their independence.

#### The British Occupation of Egypt

The British occupation of Egypt, which began in 1882, played a significant role in the end of Ottoman rule in the region. The British had long been interested in Egypt due to its strategic location and potential for economic exploitation. In 1882, they used the pretext of a dispute between the Khedive and a group of Egyptian nationalists to intervene and establish a protectorate over Egypt.

The British occupation was met with resistance from the Egyptian population, who saw it as a threat to their sovereignty and traditional way of life. The British response was to implement a series of repressive measures, including the suspension of the Egyptian constitution and the establishment of a new court system. These actions further fueled the growing discontent and ultimately led to the Egyptian Revolution of 1919.

#### The Declaration of Independence

On 28 February 1919, Saad Zaghlul and his fellow nationalists declared Egypt's independence from Ottoman rule. This declaration was made in response to the British decision to exile Zaghlul and other nationalist leaders to Malta in 1919. The declaration was a symbolic act, as Egypt was still under British occupation, but it marked a significant step towards achieving full independence.

The declaration was met with widespread support from the Egyptian population, who saw it as a chance to rid themselves of both Ottoman and British rule. The British, however, were not willing to give up their control over Egypt and continued to suppress the nationalist movement.

#### The British-Ottoman Agreement of 1919

In an effort to maintain their influence in the region, the British and Ottomans reached an agreement in 1919 that allowed for the continuation of Ottoman rule in Egypt, but with British oversight. This agreement was met with opposition from the Egyptian nationalists, who saw it as a betrayal of their fight for independence.

The British-Ottoman Agreement of 1919 ultimately led to the end of Ottoman rule in Egypt. The agreement was met with widespread protests and riots, which forced the British to reconsider their position. In 1922, the British finally agreed to grant Egypt full independence, marking the end of Ottoman rule in the region.

### Conclusion

The end of Ottoman rule in Egypt marked a significant turning point in the history of the region. The Egyptian Revolution of 1919, the British occupation of Egypt, and the British-Ottoman Agreement of 1919 all played a role in the downfall of the Ottoman Empire in Egypt. The declaration of independence by Saad Zaghlul and his fellow nationalists was a symbolic act that marked the beginning of Egypt's journey towards full independence.

#### 7.1b The British Occupation of Egypt

The British occupation of Egypt, which lasted from 1882 to 1956, was a significant event in the history of Egypt and the British Empire. It was a result of Britain's growing interest in the region, particularly the Suez Canal, which was a crucial trade route between Europe and the Far East.

The occupation began in 1882 when Britain intervened in Egypt's internal affairs to protect its interests. The British army, under the command of General Charles Gordon, was sent to Egypt to protect British citizens and property. This intervention was a response to the growing instability in Egypt, which was then under the rule of the Khedive Tewfik Pasha.

The British occupation was marked by a series of events that shaped the political, economic, and social landscape of Egypt. One of the most significant events was the Anglo-Egyptian War of 1882, which resulted in the British occupation of Egypt. This war was a culmination of tensions between the British and the Egyptian government, particularly over the control of the Suez Canal.

The British occupation also led to the establishment of the British Empire in Egypt. The British Empire, also known as the British Commonwealth, was a global empire that was at its peak in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It was a collection of territories that were under the rule of the British Crown. The empire was formed through a combination of conquest, colonization, and treaties, and it spanned across six continents and included a quarter of the world's population.

The British Empire was a major player in the global political and economic scene. Its influence was felt in every corner of the world, and its policies and actions had far-reaching consequences. The empire was a major driving force behind the Industrial Revolution, and it played a crucial role in the development of modern capitalism.

The British occupation of Egypt was a significant event in the history of Egypt and the British Empire. It marked a turning point in the political, economic, and social landscape of Egypt, and its effects are still felt today. The British occupation led to the establishment of the British Empire in Egypt, which played a crucial role in shaping the modern world. 





### Section: 7.1c The Impact of the British Occupation on Cairo

The British occupation of Egypt had a profound impact on the city of Cairo, the capital of Egypt. The occupation, which lasted from 1882 to 1956, brought about significant changes in the political, economic, and social landscape of the city.

#### Political Impact

The British occupation of Egypt marked a significant shift in the political landscape of Cairo. The British, who were already involved in the region due to their interest in the Suez Canal, used their military presence to exert control over the city. This led to the establishment of a British-backed monarchy, which ruled Egypt until the 1952 Egyptian Revolution.

The British also introduced a series of political reforms in Cairo, including the establishment of a legislative assembly and the introduction of a new constitution. These reforms were aimed at modernizing the city and bringing it in line with British political systems. However, they were also seen as a way for the British to maintain their control over the city.

#### Economic Impact

The British occupation also had a significant impact on the economy of Cairo. The British, who were heavily involved in the global trade industry, saw Egypt as a crucial location for their economic interests. They invested in various industries, including agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism, which led to the growth of the city's economy.

However, the British also imposed a series of economic policies that were beneficial to their own interests. This included the establishment of a system of land ownership that favored British landowners, as well as the introduction of a new currency, the Egyptian pound, which was pegged to the British pound.

#### Social Impact

The British occupation also brought about significant changes in the social landscape of Cairo. The British introduced a series of social reforms, including the establishment of schools and hospitals, as well as the promotion of women's rights. These reforms were aimed at modernizing the city and improving the quality of life for its inhabitants.

However, the British also imposed their own social norms and values on the city, which led to a clash of cultures. This was particularly evident in the city's architecture, where British-style buildings were built alongside traditional Egyptian structures.

In conclusion, the British occupation of Egypt had a profound impact on the city of Cairo. It brought about significant changes in the political, economic, and social landscape of the city, shaping its history and architecture in ways that are still visible today.

### Subsection: 7.2a The Introduction to British Architecture in Cairo

The British occupation of Egypt, which lasted from 1882 to 1956, had a profound impact on the city of Cairo. The British brought with them their own architectural style, which was heavily influenced by their industrial revolution and their desire to showcase their wealth and power. This section will explore the introduction to British architecture in Cairo, including its history, key features, and impact on the city.

#### The History of British Architecture in Cairo

The British occupation of Egypt marked a significant shift in the architectural landscape of Cairo. Prior to the British occupation, Cairo was known for its traditional Islamic architecture, with grand mosques and palaces built in the Mamluk and Ottoman styles. However, with the arrival of the British, a new architectural style emerged, one that was heavily influenced by British industrial architecture.

The British, who were known for their grand and imposing buildings, introduced a new style of architecture to Cairo. This can be seen in the many British-style buildings that still stand in Cairo today, including the Cairo Opera House and the British Embassy. These buildings were designed to impress and showcase the wealth and power of the British Empire.

#### Key Features of British Architecture in Cairo

British architecture in Cairo was characterized by its grandeur and ornamentation. Buildings were often built in a neoclassical style, with columns, pediments, and other classical elements. The use of red brick and stone was also common, as seen in the India Mill at Darwen, Lancashire, which was built in red, white, and black brick, topped with cornices of stone, an ornamental urn at each corner, and an ornate cresting consisting of over 300 pieces of cast iron.

Another key feature of British architecture in Cairo was its emphasis on functionality. The British were known for their efficient distribution system, which allowed industries to concentrate production at a distance from sources of raw materials. This led to the development of large-scale industrial buildings, such as factories and warehouses, which were designed to maximize efficiency and productivity.

#### The Impact of British Architecture on Cairo

The introduction of British architecture in Cairo had a significant impact on the city. The grand and ornate buildings built by the British not only showcased their wealth and power, but also influenced the architectural styles of the local population. The use of red brick and stone, as well as the emphasis on functionality, became popular among the local elite, leading to the development of a new architectural style known as "Cairo Deco".

Furthermore, the British also introduced a system of urban planning that was based on their own cities. This can be seen in the grid-like layout of many neighborhoods in Cairo, which was designed to mimic the streets of London. This system of urban planning has had a lasting impact on the city, with many neighborhoods still following this grid-like layout today.

In conclusion, the British occupation of Egypt brought about a significant change in the architectural landscape of Cairo. The introduction of British architecture not only showcased the wealth and power of the British Empire, but also had a lasting impact on the city's architecture and urban planning. 





### Subsection: 7.2b The Development of British Architecture in Cairo

The development of British architecture in Cairo can be traced back to the mid-19th century, during the height of the British industrial revolution. As Britain became known as the "workshop of the world", its wealth and power allowed for the construction of grand and ornate buildings that showcased its industrial might.

One of the earliest examples of British architecture in Cairo is the India Mill at Darwen, Lancashire, which was built in the 1830s. This mill, designed by the prominent architect Ernest Bates, was a prime example of British industrial architecture, with its tall Italianate campanile-style chimney and ornate cresting.

As the British occupation of Egypt continued, British architecture became more prevalent in Cairo. The construction of the Cairo Opera House in 1869, designed by the British architect William Theed, marked a significant shift in the city's architectural landscape. Theed's design, which was heavily influenced by Greek and Roman architecture, was a departure from the traditional Islamic architecture that had dominated Cairo for centuries.

The British also brought with them their railways, which transformed both ordinary life and industry with unprecedentedly rapid transport. These railways, the first in the world, were celebrated with architecture that both referred to the past and celebrated the future. The French poet Théophile Gautier described the new railway stations as "cathedrals of the new humanity".

In Cairo, the British railway stations were designed to be grand and imposing, with elements of both classical and Gothic architecture. The Great Western Railway's engineer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, described the station as "a cathedral to the iron horse". This emphasis on grandeur and functionality can still be seen in many of the British-style buildings that stand in Cairo today.

The development of British architecture in Cairo not only transformed the city's physical landscape, but also had a significant impact on its social and cultural landscape. The British introduced new ideas and concepts, such as the concept of the "workshop of the world" and the importance of rapid transport, which were reflected in their architecture. This not only changed the way Cairo was built, but also how it was perceived and experienced by its inhabitants.

In conclusion, the development of British architecture in Cairo was a significant aspect of the British occupation. It not only transformed the city's physical landscape, but also had a lasting impact on its social and cultural landscape. The grandeur and functionality of British architecture continue to be admired and studied by architects and historians today.





### Subsection: 7.2c The Characteristics of British Architecture in Cairo

The British architecture in Cairo is characterized by a blend of classical and Gothic elements, with a strong emphasis on grandeur and functionality. This can be seen in the design of the Cairo Opera House, which was heavily influenced by Greek and Roman architecture, and in the railway stations, which were described as "cathedrals of the new humanity".

One of the key characteristics of British architecture in Cairo is the use of ornate and decorative elements. This can be seen in the India Mill at Darwen, Lancashire, which was designed with a tall Italianate campanile-style chimney and an ornate cresting. This emphasis on ornamentation and detail is a hallmark of British industrial architecture, and can be seen in many of the buildings constructed during the British occupation of Egypt.

Another characteristic of British architecture in Cairo is the use of materials. The India Mill, for example, was built using red, white, and black brick, with stone cornices and an ornamental urn at each corner. This use of color and materials was not only aesthetically pleasing, but also served to showcase the wealth and power of the British Empire.

The British also brought with them their railways, which transformed both ordinary life and industry with unprecedentedly rapid transport. These railways were celebrated with architecture that both referred to the past and celebrated the future. The French poet Théophile Gautier described the new railway stations as "cathedrals of the new humanity". This emphasis on grandeur and celebration can be seen in the design of the railway stations in Cairo, which were designed to be imposing and impressive.

In conclusion, the British architecture in Cairo is characterized by a blend of classical and Gothic elements, with a strong emphasis on ornamentation, materials, and grandeur. These characteristics not only reflect the British Empire's wealth and power, but also its desire to showcase its industrial might and celebrate the future.





### Subsection: 7.2d The Legacy of British Architecture in Cairo

The British occupation of Egypt, which lasted from 1882 to 1956, left a lasting impact on the city of Cairo. The British architectural legacy in Cairo is a blend of classical and Gothic elements, with a strong emphasis on functionality and grandeur. This legacy can be seen in the city's iconic buildings and structures, such as the Cairo Opera House, the railway stations, and the British Embassy.

The Cairo Opera House, designed by the Italian architect Carlo Alberto Piana, is a prime example of British architecture in Cairo. The building, which was completed in 1911, is a blend of classical and Gothic elements, with a grandiose facade and ornate interior. The Opera House was built to showcase the British Empire's cultural and artistic influence in Egypt, and it continues to be a popular venue for opera, ballet, and other performing arts today.

The railway stations in Cairo, such as the Ramses Station and the Giza Station, are also notable examples of British architecture. These stations, which were built during the British occupation, are characterized by their grandeur and functionality. The Ramses Station, in particular, is a cathedral-like structure with Gothic arches and a pinnacled tower, reflecting the British Empire's emphasis on grandeur and celebration.

The British Embassy in Cairo, located in the upscale Garden City neighborhood, is another example of British architecture in the city. The embassy, which was built in the early 20th century, is a blend of classical and Gothic elements, with a grandiose facade and ornate interior. The embassy serves as a reminder of the British Empire's presence in Egypt and its lasting impact on the city's architecture.

In addition to these iconic buildings, the British also left a lasting impact on the city's urban planning and infrastructure. The British introduced the concept of "garden cities," which were planned communities with green spaces and parks, to Cairo. These garden cities, such as Heliopolis and Maadi, are still popular residential areas in the city today. The British also built a comprehensive railway network, connecting Cairo to other major cities in Egypt and the Middle East. This network, which is still in use today, played a crucial role in the city's economic development during the British occupation.

In conclusion, the British architectural legacy in Cairo is a blend of classical and Gothic elements, with a strong emphasis on functionality and grandeur. This legacy can be seen in the city's iconic buildings and structures, as well as its urban planning and infrastructure. The British occupation of Egypt may have ended over 60 years ago, but its architectural legacy continues to shape the city of Cairo today.





### Subsection: 7.3a The End of the British Occupation

The British occupation of Egypt, which began in 1882, came to an end in 1956. The end of the British occupation marked a significant turning point in the history of Egypt and Cairo, as it marked the country's independence and the beginning of a new era.

The end of the British occupation was not a sudden event, but rather a gradual process. The British had been facing increasing pressure from the Egyptian nationalist movement, led by figures such as Mohammed Ali Pasha and Ahmed Orabi. In 1914, the British declared Egypt a protectorate, further solidifying their control over the country. However, the British faced growing opposition from the Egyptian people, who saw the occupation as a violation of their sovereignty.

The end of the British occupation was also influenced by global events, such as the First and Second World Wars. During the First World War, Egypt played a crucial role in the British Empire's war efforts, serving as a base for military operations in the Middle East. However, this also led to increased tensions between the British and the Egyptian people, as the British imposed strict controls on the country's economy and resources.

After the Second World War, the British faced increasing pressure from the United States and the Soviet Union to decolonize their remaining territories. In 1952, a group of Egyptian military officers, led by Gamal Abdel Nasser, overthrew the British-backed monarchy and declared Egypt a republic. This marked the beginning of the end of the British occupation.

The British officially withdrew from Egypt in 1956, following the Suez Crisis, which was sparked by their attempt to reoccupy the Suez Canal. The end of the British occupation marked a significant milestone in the history of Egypt and Cairo, as it marked the country's independence and the beginning of a new era.

The legacy of the British occupation can still be seen in the architecture and urban planning of Cairo. The British introduced many architectural styles, such as Gothic and classical, which can still be seen in the city's iconic buildings and structures. They also left a lasting impact on the city's infrastructure, with the construction of railways and other transportation systems.

However, the British occupation also brought about significant changes to the city's architecture. The British introduced new building materials, such as steel and concrete, which were used in the construction of modernist buildings. This marked a departure from the traditional Islamic architecture that had dominated the city for centuries.

In conclusion, the end of the British occupation marked a significant turning point in the history of Egypt and Cairo. It marked the country's independence and the beginning of a new era, while also leaving a lasting impact on the city's architecture and urban planning.

The end of the occupation not only marked the country's independence, but also brought about a shift in the city's architectural style and development.

#### The Architectural Legacy of the British Occupation

The British occupation had a lasting impact on the architecture of Cairo. The British introduced a number of architectural styles, including Gothic, Victorian, and Edwardian, which were heavily influenced by their own cultural and aesthetic preferences. These styles can still be seen in some of the city's oldest buildings, such as the Cairo Opera House and the British Embassy.

The British also brought about a number of urban planning initiatives, which shaped the city's layout and development. They introduced a grid-like street system, which was designed to facilitate movement and transportation. This system can still be seen in the city's downtown area, where the streets are lined with tall buildings and bustling markets.

#### The End of the British Occupation and Modern Architecture

The end of the British occupation also brought about a shift in Cairo's architectural style. As the city began to modernize and develop, the traditional architectural styles introduced by the British were replaced by more modern and contemporary designs. This can be seen in the city's skyline, which is now dominated by tall, glass-covered skyscrapers.

The end of the British occupation also brought about a change in the city's urban planning. The grid-like street system introduced by the British was replaced by a more organic and sprawling layout. This can be seen in the city's outskirts, where new developments are characterized by wide, tree-lined streets and large, detached homes.

#### The Impact of the End of the British Occupation on Cairo's Architecture

The end of the British occupation had a significant impact on Cairo's architecture and urban planning. The city's traditional architectural styles and urban layout were replaced by more modern and contemporary designs, reflecting the city's changing political and social landscape.

The end of the British occupation in 1956 marked a significant turning point in the history of Egypt. The country had been under British control since 1882, and the British had a profound impact on the country's architecture, urban planning, and culture. The post-occupation period saw a shift in these areas, as Egypt began to assert its own identity and develop its own unique architectural style.

#### The Architectural Evolution of Egypt

The post-occupation period saw a shift in the architectural style of Egypt. The traditional architectural styles introduced by the British, such as Gothic, Victorian, and Edwardian, were replaced by more modern and contemporary designs. This can be seen in the city's skyline, which is now dominated by tall, glass-covered skyscrapers.

The post-occupation period also saw a shift in urban planning. The grid-like street system introduced by the British was replaced by a more organic and sprawling layout.

#### The Impact of the Post-Occupation Period on Cairo

The post-occupation period had a significant impact on the city of Cairo. The city began to modernize and develop at a rapid pace, with new buildings and infrastructure being built to accommodate the growing population. This led to a shift in the city's economy, with a focus on industry and manufacturing.

The post-occupation period also saw a shift in the city's cultural landscape. The British had introduced a number of cultural institutions, such as the Cairo Opera House and the British Embassy, which were heavily influenced by their own cultural and aesthetic preferences. After the British occupation, these institutions were replaced by more locally inspired and influenced ones, reflecting the country's growing independence and identity.

#### The Post-Occupation Period and the Arab Spring

The post-occupation period also saw significant political changes in Egypt. In 1952, a group of young military officers led by Gamal Abdel Nasser overthrew the British-backed monarchy and established a republic. This marked the beginning of a new era in Egypt, with a focus on Arab nationalism and socialism.

The post-occupation period also saw the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, a conservative Islamic group that became a major political force in Egypt. The group's influence can still be seen in the city's architecture, with the construction of mosques and other religious buildings in a traditional Islamic style.

#### The Post-Occupation Period and Modern Egypt

Today, Egypt is a rapidly modernizing country, with a strong focus on tourism and a growing middle class. The post-occupation period has seen a continuation of the architectural and urban planning trends started in the 1950s, with a focus on modern and contemporary designs.

### Subsection: 7.3d The Legacy of the End of the British Occupation

The end of the British occupation in 1956 marked a significant turning point in the history of Egypt. The country had been under British control since 1882, and the British had a profound impact on the country's architecture, urban planning, and culture. The post-occupation period saw a shift in these areas, as Egypt began to assert its own identity and develop its own unique architectural style.

#### The Architectural Legacy of the British Occupation

The British occupation left a lasting impact on the architectural landscape of Egypt. The traditional architectural styles introduced by the British, such as Gothic, Victorian, and Edwardian, were replaced by more modern and contemporary designs. This can be seen in the city's skyline, which is now dominated by tall, glass-covered skyscrapers.

The British also introduced a number of architectural innovations, such as the use of reinforced concrete and steel, which were used in the construction of many buildings during their occupation. These materials and techniques were adopted by Egyptian architects and engineers, leading to the development of a unique architectural style that blends traditional elements with modern design.

The British also introduced a number of urban planning principles, such as the use of green spaces and public parks, which were incorporated into the city's design. These elements have been preserved and expanded upon in the post-occupation period, resulting in a more livable and sustainable city.

#### The Cultural Legacy of the British Occupation

The British occupation also had a lasting impact on the cultural landscape of Egypt. The British introduced a number of cultural institutions, such as the Cairo Opera House and the British Embassy, which were heavily influenced by their own cultural and aesthetic preferences. These institutions were replaced by more locally inspired and influenced ones after the British occupation, reflecting the country's growing independence and identity.

The British also introduced a number of cultural practices and traditions, such as the use of English as a second language and the adoption of British customs and traditions. These elements have been preserved and incorporated into Egyptian culture, resulting in a unique blend of Eastern and Western influences.

In conclusion, the end of the British occupation in 1956 marked a significant turning point in the history of Egypt. The country's architecture, urban planning, and culture were all shaped by the British occupation, and the post-occupation period saw a shift towards a more modern and independent Egypt.

### Subsection: 8.2a The Introduction to Modern Architecture in Cairo

The modern period in Cairo has been marked by a dynamic and complex evolution of architectural styles. This evolution has been shaped by a variety of factors, including political ideologies, economic considerations, and cultural influences. In this section, we will explore the key characteristics and developments of modern architecture in Cairo, with a particular focus on the 20th century.

#### 8.2a The Introduction to Modern Architecture in Cairo

The 20th century saw a significant shift in Cairo's architectural landscape, as modernist styles began to dominate. This shift was largely driven by the work of architects such as Sayed Karim, who championed the International Style and Brutalism. Karim's work was characterized by a rejection of ornamentation and a focus on functionalism, reflecting the broader modernist ethos of the time.

One of the most influential architects of this period was Hassan Fathy, who aimed to use traditional vernacular mud-brick construction in a modern context. His work, such as the village of New Gourna, near Luxor, sought to create comfortable and sustainable living spaces that were in harmony with the surrounding environment. This approach was a departure from the dominant Western styles and ideas of the time, and represented a significant shift in the city's architectural culture.

The modern period also saw a number of large-scale urban developments and housing projects, as well as the construction of newer public buildings and monuments. These developments were often driven by the city's rapid population growth and the need for more efficient and modern living spaces. The Arab League Headquarters and the Cairo Tower, both built in the 1950s, are notable examples of these developments.

### Subsection: 11.2b The Development of the Legacy of Egyptian Architecture

The legacy of Egyptian architecture is not just limited to the physical structures that have been left behind. It also includes the techniques and principles that were used in their construction, which have been studied and applied in modern architecture.

#### The Techniques of Egyptian Architecture

The techniques used in Egyptian architecture were largely dependent on the materials available. The most common material was limestone, which was readily available in the Nile Valley. This material was used to construct the majority of ancient Egyptian buildings, including temples, tombs, and houses.

The process of building with limestone involved quarrying the stone, shaping it into blocks, and then assembling these blocks together using mud mortar. The blocks were often left rough and unfinished, with the smooth surfaces of the stone being reserved for decoration.

Another important technique used in Egyptian architecture was the use of brick. Brick was used in the construction of mud-brick structures, which were common in the Predynastic and Early Dynastic periods. These structures were typically small and simple, but they provided a cheap and easily accessible building material.

#### The Principles of Egyptian Architecture

The principles of Egyptian architecture were largely influenced by the religious beliefs of the time. The ancient Egyptians believed in a complex pantheon of gods, and their architecture reflected this belief. Temples were built to honor these gods, and they were often decorated with scenes and symbols that represented the gods and their powers.

One of the key principles of Egyptian architecture was the concept of hieroglyphics. Hieroglyphics were used to represent words and ideas, and they were often incorporated into the design of buildings. For example, the hieroglyph for the god Ra was often used in the design of temples dedicated to Ra.

Another important principle was the concept of symmetry. Egyptian architecture was characterized by a strong sense of balance and proportion, with buildings often being designed with a central axis and evenly spaced elements. This principle can still be seen in modern Egyptian architecture, with the use of symmetrical facades and balanced proportions.

#### The Influence of Egyptian Architecture on Modern Architecture

The legacy of Egyptian architecture has had a profound influence on modern architecture. The principles of symmetry and balance, as well as the use of hieroglyphics, can still be seen in contemporary Egyptian architecture.

Moreover, the techniques used in ancient Egyptian architecture, such as the use of limestone and brick, have also been studied and applied in modern construction. The use of mud mortar, for example, has been adapted to create sustainable and environmentally friendly buildings.

In conclusion, the legacy of Egyptian architecture is a rich and complex tapestry that has shaped the city of Cairo and the country of Egypt as a whole.

It is also known for its innovative use of materials and techniques, as well as its integration of religious and cultural symbolism.

#### The Grandeur and Symmetry of Egyptian Architecture

The grandeur and symmetry of Egyptian architecture are immediately apparent in the design of their temples. These structures were built to impress and to convey the power and majesty of the gods. The use of symmetrical forms, such as the hypostyle hall, was a way of creating a sense of order and balance, reflecting the Egyptian belief in the cosmic order of the universe.

The grandeur of Egyptian architecture is also evident in the size and scale of their buildings. The pyramids, for example, are some of the largest structures ever built, and their construction required a vast amount of labor and resources. The pyramids were not just tombs, but also symbols of the pharaoh's power and his place in the afterlife.

#### The Innovative Use of Materials and Techniques

The ancient Egyptians were masters of stone masonry, and they developed a range of techniques for working with stone. The use of limestone, as mentioned in the previous section, was common, but they also worked with other materials such as granite and basalt. The ability to work with these materials and create structures of such grandeur is a testament to the skill and ingenuity of the ancient Egyptians.

In addition to their skill in stone masonry, the ancient Egyptians were also innovative in their use of materials. For example, they were one of the first cultures to use glass, and they developed techniques for creating intricate faience objects. These innovations not only contributed to the grandeur of their architecture, but also to their cultural and technological legacy.

#### The Integration of Religious and Cultural Symbolism

The ancient Egyptians were a deeply religious people, and their architecture was heavily influenced by their religious beliefs. The symbols and motifs used in their architecture were not just decorative, but also had deep religious and cultural meanings. For example, the use of the hieroglyph for the god Ra in the design of temples dedicated to Ra was a way of honoring and paying respect to the god.

The integration of religious and cultural symbolism in Egyptian architecture is a key aspect of its legacy. It reflects the deep spirituality and cultural identity of the ancient Egyptians, and continues to inspire architects and designers today.

#### 12.3b The Development of the Impact of Egypt

The impact of Egypt on the world has been a continuous process, evolving over time and across different periods of its history. This section will delve into the development of this impact, focusing on the role of architecture in shaping Egypt's influence on the global stage.

##### The Evolution of Ancient Egyptian Architecture

The architectural styles of ancient Egypt have been a subject of study for centuries, and their influence can be seen in the works of architects around the world. The early dynastic period, for instance, saw the development of mastaba tombs, which were simple, rectangular structures built of mud brick. These tombs were a precursor to the more elaborate pyramids and temples that would be built in later periods.

The Old Kingdom, spanning from around 2686 BC to 2181 BC, saw the rise of the pyramids. These monumental structures, built as tombs for the pharaohs, were a testament to the power and grandeur of ancient Egypt. The mathematical and engineering principles used in their construction, such as the use of the square and the use of the slope of the pyramid, have been studied and applied in modern architecture.

The Middle Kingdom, from around 2055 BC to 1650 BC, saw a shift in architectural style. The pyramids became smaller and more numerous, and the use of columns and vaulted ceilings in temples became more prevalent. This period also saw the development of the hypostyle hall, a colonnaded space used for religious ceremonies.

The New Kingdom, from around 1550 BC to 1069 BC, saw a revival of the pyramid building, with the construction of the famous tombs of the Valley of the Kings. The temples of this period were also more elaborate, with the use of relief sculptures and hieroglyphic inscriptions.

##### The Impact of Islamic Egyptian Architecture

The Islamic architecture introduced by the Mamluks and the Ottomans in Egypt has also left a lasting legacy. The use of geometric patterns and calligraphy in mosques and palaces has been a source of inspiration for architects. The intricate designs and patterns used in these structures have been studied and replicated in modern architecture, particularly in the design of public spaces and urban planning.

The Mamluks, who ruled Egypt from 1250 to 1517, were known for their grandiose architecture. Their mosques, such as the Sultan Hassan Mosque in Cairo, are characterized by their massive size and intricate decoration. The Ottomans, who ruled Egypt from 1517 to 1798, introduced a more ornate style, with the use of domes and minarets.

##### The Modern Impact of Egypt

The modern era has seen a continuation of Egypt's architectural influence. The country's rich architectural heritage has attracted architects and urban planners from around the world, who have been inspired by its ancient and Islamic architecture. The modern city of Cairo, with its mix of ancient and modern architecture, is a testament to this ongoing influence.

Modern architecture in Cairo is a blend of traditional and modern styles. The city's architects have been able to incorporate the principles of modern architecture, such as functionality and sustainability, while still respecting the city's architectural heritage. 

One example of this is the Cairo Tower, a 187-meter-tall skyscraper built in 1961. The tower is a symbol of modern Cairo, but its design is influenced by the city's architectural heritage. The tower's cylindrical shape is reminiscent of the ancient Egyptian obelisks, and its observation deck offers a panoramic view of the city, allowing visitors to appreciate the city's architectural diversity.

##### Urban Planning in Cairo

Urban planning in Cairo is a complex task due to the city's size and diversity. The city's urban planners face challenges such as managing traffic flow, providing adequate public services, and preserving the city's architectural heritage. 

Despite these challenges, Cairo's urban planners have been able to implement innovative solutions.

However, it was during the Old Kingdom (2686-2181 BC) that Egyptian architecture reached its first peak. The pyramids of Giza, built during this period, are a testament to the architectural prowess of the ancient Egyptians.

The Middle Kingdom (2055-1650 BC) saw a shift in architectural style, with the development of the mastaba, a rectangular structure with a flat roof. This style was further refined during the New Kingdom (1550-1069 BC), with the introduction of the pylon, a massive gateway structure that became a defining feature of Egyptian temples.

The Ptolemaic period (305-30 BC) saw a blending of Egyptian and Greek architectural styles, with the introduction of the colonnade and the use of Greek architectural motifs in Egyptian structures. This period also saw the development of the Roman-Egyptian style, which incorporated elements of both Greek and Roman architecture.

#### The Influence of Egyptian Architecture on Modern Architecture

The principles of Egyptian architecture are deeply rooted in the cultural and religious beliefs of the ancient Egyptians. The most fundamental principle is the concept of maat, a term that encompasses truth, order, and harmony. This principle is reflected in the symmetry and balance of Egyptian architecture, with structures designed to reflect the cosmic order.

Another key principle is the use of symbolism. Egyptian architecture is filled with symbolic elements, each with a specific meaning. For example, the pyramid, with its geometric perfection and association with the afterlife, symbolizes the eternal nature of the pharaoh. Similarly, the use of columns and capitals in Egyptian architecture is not just for structural support, but also to symbolize important plants and deities.

#### The Techniques of Egyptian Architecture

The techniques used in Egyptian architecture are a testament to the ingenuity and skill of the ancient Egyptians. The use of mud brick, for instance, allowed for the rapid construction of large structures, while the use of stone, particularly limestone and granite, allowed for the creation of durable and long-lasting structures.

The post and lintel method of construction, where a series of vertical posts support a horizontal lintel, was a key technique used in Egyptian architecture. This method allowed for the creation of large, open spaces, such as those found in temples and palaces.

Another important technique is the use of astronomical alignment. Many Egyptian structures, particularly temples, were aligned with specific astronomical events, such as the rising of the sun on the winter solstice. This technique was a way of asserting the power of the pharaoh over the cosmos.

#### The Influence of Egyptian Architecture on Modern Architecture

The influence of Egyptian architecture on modern architecture is profound. The principles and techniques of Egyptian architecture have been studied and adapted by architects throughout history, from the ancient Greeks to modern architects.

The principles of symmetry and balance, for instance, have been incorporated into many modern architectural styles, from the classical revival to the minimalist modern. Similarly, the use of symbolism in Egyptian architecture has been adopted by many modern architects, with symbols and motifs used to convey specific meanings or themes.

The techniques of Egyptian architecture, such as the use of mud brick and the post and lintel method, have also been adapted and incorporated into modern architecture. The use of sustainable and locally sourced materials, for instance, is a direct descendant of the ancient Egyptian practice of using mud brick.

In conclusion, the influence of Egyptian architecture extends far beyond the borders of Egypt and continues to shape architectural design today. The principles and techniques of Egyptian architecture have had a profound impact on the development of architectural theory and practice, and continue to inspire architects around the world.

The Islamic period marked a pivotal point in the architectural history of Cairo. The city was captured by the Fatimid Caliphate in 969, leading to a significant shift in its architectural style. The Fatimids, who were Shia Muslims, introduced a new architectural vocabulary that was heavily influenced by their Persian and Syrian heritage.

The Fatimids also constructed a series of grand palaces and mosques, including the Al-Azhar Mosque, which remains one of the oldest and most prestigious institutions of Islamic learning in the world. These structures were not only architectural marvels, but also symbols of the Fatimids' political power and religious authority.

#### 14.1b.2 The Ayyubid Period

The Ayyubid period, which lasted from the 12th to the 13th century, saw further developments in Cairo's architectural landscape. The Ayyubids, who were Sunni Muslims, built upon the architectural legacy of the Fatimids, while also introducing their own unique style. This included the use of more austere and geometric designs, as well as the integration of elements from the Crusader architecture that they had encountered during their campaigns in the Levant.

The Ayyubids also expanded the city's walls and gates, further fortifying Cairo against external threats.

As the city continues to grow and modernize, there is a constant struggle to balance the need for development with the preservation of the city's historical and cultural identity. In this section, we will explore the development of preservation efforts in Cairo, from early initiatives to current strategies.

#### Early Preservation Efforts

The first efforts to preserve Cairo's architectural heritage can be traced back to the 19th century, during the reign of Muhammad Ali Pasha. He recognized the importance of preserving the city's historical monuments and established the Department of Antiquities in 1858. This department was responsible for the preservation and restoration of ancient Egyptian monuments, including those in Cairo.

In the early 20th century, there was a renewed interest in preserving Cairo's architectural heritage. This was largely due to the efforts of the Egyptian government, which recognized the economic benefits of preserving the city's historical sites for tourism.

#### 15.3b The Development of the Preservation of Egypt

The preservation of Egypt's architectural heritage has evolved significantly over time. The early efforts were primarily focused on the protection of the physical structures, often through restoration and reconstruction[^12^]. However, as the understanding of the cultural and historical values associated with these structures grew, so did the focus on their preservation.

#### The Evolution of Preservation Strategies

The evolution of preservation strategies in Egypt can be broadly categorized into three phases: the early phase, the modern phase, and the sustainable phase.

In the early phase, the primary focus was on the physical preservation of structures. This was often achieved through restoration and reconstruction, which involved the removal of later additions and the rebuilding of damaged parts[^13^]. This approach was heavily influenced by the Western tradition of preservation, which emphasized the physical integrity of the original structure[^14^].

The modern phase saw a shift towards a more holistic approach to preservation. This included the recognition of the cultural and historical values associated with the structures, as well as the importance of community involvement in preservation efforts[^15^]. This phase was marked by the development of strategies such as adaptive reuse, which involves repurposing historical structures for modern use, and community archaeology, which involves the participation of local communities in archaeological research[^16^].

The sustainable phase, which is ongoing, is characterized by a focus on sustainable practices in preservation. This includes the use of sustainable materials and technologies, as well as the integration of preservation efforts into broader urban planning and development strategies[^17^]. This phase recognizes the need to balance the preservation of architectural heritage with the needs of the present and future generations.

#### The Role of International Cooperation

International cooperation has played a crucial role in the preservation of Egypt's architectural heritage. The British School of Archaeology in Egypt, for instance, has been instrumental in the preservation of ancient Egyptian architecture[^18^]. The school's excavations at Tell el-Dab'a, for example, have provided valuable insights into the architecture of the Middle Kingdom[^19^].

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has also played a significant role in the preservation of Egypt's architectural heritage. Through its World Heritage Convention, UNESCO has recognized several Egyptian sites as World Heritage sites, including the Pyramids of Giza, the Temple of Abu Simbel, and the Ancient City of Thebes[^20^]. These designations provide a framework for the preservation and protection of these sites.

In conclusion, the preservation of Egypt's architectural heritage has evolved significantly over time, reflecting the changing understanding of the cultural and historical values associated with these structures. The ongoing efforts are focused on sustainable practices that balance the preservation of architectural heritage with the needs of the present and future generations. International cooperation, particularly through organizations like the British School of Archaeology and UNESCO, has been instrumental in these efforts.

This chapter will provide a detailed examination of the various aspects of Cairo's revitalization, including its historical, architectural, and urban planning dimensions.

One of the key aspects of Cairo's revitalization is its focus on preserving and restoring the city's historic buildings and neighborhoods. This includes the Fatimid and Ayyubid walls, which were built during the Fatimid and Ayyubid dynasties. These walls are composed of three vertical levels, with the lower level elevated above the street and containing the vestibules of the gates, which were accessible by ramps. The second level contained halls that connected different galleries and rooms, while the third level was used for defense purposes. The walls are a testament to the city's rich history and cultural heritage, and their preservation is a top priority in the revitalization process.

In addition to preserving the city's historic buildings, the revitalization of Cairo also involves creating new and sustainable urban spaces. This includes the development of green spaces, such as parks and gardens, which not only improve the aesthetic appeal of the city but also provide much-needed green spaces for its residents. The revitalization process also involves the use of sustainable building materials and techniques, such as green roofs and rainwater harvesting, to reduce the city's environmental impact.

The revitalization of Cairo is a collaborative effort involving the government, private sector, and community organizations.

### Subsection: 17.1b The Development of the Revitalization of Cairo

The revitalization of Cairo has been a complex and multifaceted process, involving various stakeholders and initiatives. In this section, we will explore the development of the revitalization of Cairo, focusing on the key initiatives and projects that have been undertaken.

#### The Role of the Aga Khan Development Network

One of the key players in the revitalization of Cairo has been the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN). The AKDN is a group of private, non-denominational development agencies that work to improve the quality of life of people in the developing world. In Cairo, the AKDN has been instrumental in the revitalization of the city, particularly in the area of Darb al-Ahmar.

The AKDN's work in Darb al-Ahmar began in 1986 with the establishment of the Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme. This program aimed to conserve and revitalize the historic urban fabric of Darb al-Ahmar, which is home to over 60 historical monuments. The AKDN's efforts have been focused on preserving the architectural heritage of the area, while also improving the living conditions of its inhabitants.

#### The Al-Azhar Park Project

Another significant initiative in the revitalization of Cairo has been the Al-Azhar Park project. This project, which was completed in 2005, involved the transformation of a 7.5-acre site adjacent to the Al-Azhar Mosque into a public park. The park was designed by the renowned landscape architect Michel Desvigne and has become a popular destination for both locals and tourists.

The Al-Azhar Park project not only provided a much-needed green space in the heart of Cairo, but it also had a significant impact on the surrounding neighborhood of Darb al-Ahmar. The park's construction led to the uncovering of the Ayyubid wall, which shed light on the area's rich architectural heritage. This discovery sparked a renewed interest in the revitalization of Darb al-Ahmar, leading to further initiatives and projects.

#### The Revitalization of Downtown Cairo

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the revitalization of Downtown Cairo, also known as Khedival Cairo. This area, which is home to many of Cairo's historic buildings and monuments, has been facing neglect and decay. The government and private sector have been working together to restore and revitalize Downtown Cairo, with a focus on preserving its architectural heritage while also improving its livability.

The revitalization of Downtown Cairo has been marked by a series of cosmetic improvements, including the repainting of facades and the replacement of store signage. However, there have also been efforts to address the deeper issues facing the area, such as lack of education, sanitation, and hygiene. The AKDC foundation, for example, has been working to improve the living conditions of the inhabitants of Darb al-Ahmar, while also preserving its architectural heritage.

#### The Future of Cairo's Revitalization

The revitalization of Cairo is an ongoing process, and there are still many challenges and opportunities ahead. The AKDN, for example, is currently working on a project to restore the historic buildings of the Darb al-Ahmar neighborhood. The government has also announced plans to transform the area around the Pyramids into a world-class tourist destination, with a focus on preserving the city's architectural heritage.

In addition to these initiatives, there is also a growing movement towards sustainable urban development in Cairo. This includes efforts to improve public transportation, reduce waste, and promote green spaces. The revitalization of Cairo is not just about preserving its architectural heritage, but also about creating a livable and sustainable city for its inhabitants.

### Conclusion

The revitalization of Cairo has been a complex and multifaceted process, involving various stakeholders and initiatives. The Aga Khan Development Network, the Al-Azhar Park project, and the revitalization of Downtown Cairo have all played significant roles in the city's revitalization. However, there is still much work to be done, and the future of Cairo's revitalization will require continued efforts and collaboration.

Its architecture has been shaped by various cultural influences, political ideologies, and technological advancements over the centuries. In this chapter, we will explore the reinterpretation of Cairo, focusing on how the city's architecture has been redefined and reshaped in the modern era.

The reinterpretation of Cairo is a multifaceted topic that encompasses a wide range of architectural styles, from the traditional Islamic and indigenous designs to the modern skyscrapers and urban developments. It is a reflection of the city's evolution from a medieval Islamic city to a bustling metropolis in the 21st century.

We will delve into the historical context of Cairo's architecture, examining the key architectural movements and styles that have shaped the city's built environment. We will also explore the social, cultural, and economic factors that have influenced the reinterpretation of Cairo's architecture.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the reinterpretation of Cairo, shedding light on the city's architectural evolution and its significance in the broader context of urban development.

### Subsection: 18.1a The Introduction to the Reinterpretation of Cairo

The reinterpretation of Cairo is a complex and multifaceted topic that requires a deep understanding of the city's history, culture, and architecture. In this section, we will explore the various factors that have influenced the reinterpretation of Cairo, including the city's historical context, cultural influences, and modern architectural trends.

#### The Historical Context of Cairo

Cairo, founded in the 10th century CE, is one of the oldest and most historically significant cities in the world. Its architecture has been shaped by a rich tapestry of cultural influences, from the ancient Egyptians to the Islamic conquerors and the modern urban planners. The city's history is deeply intertwined with its architecture, and understanding this history is crucial to understanding the reinterpretation of Cairo.

The city's architectural evolution can be traced back to the ancient Egyptian civilization, which was characterized by the use of stone as a dominant medium of communication. The Nile, with its fertile land and abundant water, played a crucial role in the development of ancient Egyptian civilization. The river acted as a principle of order and centralization, necessitating collective work, creating solidarity, and imposing organizations on the people. This observation is reminiscent of Innis's earlier work on the economic influence of waterways and other geographical features in his book, "The Fur Trade in Canada", first published in 1930. However, in "Empire and Communications", Innis extends his economic analysis to explore the influence of the Nile on religion, associating the river with the sun god Ra, creator of the universe.

#### Cultural Influences on Cairo's Architecture

The cultural influences on Cairo's architecture are diverse and complex. The city's architecture has been shaped by the various cultural groups that have inhabited it, including the ancient Egyptians, the Islamic conquerors, and the modern urban planners. Each of these groups has left its mark on the city's architecture, resulting in a rich tapestry of architectural styles and traditions.

The ancient Egyptians, for instance, were known for their use of stone and hieroglyphics, which were used to express the idea of royal immortality. The idea of the divine right of autocratic monarchs was developed from 2895 BC to 2540 BC, and this is reflected in the grandeur and majesty of the ancient Egyptian architecture. The pyramids, for example, are a testament to the power and grandeur of the ancient Egyptian kings.

The Islamic conquerors, on the other hand, introduced a new architectural style to Cairo. The Mamluk architecture, characterized by its use of brick and stone, was heavily influenced by the Islamic tradition. The Mamluk sultans, who ruled Egypt from the 13th to 16th centuries, built grand mosques, madrasas, and palaces that are still standing today. These buildings are a testament to the Islamic influence on Cairo's architecture.

#### Modern Architectural Trends in Cairo

In recent years, Cairo has undergone a significant architectural transformation. The city's modern architecture is characterized by a blend of traditional and modern elements, reflecting the city's rich history and its embrace of modernity. The city's skyline is dotted with modern skyscrapers, but these are often designed in a way that respects the city's architectural heritage.

The reinterpretation of Cairo's architecture is also influenced by the city's urban planning policies. The Egyptian government has implemented various urban planning initiatives to address the city's rapid growth and urbanization. These initiatives aim to create a more livable and sustainable city, while also preserving the city's architectural heritage.

In conclusion, the reinterpretation of Cairo is a complex and multifaceted topic that requires a deep understanding of the city's history, culture, and architecture. The city's architectural evolution has been shaped by a rich tapestry of cultural influences, from the ancient Egyptians to the Islamic conquerors and the modern urban planners.

### Subsection: 18.3a The Introduction to the Reinterpretation of Egypt

The reinterpretation of Egypt has been a complex and ongoing process, shaped by a multitude of factors including political ideologies, cultural influences, and technological advancements. This section will explore the various ways in which Egypt has been reinterpreted, with a particular focus on the role of architecture in this process.

#### The Reinterpretation of Egypt: A Historical Overview

The reinterpretation of Egypt can be traced back to the early 20th century, when the country was under British colonial rule. During this period, Egyptian intellectuals began to question the dominant narrative of Egyptian history, which was largely shaped by Western scholars and historians. This led to a reinterpretation of Egypt's past, with a focus on emphasizing the country's unique cultural identity and heritage.

This reinterpretation was further influenced by the rise of nationalism and the desire for self-determination in the early 20th century. The Egyptian nationalist movement sought to reclaim the country's history and culture from Western influences, leading to a renewed interest in ancient Egyptian civilization and its architectural legacy.

#### The Role of Architecture in the Reinterpretation of Egypt

Architecture played a crucial role in the reinterpretation of Egypt. The country's rich architectural heritage, dating back to ancient times, was seen as a symbol of the country's unique cultural identity. The preservation and restoration of ancient Egyptian architectural sites became a key aspect of the reinterpretation process, with the aim of showcasing the country's architectural legacy to both domestic and international audiences.

However, the reinterpretation of Egypt also involved a modernization of the country's architectural landscape. The rise of modernist architecture in the mid-20th century led to a shift in architectural styles, with a focus on incorporating elements of traditional Egyptian architecture into modern designs. This blending of traditional and modern architectural styles has been a defining feature of the reinterpretation of Egypt, reflecting the country's ongoing evolution and its efforts to balance tradition and modernity.

#### The Influence of the Nile

The Nile River, which has played a central role in the history and culture of Egypt, has also been a key factor in the reinterpretation of the country. The river's significance as a source of life and fertility has been emphasized in the reinterpretation of Egypt, with a focus on preserving and celebrating the country's agricultural heritage. This has been reflected in the design of various architectural projects, such as the High Dam in Aswan, which was built to harness the power of the Nile for irrigation and hydroelectric purposes.

#### The Reinterpretation of Egypt Today

Today, the reinterpretation of Egypt continues to evolve, with a focus on balancing the country's rich cultural heritage with modernity. The preservation and restoration of ancient architectural sites remains a key aspect of this process, while also incorporating elements of traditional architecture into modern designs. The reinterpretation of Egypt also involves a continued exploration of the country's architectural legacy, with ongoing research and excavations at ancient sites.

In conclusion, the reinterpretation of Egypt has been a complex and ongoing process, shaped by a multitude of factors. Architecture has played a crucial role in this process, reflecting the country's efforts to balance tradition and modernity while also preserving its unique cultural identity. The Nile River has also been a key factor, symbolizing the country's agricultural heritage and its ongoing evolution.

### Subsection: 19.1a The Introduction to the Reimagining of Cairo

The city of Cairo has been a hub of architectural innovation and evolution for centuries. From the grandeur of the ancient pyramids to the intricate details of Islamic architecture, the city has been a testament to the architectural prowess of its inhabitants. However, as the city continues to grow and modernize, it faces new challenges and opportunities that require a reimagining of its architectural landscape.

In this section, we will explore the reimagining of Cairo, a city that has been constantly evolving and adapting to the changing needs and desires of its people. We will delve into the various architectural styles and techniques that have been used to shape the city, and how they have been adapted and modified over time. From the traditional mud-brick structures to the modern glass and steel skyscrapers, we will examine the evolution of Cairo's architecture and how it has shaped the city's identity.

One of the key factors driving the reimagining of Cairo is the need for sustainable and livable urban spaces. As the city continues to grow, it faces challenges such as overcrowding, pollution, and resource depletion. To address these issues, architects and urban planners have been tasked with creating innovative and sustainable solutions that preserve the city's historical and cultural heritage while meeting the needs of its modern inhabitants.

One such example is the rehabilitation project on Al-Mu'izz Street, which aims to turn the street into an "open-air museum". This project, carried out by the national government, involves extensive renovations to the historical buildings, modern buildings, paving, and sewerage. The aim is to approximate the original appearance of the street, while also modernizing its nighttime appearance with state-of-the-art lighting. This project not only preserves the city's historical heritage, but also creates a more livable and attractive space for its inhabitants.

Another aspect of the reimagining of Cairo is the use of innovative architectural techniques. For example, the construction of the Cairo Tower, a 61-story skyscraper, has been a groundbreaking project in terms of its design and construction. The tower, which is the tallest building in Africa, was built using a unique technique that involved constructing the tower from the top down.

#### 19.3a The Introduction to the Reimagining of Egypt

The reimagining of Egypt has been a complex and multifaceted process, shaped by a variety of factors including political ideology, economic considerations, and cultural influences. This section will explore the various aspects of this process, examining how they have intersected to create a new architectural landscape in Egypt.

#### 19.3b The Role of Political Ideology in the Reimagining of Egypt

Political ideology has played a significant role in the reimagining of Egypt. The country's history is deeply intertwined with the ideals of Pan-Africanism, a movement that seeks to unite all Africans, regardless of ethnicity, into a single political entity. This ideology has been a driving force behind the reimagining of Egypt, with many architects and urban planners seeking to create a new architectural landscape that reflects the country's African heritage.

The Pan-Africanist ideology has been particularly influential in the design of public spaces in Egypt. For instance, the Tahrir Square, a central public space in Cairo, has been redesigned to reflect the ideals of Pan-Africanism. The square now features a large statue of the African continent, symbolizing the unity of all Africans. This redesign has not only transformed the physical appearance of the square but also its symbolic significance, reinforcing the idea of a unified African identity.

#### 19.3c The Influence of Economic Considerations on the Reimagining of Egypt

Economic considerations have also played a crucial role in the reimagining of Egypt. The country's economy is heavily reliant on tourism, and the government has been keen to modernize the country's architectural landscape to attract more tourists. This has led to the adoption of Western architectural styles and design elements, which are seen as more appealing to foreign visitors.

The reimagining of Egypt has also been influenced by the country's economic relations with other countries. For instance, Egypt's close ties with China have led to the adoption of Chinese architectural styles in some parts of the country. This has resulted in a unique blend of Eastern and Western architectural influences, reflecting Egypt's position as a bridge between the East and the West.

#### 19.3d The Impact of Cultural Influences on the Reimagining of Egypt

Cultural influences have also played a significant role in the reimagining of Egypt. The country's rich cultural heritage, characterized by a blend of ancient Egyptian, Islamic, and Christian influences, has been a source of inspiration for many architects and urban planners. This has led to the incorporation of traditional architectural elements into modern designs, creating a unique architectural style that reflects the country's cultural diversity.

The reimagining of Egypt has also been influenced by the country's diaspora communities, particularly those in the United States. The Egyptian American community, for instance, has been instrumental in promoting the use of Egyptian Revival architecture in the country. This architectural style, which draws inspiration from ancient Egyptian architecture, has been used in a variety of buildings, from private homes to public structures, creating a sense of continuity between the country's ancient past and its modern present.

In conclusion, the reimagining of Egypt has been a complex process, shaped by a variety of factors.

The Nile River, which has been a source of life and wealth for Egypt for thousands of years, continues to play a crucial role in the country's economy. The river's fertile lands have supported agriculture, and its waters have been harnessed for irrigation and hydroelectric power. The Nile's economic importance is reflected in the architecture of the country, with many buildings and structures located along the river.

The reimagining of Egypt has also been influenced by the country's economic challenges. The country has faced economic instability in recent years, with periods of high inflation and currency devaluation. These challenges have led to a focus on cost-effective and sustainable architectural solutions. For instance, the use of locally available materials and traditional construction techniques has been encouraged to reduce costs and promote sustainability.

In conclusion, economic considerations have played a significant role in the reimagining of Egypt.

The use of communal spaces in modern architecture, such as public parks and plazas, can be seen as a revival of this ancient tradition.

The Islamic influence in Egypt, introduced during the Middle Ages, has also shaped the country's social architecture. The Islamic tradition emphasizes the importance of community and social cohesion, which is reflected in the architectural design of mosques and other Islamic structures. The integration of these elements into modern architecture has resulted in a sense of community and social cohesion in urban spaces.

The Christian influence in Egypt, particularly in the Coptic Orthodox Church, has also contributed to the social architecture of the country. The Coptic tradition emphasizes the importance of community and social responsibility, which is reflected in the architectural design of Coptic churches and other Christian structures. The use of communal spaces in modern architecture, such as community centers and churches, can be seen as a revival of this ancient tradition.

The reimagining of Egypt has also been influenced by the country's social relations with other countries.
