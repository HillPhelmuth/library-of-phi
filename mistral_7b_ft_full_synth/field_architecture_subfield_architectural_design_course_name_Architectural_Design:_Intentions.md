### Section: 2.1 Set-up Space:

In the previous chapter, we discussed the importance of understanding the site and its context in architectural design. Now, we will delve into the next step in the design process - setting up the design space. This is a crucial step as it lays the foundation for the entire design and determines the direction of the project.

#### 2.1a Space Requirements

The first step in setting up the design space is to determine the space requirements. This involves understanding the functional needs of the project and translating them into spatial requirements. For example, a residential building may require a certain number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and living spaces, while a commercial building may require a specific floor area for office spaces, meeting rooms, and storage areas.

To assist in this process, architects often use space planning software, such as AutoCAD or Revit, to create 2D floor plans and 3D models. These tools allow architects to visualize the space and make adjustments to meet the space requirements.

#### 2.1b Design Intent

Once the space requirements have been determined, the next step is to establish the design intent. This involves defining the overall vision and goals for the project. The design intent is the guiding principle behind the design and is often influenced by the site context, client needs, and architectural style.

The design intent can be communicated through various means, such as sketches, diagrams, and written descriptions. These tools allow architects to convey their ideas and intentions to clients, engineers, and other stakeholders.

#### 2.1c Design Tools

In addition to space planning software, architects also use various design tools to create and communicate their designs. These tools include computer-aided design (CAD) software, building information modeling (BIM) software, and rendering software.

CAD software, such as AutoCAD or Revit, is used to create detailed 2D drawings and 3D models. These tools allow architects to accurately represent the design and make necessary adjustments.

BIM software, such as Revit or ArchiCAD, is used to create a digital representation of the building. This allows architects to coordinate all the building systems, such as structure, mechanical, and electrical, and identify potential clashes or conflicts.

Rendering software, such as SketchUp or Lumion, is used to create realistic visualizations of the design. This allows architects to communicate the design intent and showcase the design to clients.

#### 2.1d Design Process

The design process is an iterative one, with architects constantly refining and adjusting the design based on feedback and input from clients, engineers, and other stakeholders. This process involves a series of design phases, including schematic design, design development, and construction documentation.

In the schematic design phase, architects use sketches and diagrams to explore different design ideas and concepts. This allows them to quickly test and refine their ideas before moving on to more detailed design development.

In the design development phase, architects use CAD and BIM software to create more detailed and accurate representations of the design. This allows them to address any design issues and make necessary adjustments.

In the construction documentation phase, architects create detailed drawings and specifications that are used to construct the building. This includes drawings for the structure, mechanical, electrical, and other building systems.

#### 2.1e Design Review

Before moving on to construction, it is important for architects to conduct a design review. This involves reviewing the design with clients, engineers, and other stakeholders to ensure that all requirements and intentions have been met. This allows for any final adjustments to be made and ensures that the design is ready for construction.

In conclusion, setting up the design space is a crucial step in the architectural design process. It involves understanding the space requirements, establishing the design intent, and using various design tools and processes to create and communicate the design. By carefully setting up the design space, architects can ensure that their designs are successful and meet the needs and intentions of all stakeholders.

#### 2.1c Design Tools

In addition to space planning software and communication tools, architects also use various design tools to create and analyze their designs. These tools can range from hand-drawn sketches to computer-aided design (CAD) software.

One such tool is the use of grids and modules in architectural design. Grids and modules are essential in the design process as they provide a structured and organized approach to creating a design. They allow architects to break down a larger space into smaller, more manageable parts, making it easier to visualize and manipulate the design.

Grids can be used to define the overall layout of a space, while modules can be used to create repetitive elements within the design. By using grids and modules, architects can create a sense of order and consistency in their designs, while also allowing for flexibility and adaptability.

In the next section, we will explore the use of grids and modules in more detail and how they can be applied in architectural design.





### Section: 2.2 Exercise 1: Drawing the Body:

In this section, we will explore the process of drawing the human body, a fundamental skill for architects. The human body is a complex and intricate structure, and understanding its form and proportions is crucial for creating realistic and functional architectural spaces.

#### 2.2a Drawing Techniques

To begin, let's discuss some basic drawing techniques that will be useful in drawing the human body. These techniques include:

- **Perspective:** Perspective is the way in which objects appear to recede into the distance. In architectural drawing, perspective is used to create a sense of depth and distance. This is achieved by using vanishing points, where lines that are parallel in reality appear to converge in the distance.

- **Proportion:** Proportion refers to the relative size of different parts of the body. In architectural drawing, it is important to accurately represent the proportions of the human body to create a realistic and believable figure.

- **Shading:** Shading is the process of adding depth and texture to a drawing. In architectural drawing, shading is used to create a sense of volume and form. This is achieved by using different levels of darkness and lightness to create a sense of depth and texture.

- **Line Weight:** Line weight refers to the thickness of lines in a drawing. In architectural drawing, line weight is used to create a sense of hierarchy and importance. Thicker lines are often used to represent more important or dominant elements, while thinner lines are used for less important or background elements.

Now that we have a basic understanding of these drawing techniques, let's apply them to drawing the human body.

#### 2.2b Drawing the Human Body

Drawing the human body is a complex task that requires a combination of technical skills and artistic ability. Here are some steps to guide you through the process:

1. **Start with the Skeleton:** Begin your drawing by sketching out the basic skeleton of the human body. This will help you understand the overall form and proportions of the body.

2. **Add Muscles and Soft Tissue:** Once you have the skeleton, add in the muscles and soft tissue. This will help to create a more realistic and lifelike figure.

3. **Add Details:** Next, add in the details such as hair, facial features, and clothing. This will help to bring your drawing to life.

4. **Shade and Add Texture:** Use shading and line weight to add depth and texture to your drawing. This will help to create a sense of volume and form.

5. **Refine and Finalize:** Finally, take some time to refine and finalize your drawing. This may involve making adjustments to proportions, adding more details, or making other changes to improve the overall quality of your drawing.

By following these steps and using the drawing techniques discussed earlier, you can create a realistic and lifelike drawing of the human body. This skill will be invaluable in your architectural design career, as it will allow you to accurately represent the human form in your architectural spaces.

Now that we have a basic understanding of these drawing techniques, let's apply them to drawing the human body.

#### 2.2b Body Proportions

In this subsection, we will focus on the proportions of the human body. As mentioned earlier, proportion refers to the relative size of different parts of the body. In architectural drawing, it is crucial to accurately represent the proportions of the human body to create a realistic and believable figure.

To begin, let's establish some basic proportions of the human body. The average height of an adult male is around 175 cm, while the average height of an adult female is around 165 cm. The average width of the shoulders is around 40 cm, while the average width of the hips is around 35 cm. These are just average measurements and can vary depending on the individual.

When drawing the human body, it is important to keep these proportions in mind. However, it is also important to note that the human body is not perfectly symmetrical. There may be slight variations in proportions from one side to the other, and this should be reflected in the drawing.

In addition to overall proportions, it is also important to consider the proportions of different body parts. For example, the head is typically around 1/7 of the overall height of the body, while the arms are typically around 1/4 of the overall height. These proportions can also vary depending on the individual, but it is important to keep them in mind when drawing the human body.

In conclusion, understanding and accurately representing body proportions is crucial for creating realistic and believable architectural drawings. By keeping these proportions in mind and using techniques such as perspective and shading, architects can effectively communicate their design intentions through their drawings.

<Inline citations|date=April 2021>

Sketch-based modeling is a method of creating 3D models for use in 3D computer graphics applications. Sketch-based modeling is differentiated from other types of 3D modeling by its interface - instead of creating a 3D model by directly editing polygons, the user draws a 2D shape which is converted to 3D automatically by the application.

## Purpose

Many computer users think that traditional 3D modeling programs such as Blender or Maya have a high learning curve. Novice users often have difficulty creating models in traditional modeling programs without first completing a lengthy series of tutorials. Sketch-based modeling tools aim to solve this problem by creating a User interface which is similar to drawing, which most users are familiar with.

### Uses

Sketch-based modeling is primarily designed for use by persons with artistic ability, but no experience with 3D modeling programs. However, sketch-based modeling is also used for other applications. One popular application is rapid modeling of low-detail objects for use in prototyping and design work.

## Operation

There are two main types of sketch-based modeling: freehand and guided. In freehand sketch-based modeling, the user draws a 2D shape on the screen, and the application automatically converts it to a 3D model. In guided sketch-based modeling, the user is guided through a series of steps to create the 3D model.

### Subsection: 3.3a Sketching Techniques

Sketching is a fundamental skill for architects, as it allows them to quickly and easily communicate their design ideas. In the context of site visits and analysis, sketching is a valuable tool for capturing and communicating observations and ideas.

#### Hand Sketching

Hand sketching is the most basic form of sketching and involves drawing a 2D representation of a 3D object or scene. This technique is particularly useful for capturing the overall form and composition of a site or building. Hand sketching is a quick and intuitive way to explore design ideas and make notes during a site visit.

#### Computer Sketching

With the advent of digital technology, computer sketching has become an increasingly popular technique. Computer sketching programs, such as Adobe Photoshop or Autodesk Sketchbook, allow for more precise and detailed sketches to be created. These programs also offer a range of tools and features that can aid in the design process.

#### Sketch-based Modeling

As mentioned earlier, sketch-based modeling is a method of creating 3D models using a 2D sketch as a starting point. This technique is particularly useful for architects who are not familiar with traditional 3D modeling programs. Sketch-based modeling allows for a more intuitive and natural way of creating 3D models, making it a valuable tool for architectural design.

### Conclusion

Sketching is a fundamental skill for architects and is an essential tool for site visits and analysis. Whether it be hand sketching, computer sketching, or sketch-based modeling, the ability to quickly and effectively communicate design ideas is crucial in the architectural design process. As technology continues to advance, it is important for architects to embrace and utilize these digital sketching tools to enhance their design process.

### Subsection: 3.3b Problem Solving Through Sketching

Sketching is a powerful tool for problem solving in architectural design. It allows designers to quickly explore and evaluate design ideas, and to communicate these ideas to others. In this section, we will discuss the role of sketching in problem solving, and how it can be used to facilitate the design process.

#### The Role of Sketching in Problem Solving

Sketching is a form of visual thinking, and it is particularly useful in the early stages of the design process when ideas are being generated and evaluated. Sketches allow designers to quickly explore and test design ideas, and to see how these ideas might look in the real world. This can be particularly helpful when trying to solve complex design problems, as it allows designers to see the problem from different perspectives and to try out different solutions.

Moreover, sketching can also be a form of problem solving in itself. By sketching out a problem, designers can often see the problem in a new light, and can come up with creative solutions that they might not have thought of otherwise. This is because sketching allows designers to engage with the problem in a more tangible and concrete way, and to see the problem in its spatial and physical dimensions.

#### Sketching as a Communication Tool

In addition to its role in problem solving, sketching is also a powerful communication tool. Sketches can be used to communicate design ideas to others, whether it be to clients, colleagues, or other stakeholders. Sketches can convey the essence of a design idea in a way that written descriptions or computer models often cannot. They can also be used to facilitate discussion and collaboration, as they provide a common ground for all parties to refer to and build upon.

#### Sketching Techniques

There are many different techniques for sketching, and each designer will have their own preferences and styles. However, there are some common techniques that are particularly useful for problem solving. These include:

- **Conceptual Sketching**: This involves sketching out the basic form and layout of a design idea, without worrying about details or dimensions. This can be particularly useful for generating and evaluating design ideas.
- **Perspective Sketching**: This involves sketching a design idea from a specific perspective, to give a sense of its three-dimensionality. This can be particularly useful for communicating the spatial qualities of a design.
- **Annotated Sketching**: This involves adding notes and annotations to a sketch, to explain the design idea or to highlight certain aspects of it. This can be particularly useful for communicating complex design ideas.

In the next section, we will discuss how sketching can be used in the context of site visits and analysis.
