## Foreward

Welcome to "Convex Analysis and Optimization: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications"! This book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of convex analysis and optimization, a powerful tool used in various fields such as engineering, economics, and machine learning.

Convex analysis and optimization is a branch of mathematics that deals with finding the optimal solution to a problem, given a set of constraints. It is a fundamental concept in many areas of study, and its applications are vast and diverse. This book will delve into the theory behind convex analysis and optimization, as well as provide practical examples and algorithms for solving real-world problems.

One of the key concepts in convex analysis and optimization is the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. This algorithm is used to solve convex optimization problems, and it is particularly useful when dealing with large-scale problems. The algorithm works by finding the optimal solution to a linear approximation of the original problem, and then iteratively improving upon it. This approach allows for efficient and accurate solutions to complex problems.

In this book, we will explore the theory behind the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, as well as its applications in various fields. We will also discuss the concept of lower bounds on the solution value, and how they can be used to determine the quality of the solution. This will involve a deeper dive into the concept of primal-dual analysis, and how it can be used to analyze the performance of the algorithm.

We will also cover the concept of the αΒΒ algorithm, a second-order deterministic global optimization algorithm. This algorithm is particularly useful for finding the optima of general, twice continuously differentiable functions. We will explore its theory and applications, and how it can be used in conjunction with the Frank-Wolfe algorithm.

This book is intended for advanced undergraduate students at MIT, but it can also serve as a valuable resource for researchers and professionals in various fields. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of convex analysis and optimization, and to equip readers with the necessary tools to apply these concepts in their own work.

We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for those interested in convex analysis and optimization, and we look forward to seeing the impact it will have in the field. Thank you for choosing to embark on this journey with us.

## Chapter 1: The role of convexity in optimization:




### Subsection: 1.1a Convexity and convex sets

Convexity is a fundamental concept in mathematics that has been extensively studied and applied in various fields. It is a property of functions that allows us to simplify the optimization process and guarantee the existence of optimal solutions. In this section, we will explore the basics of convexity and its implications in optimization.

#### Convex Sets

A set $S \subseteq X$ in a topological vector space (TVS) $X$ is said to be convex if for any two points $x, y \in S$, the line segment connecting them is also contained in $S$. In other words, for any $x, y \in S$, the set $tx + (1-t)y$ is contained in $S$ for all $t \in [0, 1]$. This property is important because it allows us to easily visualize and understand the behavior of convex functions.

The convex hull of a set $S$ is the smallest convex set that contains $S$. It is equal to the set of all elements in $S$ that are finite linear combinations of the form $t_1 s_1 + \cdots + t_n s_n$ where $n \geq 1$ is an integer, $s_1, \ldots, s_n \in S$ and $t_1, \ldots, t_n \in [0, 1]$ sum to $1$. This property is useful because it allows us to express any point in the convex hull as a combination of points in $S$, making it easier to work with.

#### Convex Functions

A function $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ is said to be convex if for any two points $x, y \in X$, the function $f$ is always above the line segment connecting them. In other words, for any $x, y \in X$, the function $f$ satisfies the following inequality:

$$
f(tx + (1-t)y) \leq tf(x) + (1-t)f(y)
$$

for all $t \in [0, 1]$. This property is important because it allows us to easily visualize and understand the behavior of convex functions. It also allows us to simplify the optimization process, as we can focus on optimizing convex functions without worrying about the existence of optimal solutions.

#### Convex Optimization

Convex optimization is a powerful tool that allows us to solve optimization problems involving convex functions and convex constraints. It is particularly useful because it guarantees the existence of optimal solutions and allows us to use efficient algorithms to find them.

In convex optimization, we are interested in optimizing a convex function subject to convex constraints. This means that the objective function and all constraints are convex, and the feasible region is a convex set. The goal is to find the optimal solution, which is the point that minimizes the objective function while satisfying all constraints.

Convex optimization has many applications in various fields, including machine learning, signal processing, and control systems. It is a fundamental concept in convex analysis and optimization, and understanding its role in optimization is crucial for solving real-world problems.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of convex optimization problems and their applications in more detail. We will also cover the theory behind convex optimization, including duality and sensitivity analysis. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of the role of convexity in optimization and its applications.


## Chapter: Convex Analysis and Optimization: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications




### Subsection: 1.1b Convex functions and their properties

Convex functions play a crucial role in convex optimization. In this section, we will explore some important properties of convex functions and how they can be used to simplify the optimization process.

#### Convexity and Optimality

One of the key properties of convex functions is that they have a unique minimum value. This means that if a function is convex, then any local minimum is also a global minimum. This property is useful because it allows us to easily identify the optimal solution to an optimization problem.

#### Convexity and Linear Combinations

Another important property of convex functions is that they are closed under linear combinations. This means that if we have two convex functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, then the linear combination $h(x) = af(x) + bg(x)$ is also convex, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. This property is useful because it allows us to easily construct new convex functions from existing ones.

#### Convexity and Concavity

Convex functions are closely related to concave functions. In fact, a function is convex if and only if its second derivative is non-negative. This property is useful because it allows us to easily identify concave functions, which are important in convex optimization.

#### Convexity and Convex Sets

Convex functions are also closely related to convex sets. In fact, a function is convex if and only if its epigraph is a convex set. This property is useful because it allows us to easily visualize and understand the behavior of convex functions.

#### Convexity and Optimization

Convex functions are particularly useful in optimization because they have many desirable properties. For example, the sum of two convex functions is convex, and the infimal convolution of two convex functions is convex. These properties allow us to easily construct new convex functions from existing ones, making it easier to solve optimization problems.

In the next section, we will explore some algorithms for solving convex optimization problems. These algorithms will take advantage of the properties of convex functions to efficiently find the optimal solution.


## Chapter 1: The role of convexity in optimization:




### Subsection: 1.1c Convex combinations and convex hulls

Convex combinations and convex hulls are important concepts in convex analysis and optimization. In this section, we will explore these concepts and their properties.

#### Convex Combinations

A convex combination of points $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ is a point $y$ that can be written as a linear combination of these points, where the coefficients are non-negative and sum to 1. In other words, $y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i x_i$, where $\lambda_i \geq 0$ for all $i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i = 1$. This concept is closely related to the concept of a convex function, as a function is convex if and only if all of its second derivatives are non-negative.

#### Convex Hulls

The convex hull of a set $S$ is the smallest convex set that contains all the points in $S$. In other words, it is the intersection of all convex sets that contain $S$. The convex hull can be computed efficiently using Chan's algorithm, which takes $O(n \log h)$ time, where $h$ is the number of vertices of the output convex hull. This algorithm combines an $O(n \log n)$ algorithm (such as the Graham scan) with Jarvis march, in order to obtain an optimal $O(n \log h)$ time.

#### Properties of Convex Combinations and Convex Hulls

Convex combinations and convex hulls have several important properties that make them useful in convex analysis and optimization. For example, the convex hull of a set $S$ is equal to the convex hull of the extreme points of $S$. This means that the extreme points of a set are the points that cannot be written as a convex combination of other points in the set. Additionally, the convex hull of a set is always a convex set, and the extreme points of a convex hull are always extreme points of the original set.

#### Applications of Convex Combinations and Convex Hulls

Convex combinations and convex hulls have many applications in convex analysis and optimization. For example, they are used in linear programming, where the feasible region is a convex hull, and the optimal solution is a convex combination of the extreme points. They are also used in convex optimization, where the objective function is a convex combination of convex functions. Additionally, convex combinations and convex hulls are used in computational geometry, where they are used to solve problems such as finding the convex hull of a set of points.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of convex sets and their properties, and how they relate to convex combinations and convex hulls.


## Chapter: Convex Analysis and Optimization: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications




### Subsection: 1.2a Definition and properties

Epigraphs are an important concept in convex analysis and optimization. They are defined as the set of all points above a given convex function. In other words, the epigraph of a function $f$ is given by the set of all points $(x, y)$ such that $y \geq f(x)$. This concept is closely related to the concept of convexity, as a function is convex if and only if its epigraph is a convex set.

#### Properties of Epigraphs

Epigraphs have several important properties that make them useful in convex analysis and optimization. For example, the epigraph of a convex function is always a convex set. This means that the set of all points above a convex function is itself a convex set. Additionally, the epigraph of a convex function is always closed, meaning that it contains all of its limit points. This is important because it allows us to use optimization algorithms that rely on the convexity of the epigraph.

#### Applications of Epigraphs

Epigraphs have many applications in convex analysis and optimization. For example, they are used in the definition of convex functions, as mentioned earlier. They are also used in the definition of convex sets, as the epigraph of a function is always a convex set. Additionally, epigraphs are used in the definition of convex optimization problems, where the goal is to minimize a convex function over a convex set. This allows us to use efficient optimization algorithms to solve these problems.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, epigraphs are an important concept in convex analysis and optimization. They are defined as the set of all points above a given convex function and have several important properties that make them useful in solving convex optimization problems. In the next section, we will explore some specific examples of epigraphs and their applications in more detail.

## Chapter 1: The role of convexity in optimization:




### Section 1.3 Closed convex functions:

In the previous section, we discussed the properties of convex functions. In this section, we will focus on a specific type of convex function - closed convex functions.

#### 1.3a Definition and properties

A function $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ is said to be closed if its epigraph, denoted by $epi(f)$, is a closed set. In other words, the epigraph of a closed function is a closed subset of $X \times \mathbb{R}$. This property is important in convex analysis as it allows us to define the concept of a closed convex function.

A function $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ is said to be convex if its epigraph is a convex set. In other words, the epigraph of a convex function is a convex subset of $X \times \mathbb{R}$. This property is closely related to the convexity of a function, as we saw in the previous section.

Now, let us define a closed convex function. A function $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ is said to be closed convex if it is both closed and convex. This means that the epigraph of a closed convex function is a closed and convex subset of $X \times \mathbb{R}$.

Closed convex functions have several important properties that make them useful in convex analysis and optimization. Some of these properties are:

1. The infimal convolution of two closed convex functions is also a closed convex function. This property is useful in optimization problems, as it allows us to construct a closed convex function from two closed convex functions.
2. The sum of two closed convex functions is also a closed convex function. This property is useful in optimization problems, as it allows us to construct a closed convex function from two closed convex functions.
3. The sublevel sets of a closed convex function are convex and compact. This property is useful in optimization problems, as it allows us to define a feasible region for a convex optimization problem.
4. The convex hull of a closed convex function is also a closed convex function. This property is useful in convex analysis, as it allows us to define the convex hull of a closed convex function.
5. The convex combination of two closed convex functions is also a closed convex function. This property is useful in convex analysis, as it allows us to define the convex combination of two closed convex functions.

These properties make closed convex functions a powerful tool in convex analysis and optimization. In the next section, we will explore some applications of closed convex functions in optimization problems.


## Chapter 1: The role of convexity in optimization:




### Subsection 1.3b Examples of closed convex functions

In this subsection, we will explore some examples of closed convex functions. These examples will help us understand the concept of closed convex functions better and see how they are used in optimization problems.

#### 1.3b.1 Linear functions

Linear functions are a simple example of closed convex functions. A linear function is defined as $f(x) = c$ for all $x \in X$, where $c$ is a constant. The epigraph of a linear function is a straight line, which is both closed and convex. Therefore, linear functions are closed convex functions.

#### 1.3b.2 Constant functions

Constant functions are another example of closed convex functions. A constant function is defined as $f(x) = c$ for all $x \in X$, where $c$ is a constant. The epigraph of a constant function is a single point, which is both closed and convex. Therefore, constant functions are closed convex functions.

#### 1.3b.3 Polynomial functions

Polynomial functions are a more complex example of closed convex functions. A polynomial function is defined as $f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_ix^i$, where $a_i$ are constants and $n$ is a non-negative integer. The epigraph of a polynomial function is a convex polyhedron, which is both closed and convex. Therefore, polynomial functions are closed convex functions.

#### 1.3b.4 Exponential functions

Exponential functions are an example of closed convex functions that are not polynomial functions. An exponential function is defined as $f(x) = e^x$ for all $x \in X$. The epigraph of an exponential function is a convex cone, which is both closed and convex. Therefore, exponential functions are closed convex functions.

#### 1.3b.5 Convex combinations

Convex combinations are a more general example of closed convex functions. A convex combination is defined as $f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i f_i(x)$, where $f_i(x)$ are closed convex functions, $\lambda_i$ are non-negative constants, and $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i = 1$. The epigraph of a convex combination is a convex polyhedron, which is both closed and convex. Therefore, convex combinations are closed convex functions.

In conclusion, closed convex functions are important in convex analysis and optimization because of their properties. They are used to define the feasible region in optimization problems and to construct more complex functions from simpler ones. In the next section, we will explore the concept of convexity in more detail and see how it is used in optimization problems.


## Chapter 1: The role of convexity in optimization:




### Subsection 1.4a Criteria for convexity

In the previous section, we discussed some examples of closed convex functions. In this section, we will explore the criteria for convexity. A function is convex if it satisfies the following conditions:

1. Convexity at a point: A function $f(x)$ is convex at a point $x_0$ if for all $x \geq x_0$, the function $f(x)$ is either constant or increasing.
2. Convexity on an interval: A function $f(x)$ is convex on an interval $[a, b]$ if for all $x \in [a, b]$, the function $f(x)$ is either constant or increasing.
3. Convexity on a set: A function $f(x)$ is convex on a set $S$ if for all $x \in S$, the function $f(x)$ is either constant or increasing.

These conditions can be used to determine whether a function is convex or not. However, they are not always easy to apply in practice. Therefore, we will also discuss some other criteria for convexity that are more useful in practice.

#### 1.4a.1 Convexity of the epigraph

The epigraph of a function $f(x)$ is the set of all points $(x, y)$ such that $y \geq f(x)$. The epigraph of a function is convex if and only if the function is convex. This means that we can determine the convexity of a function by examining its epigraph.

#### 1.4a.2 Convexity of the sublevel sets

The sublevel sets of a function $f(x)$ are the sets of all points $x$ such that $f(x) \leq c$ for some constant $c$. The sublevel sets of a function are convex if and only if the function is convex. This means that we can determine the convexity of a function by examining its sublevel sets.

#### 1.4a.3 Convexity of the Hessian matrix

The Hessian matrix of a function $f(x)$ is the matrix of second derivatives of the function. The Hessian matrix of a function is positive semidefinite if and only if the function is convex. This means that we can determine the convexity of a function by examining its Hessian matrix.

#### 1.4a.4 Convexity of the domain

The domain of a function $f(x)$ is the set of all points $x$ such that $f(x)$ is defined. The domain of a function is convex if and only if the function is convex. This means that we can determine the convexity of a function by examining its domain.

In the next section, we will explore some algorithms for recognizing convex functions. These algorithms will provide a practical way to determine the convexity of a function.


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the role of convexity in optimization. We have seen how convex functions and convex sets play a crucial role in optimization problems, providing a framework for solving these problems efficiently and effectively. We have also discussed the properties of convex functions and sets, and how these properties can be used to solve optimization problems.

We have learned that convex functions are continuous, differentiable, and have a unique minimum. We have also seen that convex sets are closed, bounded, and have a non-empty interior. These properties make convex functions and sets ideal for optimization problems, as they allow us to use efficient algorithms and techniques to find the optimal solution.

Furthermore, we have explored the concept of convexity in higher dimensions, and how it can be extended to more complex optimization problems. We have also discussed the importance of convexity in real-world applications, such as machine learning and signal processing.

In conclusion, the role of convexity in optimization is crucial, providing a powerful tool for solving a wide range of optimization problems. By understanding the properties of convex functions and sets, we can develop efficient and effective algorithms for solving these problems.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of duality theory, a fundamental concept in the field of convex analysis and optimization. Duality theory is a powerful tool that allows us to understand the relationship between primal and dual problems, and how they can be used to solve complex optimization problems.

The concept of duality is deeply rooted in mathematics, dating back to the early 19th century when mathematicians began studying the duality between lines and planes in geometry. However, it was not until the mid-20th century that the concept was formally introduced in the context of optimization by Leonid Kantorovich and Hugo Döblin.

In the realm of convex analysis and optimization, duality theory plays a pivotal role. It provides a framework for understanding the structure of convex sets and functions, and how they can be used to solve optimization problems. The duality theory also introduces the concept of dual variables, which are used to represent the constraints in a primal problem.

In this chapter, we will explore the theory behind duality, including the concepts of primal and dual problems, dual variables, and the strong duality theorem. We will also discuss the algorithms used to solve dual problems, such as the dual simplex method and the dual ellipsoid method. Finally, we will look at some applications of duality theory in various fields, including linear programming, convex optimization, and machine learning.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of duality theory and its applications in convex analysis and optimization. You will also be equipped with the knowledge to apply these concepts to solve real-world problems. So, let's embark on this exciting journey into the world of duality theory.




### Section: 2.1 Algorithms and duality:

#### 2.1a Dual problem formulation

The dual problem is a fundamental concept in convex analysis and optimization. It is a mathematical representation of the constraints in a primal problem, expressed in terms of dual variables. The dual problem is used to solve the primal problem, and it provides a powerful tool for understanding the structure of the primal problem.

The dual problem is formulated as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{maximize} \quad & \mathbf{c}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{d}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{y} \\
\text{subject to} \quad & A \mathbf{x} + B \mathbf{y} \geq \mathbf{b} \\
& y \in Y \\
\end{align*}
$$

where $\mathbf{c}$ and $\mathbf{d}$ are vectors of coefficients, $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are vectors of decision variables, $A$ and $B$ are matrices of coefficients, and $Y$ is the feasible set for $\mathbf{y}$. The dual problem is a maximization problem, and it is dual to the primal problem, which is a minimization problem.

The dual problem can be rewritten in an equivalent minimax form:

$$
\min_{\mathbf{y} \in Y} \left[ \mathbf{d}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{y} + \max_{\mathbf{u} \geq \mathbf{0}} \left\{ (\mathbf{b} - B \mathbf{y})^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{u} \mid A^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{u} \leq \mathbf{c} \right\} \right].
$$

This formulation is known as the minimax formulation, and it is used in the Benders decomposition algorithm. The Benders decomposition algorithm is an iterative procedure that chooses successive values of $\mathbf{y}$ without considering the inner problem except through a set of cut constraints that are created through a pass-back mechanism from the maximization problem.

The dual problem provides a powerful tool for understanding the structure of the primal problem. It allows us to express the constraints in the primal problem in terms of dual variables, and it provides a framework for solving the primal problem. The dual problem is used in many algorithms for solving convex optimization problems, including the Benders decomposition algorithm and the dual simplex method.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the theory behind duality, including the concepts of primal and dual problems, dual variables, and the strong duality theorem. We will also discuss the algorithms used to solve dual problems, such as the dual simplex method and the dual ellipsoid method. Finally, we will look at some applications of duality theory in various fields, including linear programming, convex optimization, and machine learning.

#### 2.1b Duality gap

The duality gap is a fundamental concept in convex analysis and optimization. It is the difference between the optimal values of the primal and dual problems. The duality gap provides a measure of the optimality of the solution to the primal problem.

The duality gap is defined as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{duality gap} \quad & = \mathbf{c}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{d}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{y} - (\mathbf{b} - B \mathbf{y})^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{u} \\
\end{align*}
$$

where $\mathbf{c}$ and $\mathbf{d}$ are vectors of coefficients, $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are vectors of decision variables, $A$ and $B$ are matrices of coefficients, and $Y$ is the feasible set for $\mathbf{y}$. The duality gap is a scalar value, and it is non-negative for all feasible solutions to the primal and dual problems.

The duality gap is zero if and only if the primal and dual problems have the same optimal value. In this case, the solution to the primal problem is optimal, and the solution to the dual problem is a certificate of optimality.

The duality gap is positive if the primal and dual problems have different optimal values. In this case, the solution to the primal problem is not optimal, and the duality gap provides a measure of the optimality of the solution.

The duality gap is a key concept in convex analysis and optimization. It provides a measure of the optimality of the solution to the primal problem, and it is used in many algorithms for solving convex optimization problems. In the next section, we will discuss some of these algorithms and their applications.

In the next section, we will discuss some of these algorithms and their applications. We will also discuss some of the key concepts in duality theory, including the dual problem and the duality gap.

#### 2.1d Duality theory in machine learning

Duality theory has found significant applications in the field of machine learning, particularly in the areas of support vector machines (SVMs) and neural networks. The duality theory provides a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of these models and for developing efficient algorithms for training them.

In the context of SVMs, the duality theory is used to derive the dual problem, which is a mathematical representation of the constraints in the primal problem, expressed in terms of dual variables. The dual problem is used to solve the primal problem, and it provides a powerful tool for understanding the structure of the primal problem.

The duality theory is also used in the training of neural networks. The duality theory provides a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of the network and for developing efficient algorithms for training it. The duality theory is particularly useful in the context of backpropagation, where it is used to derive the dual problem and to develop efficient algorithms for training the network.

#### 2.1c Algorithms for solving dual problems

In the previous section, we discussed the duality gap and optimality conditions. In this section, we will explore algorithms for solving dual problems.

The dual problem is a mathematical representation of the constraints of the primal problem. It is used to find the optimal solution to the primal problem. The dual problem is defined as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{dual problem} &= \text{minimize} \mathbf{b}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{u} \\
\text{subject to} \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{B} \mathbf{y} &= \mathbf{c} \\
\mathbf{C} \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{D} \mathbf{y} &\leq \mathbf{d} \\
\mathbf{x} &\geq \mathbf{0}
\end{align*}
$$

The dual problem can be solved using various algorithms, including the Lagrange dual method, the Remez algorithm, and the Gauss-Seidel method.

The Lagrange dual method is an algorithm based on solving a dual Lagrangian problem. It provides an efficient way to solve the dual problem. The Lagrange dual method is defined as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Lagrange dual method} &= \text{minimize} \mathbf{b}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{u}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{r} \\
\text{subject to} \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{B} \mathbf{y} &= \mathbf{c} \\
\mathbf{C} \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{D} \mathbf{y} &\leq \mathbf{d} \\
\mathbf{x} &\geq \mathbf{0}
\end{align*}
$$

The Remez algorithm is a numerical algorithm for solving nonlinear optimization problems. It is based on the concept of implicit data structures and has been applied to solving problems in various fields, including computer graphics and image processing. The Remez algorithm is defined as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Remez algorithm} &= \text{minimize} \mathbf{b}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{u}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{r} \\
\text{subject to} \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{B} \mathbf{y} &= \mathbf{c} \\
\mathbf{C} \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{D} \mathbf{y} &\leq \mathbf{d} \\
\mathbf{x} &\geq \mathbf{0}
\end{align*}
$$

The Gauss-Seidel method is an iterative algorithm for solving linear systems of equations. It is based on the concept of implicit k-d trees and has been applied to solving problems in various fields, including computer graphics and image processing. The Gauss-Seidel method is defined as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Gauss-Seidel method} &= \text{minimize} \mathbf{b}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{u}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{r} \\
\text{subject to} \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{B} \mathbf{y} &= \mathbf{c} \\
\mathbf{C} \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{D} \mathbf{y} &\leq \mathbf{d} \\
\mathbf{x} &\geq \mathbf{0}
\end{align*}
$$

In the next section, we will explore the applications of these algorithms in solving real-world problems.




### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the concept of duality theory in convex analysis and optimization. We have seen how duality theory provides a powerful tool for solving optimization problems, by transforming a primal problem into a dual problem and vice versa. This allows us to solve complex optimization problems by breaking them down into simpler dual problems, and then using the duality gap to guide the solution process.

We have also discussed the importance of convexity in duality theory, and how it ensures that the dual problem is always feasible and bounded. This is a crucial property that allows us to apply the strong duality theorem, which states that the optimal solutions of the primal and dual problems are related by the strong duality gap.

Furthermore, we have seen how duality theory can be applied to a wide range of optimization problems, including linear, quadratic, and convex optimization problems. This makes duality theory a versatile and powerful tool in the field of convex analysis and optimization.

In conclusion, duality theory is a fundamental concept in convex analysis and optimization, providing a powerful framework for solving optimization problems. Its applications are vast and diverse, making it an essential topic for anyone studying convex analysis and optimization.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the concept of duality theory in convex analysis and optimization. We have seen how duality theory provides a powerful tool for solving optimization problems, by transforming a primal problem into a dual problem and vice versa. This allows us to solve complex optimization problems by breaking them down into simpler dual problems, and then using the duality gap to guide the solution process.

We have also discussed the importance of convexity in duality theory, and how it ensures that the dual problem is always feasible and bounded. This is a crucial property that allows us to apply the strong duality theorem, which states that the optimal solutions of the primal and dual problems are related by the strong duality gap.

Furthermore, we have seen how duality theory can be applied to a wide range of optimization problems, including linear, quadratic, and convex optimization problems. This makes duality theory a versatile and powerful tool in the field of convex analysis and optimization.

In conclusion, duality theory is a fundamental concept in convex analysis and optimization, providing a powerful framework for solving optimization problems. Its applications are vast and diverse, making it an essential topic for anyone studying convex analysis and optimization.

### Subsection: 3.1a Definition and properties

#### 3.1aa Definition of Convex and Affine Hulls

The convex hull of a set $S$ is the smallest convex set that contains $S$. It is defined as the intersection of all convex sets that contain $S$. Mathematically, the convex hull of $S$, denoted by $\operatorname{co} S$, is given by:

$$
\operatorname{co} S = \bigcap_{C \in \mathcal{C}} C
$$

where $\mathcal{C}$ is the set of all convex sets that contain $S$.

The affine hull of a set $S$, denoted by $\operatorname{aff} S$, is the smallest affine set that contains $S$. An affine set is a set that is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. The affine hull of $S$ is given by:

$$
\operatorname{aff} S = \bigcap_{A \in \mathcal{A}} A
$$

where $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of all affine sets that contain $S$.

The convex hull and affine hull of a set are closely related. In fact, the affine hull of a set is always a subset of its convex hull. This is because every affine set is convex, but not every convex set is affine. Therefore, the affine hull of a set can be seen as a "core" of the convex hull, containing only the affine parts of the convex hull.

#### 3.1a Properties of Convex and Affine Hulls

The convex hull and affine hull of a set have several important properties that make them useful in convex analysis and optimization. These properties are:

1. **Linearity:** The convex hull and affine hull of a set are both convex and affine, respectively. This means that they are closed under addition and scalar multiplication.

2. **Finite intersection property:** The intersection of any finite number of convex (respectively, affine) sets is convex (respectively, affine). This property is used in the definition of the convex hull and affine hull.

3. **Maximal property:** The convex hull (respectively, affine hull) of a set is the intersection of all convex (respectively, affine) sets that contain the set. This property is also used in the definition of the convex hull and affine hull.

4. **Stability under convex combinations:** If $S$ is a set and $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ are points in the convex hull (respectively, affine hull) of $S$, then any convex combination of $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ is also in the convex hull (respectively, affine hull) of $S$. This property is useful in proving theorems about convex and affine hulls.

5. **Relationship between convex and affine hulls:** As mentioned earlier, the affine hull of a set is always a subset of its convex hull. This relationship is important in many applications of convex and affine hulls.

In the next section, we will explore the algorithms for computing the convex and affine hulls of a set.

#### 3.1a Properties of Convex and Affine Hulls (Continued)

5. **Relationship between convex and affine hulls (continued):** The affine hull of a set $S$ can be seen as a "core" of the convex hull of $S$. This means that the affine hull of $S$ is always a subset of the convex hull of $S$. This relationship is important in many applications of convex and affine hulls.

6. **Finite representation:** The convex hull and affine hull of a set can be represented as the convex hull and affine hull of a finite subset of the set. This property is useful in many algorithms for computing the convex and affine hulls of a set.

7. **Stability under translation:** If $S$ is a set and $x$ is a point, then the convex hull (respectively, affine hull) of $S + x$ is the translation of the convex hull (respectively, affine hull) of $S$ by $x$. This property is useful in many applications of convex and affine hulls.

8. **Stability under scaling:** If $S$ is a set and $k$ is a positive scalar, then the convex hull (respectively, affine hull) of $kS$ is the scaling of the convex hull (respectively, affine hull) of $S$ by $k$. This property is useful in many applications of convex and affine hulls.

9. **Stability under intersection:** If $S_1$ and $S_2$ are sets, then the convex hull (respectively, affine hull) of $S_1 \cap S_2$ is the intersection of the convex hull (respectively, affine hull) of $S_1$ and the convex hull (respectively, affine hull) of $S_2$. This property is useful in many applications of convex and affine hulls.

10. **Stability under union:** If $S_1$ and $S_2$ are sets, then the convex hull (respectively, affine hull) of $S_1 \cup S_2$ is the union of the convex hull (respectively, affine hull) of $S_1$ and the convex hull (respectively, affine hull) of $S_2$. This property is useful in many applications of convex and affine hulls.

These properties make the convex hull and affine hull of a set powerful tools in convex analysis and optimization. They allow us to understand the structure of convex and affine sets, and to develop efficient algorithms for computing them. In the next section, we will explore some of these algorithms in more detail.

#### 3.1b Examples of Convex and Affine Hulls

In this section, we will explore some examples of convex and affine hulls to further understand their properties and applications.

##### Example 1: Convex Hull of a Set

Consider the set $S = \{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\}$, where $x_1 = (1, 2, 3)$, $x_2 = (2, 3, 4)$, $x_3 = (3, 4, 5)$, and $x_4 = (4, 5, 6)$. The convex hull of $S$ can be represented as the convex hull of the subset $\{x_1, x_2, x_3\}$. This is because the point $x_4$ can be expressed as a convex combination of the points $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$.

The affine hull of $S$ can be seen as a "core" of the convex hull of $S$. This means that the affine hull of $S$ is always a subset of the convex hull of $S$. In this case, the affine hull of $S$ is the set $\{x_1, x_2, x_3\}$.

##### Example 2: Affine Hull of a Set

Consider the set $S = \{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\}$, where $x_1 = (1, 2, 3)$, $x_2 = (2, 3, 4)$, $x_3 = (3, 4, 5)$, and $x_4 = (4, 5, 6)$. The affine hull of $S$ can be represented as the affine hull of the subset $\{x_1, x_2, x_3\}$. This is because the point $x_4$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the points $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$.

The convex hull of $S$ is a subset of the affine hull of $S$. This is because the convex hull of a set is always a convex subset of the affine hull of the set. In this case, the convex hull of $S$ is the set $\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\}$.

These examples illustrate the relationship between the convex hull and affine hull of a set. They also demonstrate the stability properties of these hulls under translation, scaling, intersection, and union. These properties are useful in many applications of convex and affine hulls.

#### 3.1c Applications of Convex and Affine Hulls

In this section, we will explore some applications of convex and affine hulls. These applications demonstrate the power and versatility of these concepts in various fields.

##### Application 1: Linear Programming

Linear programming is a powerful optimization technique that is used to solve a wide range of problems. The simplex algorithm, a popular method for solving linear programming problems, relies heavily on the concept of convex hulls. The algorithm starts at a vertex of the feasible region and iteratively moves to adjacent vertices until an optimal solution is found. The convex hull of the feasible region plays a crucial role in determining the direction of these moves.

##### Application 2: Convexity Checks

Convexity checks are used to determine whether a set or a function is convex. The convex hull of a set can be used to check whether the set is convex. If the convex hull of a set is equal to the set itself, then the set is convex. Similarly, the affine hull of a set can be used to check whether the set is affine. If the affine hull of a set is equal to the set itself, then the set is affine.

##### Application 3: Geometric Interpretation of Convexity

The convex hull and affine hull of a set provide a geometric interpretation of convexity and affinity. The convex hull of a set is the smallest convex set that contains the set. The affine hull of a set is the smallest affine set that contains the set. These interpretations can be useful in visualizing and understanding convex and affine sets.

##### Application 4: Algorithmic Efficiency

The properties of convex and affine hulls can be used to design efficient algorithms. For example, the finite representation property of convex and affine hulls can be used to design algorithms that compute these hulls in finite time. Similarly, the stability properties of these hulls can be used to design algorithms that are robust to small perturbations.

In conclusion, convex and affine hulls are fundamental concepts in convex analysis and optimization. They have a wide range of applications and properties that make them indispensable tools in the study of convex sets and functions.




#### 3.1b Convex Hulls and Affine Hulls of Sets

The convex hull and affine hull of a set are fundamental concepts in convex analysis and optimization. They provide a way to capture the essential structure of a set in a simpler, more manageable form. In this section, we will delve deeper into these concepts and explore their properties and applications.

#### 3.1b Convex Hulls and Affine Hulls of Sets

The convex hull and affine hull of a set are defined as the smallest convex and affine sets, respectively, that contain the set. In other words, the convex hull of a set $S$ is the intersection of all convex sets that contain $S$, and the affine hull of $S$ is the intersection of all affine sets that contain $S$.

The convex hull and affine hull of a set have several important properties that make them useful in convex analysis and optimization. These properties are:

1. **Linearity:** The convex hull and affine hull of a set are both convex and affine, respectively. This means that they are closed under addition and scalar multiplication.

2. **Finite intersection property:** The intersection of any finite number of convex (respectively, affine) sets is convex (respectively, affine). This property is used in the definition of the convex hull and affine hull.

3. **Maximal property:** The convex hull (respectively, affine hull) of a set is the intersection of all convex (respectively, affine) sets that contain the set. This property is also used in the definition of the convex hull and affine hull.

4. **Relationship between convex and affine hulls:** The affine hull of a set is always a subset of its convex hull. This is because every affine set is convex, but not every convex set is affine. Therefore, the affine hull of a set can be seen as a "core" of the convex hull, containing only the affine parts of the convex hull.

5. **Relationship with convex combinations:** Every element of the convex hull of a set can be expressed as a convex combination of elements in the set. Similarly, every element of the affine hull of a set can be expressed as an affine combination of elements in the set. This property is useful in many optimization problems.

6. **Relationship with extreme points and rays:** The extreme points of the convex hull of a set are those elements that cannot be expressed as a convex combination of other elements in the set. Similarly, the extreme rays of the affine hull of a set are those elements that cannot be expressed as an affine combination of other elements in the set. These extreme points and rays play a crucial role in many optimization problems.

In the next section, we will explore these properties in more detail and discuss their implications for convex analysis and optimization.

#### 3.1c Examples and counterexamples

In this section, we will explore some examples and counterexamples to further illustrate the concepts of convex and affine hulls.

##### Example 1: Convex Hull of a Set

Consider the set $S = \{a, b, c\}$, where $a = (1, 2, 3)$, $b = (4, 5, 6)$, and $c = (7, 8, 9)$. The convex hull of $S$ is the intersection of all convex sets that contain $S$. One such set is the convex hull of $\{a, b\}$, which is the set of all points $(x, y, z)$ such that $x \leq 4$ and $y \leq 5$. Therefore, the convex hull of $S$ is the set of all points $(x, y, z)$ such that $x \leq 4$ and $y \leq 5$.

##### Example 2: Affine Hull of a Set

Consider the set $S = \{a, b, c\}$, where $a = (1, 2, 3)$, $b = (4, 5, 6)$, and $c = (7, 8, 9)$. The affine hull of $S$ is the intersection of all affine sets that contain $S$. One such set is the affine hull of $\{a, b\}$, which is the set of all points $(x, y, z)$ such that $x + y + z = 10$. Therefore, the affine hull of $S$ is the set of all points $(x, y, z)$ such that $x + y + z = 10$.

##### Counterexample 1: Affine Hull is Not Always a Subset of the Convex Hull

Consider the set $S = \{a, b, c\}$, where $a = (1, 2, 3)$, $b = (4, 5, 6)$, and $c = (7, 8, 9)$. The affine hull of $S$ is the set of all points $(x, y, z)$ such that $x + y + z = 10$. However, the convex hull of $S$ is the set of all points $(x, y, z)$ such that $x \leq 4$ and $y \leq 5$. The affine hull is not a subset of the convex hull, as the point $(3, 3, 4)$ is in the affine hull but not in the convex hull.

##### Counterexample 2: Convex Hull is Not Always a Subset of the Affine Hull

Consider the set $S = \{a, b, c\}$, where $a = (1, 2, 3)$, $b = (4, 5, 6)$, and $c = (7, 8, 9)$. The convex hull of $S$ is the set of all points $(x, y, z)$ such that $x \leq 4$ and $y \leq 5$. However, the affine hull of $S$ is the set of all points $(x, y, z)$ such that $x + y + z = 10$. The convex hull is not a subset of the affine hull, as the point $(4, 5, 1)$ is in the convex hull but not in the affine hull.

These examples and counterexamples illustrate the important properties of convex and affine hulls. They also highlight the fact that while the convex hull and affine hull of a set are always convex and affine, respectively, they are not always equal.




#### 3.2a Statement and proof of Caratheodory's theorem

Caratheodory's theorem is a fundamental result in convex analysis that provides a characterization of convex functions. It is named after the German mathematician Constantin Caratheodory. The theorem is particularly useful in the study of differentiable convex functions, as it provides a way to express a convex function as a sum of affine functions.

##### Statement of Caratheodory's Theorem

Caratheodory's theorem can be stated as follows:

Let $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ be a convex function. Then, for every $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, there exists a set of at most $n+1$ affine functions $g_1, g_2, ..., g_{n+1}$ such that $f(x) = \min_{i=1}^{n+1} g_i(x)$.

In other words, every convex function can be expressed as the minimum of a finite number of affine functions. This is a powerful result because affine functions are easy to work with, and many important functions, such as linear functions and exponential functions, are affine.

##### Proof of Caratheodory's Theorem

The proof of Caratheodory's theorem is based on the concept of the convex hull. The convex hull of a set $S$ is the intersection of all convex sets that contain $S$. It is easy to see that the convex hull of a set is always convex.

Let $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ be a convex function. For every $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, the set $S = \{x\}$ is convex. Therefore, the convex hull of $S$ is also convex. By the definition of the convex hull, there exists a set of at most $n+1$ convex sets $C_1, C_2, ..., C_{n+1}$ that contain $S$. Each of these sets is affine, and therefore, each of the functions $g_i(x) = \min_{y \in C_i} f(y)$ is affine. Since $S \subseteq C_i$ for each $i$, we have $f(x) = \min_{i=1}^{n+1} g_i(x)$.

This proves Caratheodory's theorem. The key idea is to express the convex function $f$ as the minimum of a finite number of affine functions $g_i$. This allows us to reduce the study of convex functions to the study of affine functions, which are much simpler.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of Caratheodory's theorem for the study of differentiable convex functions.

#### 3.2b Applications of Caratheodory's theorem

Caratheodory's theorem has a wide range of applications in convex analysis and optimization. In this section, we will explore some of these applications, focusing on their relevance to differentiable convex functions.

##### Convexity of Differential Distance Function

The differential distance function, as introduced in the context, is a key concept in convex analysis. It is defined as the function $d_C(x) = \min_{y \in C} \|x-y\|$, where $C$ is a convex set. The convexity of this function is crucial for many optimization problems.

Caratheodory's theorem provides a way to express the differential distance function as the minimum of a finite number of affine functions. This is particularly useful when dealing with differentiable convex functions, as it allows us to express the function as a sum of affine functions. This is important because affine functions are easy to work with, and many important functions, such as linear functions and exponential functions, are affine.

##### Convexity of Differential Convexity

The differential convexity of a function is another important concept in convex analysis. It is defined as the function $D_C(x) = \min_{y \in C} \|x-y\|^2$. Like the differential distance function, the convexity of this function is crucial for many optimization problems.

#### 3.2b Applications of Caratheodory's theorem

Caratheodory's theorem has a wide range of applications in convex analysis and optimization. In this section, we will discuss some of these applications, focusing on their relevance to differentiable convex functions.

##### Convexity of the Exponential Function

One of the most important applications of Caratheodory's theorem is in the study of the exponential function. The exponential function is a fundamental function in mathematics, with applications in many areas, including probability theory, statistics, and physics. It is also a convex function, which is a crucial property for many optimization problems.

The convexity of the exponential function can be proved using Caratheodory's theorem. Let $f(x) = e^x$. For any $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y) = e^{\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y} \leq e^{\lambda x}e^{(1-\lambda)y}$, where the inequality follows from the convexity of the exponential function. By Caratheodory's theorem, there exists a set of at most two affine functions $g_1(x) = e^x$ and $g_2(x) = e^{-x}$ such that $f(x) = \min_{i=1}^{2} g_i(x)$.

##### Convexity of the Logarithm Function

Another important application of Caratheodory's theorem is in the study of the logarithm function. The logarithm function is the inverse of the exponential function, and it is also a convex function. This property is crucial in many optimization problems, particularly in the study of differentiable convex functions.

The convexity of the logarithm function can be proved using Caratheodory's theorem. Let $f(x) = \log(x)$. For any $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y) = \log(\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y) \leq \log(\lambda x) + \log((1-\lambda)y)$, where the inequality follows from the convexity of the logarithm function. By Caratheodory's theorem, there exists a set of at most two affine functions $g_1(x) = \log(x)$ and $g_2(x) = -\log(x)$ such that $f(x) = \min_{i=1}^{2} g_i(x)$.

##### Convexity of the Power Function

The power function $f(x) = x^p$ is another important function in convex analysis and optimization. It is convex for $p \geq 1$, and this property can be proved using Caratheodory's theorem. The proof is similar to the proofs of the convexity of the exponential and logarithm functions, and we omit it here.

In conclusion, Caratheodory's theorem is a powerful tool in the study of differentiable convex functions. It provides a way to express a convex function as the minimum of a finite number of affine functions, which simplifies the analysis of these functions. This theorem has many applications, including the study of the exponential, logarithm, and power functions.

## Chapter: Convex Analysis and Optimization: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the concept of convex sets and their properties. Convex sets are an important topic in convex analysis and optimization, as they have many applications in various fields such as engineering, economics, and machine learning. A set is said to be convex if it contains all the line segments connecting any two of its points. This simple definition has powerful implications and is the basis for many important results in convex analysis.

We will begin by discussing the basic properties of convex sets, such as the convex combination and the extreme points of a convex set. We will then delve into more advanced topics, such as the convex hull and the convex cone. These concepts will be illustrated with examples and applications to provide a deeper understanding of convex sets.

Next, we will explore the concept of convex functions, which are functions that are convex on a convex set. We will discuss the properties of convex functions, such as the convexity of the sum and the infimal convolution. We will also cover important algorithms for solving convex optimization problems, such as the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and the ellipsoid method.

Finally, we will discuss some applications of convex sets and functions in various fields. These applications will demonstrate the versatility and power of convex analysis and optimization. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of convex sets and functions and their applications, and will be equipped with the necessary tools to tackle more advanced topics in convex analysis and optimization.

## Chapter: Convex Analysis and Optimization: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the concept of convex sets and their properties. Convex sets are an important topic in convex analysis and optimization, as they have many applications in various fields such as engineering, economics, and machine learning. A set is said to be convex if it contains all the line segments connecting any two of its points. This simple definition has powerful implications and is the basis for many important results in convex analysis.

We will begin by discussing the basic properties of convex sets, such as the convex combination and the extreme points of a convex set. We will then delve into more advanced topics, such as the convex hull and the convex cone. These concepts will be illustrated with examples and applications to provide a deeper understanding of convex sets.

Next, we will explore the concept of convex functions, which are functions that are convex on a convex set. We will discuss the properties of convex functions, such as the convexity of the sum and the infimal convolution. We will also cover important algorithms for solving convex optimization problems, such as the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and the ellipsoid method.

Finally, we will discuss some applications of convex sets and functions in various fields. These applications will demonstrate the versatility and power of convex analysis and optimization. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of convex sets and functions and their applications, and will be equipped with the necessary tools to tackle more advanced topics in convex analysis and optimization.


## Chapter 4: Convex sets:




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the concepts of relative interior and closure in the context of convex analysis and optimization. These concepts are fundamental to understanding the properties of convex sets and their implications in optimization problems. We will explore the theoretical foundations of these concepts, their algorithms for computation, and their applications in various fields.

The relative interior of a set is a concept that extends the notion of interiority to subsets of a convex set. It is a crucial concept in convex analysis as it allows us to define the relative interior of a face of a convex set, which is a fundamental concept in the study of convex sets. We will discuss the properties of the relative interior, its algorithms for computation, and its applications in optimization problems.

The closure of a set is another important concept in convex analysis. It is the smallest closed set that contains a given set. The closure of a set is particularly useful in optimization problems as it allows us to define the closure of a face of a convex set, which is a fundamental concept in the study of convex sets. We will discuss the properties of the closure, its algorithms for computation, and its applications in optimization problems.

### Section: 4.1 Algebra of convex sets:

#### 4.1a Minkowski sum and difference of convex sets

The Minkowski sum and difference are fundamental operations in the algebra of convex sets. They are named after the German mathematician Hermann Minkowski, who made significant contributions to various fields of mathematics, including number theory, geometry, and functional analysis.

The Minkowski sum of two convex sets $A$ and $B$ is defined as the set of all points that can be written as the sum of a point in $A$ and a point in $B$. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$
A + B = \{x + y | x \in A, y \in B\}
$$

The Minkowski difference of two convex sets $A$ and $B$ is defined as the set of all points that can be written as the difference of a point in $A$ and a point in $B$. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$
A - B = \{x - y | x \in A, y \in B\}
$$

These operations are particularly useful in convex optimization, where they allow us to express the feasible region of a problem as the Minkowski sum of two convex sets. This simplifies the problem and allows us to apply various optimization algorithms.

The Minkowski sum and difference operations are associative and commutative, meaning that the order in which the operations are performed does not matter. This property is crucial in the study of convex sets and their properties.

In the next section, we will explore the properties of the Minkowski sum and difference operations in more detail, including their relationship with the relative interior and closure of convex sets. We will also discuss algorithms for computing these operations and their applications in convex optimization.

#### 4.1b Convex combination and extreme points

Convex combination is another fundamental operation in the algebra of convex sets. It is a generalization of the concept of a linear combination, where the coefficients are restricted to be non-negative and sum to one. 

A convex combination of points $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \in X$ is a point $y \in X$ of the form:

$$
y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i x_i
$$

where $\lambda_i \geq 0$ for all $i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i = 1$. 

The set of all convex combinations of points $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \in X$ is denoted by $\co(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$. 

Convex combinations play a crucial role in convex optimization, as they allow us to express any point in the convex hull of a set as a convex combination of its extreme points. This simplifies the problem and allows us to apply various optimization algorithms.

An extreme point of a convex set $X$ is a point $x \in X$ that cannot be written as a convex combination of other points in $X$. In other words, $x$ is an extreme point of $X$ if and only if $\co(x) = \{x\}$. 

The set of all extreme points of a convex set $X$ is denoted by $\ex(X)$. 

Extreme points are particularly important in convex optimization, as they provide a way to characterize the convex hull of a set. The convex hull of a set $X$ is the smallest convex set that contains $X$, and it can be represented as the convex hull of its extreme points:

$$
\conv(X) = \conv(\ex(X))

An extreme ray of a convex set $X$ is a ray that cannot be written as a convex combination of other rays in $X$. In other words, a ray $r$ is an extreme ray of $X$ if and only if $\co(r) = \{r\}$.

Extreme rays are particularly important in convex optimization, as they provide a way to characterize the convex hull of a set. The convex hull of a set $X$ can be represented as the convex hull of its extreme rays:

$$

#### 4.1b Convex combination and extreme points

Convex combination is a fundamental operation in the algebra of convex sets. It is a generalization of the concept of a linear combination, where the coefficients are restricted to be non-negative and sum to one. 

A convex combination of points $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ is a point $y$ that can be written as:

$$
y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i x_i
$$

where $\lambda_i \geq 0$ for all $i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i = 1$. 

The set of all convex combinations of points $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ is a convex set. This set is often referred to as the convex hull of the points $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$.

The extreme directions of a convex set $C$ are the directions that form the boundary of the convex hull of $C$. They are the directions that cannot be expressed as a convex combination of other directions in $C$.

The extreme directions of a convex set $C$ can be computed using the algorithm proposed by Chan. This algorithm runs in polynomial time and provides a way to compute the extreme directions of the convex hull.

The extreme directions of the convex hull of a set $S$ play a crucial role in convex optimization. They are the directions that correspond to the optimal solutions of linear programming problems.

In the next section, we will explore the properties of convex hull and extreme directions in more detail, including their relationship with the relative interior and closure of convex sets. We will also discuss algorithms for computing these operations and their applications in convex optimization.

#### 4.1z Convex hull and extreme directions

The concept of extreme directions is another important aspect of convex sets. An extreme direction of a convex set $C$ is a direction that cannot be written as a convex combination of other directions in $C$. In other words, an extreme direction $d$ of $C$ satisfies the following property:

$$
d = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i d_i
$$

implies that $d = d_i$ for some $i$ and $\lambda_i = 1$.

#### 4.2a Hahn-Banach separation theorem

The Hahn-Banach separation theorem is a fundamental result in convex analysis and optimization. It provides a method to separate a point from a convex set using a hyperplane. This theorem is named after the German mathematicians Hans Hahn and Stefan Banach.

The theorem states that given a convex set $C$ and a point $x \notin C$, there exists a hyperplane $H$ that separates $x$ from $C$. In other words, there exists a linear function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) < \inf_{y \in C} f(y)$.

The proof of the Hahn-Banach separation theorem is based on the Hahn-Banach theorem, which is a result about the extension of linear functions. The Hahn-Banach theorem states that given a linear function $f: M \to \mathbb{R}$ defined on a vector subspace $M$ of a real vector space $X$, there exists a linear extension $\tilde{f}: X \to \mathbb{R}$ of $f$ such that $\tilde{f}(x) \leq f(x)$ for all $x \in M$.

The proof of the Hahn-Banach separation theorem begins by considering the convex set $C$ and the point $x \notin C$. If $C$ is empty, then the theorem is trivially true. Otherwise, let $M$ be the affine hull of $C$, which is the smallest affine set containing $C$. By the Hahn-Banach theorem, there exists a linear function $f: M \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) \leq \inf_{y \in C} f(y)$.

The proof then proceeds to show that $f(x) < \inf_{y \in C} f(y)$, which implies the existence of a hyperplane $H$ that separates $x$ from $C$. The details of the proof are omitted here, but they can be found in the references provided.

The Hahn-Banach separation theorem has many applications in convex analysis and optimization. For example, it is used in the proof of the convex combination theorem, which states that every convex combination of points in a convex set is also in the set. It is also used in the proof of the extreme point theorem, which states that the extreme points of a convex set are the points that cannot be written as a convex combination of other points in the set.

In the next section, we will explore the properties of the relative interior and closure of convex sets, and how they relate to the Hahn-Banach separation theorem.

#### 4.2b Supporting hyperplane and separation

The concept of a supporting hyperplane is closely related to the Hahn-Banach separation theorem. A hyperplane $H$ is said to support a convex set $C$ at a point $x \in C$ if $H$ contains $x$ and $H \cap C = \{x\}$. In other words, $H$ is a supporting hyperplane of $C$ at $x$ if $H$ is the smallest hyperplane that contains $x$ and does not intersect $C$ except at $x$.

The supporting hyperplane $H$ of $C$ at $x$ can be characterized as the hyperplane that satisfies the following condition:

$$
\inf_{y \in C} \delta(y, H) = \delta(x, H)
$$

where $\delta(x, H)$ is the distance from $x$ to $H$. This condition implies that $x$ is the closest point in $C$ to $H$.

The Hahn-Banach separation theorem can be restated in terms of supporting hyperplanes. Given a convex set $C$ and a point $x \notin C$, there exists a supporting hyperplane $H$ of $C$ at a point $x' \in C$ such that $x' \in C$ and $x' \in H$. This means that $H$ separates $x$ from $C$.

The proof of this restatement of the Hahn-Banach separation theorem is similar to the proof of the original theorem. The key step is to apply the Hahn-Banach theorem to the affine hull of $C$ to obtain a linear function $f: M \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) \leq \inf_{y \in C} f(y)$. This function $f$ can be used to construct a supporting hyperplane $H$ of $C$ at a point $x' \in C$ such that $x' \in C$ and $x' \in H$.

The concept of a supporting hyperplane and the Hahn-Banach separation theorem are fundamental tools in convex analysis and optimization. They provide a way to separate a point from a convex set using a hyperplane, which is often useful in many applications.

#### 4.2c Applications of separation theorems

The separation theorems, including the Hahn-Banach separation theorem and its restatement in terms of supporting hyperplanes, have a wide range of applications in convex analysis and optimization. These theorems provide a powerful tool for separating a point from a convex set, which is often crucial in many optimization problems.

One of the most common applications of the separation theorems is in the field of linear programming. In linear programming, the goal is to maximize a linear function over a convex polytope, which is a finite intersection of half-spaces. The separation theorems can be used to construct a supporting hyperplane for the polytope at a point outside the polytope, which can then be used to formulate a linear programming problem.

Another important application of the separation theorems is in the field of convex optimization. In convex optimization, the goal is to minimize a convex function over a convex set. The separation theorems can be used to construct a supporting hyperplane for the set at a point outside the set, which can then be used to formulate a convex optimization problem.

The separation theorems also have applications in the field of convex geometry. In convex geometry, the goal is to study the geometric properties of convex sets. The separation theorems can be used to construct a supporting hyperplane for a convex set at a point inside the set, which can then be used to study the geometry of the set.

In conclusion, the separation theorems, including the Hahn-Banach separation theorem and its restatement in terms of supporting hyperplanes, are fundamental tools in convex analysis and optimization. They provide a powerful way to separate a point from a convex set, which is often crucial in many optimization problems.




#### 4.2b Supporting hyperplane theorem

The Supporting Hyperplane Theorem is another fundamental result in convex analysis and optimization. It provides a method to find a hyperplane that supports a convex set at a given point. This theorem is named after the concept of a supporting hyperplane, which is a hyperplane that touches a convex set at a point on its boundary.

The theorem states that given a convex set $C$ and a point $x \in \partial C$, there exists a hyperplane $H$ that supports $C$ at $x$. In other words, there exists a linear function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) = \sup_{y \in C} f(y)$.

The proof of the Supporting Hyperplane Theorem is based on the Hahn-Banach separation theorem. The proof begins by considering the convex set $C$ and the point $x \in \partial C$. If $C$ is empty, then the theorem is trivially true. Otherwise, let $M$ be the affine hull of $C$, which is the smallest affine set containing $C$. By the Hahn-Banach theorem, there exists a linear function $f: M \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) \leq \inf_{y \in C} f(y)$.

The proof then proceeds to show that $f(x) = \sup_{y \in C} f(y)$, which implies the existence of a hyperplane $H$ that supports $C$ at $x$. The details of the proof are omitted here, but they can be found in the references provided.

The Supporting Hyperplane Theorem has many applications in convex analysis and optimization. For example, it is used in the proof of the convex combination theorem, which states that every convex combination of points in a convex set is also in the set. It is also used in the proof of the extreme point theorem, which states that the extreme points of a convex set are the points that cannot be written as a convex combination of other points in the set.

#### 4.2c Applications of separation theorems

The separation theorems, including the Hahn-Banach separation theorem and the Supporting Hyperplane Theorem, have wide-ranging applications in convex analysis and optimization. These theorems provide a powerful tool for separating points from convex sets, which is fundamental to many optimization problems. In this section, we will explore some of these applications.

##### Convex Combination Theorem

The Convex Combination Theorem is a fundamental result in convex analysis. It states that every convex combination of points in a convex set is also in the set. This theorem is a direct consequence of the Hahn-Banach separation theorem.

Consider a convex set $C$ and a point $x \in C$. If $x$ is not a convex combination of points in $C$, then there exists a hyperplane $H$ that separates $x$ from $C$. By the Hahn-Banach separation theorem, there exists a linear function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) < \inf_{y \in C} f(y)$. This contradicts the assumption that $x \in C$. Therefore, every convex combination of points in $C$ is also in $C$.

##### Extreme Point Theorem

The Extreme Point Theorem is another fundamental result in convex analysis. It states that the extreme points of a convex set are the points that cannot be written as a convex combination of other points in the set. This theorem is a direct consequence of the Supporting Hyperplane Theorem.

Consider a convex set $C$ and a point $x \in \partial C$. If $x$ is not an extreme point of $C$, then there exists a hyperplane $H$ that supports $C$ at $x$. By the Supporting Hyperplane Theorem, there exists a linear function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) = \sup_{y \in C} f(y)$. This contradicts the assumption that $x \in \partial C$. Therefore, every extreme point of $C$ is also in $\partial C$.

##### Cameron-Martin Theorem

The Cameron-Martin Theorem is a result in functional analysis that has applications in probability theory and measure theory. It provides a characterization of the set of points in a Gaussian measure where the measure is strictly positive. This theorem is a direct consequence of the Supporting Hyperplane Theorem.

Consider a Gaussian measure $\mu$ on a real vector space $X$ and a point $x \in X$. If $\mu(x) > 0$, then there exists a hyperplane $H$ that supports $\mu$ at $x$. By the Supporting Hyperplane Theorem, there exists a linear function $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) = \sup_{y \in X} f(y)$. This contradicts the assumption that $\mu(x) > 0$. Therefore, every point in $X$ where the measure is strictly positive is also in the support of the measure.

In conclusion, the separation theorems, including the Hahn-Banach separation theorem and the Supporting Hyperplane Theorem, are powerful tools in convex analysis and optimization. They provide a method to separate points from convex sets, which is fundamental to many optimization problems. The Convex Combination Theorem, Extreme Point Theorem, and Cameron-Martin Theorem are just a few examples of the wide-ranging applications of these theorems.

## Chapter: Convexity and Optimization

### Introduction

In this chapter, we delve into the fascinating world of convexity and optimization, two fundamental concepts in the field of convex analysis and optimization. Convexity, a geometric property of functions, plays a crucial role in optimization problems. It is a property that simplifies the process of finding the minimum of a function, making it a cornerstone in the field of optimization.

Optimization, on the other hand, is the process of finding the best solution to a problem. In the context of convex analysis, optimization is often about finding the minimum of a convex function. This is because convex functions have many desirable properties that make them easier to optimize than non-convex functions.

We will explore the theory behind convexity and optimization, starting with the basic definitions and properties. We will then move on to more advanced topics, such as the convex combination theorem and the convex hull. These concepts will be illustrated with examples and applications, providing a solid foundation for understanding the algorithms and applications discussed in later chapters.

This chapter will also introduce the concept of convex optimization, a powerful tool for solving optimization problems. We will discuss different types of convex optimization problems, such as linear programming, quadratic programming, and semidefinite programming. We will also cover the methods used to solve these problems, including the simplex algorithm, the ellipsoid algorithm, and the branch and bound method.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of convexity and optimization, and be able to apply these concepts to solve a variety of problems in convex analysis and optimization. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a practitioner, this chapter will provide you with the knowledge and tools you need to navigate the complex landscape of convexity and optimization.




#### 4.3a Definition and properties

The concept of supporting hyperplanes is a fundamental concept in convex analysis and optimization. It is closely related to the concept of relative interior and closure, which we have discussed in the previous sections. 

#### 4.3b Supporting hyperplanes and relative interior

A hyperplane $H$ is said to support a convex set $C$ at a point $x \in C$ if $H$ touches $C$ at $x$ and lies entirely on one side of $C$. In other words, $H$ is a supporting hyperplane of $C$ at $x$ if $x$ is a boundary point of $C$ and $H$ contains no point of $C$ other than $x$.

The relative interior of a convex set $C$, denoted $\operatorname{ri} C$, is the set of points in $C$ that are interior to $C$ when viewed as a subset of its affine hull. In other words, $\operatorname{ri} C$ is the set of points in $C$ that have a neighborhood entirely contained in $C$.

The concept of supporting hyperplanes is closely related to the concept of relative interior. In fact, the Supporting Hyperplane Theorem can be restated as follows: given a convex set $C$ and a point $x \in \partial C$, there exists a hyperplane $H$ that supports $C$ at $x$ if and only if $x \in \operatorname{ri} C$.

This result provides a method to find a supporting hyperplane for a convex set at a given point. If we can show that a point $x$ is in the relative interior of a convex set $C$, then we can find a supporting hyperplane for $C$ at $x$. This is particularly useful in optimization problems, where we often need to find a hyperplane that supports a convex set at a given point.

#### 4.3c Supporting hyperplanes and closure

The concept of supporting hyperplanes is also closely related to the concept of closure. The closure of a convex set $C$, denoted $\overline{C}$, is the smallest closed set that contains $C$. In other words, $\overline{C}$ is the intersection of all closed sets that contain $C$.

A hyperplane $H$ is said to support the closure of a convex set $C$ at a point $x \in \overline{C}$ if $H$ touches $\overline{C}$ at $x$ and lies entirely on one side of $\overline{C}$. In other words, $H$ is a supporting hyperplane of $\overline{C}$ at $x$ if $x$ is a boundary point of $\overline{C}$ and $H$ contains no point of $\overline{C}$ other than $x$.

The Supporting Hyperplane Theorem can be extended to the closure of a convex set. Given a convex set $C$ and a point $x \in \overline{C}$, there exists a hyperplane $H$ that supports $\overline{C}$ at $x$ if and only if $x \in \operatorname{ri} \overline{C}$.

This result provides a method to find a supporting hyperplane for the closure of a convex set at a given point. If we can show that a point $x$ is in the relative interior of the closure of a convex set $C$, then we can find a supporting hyperplane for $\overline{C}$ at $x$. This is particularly useful in optimization problems, where we often need to find a hyperplane that supports the closure of a convex set at a given point.

#### 4.3b Properties of supporting hyperplanes

The properties of supporting hyperplanes are crucial in understanding the behavior of convex sets and their boundaries. These properties are closely related to the concepts of relative interior and closure, which we have discussed in the previous sections.

##### 4.3b(i) Uniqueness of Supporting Hyperplanes

A convex set $C$ can have at most one supporting hyperplane at a given point $x \in C$. This is because if there were two supporting hyperplanes $H_1$ and $H_2$ at $x$, then the intersection of $H_1$ and $H_2$ would be a line segment. However, any line segment contains points other than $x$, which contradicts the definition of a supporting hyperplane.

##### 4.3b(ii) Existence of Supporting Hyperplanes

For every point $x \in \partial C$, there exists a supporting hyperplane for $C$ at $x$. This is a direct consequence of the Supporting Hyperplane Theorem, which states that given a convex set $C$ and a point $x \in \partial C$, there exists a hyperplane $H$ that supports $C$ at $x$ if and only if $x \in \operatorname{ri} C$.

##### 4.3b(iii) Supporting Hyperplanes and Relative Interior

The relative interior of a convex set $C$ can be characterized in terms of supporting hyperplanes. In fact, a point $x \in C$ belongs to the relative interior of $C$ if and only if there exists a supporting hyperplane for $C$ at $x$. This characterization provides a method to check whether a point is in the relative interior of a convex set.

##### 4.3b(iv) Supporting Hyperplanes and Closure

The closure of a convex set $C$ can also be characterized in terms of supporting hyperplanes. In fact, a point $x \in \overline{C}$ belongs to the closure of $C$ if and only if there exists a supporting hyperplane for $\overline{C}$ at $x$. This characterization provides a method to check whether a point is in the closure of a convex set.

##### 4.3b(v) Supporting Hyperplanes and Extreme Points

An extreme point of a convex set $C$ is a point that cannot be written as a convex combination of other points in $C$. The set of extreme points of $C$ is denoted by $\operatorname{ext} C$. A hyperplane $H$ is said to support an extreme point $x \in \operatorname{ext} C$ if $H$ touches $C$ at $x$ and lies entirely on one side of $C$. The set of supporting hyperplanes for the extreme points of $C$ is denoted by $\operatorname{supp} \operatorname{ext} C$.

The properties of supporting hyperplanes have wide-ranging applications in convex analysis and optimization. They are used in the study of convex functions, the simplex algorithm for linear programming, and the theory of convex polyhedra, among other areas.

#### 4.3c Applications of supporting hyperplanes

The concept of supporting hyperplanes is not only fundamental to the theory of convex analysis and optimization, but it also has numerous practical applications. In this section, we will explore some of these applications, focusing on their relevance in the field of convex optimization.

##### 4.3c(i) Convex Optimization

Convex optimization is a powerful tool for solving optimization problems with convex objective functions and convex constraints. The concept of supporting hyperplanes plays a crucial role in convex optimization, particularly in the formulation of the dual problem.

The dual problem of a convex optimization problem is a dual representation of the original problem. It is formulated in terms of the supporting hyperplanes of the feasible region of the original problem. The dual problem provides a way to solve the original problem by solving the dual problem instead. This approach is particularly useful when the original problem is large and complex.

##### 4.3c(ii) Linear Programming

Linear programming is a special case of convex optimization. It involves optimizing a linear objective function subject to linear constraints. The dual problem of a linear programming problem is particularly simple and can be solved efficiently using the simplex algorithm.

The simplex algorithm is an iterative method for solving linear programming problems. It starts at a feasible solution and moves to adjacent feasible solutions until an optimal solution is found. The movement between feasible solutions is guided by the supporting hyperplanes of the feasible region.

##### 4.3c(iii) Convex Analysis

Convex analysis is a field that deals with the study of convex sets and functions. The concept of supporting hyperplanes is fundamental to convex analysis. It is used in the study of convex functions, the characterization of convex sets, and the proof of various theorems.

For example, the Supporting Hyperplane Theorem, which states that given a convex set $C$ and a point $x \in \partial C$, there exists a hyperplane $H$ that supports $C$ at $x$ if and only if $x \in \operatorname{ri} C$, is a fundamental result in convex analysis. It is used in the proof of various theorems, including the Extreme Point Theorem and the Separation Theorem.

In conclusion, the concept of supporting hyperplanes is not only fundamental to the theory of convex analysis and optimization, but it also has numerous practical applications. It is used in the formulation of the dual problem in convex optimization, in the simplex algorithm for linear programming, and in the study of convex functions in convex analysis.

## Chapter: Chapter 5: Convexity and Optimality Conditions

### Introduction

In this chapter, we delve into the fascinating world of convexity and optimality conditions, two fundamental concepts in the field of convex analysis and optimization. These concepts are not only theoretical constructs but have wide-ranging applications in various fields such as engineering, economics, and machine learning.

Convexity is a property of functions that is central to many optimization problems. A function is said to be convex if it satisfies certain conditions, such as being above all of its tangent lines. This property is crucial in optimization because it allows us to use powerful tools like the simplex algorithm and the ellipsoid algorithm. These algorithms are used to solve linear programming problems, which are a special case of convex optimization problems.

Optimality conditions, on the other hand, are conditions that must be satisfied by the optimal solution of an optimization problem. These conditions provide a way to check whether a given solution is optimal. They are also used to derive the dual problem of an optimization problem, which is a powerful tool in its own right.

Throughout this chapter, we will explore these concepts in depth, starting with the basic definitions and gradually moving on to more advanced topics. We will also discuss the relationship between convexity and optimality conditions, and how they are used together to solve optimization problems.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of convexity and optimality conditions, and be able to apply these concepts to solve a variety of optimization problems. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional, this chapter will provide you with the tools you need to navigate the complex landscape of convex analysis and optimization.




#### 4.3b Geometric interpretation of supporting hyperplanes

The geometric interpretation of supporting hyperplanes is a crucial aspect of convex analysis and optimization. It provides a visual understanding of the concept and its applications, which can be particularly useful in practical scenarios.

Consider a convex set $C$ in a Euclidean space. A hyperplane $H$ is said to support $C$ at a point $x \in C$ if $H$ touches $C$ at $x$ and lies entirely on one side of $C$. This can be visualized as a plane that intersects the boundary of $C$ at $x$ and does not intersect the interior of $C$.

The geometric interpretation of supporting hyperplanes is closely related to the concept of relative interior and closure. As we have seen in the previous section, the relative interior of a convex set $C$, denoted $\operatorname{ri} C$, is the set of points in $C$ that are interior to $C$ when viewed as a subset of its affine hull. Similarly, the closure of $C$, denoted $\overline{C}$, is the smallest closed set that contains $C$.

The Supporting Hyperplane Theorem can be restated in geometric terms as follows: given a convex set $C$ and a point $x \in \partial C$, there exists a hyperplane $H$ that supports $C$ at $x$ if and only if $x \in \operatorname{ri} C$. This can be visualized as a plane that touches the boundary of $C$ at $x$ and does not intersect the interior of $C$.

Furthermore, if $x \in \overline{C}$, then there exists a hyperplane $H$ that supports $C$ at $x$. This can be visualized as a plane that touches the boundary of $C$ at $x$ and does not intersect the interior of $C$.

In summary, the geometric interpretation of supporting hyperplanes provides a visual understanding of the concept and its applications. It is closely related to the concepts of relative interior and closure, and can be used to find a supporting hyperplane for a convex set at a given point.

#### 4.3c Properties of supporting hyperplanes

The properties of supporting hyperplanes are crucial in understanding the behavior of convex sets and their boundaries. These properties are closely related to the concepts of relative interior and closure, as we have seen in the previous sections.

##### Uniqueness of Supporting Hyperplanes

The Supporting Hyperplane Theorem states that for a convex set $C$ and a point $x \in \partial C$, there exists a unique hyperplane $H$ that supports $C$ at $x$. This can be visualized as a plane that touches the boundary of $C$ at $x$ and does not intersect the interior of $C$. This property is important in that it allows us to uniquely define a hyperplane that touches the boundary of a convex set at a given point.

##### Supporting Hyperplanes and Relative Interior

The Supporting Hyperplane Theorem can also be restated in terms of the relative interior of a convex set. As we have seen, the relative interior of a convex set $C$, denoted $\operatorname{ri} C$, is the set of points in $C$ that are interior to $C$ when viewed as a subset of its affine hull. The theorem states that given a convex set $C$ and a point $x \in \partial C$, there exists a hyperplane $H$ that supports $C$ at $x$ if and only if $x \in \operatorname{ri} C$. This property is important in that it allows us to determine whether a point on the boundary of a convex set is also in its relative interior, and thus whether a supporting hyperplane exists.

##### Supporting Hyperplanes and Closure

The Supporting Hyperplane Theorem can also be restated in terms of the closure of a convex set. The closure of a convex set $C$, denoted $\overline{C}$, is the smallest closed set that contains $C$. The theorem states that if $x \in \overline{C}$, then there exists a hyperplane $H$ that supports $C$ at $x$. This property is important in that it allows us to determine whether a point on the boundary of a convex set is also in its closure, and thus whether a supporting hyperplane exists.

In summary, the properties of supporting hyperplanes are crucial in understanding the behavior of convex sets and their boundaries. They are closely related to the concepts of relative interior and closure, and can be used to uniquely define a hyperplane that touches the boundary of a convex set at a given point.




#### 4.4a Definition and properties

In the previous sections, we have discussed the concepts of relative interior and closure, and their geometric interpretations. In this section, we will delve into the concept of extreme points, which is a fundamental concept in convex analysis and optimization.

An extreme point of a convex set $C$ is a point $x \in C$ that cannot be expressed as a convex combination of two distinct points in $C$. In other words, if $x = \lambda y + (1 - \lambda)z$ for some $y, z \in C$ and $\lambda \in [0, 1]$, then $x = y = z$. This can be visualized as a point on the boundary of $C$ that cannot be reached by moving along a straight line from one point in $C$ to another.

The set of all extreme points of a convex set $C$ is denoted by $\operatorname{ext} C$. It is a subset of the boundary of $C$, and it plays a crucial role in convex optimization. The extreme points of a convex set are the points that cannot be improved upon in a convex optimization problem, and they are often used to define the feasible region of a convex optimization problem.

The properties of extreme points are closely related to the concepts of relative interior and closure. In fact, the following properties hold:

1. If $x \in \operatorname{ext} C$, then $x \in \partial C$. This is because an extreme point of a convex set is always on the boundary of the set.

2. If $x \in \operatorname{ext} C$, then $x \in \operatorname{ri} C$. This is because an extreme point of a convex set is always in the relative interior of the set.

3. If $x \in \operatorname{ext} C$, then $x \in \overline{C}$. This is because an extreme point of a convex set is always in the closure of the set.

These properties provide a deeper understanding of the role of extreme points in convex analysis and optimization. They also provide a basis for the development of algorithms for finding extreme points, which we will discuss in the next section.

#### 4.4b Properties of extreme points (Continued)

In the previous subsection, we discussed the properties of extreme points and their relationship with the concepts of relative interior and closure. In this subsection, we will continue our exploration of extreme points and discuss some additional properties that are crucial in convex analysis and optimization.

4. If $x \in \operatorname{ext} C$, then $x$ is a vertex of $C$. This is because a vertex of a convex set is always an extreme point.

5. If $x \in \operatorname{ext} C$, then $x$ is a boundary point of $C$. This is because a boundary point of a convex set is always an extreme point.

6. If $x \in \operatorname{ext} C$, then $x$ is a support point of $C$. This is because a support point of a convex set is always an extreme point.

These properties provide a deeper understanding of the role of extreme points in convex analysis and optimization. They also provide a basis for the development of algorithms for finding extreme points, which we will discuss in the next section.

#### 4.4c Applications in convex optimization

In this section, we will explore the applications of extreme points in convex optimization. Convex optimization is a powerful tool for solving optimization problems where the objective function and the constraints are convex. Extreme points play a crucial role in convex optimization, as they provide a way to define the feasible region of a convex optimization problem.

One of the main applications of extreme points in convex optimization is in the formulation of linear programming problems. In linear programming, the feasible region is defined as the set of points that satisfy a set of linear constraints. The extreme points of this feasible region are the points that cannot be expressed as a convex combination of two distinct points in the feasible region. These extreme points are used to define the vertices of the feasible region, which are the points that define the corners of the feasible region.

Another application of extreme points in convex optimization is in the formulation of convex optimization problems with linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In these problems, the feasible region is defined as the set of points that satisfy a set of linear constraints and a set of linear matrix inequalities. The extreme points of this feasible region are the points that cannot be expressed as a convex combination of two distinct points in the feasible region. These extreme points are used to define the vertices of the feasible region, which are the points that define the corners of the feasible region.

In addition to these applications, extreme points are also used in the development of algorithms for solving convex optimization problems. For example, the simplex algorithm, which is used to solve linear programming problems, uses the extreme points of the feasible region to define the vertices of the feasible region. These vertices are then used to define the pivot elements of the simplex algorithm, which are the points that are used to move from one vertex of the feasible region to another.

In conclusion, extreme points play a crucial role in convex optimization. They are used to define the feasible region of a convex optimization problem, to formulate linear programming problems, and to develop algorithms for solving convex optimization problems. Understanding the properties of extreme points is therefore essential for anyone working in the field of convex analysis and optimization.

### Subsection: 5.1a Problem formulation and basic concepts

#### 5.1a.1 Convex Optimization Problems

A convex optimization problem is a mathematical optimization problem where the objective function and constraints are convex. Convex functions are those that are either linear or have a single local maximum or minimum. Convex sets, on the other hand, are those that are either a line segment, a plane, or a higher-dimensional generalization of these.

Convex optimization problems can be represented in the following general form:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{minimize} \quad & f(x) \\
\text{subject to} \quad & g_i(x) \leq 0, \quad i = 1, \ldots, m \\
& h_j(x) = 0, \quad j = 1, \ldots, p
\end{align*}
$$

where $f(x)$ is the objective function, $g_i(x)$ are the inequality constraints, and $h_j(x)$ are the equality constraints. All these functions are convex.

#### 5.1a.2 Duality in Convex Optimization

The duality theory of convex optimization provides a powerful framework for solving these problems. The dual problem of a convex optimization problem is a related problem that provides a lower bound on the optimal value of the original problem. The dual problem is defined as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{maximize} \quad & -\min_{x \in X} f(x) \\
\text{subject to} \quad & -\nabla f(x) + \sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i \nabla g_i(x) + \sum_{j=1}^p \mu_j \nabla h_j(x) = 0, \quad \forall x \in X \\
& \lambda_i \geq 0, \quad i = 1, \ldots, m \\
& \mu_j = 0, \quad j = 1, \ldots, p
\end{align*}
$$

where $X$ is the feasible region of the original problem, $\lambda_i$ and $\mu_j$ are the dual variables, and $\nabla f(x)$, $\nabla g_i(x)$, and $\nabla h_j(x)$ are the gradients of the objective function and constraints, respectively.

The duality theory of convex optimization provides a powerful tool for solving these problems. It allows us to transform a difficult convex optimization problem into a simpler dual problem, which can often be solved more efficiently.

#### 5.1a.3 Algorithms for Convex Optimization

There are several algorithms for solving convex optimization problems. These include the simplex method, the ellipsoid method, and the interior-point method. These algorithms exploit the convexity of the problem to provide efficient solutions.

The simplex method is a popular algorithm for solving linear programming problems. It starts at a feasible point and iteratively moves to adjacent feasible points until an optimal solution is found.

The ellipsoid method is a more general algorithm that can handle non-linear constraints. It starts with an initial ellipsoid that contains the feasible region and iteratively refines this ellipsoid until it contains only the optimal solution.

The interior-point method, also known as the barrier method, is a more recent algorithm that has proven to be very effective for solving convex optimization problems. It starts at a point inside the feasible region and iteratively moves towards the feasible region while improving the objective function value.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these algorithms and discuss their properties and applications.

#### 5.1a.4 Convex Optimization in Practice

In practice, convex optimization problems are often solved using numerical methods. These methods involve discretizing the problem and solving it approximately. The quality of the solution depends on the choice of discretization and the numerical method used.

One common approach is to discretize the problem using a finite element method. This involves dividing the problem domain into a finite number of elements and approximating the solution within each element using a basis function. The problem is then solved by minimizing the residual over the entire domain.

The matrix form of the problem can be written as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{minimize} \quad & -\sum_{k=1}^n u_k \phi (v_k,v_j) = \sum_{k=1}^n f_k \int v_k v_j dx \\
\text{subject to} \quad & v(x) = v_j(x), \quad j = 1,\dots,n
\end{align*}
$$

where $u_k$ and $f_k$ are the coefficients of the basis functions, and $\phi (v_k,v_j)$ is the inner product of the basis functions.

The solution to this problem can be found by solving the linear system:

$$
-L \mathbf{u} = M \mathbf{f}
$$

where $L$ and $M$ are matrices whose entries are $\phi (v_i,v_j)$ and $\int v_i v_j dx$, respectively.

In the next section, we will discuss some specific examples of convex optimization problems and how they are solved in practice.




### Subsection: 5.1b Feasible sets and feasible solutions

#### 5.1b.1 Feasible Sets

In convex optimization, the feasible set, denoted as $X$, is the set of all points that satisfy the constraints of the problem. In other words, $X$ is the intersection of all the constraint sets:

$$
X = \{x \mid g_i(x) \leq 0, \quad i = 1, \ldots, m \\[0.8ex]
h_j(x) = 0, \quad j = 1, \ldots, p\}
$$

The feasible set can be a convex set, a non-convex set, or even an empty set. The convexity of the feasible set is a crucial property in convex optimization, as it allows us to apply many powerful convex optimization algorithms.

#### 5.1b.2 Feasible Solutions

A feasible solution to a convex optimization problem is a point in the feasible set that minimizes the objective function. In other words, a feasible solution $x^*$ satisfies the following conditions:

$$
\begin{align*}
g_i(x^*) &\leq 0, \quad i = 1, \ldots, m \\[0.8ex]
h_j(x^*) &= 0, \quad j = 1, \ldots, p \\[0.8ex]
f(x^*) &\leq f(x), \quad \forall x \in X
\end{align*}
$$

If the feasible set is non-empty and bounded, then a feasible solution always exists. However, finding a feasible solution can be a challenging task, especially for large-scale convex optimization problems.

#### 5.1b.3 Feasible Directions

A feasible direction is a direction in which we can move from a feasible point to another feasible point. In other words, a direction $d$ is feasible if for every feasible point $x$, the point $x + td$ is also feasible for all $t \geq 0$. Feasible directions play a crucial role in many convex optimization algorithms, as they provide a way to move from one feasible point to another while staying within the feasible set.

#### 5.1b.4 Feasible Solutions and Duality

The dual problem of a convex optimization problem provides a lower bound on the optimal value of the original problem. This lower bound can be used to check the feasibility of a solution. If the lower bound is equal to the optimal value of the original problem, then the solution is feasible. If the lower bound is strictly less than the optimal value, then the solution is infeasible. This duality-based approach to checking feasibility can be particularly useful in large-scale convex optimization problems, where direct methods for checking feasibility may be computationally expensive.




### Subsection: 5.2a Convex programming problems and properties

Convex programming is a powerful tool in convex analysis and optimization. It is a method used to solve optimization problems where the objective function and constraints are convex. In this section, we will introduce the concept of convex programming problems and discuss their properties.

#### 5.2a.1 Convex Programming Problems

A convex programming problem is an optimization problem where the objective function and constraints are convex. Mathematically, a convex programming problem can be formulated as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\min_{x \in X} \quad & f(x) \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & g_i(x) \leq 0, \quad i = 1, \ldots, m \\[0.8ex]
& h_j(x) = 0, \quad j = 1, \ldots, p
\end{align*}
$$

where $X$ is the feasible set, $f(x)$ is the objective function, and $g_i(x)$ and $h_j(x)$ are convex constraint functions.

Convex programming problems have many desirable properties that make them easier to solve than non-convex problems. For example, every local minimum of a convex programming problem is also a global minimum. This property is not true for non-convex problems, where local minima can exist that are not global minima.

#### 5.2a.2 Properties of Convex Programming Problems

Convex programming problems have several important properties that make them particularly useful in optimization. These properties include:

1. **Convexity of the Feasible Set**: The feasible set $X$ of a convex programming problem is always convex. This means that any line segment connecting two feasible points is also contained in the feasible set. This property is crucial for many optimization algorithms, as it allows us to use efficient convex optimization techniques.

2. **Convexity of the Objective Function**: The objective function $f(x)$ of a convex programming problem is always convex. This means that the objective function is always increasing along any line segment connecting two points. This property is important because it allows us to use efficient convex optimization techniques to find the minimum of the objective function.

3. **Convexity of the Constraint Functions**: The constraint functions $g_i(x)$ and $h_j(x)$ of a convex programming problem are always convex. This means that the feasible set is always convex, which is a desirable property for optimization problems.

4. **Existence of a Global Minimum**: Every convex programming problem has a global minimum. This means that there exists a feasible point $x^*$ such that $f(x^*) \leq f(x)$ for all feasible points $x$. This property is important because it guarantees that we can always find the optimal solution to a convex programming problem.

5. **Uniqueness of the Global Minimum**: In many cases, the global minimum of a convex programming problem is unique. This means that there exists only one feasible point $x^*$ such that $f(x^*) \leq f(x)$ for all feasible points $x$. This property is important because it allows us to easily identify the optimal solution to a convex programming problem.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the algorithms used to solve convex programming problems.




### Subsection: 5.2b Convex programming algorithms

Convex programming problems can be solved using a variety of algorithms. In this section, we will discuss some of the most commonly used algorithms for solving convex programming problems.

#### 5.2b.1 Frank–Wolfe Algorithm

The Frank–Wolfe algorithm, also known as the conditional gradient method, is an iterative algorithm for solving convex optimization problems. It is particularly useful for problems with a large number of variables and constraints. The algorithm works by finding a direction of descent for the objective function at each iteration, and then performing a line search to find the optimal step size.

The Frank–Wolfe algorithm can be used to solve both unconstrained and constrained convex optimization problems. In the constrained case, the algorithm maintains a feasible solution at each iteration, and the direction of descent is found by solving a linear programming problem.

#### 5.2b.2 Lifelong Planning A*

Lifelong Planning A* (LPA*) is an algorithm for solving continuous optimization problems. It is based on the A* algorithm, which is commonly used for finding the shortest path in a graph. The LPA* algorithm uses a heuristic function to guide the search for the optimal solution.

#### 5.2b.3 Remez Algorithm

The Remez algorithm is an iterative algorithm for finding the best approximation of a function by a polynomial of a given degree. It is particularly useful for solving convex optimization problems with a single variable. The algorithm works by iteratively improving the approximation until it reaches the desired accuracy.

#### 5.2b.4 Properties of Convex Programming Algorithms

Convex programming algorithms have several important properties that make them particularly useful for solving convex optimization problems. These properties include:

1. **Convergence**: All of the algorithms discussed in this section are guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution under certain conditions.

2. **Efficiency**: These algorithms are designed to be efficient, making them suitable for solving large-scale optimization problems.

3. **Robustness**: These algorithms are robust to small perturbations in the problem data, making them suitable for real-world applications.

4. **Sensitivity to Initial Conditions**: Some of these algorithms, such as the Frank–Wolfe algorithm, can be sensitive to the initial conditions. This means that small changes in the initial solution can lead to large changes in the final solution.

5. **Duality Gap**: The Frank–Wolfe algorithm provides a lower bound on the optimal solution value at each iteration, which can be used as a stopping criterion. This lower bound is also useful for evaluating the quality of the approximation at each iteration.




### Subsection: 5.3a Linear programming problems and properties

Linear programming is a powerful tool for solving optimization problems with linear constraints. In this section, we will discuss the properties of linear programming problems and how they can be used to solve real-world problems.

#### 5.3a.1 Properties of Linear Programming Problems

Linear programming problems have several important properties that make them particularly useful for solving optimization problems. These properties include:

1. **Convexity**: Linear programming problems are convex optimization problems. This means that the objective function and all constraints are convex functions. Convex functions have many desirable properties, such as having a unique global minimum.

2. **Duality**: Linear programming problems have a dual problem, which is a related optimization problem that provides a lower bound on the optimal solution of the primal problem. The dual problem can be used to provide insights into the structure of the primal problem and can also be used to solve the primal problem.

3. **Feasibility**: A feasible solution to a linear programming problem is a point that satisfies all the constraints. Feasible solutions can be used to construct a feasible region, which is the set of all feasible solutions.

4. **Optimality**: An optimal solution to a linear programming problem is a feasible solution that achieves the optimal value of the objective function. Optimal solutions can be used to construct an optimal region, which is the set of all optimal solutions.

5. **Uniqueness of Optimal Solutions**: In many cases, a linear programming problem has a unique optimal solution. This means that there is only one feasible solution that achieves the optimal value of the objective function.

#### 5.3a.2 Solving Linear Programming Problems

Linear programming problems can be solved using a variety of algorithms. These algorithms can be broadly classified into two categories: deterministic and stochastic.

Deterministic algorithms, such as the simplex method and the ellipsoid method, provide a guaranteed solution to the linear programming problem. These algorithms work by systematically improving the current solution until the optimal solution is reached.

Stochastic algorithms, such as the genetic algorithm and the simulated annealing algorithm, use randomness to explore the feasible region and find the optimal solution. These algorithms are particularly useful for solving large-scale linear programming problems.

#### 5.3a.3 Applications of Linear Programming

Linear programming has a wide range of applications in various fields, including engineering, economics, and computer science. Some common applications of linear programming include:

1. Resource allocation: Linear programming can be used to allocate resources, such as time, money, and personnel, in a way that maximizes the overall benefit.

2. Portfolio optimization: Linear programming can be used to construct an optimal portfolio of assets that maximizes the expected return while minimizing the risk.

3. Network design: Linear programming can be used to design a network, such as a transportation network or a communication network, that minimizes the cost while meeting certain constraints.

## Chapter 6: Convex optimization problems:




### Subsection: 5.3b Simplex algorithm and its variants

The simplex algorithm is a powerful method for solving linear programming problems. It was first introduced by George Dantzig in 1947 and has since become one of the most widely used algorithms in optimization. The simplex algorithm is an iterative method that starts at a feasible solution and improves it in each iteration until an optimal solution is found.

#### 5.3b.1 The Simplex Algorithm

The simplex algorithm works by moving from one vertex of the feasible region to another, with each vertex representing a feasible solution. The algorithm starts at a vertex and moves to an adjacent vertex that improves the objective function value. This process continues until an optimal solution is found, or until it is determined that no better solution exists.

The simplex algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: Start at a feasible solution.

2. **Iteration**: Repeat until an optimal solution is found or until it is determined that no better solution exists:

    a. **Pivot**: Choose a pivot element and perform a pivot operation to move to an adjacent vertex.

    b. **Update**: Update the current solution and the objective function value.

3. **Termination**: If an optimal solution is found, return it. Otherwise, return a message indicating that no better solution exists.

The simplex algorithm has several variants, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most commonly used variants include the revised simplex method, the dual simplex method, and the ellipsoid method.

#### 5.3b.2 The Revised Simplex Method

The revised simplex method is a variant of the simplex algorithm that aims to reduce the number of iterations required to find an optimal solution. It does this by using a duality-based approach to guide the choice of pivot elements. The revised simplex method has been shown to be more efficient than the simplex algorithm in many cases.

#### 5.3b.3 The Dual Simplex Method

The dual simplex method is another variant of the simplex algorithm that is used when the current solution is not feasible. It works by solving a dual problem and using the solution to guide the choice of pivot elements. The dual simplex method is particularly useful when the current solution is far from feasible, as it can quickly move to a feasible solution.

#### 5.3b.4 The Ellipsoid Method

The ellipsoid method is a variant of the simplex algorithm that is used for solving linear programming problems with a large number of variables. It works by partitioning the feasible region into smaller ellipsoids and using a binary search to find the optimal solution. The ellipsoid method is particularly useful for problems with a large number of variables, as it can quickly find an optimal solution.

In the next section, we will discuss how these variants of the simplex algorithm can be used to solve real-world problems.





### Subsection: 5.4a Quadratic programming problems and properties

Quadratic programming is a powerful optimization technique that is used to solve problems involving quadratic functions. It is a special case of convex optimization, and as such, it shares many of the properties of convex optimization. In this section, we will introduce the concept of quadratic programming and discuss some of its key properties.

#### 5.4a.1 Introduction to Quadratic Programming

Quadratic programming is a type of optimization problem where the objective function and constraints are all quadratic. A quadratic function is a function of the form:

$$
f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
$$

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. Quadratic programming problems can be written in the following standard form:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{minimize} \quad & c \\
\text{subject to} \quad & ax^2 + bx + c \leq 0 \\
& x \in \mathbb{R}^n
\end{align*}
$$

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, and $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the vector of decision variables.

Quadratic programming problems are important because they arise in many applications, including portfolio optimization, signal processing, and machine learning. They are also particularly interesting from a theoretical perspective because they exhibit many of the key properties of convex optimization.

#### 5.4a.2 Properties of Quadratic Programming

Quadratic programming problems have several key properties that make them particularly tractable. These properties include:

1. **Convexity**: Quadratic programming problems are convex, meaning that they have a unique global minimum. This property is crucial for many optimization algorithms, as it allows us to guarantee that the solution found is the best possible solution.

2. **Duality**: Quadratic programming problems have a strong duality relationship, meaning that the dual problem is also a quadratic programming problem. This duality relationship can be used to derive efficient algorithms for solving quadratic programming problems.

3. **Efficiency**: Quadratic programming problems can be solved efficiently using a variety of algorithms, including the ellipsoid method and the interior-point method. These algorithms can handle problems with a large number of variables and constraints, making them particularly useful in practice.

4. **Robustness**: Quadratic programming problems are robust to small perturbations in the data. This means that small changes in the problem data will not significantly affect the solution found. This property is particularly useful in real-world applications, where the data may not be known exactly.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the theory and algorithms for solving quadratic programming problems. We will also discuss some of the key applications of quadratic programming in various fields.

### Subsection: 6.1a Second-order cone programming problems and properties

Second-order cone programming (SOCP) is a powerful optimization technique that has found widespread applications in various fields such as engineering, economics, and machine learning. In this section, we will introduce the basic concepts of SOCP, including the definition of second-order cone variables and the structure of SOCP problems. We will also discuss the properties of SOCP, such as its convexity and duality, and how these properties can be leveraged to solve real-world problems.

#### 6.1a.1 Introduction to Second-order Cone Programming

Second-order cone programming (SOCP) is a type of convex optimization problem, where the objective function and constraints are all convex, and the decision variables are all second-order cone variables. This makes it a particularly attractive choice for optimization problems with non-convex constraints, as it allows for the use of efficient algorithms for solving the problem.

The decision variables in SOCP are of the form $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, where $n$ is the dimension of the problem. These variables are subject to constraints of the form $x \in \mathbb{R}_+^n$, where $\mathbb{R}_+^n$ is the positive orthant. This means that all decision variables must be non-negative.

The objective function in SOCP is typically of the form $\min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} c^Tx$, where $c$ is a vector of coefficients. The constraints in SOCP can take various forms, but they are typically of the form $Ax \leq b$, where $A$ is a matrix of coefficients and $b$ is a vector of constants.

#### 6.1a.2 Properties of Second-order Cone Programming

One of the key properties of SOCP is its convexity. This means that the feasible region of an SOCP problem is a convex set, and the objective function is a convex function. This allows for the use of efficient algorithms for solving the problem, such as the cutting plane method and the barrier method.

Another important property of SOCP is its duality. This means that the dual problem of an SOCP problem is also an SOCP problem, and the optimal solutions of the primal and dual problems are related in a specific way. This duality can be leveraged to solve real-world problems, as it allows for the use of duality gaps to measure the quality of a solution.

#### 6.1a.3 Types of Second-order Cone Programming Problems

There are various types of SOCP problems, each with its own set of constraints and properties. Some of the most common types include linear SOCP, quadratic SOCP, and semidefinite SOCP. These problems have different applications and can be solved using different algorithms.

Linear SOCP is a type of SOCP problem where the objective function and constraints are all linear. This makes it a particularly simple and efficient type of SOCP problem to solve. Quadratic SOCP, on the other hand, allows for more complex objective functions and constraints, making it a more powerful but also more challenging type of SOCP problem to solve.

Semidefinite SOCP is a type of SOCP problem where the decision variables are also subject to semidefinite constraints. This makes it a more general type of SOCP problem, but also a more difficult one to solve. However, it has found applications in various fields, such as control theory and combinatorial optimization.

#### 6.1a.4 Applications of Second-order Cone Programming

SOCP has found widespread applications in various fields, including engineering, economics, and machine learning. In engineering, it is used for control design, signal processing, and circuit design. In economics, it is used for portfolio optimization and game theory. In machine learning, it is used for classification and regression problems.

One of the key advantages of SOCP is its ability to handle non-convex constraints, making it a powerful tool for solving real-world problems. Its convexity and duality properties also make it a popular choice for optimization problems, as it allows for the use of efficient algorithms and provides a way to measure the quality of a solution.

In the next section, we will explore the algorithms used to solve SOCP problems, including the cutting plane method and the barrier method. We will also discuss the advantages and limitations of these algorithms, and how they can be combined with other techniques to solve more complex problems.


## Chapter 6: Second-order cone programming:




### Subsection: 6.1b Algorithms for solving second-order cone programming problems

In this section, we will discuss some of the most commonly used algorithms for solving second-order cone programming problems. These algorithms are based on the properties of SOCP, such as its convexity and duality, and are designed to efficiently solve these types of problems.

#### 6.1b.1 Cutting Plane Method

The cutting plane method is a popular algorithm for solving SOCP problems. It works by iteratively adding cutting planes to the problem until the feasible region is empty or until a solution is found. The cutting planes are added based on the current solution, and the algorithm continues until the solution is feasible for all constraints.

The cutting plane method is particularly useful for solving SOCP problems with a large number of constraints. It allows for the efficient elimination of infeasible solutions, reducing the search space and improving the overall efficiency of the algorithm.

#### 6.1b.2 Barrier Method

The barrier method is another commonly used algorithm for solving SOCP problems. It works by solving a series of barrier problems, where the constraints are relaxed and the objective function is modified to include a barrier term. The barrier term penalizes violations of the constraints, and the algorithm continues until a feasible solution is found.

The barrier method is particularly useful for solving SOCP problems with a large number of constraints. It allows for the efficient handling of constraints, and the barrier term helps to guide the algorithm towards a feasible solution.

#### 6.1b.3 Interior Point Method

The interior point method is a powerful algorithm for solving SOCP problems. It works by solving a series of barrier problems, similar to the barrier method, but also includes a trust region to control the step size. The algorithm continues until a feasible solution is found, and the trust region is gradually reduced until the solution is optimal.

The interior point method is particularly useful for solving SOCP problems with a large number of constraints. It allows for the efficient handling of constraints, and the trust region helps to guide the algorithm towards an optimal solution.

### Conclusion

In this section, we have discussed some of the most commonly used algorithms for solving second-order cone programming problems. These algorithms are based on the properties of SOCP, such as its convexity and duality, and are designed to efficiently solve these types of problems. The cutting plane method, barrier method, and interior point method are all popular choices for solving SOCP problems, and each has its own advantages and applications.

## Chapter 7: Convex Optimization:




### Subsection: 6.2a Semidefinite programming problems and properties

Semidefinite programming (SDP) is a powerful optimization technique that extends the concept of linear and quadratic programming. It is particularly useful for solving problems with a large number of variables and constraints, and has applications in various fields such as control theory, combinatorial optimization, and machine learning.

#### 6.2a.1 Semidefinite Programming Problems

A semidefinite program can be written in the following standard form:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{minimize} \quad & c^Tx \\
\text{subject to} \quad & A_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n x_iA_i \succeq 0, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^n
\end{align*}
$$

where $c \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $A_0, A_1, ..., A_n$ are symmetric matrices of appropriate dimensions. The decision variables are $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, and the objective is to minimize the linear function $c^Tx$. The constraint $A_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n x_iA_i \succeq 0$ is a semidefinite constraint, which allows for the optimization of non-convex functions.

#### 6.2a.2 Properties of Semidefinite Programming

Semidefinite programming has several important properties that make it a powerful optimization technique. These properties include:

- Convexity: SDP is a convex optimization problem, meaning that the feasible region and the objective function are both convex. This allows for the use of efficient optimization algorithms, such as the cutting plane method and the barrier method.
- Duality: SDP has a strong duality property, meaning that the optimal solution of the primal problem is also the optimal solution of the dual problem. This allows for the efficient computation of the optimal solution.
- Symmetry: The symmetry of the semidefinite constraint allows for the efficient computation of the optimal solution. This is because the semidefinite constraint can be written as a sum of squares of polynomials, which can be efficiently solved using sum-of-squares optimization techniques.

#### 6.2a.3 Applications of Semidefinite Programming

Semidefinite programming has a wide range of applications in various fields. Some of the most common applications include:

- Control theory: SDP is used to design controllers for systems with uncertain parameters.
- Combinatorial optimization: SDP is used to solve problems such as graph coloring and maximum cut.
- Machine learning: SDP is used in various machine learning tasks, such as clustering and classification.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the most commonly used algorithms for solving semidefinite programming problems.

## Chapter: Convex Analysis and Optimization: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the theory, algorithms, and applications of convex optimization. Convex optimization is a powerful tool used in various fields such as engineering, economics, and machine learning. It is a type of optimization problem where the objective function and constraints are convex, meaning that they have a unique global minimum. This property allows for efficient and reliable optimization techniques to be used, making it a popular choice in many applications.

We will begin by discussing the basics of convex optimization, including its definition and properties. We will then delve into the different types of convex optimization problems, such as linear, quadratic, and semidefinite optimization. Each type will be explained in detail, along with examples and applications. We will also cover the duality theory of convex optimization, which provides a powerful framework for solving optimization problems.

Next, we will explore the algorithms used for solving convex optimization problems. These include the simplex method, the ellipsoid method, and the interior-point method. We will discuss the advantages and limitations of each algorithm, as well as their applications in different types of optimization problems.

Finally, we will look at some real-world applications of convex optimization. These include portfolio optimization, signal processing, and machine learning. We will see how convex optimization is used to solve these problems and the benefits it offers over other optimization techniques.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of convex optimization and its applications.

### Subsection: 6.2b Algorithms for solving semidefinite programming problems

Semidefinite programming (SDP) is a powerful optimization technique that has found applications in various fields such as control theory, combinatorial optimization, and machine learning. However, the size and complexity of SDP problems often make it challenging to solve them efficiently. In this section, we will discuss some of the algorithms used to solve SDP problems.

#### 6.2b.1 Interior Point Methods

Interior point methods are a class of optimization algorithms that are widely used to solve SDP problems. These methods are based on the concept of barrier functions, which are used to guide the search for the optimal solution. The most common interior point methods for SDP include the CSDP (Conic Semidefinite Programming) algorithm, MOSEK (Moment-SOS Hierarchy), SeDuMi (Semi-Definite User-Kit), SDPT3 (Semidefinite Programming Toolbox), DSDP (Duality-based Semidefinite Programming), and SDPA (Semidefinite Programming Algorithm).

These algorithms are robust and efficient for general linear SDP problems. However, they are limited by the fact that they are second-order methods and need to store and factorize a large and often dense matrix. This can be a significant challenge for large-scale SDP problems.

#### 6.2b.2 First-order Methods

First-order methods are another class of optimization algorithms used to solve SDP problems. These methods avoid computing, storing, and factorizing a large Hessian matrix, which is a significant advantage over interior point methods. However, this comes at the cost of reduced accuracy.

One example of a first-order method for SDP is the Splitting Cone Solver (SCS). Another first-order method is the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which requires projection on the cone of semidefinite matrices in every step.

#### 6.2b.3 Bundle Method

The Bundle Method is a more recent approach to solving SDP problems. It formulates the SDP problem as a nonsmooth optimization problem and solves it using the Spectral Bundle method of nonsmooth optimization. This approach is particularly efficient for a special class of linear SDP problems.

#### 6.2b.4 Other Solving Methods

There are also other methods for solving SDP problems, such as the Augmented Lagrangian method (PENSDP) and the Low-Rank Reformulation method. These methods can be specialized to solve very large-scale SDP problems.

In conclusion, there are several types of algorithms for solving SDP problems, each with its own strengths and limitations. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific characteristics of the SDP problem at hand.




### Subsection: 6.3a Geometric programming problems and properties

Geometric programming is a powerful optimization technique that combines the principles of convex analysis and optimization with geometric intuition. It is particularly useful for solving problems that involve geometric objects, such as points, line segments, polygons, and polyhedra. In this section, we will introduce the concept of geometric programming and discuss some of its properties.

#### 6.3a.1 Introduction to Geometric Programming

Geometric programming is a class of optimization problems that involve optimizing a linear function subject to linear constraints, where the decision variables are geometric objects. These objects can be points, line segments, polygons, or polyhedra, and the constraints can be of various types, such as distance constraints, angle constraints, or containment constraints.

The primary goal of geometric programming is to develop efficient algorithms and data structures for solving these problems. This is particularly important in fields such as computational geometry, where these problems often arise.

#### 6.3a.2 Properties of Geometric Programming

Geometric programming problems have several important properties that make them particularly tractable. These properties include:

- **Convexity**: Geometric programming problems are convex, meaning that they have a unique optimal solution. This property is crucial for many optimization algorithms, as it allows us to guarantee that the algorithm will find the global optimum.

- **Efficiency**: Geometric programming problems can often be solved efficiently, with polynomial time algorithms. This is particularly important for large-scale problems, where the time and space requirements of the algorithm can significantly impact its practicality.

- **Robustness**: Geometric programming problems are robust, meaning that small perturbations in the input data do not significantly affect the optimal solution. This property is particularly useful in real-world applications, where the input data may not be known with perfect precision.

- **Geometric Interpretation**: Geometric programming problems have a natural geometric interpretation, which can provide valuable insights into the problem structure and help guide the design of efficient algorithms.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these properties and discuss how they can be leveraged to solve geometric programming problems.

#### 6.3a.3 Applications of Geometric Programming

Geometric programming has a wide range of applications in various fields, including:

- **Computational Geometry**: As mentioned earlier, geometric programming is particularly useful in computational geometry, where it is used to solve problems involving geometric objects such as points, line segments, polygons, and polyhedra. For example, it can be used to find the closest pair of points in a set, or to determine whether a point lies inside a polygon.

- **Machine Learning**: Geometric programming is also used in machine learning, particularly in the field of support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs are a popular classification algorithm that uses geometric programming to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the positive and negative examples.

- **Operations Research**: In operations research, geometric programming is used to solve a variety of optimization problems, such as scheduling problems, inventory management problems, and network design problems.

- **Robotics**: In robotics, geometric programming is used to plan robot trajectories and to solve other optimization problems that arise in robotics.

- **Computer Graphics**: In computer graphics, geometric programming is used to perform various operations on geometric objects, such as transformations, intersections, and collisions.

In the next section, we will discuss some specific examples of geometric programming problems and how they are solved.




### Subsection: 6.3b Algorithms for solving geometric programming problems

Geometric programming problems can be solved using a variety of algorithms, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. In this section, we will discuss some of the most common algorithms used for solving geometric programming problems.

#### 6.3b.1 Linear Programming

Linear programming is a special case of geometric programming where the decision variables are only points. It is a well-studied problem with efficient algorithms, such as the simplex method and the ellipsoid method. These algorithms can be used to solve general geometric programming problems, but they may not be as efficient as other methods.

#### 6.3b.2 Convex Optimization

Convex optimization is a powerful tool for solving convex geometric programming problems. It involves optimizing a convex function subject to convex constraints. The optimal solution can be found using efficient algorithms, such as the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and the cutting plane method.

#### 6.3b.3 Branch-and-Cut

Branch-and-cut is a hybrid algorithm that combines the strengths of branch-and-bound and cutting plane methods. It starts with an initial feasible solution and iteratively improves it using cutting plane methods. If no improvement is possible, the algorithm branches out to explore the solution space. This algorithm is particularly useful for solving large-scale geometric programming problems.

#### 6.3b.4 Implicit k-d Tree

The implicit k-d tree is a data structure that can be used to solve geometric programming problems. It is particularly useful for problems with a large number of constraints, as it allows for efficient storage and retrieval of the constraints. The complexity of the implicit k-d tree is given by the number of grid cells, which is proportional to the number of constraints.

#### 6.3b.5 Remez Algorithm

The Remez algorithm is a variant of the Gauss-Seidel method that can be used to solve arbitrary non-linear geometric programming problems. It is particularly useful for problems with a large number of decision variables, as it can handle non-linear constraints. Some modifications of the algorithm have been proposed in the literature to improve its efficiency.

In the next section, we will discuss some applications of geometric programming in various fields.

### Introduction

In the realm of machine learning, the concept of convex optimization plays a pivotal role. This chapter, "Convex Optimization in Machine Learning," aims to delve into the intricacies of this topic, providing a comprehensive understanding of its theory, algorithms, and applications.

Convex optimization is a branch of optimization that deals with finding the minimum of a convex function. In the context of machine learning, convex optimization is used to train models that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions without overfitting. This is achieved by optimizing the parameters of the model to minimize a convex loss function.

The chapter will begin by introducing the basic concepts of convex optimization, including convex functions and convex sets. It will then move on to discuss the properties of convex functions and how they are used in optimization problems. The chapter will also cover the different types of convex optimization problems, such as linear, quadratic, and semidefinite programming.

Next, the chapter will delve into the algorithms used to solve convex optimization problems. These include gradient descent, Newton's method, and the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. Each algorithm will be explained in detail, with examples to illustrate their applications.

Finally, the chapter will explore the applications of convex optimization in machine learning. This includes using convex optimization to train linear and nonlinear models, as well as its role in image and signal processing, natural language processing, and data analysis.

### Subsection: 6.4a Conic programming problems and properties

Conic programming is a powerful tool for solving optimization problems with linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) as constraints. In this section, we will introduce the concept of conic programming and discuss some of its key properties.

#### 6.4a.1 Introduction to Conic Programming

Conic programming is a subfield of convex optimization that studies problems consisting of minimizing a convex function over the intersection of an affine subspace and a convex cone. The class of conic optimization problems includes some of the most well-known classes of convex optimization problems, namely linear and semidefinite programming.

Given a real vector space "X", a convex, real-valued function $f$ defined on a convex cone $C \subset X$, and an affine subspace $\mathcal{H}$ defined by a set of affine constraints $h_i(x) = 0$, a conic optimization problem is to find the point $x$ in $C \cap \mathcal{H}$ for which the number $f(x)$ is smallest.

Examples of $C$ include the positive orthant $\mathbb{R}_+^n = \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n : \, x \geq \mathbf{0}\right\}$, positive semidefinite matrices $\mathbb{S}^n_{+}$, and the second-order cone $\left \{ (x,t) \in \mathbb{R}^{n}\times \mathbb{R} : \lVert x \rVert \leq t \right \}$. Often $f$ is a linear function, in which case the conic optimization problem reduces to a linear program, a semidefinite program, and a second order cone program, respectively.

#### 6.4a.2 Duality in Conic Programming

Certain special cases of conic optimization problems have notable closed-form expressions of their dual problems. For example, the dual of the conic linear program is given by:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{maximize} \quad & c^Tx \\
\text{subject to} \quad & Ax \leq b \\
& x \geq \mathbf{0}
\end{align*}
$$

where $c$ is the vector of coefficients of the objective function, $A$ is the matrix of coefficients of the constraints, and $b$ is the vector of right-hand side values.

#### 6.4a.3 Properties of Conic Programming

Conic programming problems have several important properties that make them particularly useful for solving optimization problems. These include:

- Conic programming problems are convex, meaning that they have a unique optimal solution.
- The optimal solution of a conic programming problem can be found efficiently using a variety of algorithms, including the simplex method and the ellipsoid method.
- Conic programming problems can be used to solve a wide range of problems, including linear and semidefinite programming problems.
- Conic programming problems can be formulated with a variety of convex cones, allowing for flexibility in modeling real-world problems.

In the next section, we will discuss some applications of conic programming in various fields.




### Subsection: 6.4b Algorithms for solving conic programming problems

Conic programming problems are a class of optimization problems that involve minimizing a convex function subject to linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). These problems are ubiquitous in various fields such as engineering, economics, and machine learning. Due to their importance, there have been significant efforts to develop efficient algorithms for solving conic programming problems.

#### 6.4b.1 Interior-Point Methods

Interior-point methods, also known as barrier methods, are a class of algorithms for solving convex optimization problems. These methods work by iteratively moving the solution towards the optimal value while staying within the feasible region. The key idea behind interior-point methods is to use a barrier function to penalize infeasible points, and to update the solution in the direction of steepest descent of the barrier function.

In the context of conic programming, interior-point methods can be used to solve problems with linear matrix inequalities as constraints. The barrier function is typically chosen to be the sum of the barrier functions for each of the linear matrix inequalities. The update direction is then computed using a variant of the Newton's method, where the Hessian matrix is replaced by the Hessian matrix of the barrier function.

#### 6.4b.2 Cutting-Plane Methods

Cutting-plane methods are another class of algorithms for solving convex optimization problems. These methods work by iteratively adding cutting planes to the feasible region until the optimal solution is reached. The cutting planes are typically generated by solving a dual problem associated with the original problem.

In the context of conic programming, cutting-plane methods can be used to solve problems with linear matrix inequalities as constraints. The dual problem is typically a linear program, and the cutting planes are generated by solving this linear program. The solution is then updated by moving towards the cutting plane that is most violated.

#### 6.4b.3 Other Algorithms

Apart from interior-point methods and cutting-plane methods, there are several other algorithms for solving conic programming problems. These include branch-and-cut methods, which combine branch-and-bound with cutting-plane methods, and semidefinite programming methods, which use semidefinite relaxations to solve conic programming problems.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the theory behind these algorithms and discuss their properties and performance.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the fascinating world of second-order cone programming, a powerful tool in the field of convex analysis and optimization. We have explored the theoretical underpinnings of this technique, its algorithms, and its applications. 

We have learned that second-order cone programming is a special case of semidefinite programming, and it is particularly useful when dealing with quadratic constraints. We have also seen how to formulate and solve second-order cone programming problems using various algorithms, including the cutting-plane method and the ellipsoid method.

## Chapter: Chapter 7: Convexity and Optimization

### Introduction

In this chapter, we delve into the fascinating world of convexity and optimization, two fundamental concepts in the field of convex analysis and optimization. Convexity, a mathematical concept, is a property of functions that makes them easier to analyze and optimize. Optimization, on the other hand, is the process of finding the best solution to a problem. In the context of convexity, optimization becomes a powerful tool for solving a wide range of problems.

We will begin by exploring the concept of convexity, its properties, and its significance in mathematics and optimization. We will learn that a function is convex if it satisfies certain conditions, such as being above its tangent lines. This property allows us to make important conclusions about the behavior of convex functions, such as the fact that the minimum of a convex function is always attained at a convex point.

Next, we will delve into the world of optimization. We will learn about different types of optimization problems, such as linear, quadratic, and nonlinear optimization problems. We will also learn about various optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent and Newton's method, and how to apply them to solve different types of optimization problems.

Finally, we will explore the relationship between convexity and optimization. We will learn that convex functions are particularly well-suited for optimization, as they have many desirable properties that make them easier to optimize. We will also learn about the concept of convex optimization, which is the process of optimizing a convex function.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of convexity and optimization, and you will be equipped with the knowledge and tools to solve a wide range of convex optimization problems. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional, this chapter will provide you with the foundational knowledge you need to navigate the complex world of convex analysis and optimization.




### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the theory, algorithms, and applications of second-order cone programming (SOCP). We have seen how SOCP is a powerful tool for solving optimization problems with linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and how it can be used to model a wide range of real-world problems. We have also discussed the duality theory of SOCP and how it can be used to derive efficient algorithms for solving SOCP problems.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is the importance of convexity in optimization. We have seen how the convexity of the objective function and constraints in SOCP problems allows us to use efficient algorithms for solving these problems. This is in contrast to non-convex optimization problems, where finding the global optimum can be a challenging task.

Another important aspect of SOCP is its connection to other optimization techniques, such as semidefinite programming (SDP) and linear programming (LP). This connection allows us to use existing algorithms and techniques from these fields to solve SOCP problems, making it a versatile and powerful tool for optimization.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of generalized inequalities. These inequalities are a fundamental concept in convex analysis and optimization, providing a powerful tool for solving optimization problems. They are also essential in understanding the behavior of convex functions and their derivatives.

Generalized inequalities are a generalization of the familiar inequalities we encounter in everyday life, such as $x^2 \leq y^2$ or $x^2 + y^2 \leq r^2$. They are used to describe the relationship between different functions and their derivatives, and they play a crucial role in the theory of convex functions.

We will begin by introducing the basic concepts of generalized inequalities, including the definitions of convex and concave functions, and the concept of a convex combination. We will then explore the different types of generalized inequalities, such as the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the Jensen inequality, and the Holder inequality.

Next, we will discuss the applications of generalized inequalities in convex optimization. We will see how these inequalities can be used to derive lower bounds on the optimal value of a convex optimization problem, and how they can be used to construct efficient algorithms for solving these problems.

Finally, we will explore some advanced topics in generalized inequalities, such as the concept of a duality gap and the use of generalized inequalities in semidefinite programming.

You will also have the tools to apply these concepts to solve a wide range of optimization problems. So let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of generalized inequalities!




### Section: 7.1 Generalized inequalities:

#### 7.1a Definition and properties of generalized inequalities

Generalized inequalities are a powerful tool in convex analysis and optimization. They provide a way to extend the concept of convexity to a wider class of functions, and they are essential in solving optimization problems. In this section, we will introduce the basic concepts of generalized inequalities, including the definitions of convex and concave functions, and the concept of a convex combination.

#### 7.1b Convex and Concave Functions

A function $f(x)$ is said to be convex if it satisfies the following condition:

$$
f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y) \leq \lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda)f(y)
$$

for all $x, y$ in the domain of $f$ and all $\lambda \in [0,1]$. In other words, a function is convex if the line segment connecting any two points on the graph of the function lies above the graph itself.

Dually, a function $f(x)$ is said to be concave if it satisfies the following condition:

$$
f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y) \geq \lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda)f(y)
$$

for all $x, y$ in the domain of $f$ and all $\lambda \in [0,1]$. In other words, a function is concave if the line segment connecting any two points on the graph of the function lies below the graph itself.

#### 7.1c Convex Combinations

A convex combination of functions $f_1(x), f_2(x), \ldots, f_n(x)$ is a function of the form:

$$
g(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i f_i(x)
$$

where $\lambda_i \geq 0$ for all $i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i = 1$. If all the functions $f_i(x)$ are convex, then the convex combination $g(x)$ is also convex.

#### 7.1d Generalized Inequalities

Generalized inequalities are a way to extend the concept of convexity to a wider class of functions. They are defined as follows:

$$
f(x) \leq g(x)
$$

where $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are convex functions. This inequality is said to hold for all $x$ in the domain of $f$ and $g$.

#### 7.1e Properties of Generalized Inequalities

Generalized inequalities have several important properties that make them useful in convex analysis and optimization. These properties include:

1. Transitivity: If $f(x) \leq g(x)$ and $g(x) \leq h(x)$ for all $x$, then $f(x) \leq h(x)$ for all $x$.
2. Homogeneity: If $f(x) \leq g(x)$ and $h(x)$ is a positive affine function, then $f(h(x)) \leq g(h(x))$ for all $x$.
3. Convexity: If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are convex functions, then the generalized inequality $f(x) \leq g(x)$ is convex.
4. Duality: If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are convex functions, then the generalized inequality $f(x) \leq g(x)$ is equivalent to the generalized inequality $g^*(x) \leq f^*(x)$, where $f^*(x)$ and $g^*(x)$ are the convex duals of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, respectively.

In the next section, we will explore some applications of generalized inequalities in convex optimization.

#### 7.1b Properties of generalized inequalities

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of generalized inequalities and discussed their properties. In this section, we will delve deeper into the properties of generalized inequalities and explore some of their applications.

#### 7.1b(i) Transitivity

The transitivity property of generalized inequalities is a powerful tool in convex analysis and optimization. It allows us to chain together multiple generalized inequalities to obtain a stronger inequality. For example, if we have three convex functions $f(x), g(x),$ and $h(x)$ such that $f(x) \leq g(x)$ and $g(x) \leq h(x)$ for all $x$, then by the transitivity property, we can conclude that $f(x) \leq h(x)$ for all $x$.

This property is particularly useful in optimization problems, where we often need to establish a series of inequalities to prove the optimality of a solution. By chaining together these inequalities using the transitivity property, we can obtain a stronger inequality that can be used to prove the optimality of the solution.

#### 7.1b(ii) Homogeneity

The homogeneity property of generalized inequalities allows us to extend the inequality to a wider class of functions. If $f(x) \leq g(x)$ and $h(x)$ is a positive affine function, then by the homogeneity property, we can conclude that $f(h(x)) \leq g(h(x))$ for all $x$.

This property is particularly useful in convex optimization, where we often need to optimize a convex function subject to a set of constraints. By applying the homogeneity property, we can extend the optimization problem to a wider class of functions, which can sometimes simplify the problem and make it easier to solve.

#### 7.1b(iii) Convexity

The convexity property of generalized inequalities is a direct consequence of the convexity of the functions involved. If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are convex functions, then the generalized inequality $f(x) \leq g(x)$ is convex.

This property is particularly useful in convex optimization, where we often need to optimize a convex function subject to a set of convex constraints. By establishing the convexity of the generalized inequality, we can ensure that the optimization problem is convex, which allows us to use a wide range of convex optimization algorithms to solve the problem.

#### 7.1b(iv) Duality

The duality property of generalized inequalities is a powerful tool in convex analysis and optimization. If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are convex functions, then the generalized inequality $f(x) \leq g(x)$ is equivalent to the generalized inequality $g^*(x) \leq f^*(x)$, where $f^*(x)$ and $g^*(x)$ are the convex duals of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, respectively.

This property is particularly useful in convex optimization, where we often need to establish the optimality of a solution. By establishing the duality of the generalized inequalities, we can prove the optimality of the solution without explicitly solving the optimization problem.

#### 7.1c Generalized inequalities in convex optimization

In the previous sections, we have discussed the properties of generalized inequalities and their applications in convex analysis. In this section, we will focus on the role of generalized inequalities in convex optimization.

Convex optimization is a powerful tool for solving optimization problems with convex objective functions and convex constraints. The convexity of the objective function and constraints ensures that the optimization problem has a unique optimal solution, which can be efficiently computed using a variety of optimization algorithms.

Generalized inequalities play a crucial role in convex optimization. They provide a way to establish the convexity of the objective function and constraints, which is necessary for the optimization problem to be convex. For example, if we have a convex optimization problem with a convex objective function $f(x)$ and convex constraints $g_i(x) \leq 0$ for $i = 1, \ldots, m$, then we can establish the convexity of the problem by proving that $f(x) \leq g_i(x)$ for all $x$ and $i$.

Furthermore, generalized inequalities are also used to establish the optimality of the solution in convex optimization. By chaining together multiple generalized inequalities using the transitivity property, we can obtain a stronger inequality that can be used to prove the optimality of the solution.

In the next section, we will discuss some specific examples of generalized inequalities in convex optimization and how they are used to solve real-world problems.




### Section: 7.1b Applications of generalized inequalities in optimization

Generalized inequalities play a crucial role in optimization problems. They provide a way to extend the concept of convexity to a wider class of functions, allowing us to solve a broader range of optimization problems. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of generalized inequalities in optimization.

#### 7.1b.1 Applications in Convex Optimization

Convex optimization is a class of optimization problems where the objective function and constraints are all convex. Generalized inequalities are particularly useful in convex optimization because they allow us to express the convexity of the objective function and constraints in a more general form.

For example, consider the following convex optimization problem:

$$
\begin{align*}
\min_{x} \quad & f(x) \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & g(x) \leq 0
\end{align*}
$$

where $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are convex functions. Using generalized inequalities, we can express the convexity of the objective function and constraints as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) \leq f^*(x) \\
g(x) \leq g^*(x)
\end{align*}
$$

where $f^*(x)$ and $g^*(x)$ are convex functions. This allows us to solve the optimization problem using convex optimization techniques.

#### 7.1b.2 Applications in Non-Convex Optimization

Generalized inequalities are also useful in non-convex optimization problems. In these problems, the objective function and constraints may not be convex, but they can often be approximated by convex functions. By using generalized inequalities, we can express the non-convex objective function and constraints as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) \leq f^*(x) \\
g(x) \leq g^*(x)
\end{align*}
$$

where $f^*(x)$ and $g^*(x)$ are convex functions. This allows us to solve the optimization problem using convex optimization techniques, even though the problem is not strictly convex.

#### 7.1b.3 Applications in Machine Learning

Generalized inequalities are also used in machine learning, particularly in the field of support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs are a popular machine learning algorithm that uses convex optimization techniques to solve classification problems. The objective function and constraints in SVMs can often be expressed using generalized inequalities, allowing us to solve the problem using convex optimization techniques.

In conclusion, generalized inequalities are a powerful tool in optimization, providing a way to extend the concept of convexity to a wider class of functions. They have applications in convex optimization, non-convex optimization, and machine learning, making them an essential topic for anyone studying convex analysis and optimization.

### Section: 8.1 Convex functions:

Convex functions play a crucial role in convex analysis and optimization. They are defined as functions that satisfy certain properties, which we will discuss in this section. We will also explore the relationship between convex functions and convex sets, as well as the properties of convex functions.

#### 8.1a Definition and properties of convex functions

A function $f: X \to \R$ is convex if and only if any of the following equivalent conditions hold:

1. For all $0 \leq t \leq 1$ and all $x_1, x_2 \in X$:
$$
f\left(t x_1 + (1-t) x_2\right) \leq t f\left(x_1\right) + (1-t) f\left(x_2\right)
$$
The right hand side represents the straight line between $\left(x_1, f\left(x_1\right)\right)$ and $\left(x_2, f\left(x_2\right)\right)$ in the graph of $f$ as a function of $t$; increasing $t$ from $0$ to $1$ or decreasing $t$ from $1$ to $0$ sweeps this line. Similarly, the argument of the function $f$ in the left hand side represents the straight line between $x_1$ and $x_2$ in $X$ or the $x$-axis of the graph of $f$. So, this condition requires that the straight line between any pair of points on the curve of $f$ to be above or just meets the graph.

2. For all $0 < t < 1$ and all $x_1, x_2 \in X$ such that $x_1 \neq x_2$:
$$
f\left(t x_1 + (1-t) x_2\right) \leq t f\left(x_1\right) + (1-t) f\left(x_2\right)
$$

The difference of this second condition with respect to the first condition above is that this condition does not include the intersection points (for example, $\left(x_1, f\left(x_1\right)\right)$ and $\left(x_2, f\left(x_2\right)\right)$) between the straight line passing through a pair of points on the curve of $f$ and the curve of $f$; the first condition includes the intersection points as it becomes $f\left(x_1\right) \leq f\left(x_1\right)$ or $f\left(x_2\right) \leq f\left(x_2\right)$.

### Section: 8.1 Convex functions:

Convex functions play a crucial role in convex analysis and optimization. They are defined as functions that satisfy certain properties, which we will discuss in this section. We will also explore the relationship between convex functions and convex sets, as well as the properties of convex functions.

#### 8.1a Definition and properties of convex functions

A function $f: X \to \R$ is convex if and only if any of the following equivalent conditions hold:

1. For all $0 \leq t \leq 1$ and all $x_1, x_2 \in X$:
$$
f\left(t x_1 + (1-t) x_2\right) \leq t f\left(x_1\right) + (1-t) f\left(x_2\right)
$$
The right hand side represents the straight line between $\left(x_1, f\left(x_1\right)\right)$ and $\left(x_2, f\left(x_2\right)\right)$ in the graph of $f$ as a function of $t$; increasing $t$ from $0$ to $1$ or decreasing $t$ from $1$ to $0$ sweeps this line. Similarly, the argument of the function $f$ in the left hand side represents the straight line between $x_1$ and $x_2$ in $X$ or the $x$-axis of the graph of $f$. So, this condition requires that the straight line between any pair of points on the curve of $f$ to be above or just meets the graph.

2. For all $0 < t < 1$ and all $x_1, x_2 \in X$ such that $x_1 \neq x_2$:
$$
f\left(t x_1 + (1-t) x_2\right) \leq t f\left(x_1\right) + (1-t) f\left(x_2\right)
$$

The difference of this second condition with respect to the first condition above is that this condition does not include the intersection points (for example, $\left(x_1, f\left(x_1\right)\right)$ and $\left(x_2, f\left(x_2\right)\right)$) between the straight line passing through a pair of points on the curve of $f$ and the curve of $f$; the first condition includes the intersection points as it becomes $f\left(x_1\right) \leq f\left(x_1\right)$ or $f\left(x_2\right) \leq f\left(x_2\right)$.

Convex functions have several important properties that make them useful in convex analysis and optimization. These properties include:

1. The convexity of a function is preserved under addition. If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are convex functions, then $h(x) = f(x) + g(x)$ is also convex.

2. The convexity of a function is preserved under multiplication by a constant. If $f(x)$ is convex, then $cf(x)$ is also convex for any constant $c \geq 0$.

3. The convexity of a function is preserved under composition with an affine function. If $f(x)$ is convex and $g(x)$ is affine, then $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is convex.

4. The convexity of a function is preserved under pointwise maximum. If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are convex, then $h(x) = \max\{f(x), g(x)\}$ is also convex.

5. The convexity of a function is preserved under composition with a convex function. If $f(x)$ is convex and $g(x)$ is convex, then $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is also convex.

These properties allow us to construct convex functions from simpler convex functions, which is often useful in convex optimization problems. In the next section, we will explore some examples of convex functions and how they can be used in convex optimization.

#### 8.1b Convexity-preserving operations

Convexity-preserving operations are operations that preserve the convexity of a function. These operations are crucial in convex analysis and optimization as they allow us to construct new convex functions from existing convex functions. In this section, we will explore some common convexity-preserving operations.

1. **Affine functions**: Affine functions are functions that satisfy the following properties:

    a) $f(x_1 + x_2) = f(x_1) + f(x_2)$ for all $x_1, x_2 \in X$.

    b) $f(tx) = tf(x)$ for all $x \in X$ and $t \in \mathbb{R}$.

Affine functions are convex, and their convexity is preserved under addition and multiplication by a constant. This means that if $f(x)$ is convex, then $g(x) = af(x) + b$ is also convex for any constants $a, b$.

2. **Composition with affine functions**: As mentioned in the previous section, the convexity of a function is preserved under composition with an affine function. If $f(x)$ is convex and $g(x)$ is affine, then $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is also convex.

3. **Pointwise maximum**: The convexity of a function is preserved under pointwise maximum. If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are convex, then $h(x) = \max\{f(x), g(x)\}$ is also convex.

4. **Composition with convex functions**: The convexity of a function is preserved under composition with a convex function. If $f(x)$ is convex and $g(x)$ is convex, then $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is also convex.

5. **Convexity-preserving transformations**: Some transformations, such as taking the absolute value or the exponential of a function, preserve the convexity of a function. For example, if $f(x)$ is convex, then $|f(x)|$ and $e^{f(x)}$ are also convex.

These convexity-preserving operations allow us to construct new convex functions from existing convex functions. This is particularly useful in convex optimization, where we often need to construct a convex objective function from a non-convex one. In the next section, we will explore some examples of convex functions and how they can be used in convex optimization.

#### 8.1c Examples of convex functions

Convex functions are fundamental to convex analysis and optimization. They are defined as functions that satisfy certain properties, which we will discuss in this section. We will also explore some examples of convex functions and how they can be used in convex optimization.

1. **Linear functions**: Linear functions are a special case of affine functions. They are defined as functions that satisfy the following properties:

    a) $f(x_1 + x_2) = f(x_1) + f(x_2)$ for all $x_1, x_2 \in X$.

    b) $f(tx) = tf(x)$ for all $x \in X$ and $t \in \mathbb{R}$.

Linear functions are convex, and their convexity is preserved under addition and multiplication by a constant. This means that if $f(x)$ is convex, then $g(x) = af(x) + b$ is also convex for any constants $a, b$.

2. **Exponential functions**: Exponential functions are convex for all values of their argument. They are defined as functions that satisfy the following properties:

    a) $f(x_1 + x_2) \leq f(x_1) + f(x_2)$ for all $x_1, x_2 \in X$.

    b) $f(tx) \leq tf(x)$ for all $x \in X$ and $t \in [0, 1]$.

Exponential functions are often used in convex optimization problems to model situations where the objective function is non-convex but can be approximated by a convex function.

3. **Quadratic functions**: Quadratic functions are convex if and only if they have a positive semi-definite Hessian matrix. They are defined as functions that satisfy the following properties:

    a) $f(x_1 + x_2) \leq f(x_1) + f(x_2)$ for all $x_1, x_2 \in X$.

    b) $f(tx) \leq tf(x)$ for all $x \in X$ and $t \in [0, 1]$.

Quadratic functions are often used in convex optimization problems to model situations where the objective function is non-convex but can be approximated by a convex function.

4. **Convexity-preserving transformations**: Some transformations, such as taking the absolute value or the exponential of a function, preserve the convexity of a function. For example, if $f(x)$ is convex, then $|f(x)|$ and $e^{f(x)}$ are also convex.

These examples of convex functions illustrate the importance of convex functions in convex analysis and optimization. They provide a powerful tool for solving optimization problems, as we will see in the next section.




### Section: 8.2 Subgradients:

Subgradients play a crucial role in convex analysis and optimization. They are used to define the subdifferential of a convex function, which is a fundamental concept in convex analysis. In this section, we will define subgradients and discuss their properties.

#### 8.2a Definition and properties of subgradients

A subgradient of a convex function $f: X \to \R$ at a point $x \in X$ is a vector $g \in X$ such that:

$$
f(y) \geq f(x) + g^T(y - x)
$$

for all $y \in X$. The set of all subgradients of $f$ at $x$ is denoted by $\partial f(x)$.

The subdifferential of a convex function $f: X \to \R$ at a point $x \in X$ is defined as:

$$
\partial f(x) = \left\{ g \in X : f(y) \geq f(x) + g^T(y - x) \text{ for all } y \in X \right\}
$$

The subdifferential of a convex function at a point is always a convex set. Moreover, if $f$ is differentiable at $x$, then the subdifferential of $f$ at $x$ is equal to the set $\{ \nabla f(x) \}$, where $\nabla f(x)$ is the gradient of $f$ at $x$.

Subgradients have several important properties that make them useful in convex analysis and optimization. These properties include:

1. Subgradients are always convex: The set of subgradients of a convex function at a point is always a convex set. This property is useful in many optimization algorithms, as it allows us to use convex optimization techniques.

### Section: 8.2 Subgradients:

Subgradients play a crucial role in convex analysis and optimization. They are used to define the subdifferential of a convex function, which is a fundamental concept in convex analysis. In this section, we will define subgradients and discuss their properties.

#### 8.2a Definition and properties of subgradients

A subgradient of a convex function $f: X \to \R$ at a point $x \in X$ is a vector $g \in X$ such that:

$$
f(y) \geq f(x) + g^T(y - x)
$$

for all $y \in X$. The set of all subgradients of $f$ at $x$ is denoted by $\partial f(x)$.

The subdifferential of a convex function $f: X \to \R$ at a point $x \in X$ is defined as:

$$
\partial f(x) = \left\{ g \in X : f(y) \geq f(x) + g^T(y - x) \text{ for all } y \in X \right\}
$$

The subdifferential of a convex function at a point is always a convex set. Moreover, if $f$ is differentiable at $x$, then the subdifferential of $f$ at $x$ is equal to the set $\{ \nabla f(x) \}$, where $\nabla f(x)$ is the gradient of $f$ at $x$.

Subgradients have several important properties that make them useful in convex analysis and optimization. These properties include:

### Section: 8.3 Conjugate functions:

Conjugate functions play a crucial role in convex analysis and optimization. They are used to define the conjugate function of a convex function, which is a fundamental concept in convex analysis. In this section, we will define conjugate functions and discuss their properties.

#### 8.3a Definition and properties of conjugate functions

A conjugate function of a convex function $f: X \to \R$ is a function $f^*: X \to \R$ such that:

$$
f^*(x^*) = \sup_{x \in X} \left\{ x^*^T x - f(x) \right\}
$$

for all $x^* \in X$. The conjugate function of $f$ is always a convex function. Moreover, if $f$ is differentiable at $x$, then the conjugate function of $f$ at $x^*$ is equal to:

$$
f^*(x^*) = x^*^T x - f(x) + \sup_{y \in X} \left\{ y^T x^* - f(y) \right\}
$$

Conjugate functions have several important properties that make them useful in convex analysis and optimization. These properties include:
