## Foreward

Welcome to "The Role of Science and Scientists in Collaborative Approaches to Environmental Policymaking: A Comprehensive Guide". This book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of science and scientists in collaborative approaches to environmental policymaking. As the world faces increasingly complex environmental challenges, it is crucial to have a thorough understanding of the role of science and scientists in shaping policies that can effectively address these issues.

The book is structured around the concept of Collaborative Environmental Governance (CEG), a framework that emphasizes the importance of collaboration among stakeholders in addressing environmental issues. However, as with any approach, CEG also has its limitations and challenges. One of the key challenges is the immediate nature of environmental issues, which often require immediate actions. This can be a barrier to collaboration, as it takes time and resources to build and develop collaborative systems.

Another challenge is the presence of asymmetric power dynamics, which can hinder collaboration among institutions and actors. These power dynamics can be rooted in the existing power structures between different actors, making it difficult for them to collaborate effectively. This can lead to conflicts and hinder the overall effectiveness of CEG.

Furthermore, collaboration can also lead to increased conflict, especially in situations where large state actors are involved. In such cases, collaboration may be seen as a means of co-optation or marginalization of smaller actors. This can undermine the effectiveness of collaborative approaches and reinforce uneven power dynamics.

To address these challenges, the book will delve into the role of science and scientists in shaping environmental policies. It will explore how scientific knowledge and evidence can be effectively communicated and utilized in policymaking processes. The book will also discuss the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and the role of scientists in bridging the gap between science and policy.

In addition, the book will also touch upon the concept of Science of Science Policy (SoSP), an emerging interdisciplinary research area that seeks to develop theoretical and empirical models of the scientific enterprise. This will provide a scientific basis for government and society to make better R&D management decisions.

I hope this book will serve as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and policymakers alike, providing a comprehensive understanding of the role of science and scientists in collaborative approaches to environmental policymaking. Let us work together towards a more sustainable future.

### Subsection 1.3a Historical Perspective

The traditional role of science in society has evolved significantly over time. From the ancient civilizations of Greece and Rome, where science was seen as a means to understand the natural world, to the modern era where science has become an integral part of our daily lives, the relationship between science and society has undergone a profound transformation.

#### 1.3a Historical Perspective

The ancient Greeks, particularly the Pythagoreans, were among the first to recognize the importance of mathematics and science. They saw the world as a harmonious system governed by mathematical laws, and they sought to understand this system through observation and experimentation. This early fascination with science laid the foundation for the scientific method that we use today.

In the Middle Ages, science was often intertwined with religion and philosophy. The Scholastic philosophers, for instance, sought to reconcile the teachings of Aristotle with Christian doctrine. This period also saw the development of the first universities, where science was taught alongside other disciplines.

The Renaissance marked a significant shift in the role of science in society. The rediscovery of ancient Greek and Roman texts, particularly those of Aristotle and Galen, led to a renewed interest in science. This period also saw the rise of the scientific method, which emphasized observation, experimentation, and the use of mathematical models to explain natural phenomena.

The Scientific Revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries further solidified the importance of science in society. The work of scientists such as Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo challenged traditional beliefs about the universe and led to the development of modern astronomy and physics.

The Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries further transformed the role of science in society. The application of scientific principles to industry led to the development of new technologies and processes, driving economic growth and social change.

Today, science continues to play a crucial role in society. It is not only a means to understand the natural world but also a tool for solving societal problems and driving innovation. The traditional role of science in society has evolved significantly over time, and it continues to evolve as we face new challenges and opportunities.

In the next section, we will explore the role of science in environmental policymaking, a critical area where science and society intersect.




### Subsection 1.3b Science and Public Policy

The relationship between science and public policy has been a topic of great interest and debate. Science, as a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions, has a profound impact on public policy. It is through science that we understand the natural world and develop technologies that can address societal needs and challenges. However, the role of science in public policy is not without its complexities and controversies.

#### 1.3b Science and Public Policy

The traditional role of science in public policy has been one of providing evidence and information to inform policy decisions. This role is often referred to as the "scientific basis" for policy. The scientific basis is a critical component of the policy process, as it provides the evidence and information necessary for policymakers to make informed decisions. This role is particularly important in areas such as environmental policy, where scientific understanding is crucial for addressing complex environmental challenges.

However, the traditional role of science in public policy has been challenged by the increasing complexity of environmental issues and the growing demand for more participatory and inclusive decision-making processes. This has led to a shift in the role of science in public policy, with a greater emphasis on collaboration and co-production of knowledge between scientists and other stakeholders.

The concept of "co-production of knowledge" refers to the process where knowledge is not solely produced by scientists, but is also co-produced with other stakeholders, such as policymakers, industry, and the public. This approach recognizes the importance of involving a diverse range of stakeholders in the knowledge production process, as it can lead to more relevant and applicable knowledge for policy decisions.

The "science of science policy" (SoSP) is an emerging interdisciplinary research area that seeks to develop theoretical and empirical models of the scientific enterprise. This scientific basis can be used to help government, and society in general, make better R&D management decisions by establishing a scientifically rigorous, quantitative basis from which policy makers and researchers may assess the impacts of the nation's scientific and engineering enterprise, improve their understanding of its dynamics, and assess the likely outcomes.

The federal government of the United States has been a supporter of SoSP. In 2006, the National Science and Technology Council's Subcommittee on Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE) established an Interagency Task Group on Science of Science Policy (ITG) to serve as part of the internal deliberative process of the Subcommittee. The ITG's subsequent work has been guided by the questions outlined in the Roadmap and the action steps developed at the workshop. Furthermore, since 2007, the National Science Foundation, in support of academic research to advance the field, has awarded grants from the Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP) program.

In conclusion, the role of science in public policy is complex and multifaceted. It involves not only providing evidence and information, but also collaborating with other stakeholders in the co-production of knowledge. The emerging field of SoSP provides a scientific basis for this collaborative approach, and is crucial for addressing the complex environmental challenges of the 21st century.




### Subsection 1.3c Science and Education

The relationship between science and education is a critical aspect of the traditional role of science in society. Science education is the process of teaching and learning about science, including the natural world, the scientific method, and the role of science in society. It is through science education that we prepare the next generation of scientists, engineers, and citizens who will be responsible for addressing the complex environmental challenges we face.

#### 1.3c Science and Education

Science education plays a crucial role in promoting scientific literacy, which is the ability to understand and evaluate scientific information and its implications. Scientific literacy is essential for making informed decisions about scientific and technological issues that affect our lives and society. It is also crucial for fostering a scientifically literate public, which is necessary for a democratic society.

The traditional role of science in education has been one of teaching students the scientific method and the principles of science. This involves teaching students how to observe, measure, and analyze the natural world, and how to use this information to develop scientific explanations and predictions. This approach is often referred to as the "scientific method" and is a fundamental part of science education.

However, the traditional role of science in education has been challenged by the increasing complexity of scientific knowledge and the growing demand for more interdisciplinary and problem-based learning. This has led to a shift in the role of science in education, with a greater emphasis on interdisciplinary learning and problem-based learning.

Interdisciplinary learning involves the study of multiple disciplines in an integrated way. This approach recognizes the complexity of real-world problems and the need for students to understand and apply knowledge from multiple disciplines to address these problems. Problem-based learning, on the other hand, involves students in solving real-world problems, which allows them to apply their knowledge and skills in a meaningful way.

The concept of "science education for sustainable development" (SESD) is an example of a new approach to science education that reflects these changes. SESD aims to promote the use of science and technology to address the challenges of sustainable development, including environmental, social, and economic challenges. This approach recognizes the importance of interdisciplinary learning and problem-based learning in preparing students to address these challenges.

In conclusion, the traditional role of science in education has been one of teaching students the scientific method and the principles of science. However, the increasing complexity of scientific knowledge and the growing demand for more interdisciplinary and problem-based learning have led to a shift in this role, with a greater emphasis on interdisciplinary learning and problem-based learning. This shift reflects the changing nature of science and the need to prepare students for the challenges of the future.




### Subsection 1.4a Science and Technology

The relationship between science and technology is a complex and dynamic one. Science provides the knowledge and understanding of the natural world, while technology applies this knowledge to create practical solutions to real-world problems. This relationship is often referred to as the "science-technology interface" and is a critical aspect of the changing role of science in contemporary society.

#### 1.4a Science and Technology

The traditional role of science in technology has been one of providing the theoretical foundation for technological innovation. Scientists would conduct research to understand the natural world, and this knowledge would then be applied by engineers and technologists to create new technologies. This approach is often referred to as "reductionist" or "bottom-up" science, where complex systems are understood by breaking them down into their individual components.

However, the traditional role of science in technology has been challenged by the increasing complexity of technological systems and the growing demand for more interdisciplinary and problem-based learning. This has led to a shift in the role of science in technology, with a greater emphasis on interdisciplinary research and problem-based learning.

Interdisciplinary research involves the study of multiple disciplines in an integrated way. This approach recognizes the complexity of technological systems and the need for scientists, engineers, and technologists to work together to understand and develop these systems. Problem-based learning, on the other hand, involves learning by doing, where students are given real-world problems to solve, requiring them to apply their knowledge and skills in a practical context.

The changing role of science in technology is also reflected in the increasing importance of technology in scientific research. Many scientific experiments now rely on complex technological equipment, and the analysis of scientific data often involves the use of sophisticated software tools. This has led to a growing demand for scientists with a strong background in technology, and has also led to the development of new fields such as computational science and data science.

In conclusion, the relationship between science and technology is a complex and dynamic one, with both fields influencing and shaping each other in significant ways. As we move forward into the future, it is likely that this relationship will continue to evolve, with new challenges and opportunities emerging as we strive to address the complex environmental and societal issues of our time.

#### 3.3a Principles of Ecosystem Based Management

Ecosystem-based management (EBM) is a holistic approach to environmental management that recognizes the complex interactions between species, ecosystem components, and humans. It is a process that involves the integration of scientific knowledge, policy, and governance to achieve sustainable and resilient ecosystems. In this section, we will explore the principles of EBM and how they guide the implementation of this approach.

##### 3.3a.1 Principles of Ecosystem-Based Management

The principles of EBM are based on the understanding that ecosystems are complex and dynamic systems that are influenced by a variety of factors. These factors include natural processes, human activities, and environmental changes. Therefore, effective EBM requires a comprehensive understanding of these factors and their interactions.

One of the key principles of EBM is the precautionary principle, which states that in the face of potential irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason to postpone taking action to prevent harm. This principle is particularly relevant in the context of environmental management, where the potential consequences of inaction can be severe and irreversible.

Another important principle of EBM is the adaptive management principle, which recognizes the need for flexibility and learning in the face of uncertainty and changing conditions. This principle emphasizes the importance of monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of management strategies and making adjustments as needed.

The principles of EBM also include the principles of sustainability and resilience. Sustainability refers to the ability of ecosystems to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Resilience, on the other hand, refers to the ability of ecosystems to withstand and recover from disturbances.

##### 3.3a.2 Implementing Ecosystem-Based Management

Implementing EBM can be a complex and challenging process, especially in large and diverse ecosystems. However, there are some key steps that can guide the implementation process.

The first step is to define clear and concise goals for EBM. These goals should be broadly applicable, measurable, and readily observable, and ideally be collectively supported in order to be achievable. They should also be flexible enough to incorporate a measure of uncertainty and be able to evolve as conditions and knowledge change.

The next step is to involve the community and stakeholders in the process. This is crucial for ensuring that the goals and objectives of EBM are aligned with the values and needs of the community. It also helps to build support and commitment for the implementation of EBM.

Finally, it is important to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of EBM strategies.

#### 3.3b Ecosystem Services

Ecosystem services are the benefits that humans receive from ecosystems. These services are essential for human well-being and are often taken for granted. However, human activities are causing significant degradation of ecosystems, leading to a decline in these services. In this section, we will explore the concept of ecosystem services and their importance in environmental management.

##### 3.3b.1 Types of Ecosystem Services

The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment identified four major categories of ecosystem services: provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services. Provisioning services refer to the tangible, material products of ecosystem processes, such as water, food, fuel, and medicinal plants. These services are essential for human survival and well-being.

Regulating services, on the other hand, are the processes that maintain the conditions necessary for life on Earth. These include the maintenance of hydrological cycles, cleaning air and water, the maintenance of oxygen in the atmosphere, and crop pollination. These services are crucial for the functioning of ecosystems and are often taken for granted.

Cultural services refer to the non-material benefits that humans receive from ecosystems, such as recreation, inspiration, and opportunities for research. These services are essential for human well-being and are often overlooked in environmental management.

Finally, supporting services, also known as ecosystem services, are the foundation upon which all other ecosystem services depend. These include nutrient cycling, soil formation, and pest regulation. These services are often taken for granted, but their decline can have cascading effects on other ecosystem services.

##### 3.3b.2 Importance of Ecosystem Services

Ecosystem services are essential for human well-being and are often taken for granted. However, human activities, such as deforestation, pollution, and overfishing, are causing significant degradation of ecosystems, leading to a decline in these services. This decline can have severe consequences for human health, livelihoods, and overall well-being.

For example, the decline in regulating services, such as the maintenance of hydrological cycles and air and water purification, can lead to water scarcity, air pollution, and the spread of diseases. The decline in provisioning services, such as food and fuel, can have severe consequences for human livelihoods, particularly in developing countries.

Moreover, the decline in cultural services, such as recreation and inspiration, can have a significant impact on human quality of life. The loss of these services can also lead to a loss of cultural and spiritual values associated with ecosystems.

In conclusion, ecosystem services are essential for human well-being and are often taken for granted. However, their decline can have severe consequences for human health, livelihoods, and overall well-being. Therefore, it is crucial to incorporate the management of ecosystem services into environmental policies and practices.

It is often perceived as a complex process due to the large and diverse areas it is applied to, as well as the uncertainty and difficulty in predicting outcomes. However, with the increasing need for effective environmental management, EBM is likely to be used more in the future.

##### 3.3c.1 Implementation of Ecosystem-based Management

The implementation of EBM involves setting clear and concise goals, involving the community and stakeholders, and incorporating social, cultural, economic, and environmental importance. As discussed by Slocombe (1998a), goals should be broadly applicable, measurable, and readily observable, and ideally be collectively supported in order to be achievable. They should also be flexible enough to incorporate a measure of uncertainty and be able to evolve as conditions and knowledge change.

In addition to setting goals, EBM also involves identifying and addressing threats to ecosystems. This may involve focusing on specific threatening processes, as discussed by Slocombe (1998a). For example, in the case of the Great Barrier Reef, the Australian Institute of Marine Science identified 12 threatening processes that were contributing to the decline of the reef. By addressing these specific processes, the reef was able to recover and maintain its health.

##### 3.3c.2 Case Studies of Ecosystem-based Management

There are several case studies that demonstrate the successful implementation of EBM. One such example is the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. As mentioned earlier, the reef was facing significant degradation due to a variety of threats. However, through the implementation of EBM, the reef was able to recover and maintain its health. This involved setting clear goals, involving the community and stakeholders, and addressing specific threatening processes.

Another case study is the Chesapeake Bay in the United States. The bay was facing pollution and habitat degradation due to human activities. Through the implementation of EBM, the bay was able to recover and maintain its health. This involved setting clear goals, involving the community and stakeholders, and incorporating social, cultural, economic, and environmental importance.

##### 3.3c.3 Challenges and Future Directions

Despite the success of these case studies, there are still challenges in implementing EBM. One of the main challenges is the uncertainty and difficulty in predicting outcomes.
