### 1.1: Basics of Crystal Structure Refinement

Crystal structure refinement is a powerful technique used to determine the atomic and molecular structure of crystalline materials. It is an essential tool in the field of materials science, as it allows us to understand the arrangement of atoms and molecules within a crystal, which is crucial for predicting and controlling the properties of materials.

In this section, we will cover the basics of crystal structure refinement, including the concept of crystal structure, the principles of crystal structure refinement, and the different methods used for crystal structure refinement.

#### 1.1a: Crystal Structure

A crystal is a solid material with a regular, repeating arrangement of atoms or molecules. This arrangement is known as the crystal structure, and it is what gives crystals their unique properties. The crystal structure is determined by the type of atoms or molecules present in the crystal, as well as the interactions between them.

The crystal structure can be described using a unit cell, which is the smallest repeating unit of the crystal. The unit cell contains all the information about the crystal structure, as it is repeated throughout the entire crystal. The unit cell is defined by six lattice parameters, which describe the size and shape of the unit cell.

#### 1.1b: Principles of Crystal Structure Refinement

Crystal structure refinement is based on the principle of least squares, which states that the best fit between experimental data and theoretical calculations is achieved when the sum of the squares of the differences between the two is minimized. In crystal structure refinement, this principle is applied to the observed and calculated structure factors, which are used to determine the crystal structure.

The observed structure factors are obtained from experimental data, such as X-ray diffraction patterns. The calculated structure factors are calculated using the crystal structure model, which is a theoretical representation of the crystal structure. By minimizing the difference between the observed and calculated structure factors, the crystal structure model can be refined to accurately represent the true crystal structure.

#### 1.1c: Methods of Crystal Structure Refinement

There are several methods used for crystal structure refinement, each with its own advantages and limitations. Some of the most commonly used methods include the Rietveld method, the direct method, and the indirect method.

The Rietveld method, also known as the full-profile refinement method, is a powerful technique that allows for the simultaneous refinement of the crystal structure model and the experimental data. It is particularly useful for complex crystal structures with multiple phases and defects.

The direct method, also known as the ab initio method, is based on the principle of direct phasing, where the crystal structure is determined directly from the experimental data without the need for a priori knowledge of the crystal structure. This method is particularly useful for simple crystal structures with a high degree of symmetry.

The indirect method, also known as the iterative method, is based on the principle of iterative refinement, where the crystal structure model is gradually improved through repeated cycles of refinement. This method is particularly useful for complex crystal structures with multiple phases and defects.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the principles and methods of crystal structure refinement, providing a comprehensive guide for understanding and applying these techniques.

## Unit cell

Crystal structure is described in terms of the geometry of arrangement of particles in the unit cells. The unit cell is defined as the smallest repeating unit having the full symmetry of the crystal structure. The geometry of the unit cell is defined as a parallelepiped, providing six lattice parameters taken as the lengths of the cell edges ("a", "b", "c") and the angles between them (α, β, γ). The positions of particles inside the unit cell are described by the fractional coordinates ("x<sub>i</sub>", "y<sub>i</sub>", "z<sub>i</sub>") along the cell edges, measured from a reference point. It is thus only necessary to report the coordinates of a smallest asymmetric subset of particles, called the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The asymmetric unit may be chosen so that it occupies the smallest physical space, which means that not all particles need to be physically located inside the boundaries given by the lattice parameters. All other particles of the unit cell are generated by the symmetry operations that characterize the symmetry of the unit cell. The collection of symmetry operations of the unit cell is expressed formally as the space group of the crystal structure.

### Miller indices

Vectors and planes in a crystal lattice are described by the three-value Miller index notation. This syntax uses the indices "h", "k", and "ℓ" as directional parameters.

By definition, the syntax ("hkℓ") denotes a plane that intercepts the three points "a"<sub>1</sub>/"h", "a"<sub>2</sub>/"k", and "a"<sub>3</sub>/"ℓ", or some multiple thereof. That is, the Miller indices are proportional to the inverses of the intercepts of the plane with the unit cell (in the basis of the lattice vectors). If one or more of the indices is zero, it means that the planes do not intersect that axis (i.e., the intercept is "at infinity"). A plane containing a coordinate axis is translated so that it no longer contains that axis before its Miller indices are determined.

## Chapter 2: Crystal Structure Refinement:




### Section: 1.1 From Crystal to Diffraction Pattern:

Crystals are solid materials that have a regular, repeating arrangement of atoms or molecules. This arrangement is known as the crystal structure and is described in terms of the geometry of the unit cell. The unit cell is the smallest repeating unit that has the full symmetry of the crystal structure. It is defined by six lattice parameters, taken as the lengths of the cell edges ("a", "b", "c") and the angles between them (α, β, γ). The positions of particles within the unit cell are described by fractional coordinates ("x<sub>i</sub>", "y<sub>i</sub>", "z<sub>i</sub>") along the cell edges, measured from a reference point.

The crystal structure can be visualized using Miller indices, a notation system that describes vectors and planes in a crystal lattice. The syntax ("hkℓ") denotes a plane that intercepts the three points "a"<sub>1</sub>/"h", "a"<sub>2</sub>/"k", and "a"<sub>3</sub>/"ℓ", or some multiple thereof. This means that the Miller indices are proportional to the inverses of the intercepts of the plane with the unit cell. If one or more of the indices is zero, it means that the planes do not intersect that axis.

When a beam of electromagnetic radiation, such as X-rays or light, is passed through a crystal, it is diffracted by the regular arrangement of atoms or molecules. This diffraction pattern can be analyzed to determine the crystal structure. The diffraction pattern is a function of the crystal structure, the wavelength of the radiation, and the orientation of the crystal with respect to the radiation.

The diffraction pattern can be calculated using the Fraunhofer diffraction equation, which describes the diffraction of a beam of electromagnetic radiation by a grating. The equation is given by:

$$
U(\theta) = a \left [e^{\frac { i\pi S \sin \theta }{\lambda}} + e^{- \frac { i \pi S \sin \theta} {\lambda}} \right] \int_ {-W/2}^{W/2} e^{ {-2 \pi ix' \sin \theta} / \lambda} \, dx'
$$

where $U(\theta)$ is the diffracted pattern, $a$ is the amplitude of the incident beam, $S$ is the spacing between the slits, $W$ is the width of the slits, $\theta$ is the angle of diffraction, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the radiation.

The diffraction pattern can also be calculated using Fourier transforms. The aperture function, which describes the shape of the aperture, is given by:

$$
a \left[\operatorname {rect} \left (\frac{x-S/2}{W} \right) + \operatorname {rect} \left (\frac{x+S/2}{W} \right) \right]
$$

The Fourier transform of this function is given by:

$$
\hat f(\operatorname{rect}(ax)) = \frac 1 \cdot \operatorname{sinc}\left(\frac{\xi}{2a}\right)
$$

where $\xi$ is the Fourier transform frequency. The Fourier transform of the aperture function can be used to calculate the diffracted pattern, $U(x,z)$, as follows:

$$
U(x,z) = \hat {f} \left [a \left[\operatorname {rect} \left (\frac{x-S/2}{W} \right) + \operatorname {rect} \left (\frac{x+S/2}{W} \right) \right ] \right ] = 2W \left[ e^{- i \pi Sx/\lambda z}+e^{ i \pi Sx/\lambda z} \right] \frac {\sin { \frac {\pi Wx} {\lambda z}}}{ \frac {\pi Wx} {\lambda z}}
$$

or

$$
U(\theta)= 2a \cos {\frac { \pi S \sin \theta } \lambda} W \operatorname{sinc} \frac { \pi W \sin \theta} \lambda
$$

The intensity of the diffracted pattern, $I(\theta)$, is given by:

$$
I(\theta) \propto \cos^2 \left [ \frac {\pi S \sin \theta} \lambda \right] \operatorname{sinc}^2 \left [ \frac {\pi W \sin \theta}\lambda \right]
$$

This equation shows that the intensity of the diffracted pattern is proportional to the square of the cosine of the scattering angle and the square of the sinc of the product of the width of the slits and the sine of the scattering angle. This equation is known as the Fraunhofer diffraction equation.

In the next section, we will discuss how to use the diffraction pattern to determine the crystal structure.




### Section: 1.1c Diffraction Pattern Analysis

The analysis of the diffraction pattern is a crucial step in crystal structure refinement. It involves the interpretation of the diffraction pattern to determine the crystal structure. This is done by comparing the observed diffraction pattern with the calculated diffraction pattern for different crystal structures. The crystal structure that gives the best match with the observed diffraction pattern is then considered to be the correct crystal structure.

The diffraction pattern analysis can be performed using various methods, including the Rietveld method, the direct method, and the indirect method. The Rietveld method is the most commonly used method for crystal structure refinement. It involves the simultaneous refinement of the crystal structure and the diffraction pattern. The direct method involves the direct determination of the crystal structure from the diffraction pattern, without any prior knowledge of the crystal structure. The indirect method involves the determination of the crystal structure from the diffraction pattern, using additional information such as chemical composition or symmetry.

The diffraction pattern analysis can also be performed using various software tools, such as FullProf, Jana, and GSAS. These tools provide a user-friendly interface for the analysis of the diffraction pattern and the refinement of the crystal structure. They also provide a range of options for the visualization and interpretation of the diffraction pattern.

The analysis of the diffraction pattern can be a complex and time-consuming process. However, with the advancements in computational methods and software tools, it has become more accessible and efficient. It is an essential tool for the study of crystal structures and their properties.

#### 1.1c.1 Rietveld Method

The Rietveld method is a powerful method for crystal structure refinement. It involves the simultaneous refinement of the crystal structure and the diffraction pattern. The method is based on the least-squares method, which minimizes the difference between the observed and calculated diffraction patterns. The Rietveld method is particularly useful for the refinement of complex crystal structures, as it can handle a large number of parameters.

The Rietveld method involves the following steps:

1. The crystal structure is modeled using a set of atomic positions and thermal factors.
2. The diffraction pattern is calculated for the modeled crystal structure.
3. The observed and calculated diffraction patterns are compared, and the difference is minimized by adjusting the atomic positions and thermal factors.
4. The crystal structure is refined until the difference between the observed and calculated diffraction patterns is minimized.

The Rietveld method provides a quantitative measure of the goodness of fit, which is the ratio of the observed and calculated diffraction patterns. A value close to 1 indicates a good fit, while a value greater than 1 indicates a poor fit.

#### 1.1c.2 Direct Method

The direct method involves the direct determination of the crystal structure from the diffraction pattern, without any prior knowledge of the crystal structure. The method is based on the principle of phase determination, which involves the determination of the phase of the diffracted waves. The direct method is particularly useful for the determination of the crystal structure from a single crystal.

The direct method involves the following steps:

1. The diffraction pattern is measured for a single crystal.
2. The diffraction pattern is analyzed to determine the crystal system and the unit cell parameters.
3. The crystal structure is determined by solving the phase problem, which involves the determination of the phase of the diffracted waves.

The direct method is a powerful tool for crystal structure determination, as it can provide a complete determination of the crystal structure from a single crystal. However, it requires a high-quality diffraction pattern and a good understanding of the crystal system and the unit cell parameters.

#### 1.1c.3 Indirect Method

The indirect method involves the determination of the crystal structure from the diffraction pattern, using additional information such as chemical composition or symmetry. The method is particularly useful for the determination of the crystal structure from polycrystalline samples.

The indirect method involves the following steps:

1. The diffraction pattern is measured for a polycrystalline sample.
2. The diffraction pattern is analyzed to determine the crystal system and the unit cell parameters.
3. The crystal structure is determined by using additional information such as chemical composition or symmetry.

The indirect method is a useful tool for crystal structure determination, as it can provide a good approximation of the crystal structure even from a polycrystalline sample. However, it requires a good understanding of the crystal system and the unit cell parameters, as well as additional information about the crystal structure.

## Chapter: Direct Methods

### Introduction

The study of crystal structures is a fundamental aspect of materials science and chemistry. It involves the determination of the arrangement of atoms, ions, and molecules in a crystal, which is crucial for understanding the properties and behavior of materials. Traditionally, this has been achieved through indirect methods, such as X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy. However, with the advent of direct methods, the process of crystal structure determination has become more efficient and accurate.

In this chapter, we will delve into the world of direct methods for crystal structure determination. These methods, also known as ab initio methods, involve the use of mathematical algorithms and computational techniques to solve crystal structures without any prior knowledge of the structure. This is in contrast to indirect methods, which require some initial information about the structure to be known.

We will begin by discussing the principles behind direct methods, including the concept of phase space and the role of symmetry in crystal structures. We will then explore the various algorithms and techniques used in direct methods, such as the Fourier method, the Patterson method, and the direct method of ShelX. We will also discuss the advantages and limitations of these methods, as well as their applications in different types of crystals.

Furthermore, we will examine the role of direct methods in the field of materials science, particularly in the study of new materials with unique properties. We will also touch upon the importance of direct methods in the development of new materials, as they allow for a deeper understanding of the crystal structure and its influence on the properties of the material.

Finally, we will discuss the future prospects of direct methods in the field of crystal structure determination, including the potential for further advancements and the integration of direct methods with other techniques. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of direct methods and their role in the study of crystal structures.

### Section: 1.2c Advanced Features of SHELX

In addition to its basic features, the SHELX package also includes several advanced features that make it a powerful tool for crystal structure refinement. These features include:

#### 1.2c.1 Non-crystallographic Symmetry

The SHELX package is capable of handling crystal structures with non-crystallographic symmetry. This means that the symmetry of the crystal structure is not limited to the traditional crystallographic symmetry operations, such as rotations and reflections. Non-crystallographic symmetry can occur in complex structures, such as biomolecules, and the SHELX package is equipped to handle it.

### Subsection 2.1a: Role of Hydrogen Atoms in Crystal Structures

Hydrogen atoms play a crucial role in crystal structures, particularly in the case of Ice Ih. The hydrogen atoms in Ice Ih are disordered, meaning they are not in a fixed position within the crystal lattice. This disorder allows for a certain amount of flexibility in the crystal structure, resulting in a residual entropy that is inherent to the lattice. This residual entropy is equal to 3.5 J mol<sup>−1</sup> K<sup>−1</sup> and is determined by the number of possible configurations of hydrogen positions that can be formed while still maintaining the requirement for each oxygen atom to have only two hydrogens in closest proximity.

The presence of hydrogen atoms in crystal structures also has a significant impact on the properties of these materials. For example, in Ice Ih, the hydrogen atoms play a crucial role in the hydrogen bonding between water molecules. This bonding is responsible for the unique properties of Ice Ih, such as its high melting and boiling points.

### Subsection: 3.1b Common Challenges in Atom Type Assignment

Atom type assignment is a crucial step in crystal structure refinement, as it allows us to accurately determine the atomic positions and bond lengths within a crystal structure. However, this process is not without its challenges. In this section, we will discuss some of the common challenges faced in atom type assignment and how they can be addressed.

#### 3.1b.1 Disorder in Crystal Structures

As mentioned in the previous section, disorder can significantly impact the accuracy of atom type assignment. This is because disorder can lead to variations in the atomic positions and bond lengths, making it difficult to determine the correct atom type for each atom. In some cases, disorder can even result in the presence of multiple atom types within a single crystal structure.

To address this challenge, it is essential to carefully analyze the diffraction data and use advanced techniques such as Rietveld refinement to account for disorder in the crystal structure. This involves fitting the diffraction data to a model that includes the disorder parameters, such as the occupancy and thermal factors, for each atom type. By doing so, we can accurately determine the atomic positions and bond lengths, even in the presence of disorder.

#### 3.1b.2 Complex Crystal Structures

Another common challenge in atom type assignment is dealing with complex crystal structures. In some cases, the crystal structure may contain multiple types of atoms, each with its own unique bond lengths and angles. This can make it difficult to accurately assign atom types, as the diffraction data may not be sufficient to distinguish between different atom types.

To address this challenge, it is important to carefully analyze the diffraction data and use advanced techniques such as ab initio structure determination. This involves using quantum chemical calculations to determine the atomic positions and bond lengths within the crystal structure. By combining this with the diffraction data, we can accurately assign atom types and obtain a more accurate crystal structure.

#### 3.1b.3 Limitations of Experimental Techniques

Experimental techniques, such as X-ray crystallography, have limitations when it comes to accurately determining the atomic positions and bond lengths within a crystal structure. This can make it difficult to assign atom types, especially in complex crystal structures.

To address this challenge, it is important to use a combination of experimental techniques, such as X-ray crystallography and neutron diffraction, to obtain a more complete understanding of the crystal structure. This can help to overcome the limitations of individual techniques and provide a more accurate determination of atom types.

In conclusion, atom type assignment is a crucial step in crystal structure refinement, but it is not without its challenges. By carefully analyzing the diffraction data and using advanced techniques, we can overcome these challenges and accurately determine the atomic positions and bond lengths within a crystal structure.

### Subsection: 3.1c Strategies for Resolving Ambiguities

In some cases, even with careful analysis and advanced techniques, there may still be ambiguities in atom type assignment. This can be due to a variety of factors, such as overlapping diffraction peaks or similar bond lengths and angles between different atom types. In this section, we will discuss some strategies for resolving these ambiguities.

#### 3.1c.1 Use of Additional Experimental Techniques

One strategy for resolving ambiguities is to use additional experimental techniques, such as neutron scattering or electron microscopy. These techniques can provide complementary information about the crystal structure, which can help to distinguish between different atom types. For example, neutron scattering can be used to determine the magnetic properties of a crystal, which can be useful for distinguishing between different types of atoms.

#### 3.1c.2 Use of Computational Methods

Another strategy for resolving ambiguities is to use computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These calculations can be used to predict the electronic structure and bond lengths of a crystal, which can help to distinguish between different atom types. Additionally, DFT calculations can also be used to optimize the atomic positions and bond lengths, providing a more accurate representation of the crystal structure.

#### 3.1c.3 Use of Machine Learning Techniques

In recent years, machine learning techniques have been increasingly used in crystal structure refinement. These techniques can be trained on large datasets of known crystal structures to learn patterns and features that can be used to distinguish between different atom types. This can be particularly useful for resolving ambiguities in complex crystal structures, where traditional methods may not be as effective.

#### 3.1c.4 Experimental Validation

Finally, it is important to note that all strategies for resolving ambiguities should be validated experimentally. This can be done by comparing the predicted results with experimental data, such as single crystal X-ray diffraction or powder X-ray diffraction. This step is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the assigned atom types.

In conclusion, resolving ambiguities in atom type assignment is a crucial step in crystal structure refinement. By carefully analyzing the diffraction data, using advanced techniques, and considering additional experimental and computational methods, we can accurately determine the atomic positions and bond lengths within a crystal structure, even in the presence of disorder and complexity.

### Subsection: 3.2a Causes of Atom Type Ambiguities

In the previous section, we discussed some strategies for resolving ambiguities in atom type assignment. However, it is important to understand the causes of these ambiguities in order to effectively address them. In this section, we will explore some of the common causes of atom type ambiguities in crystal structure refinement.

#### 3.2a.1 Similarity in Bond Lengths and Angles

One of the main causes of atom type ambiguities is the similarity in bond lengths and angles between different atom types. This can make it difficult to distinguish between different types of atoms, especially in complex crystal structures. For example, in a binary alloy, the bond lengths and angles between atoms of the same type may be very similar to those between atoms of different types. This can lead to ambiguities in atom type assignment, as the diffraction pattern may not be able to distinguish between the two types of atoms.

#### 3.2a.2 Overlapping Diffraction Peaks

Another common cause of atom type ambiguities is the overlapping of diffraction peaks. In a crystal structure, diffraction peaks are generated when electrons are scattered from the atoms in the crystal lattice. These peaks can overlap, making it difficult to distinguish between different types of atoms. This can be particularly problematic in complex crystal structures, where there may be multiple types of atoms present.

#### 3.2a.3 Disorder in the Crystal Structure

Disorder in the crystal structure can also lead to atom type ambiguities. Disorder refers to the random arrangement of atoms in a crystal lattice. This can occur due to defects in the crystal structure, such as vacancies or interstitials, or due to the presence of impurities. Disorder can make it difficult to determine the exact position and type of atoms in the crystal, leading to ambiguities in atom type assignment.

#### 3.2a.4 Limitations of Experimental Techniques

Finally, the limitations of experimental techniques can also contribute to atom type ambiguities. While techniques such as X-ray diffraction and neutron scattering are powerful tools for studying crystal structures, they have their limitations. For example, X-ray diffraction is sensitive to the electron density of atoms, rather than their specific type. This can make it difficult to distinguish between different types of atoms, especially if they have similar electron densities. Additionally, experimental techniques may not be able to provide information about the orientation of atoms in the crystal, which can also contribute to ambiguities in atom type assignment.

In the next section, we will discuss some strategies for addressing these causes of atom type ambiguities and improving the accuracy of atom type assignment in crystal structure refinement.





### Subsection: 3.2b Strategies for Resolving Ambiguities

In the previous section, we discussed some common causes of atom type ambiguities in crystal structure refinement. In this section, we will explore some strategies for resolving these ambiguities.

#### 3.2b.1 Use of Additional Experimental Techniques

One strategy for resolving atom type ambiguities is to use additional experimental techniques. These techniques can provide complementary information about the crystal structure, which can help to distinguish between different types of atoms. For example, techniques such as neutron diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and electron microscopy can provide information about the magnetic properties, electronic structure, and surface structure of the crystal, respectively. This information can then be used to help resolve ambiguities in atom type assignment.

#### 3.2b.2 Use of Computational Methods

Another strategy for resolving atom type ambiguities is to use computational methods. These methods can be used to calculate the electronic structure and bonding of the crystal, which can help to distinguish between different types of atoms. For example, density functional theory (DFT) calculations can be used to calculate the electronic structure of the crystal, while molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be used to study the dynamics of the crystal and its constituent atoms. These methods can provide valuable insights into the crystal structure and help to resolve ambiguities in atom type assignment.

#### 3.2b.3 Use of Machine Learning Techniques

In recent years, machine learning techniques have been increasingly used in the field of crystal structure refinement. These techniques can be used to analyze large datasets of crystal structures and learn patterns and relationships between different types of atoms. This information can then be used to help resolve ambiguities in atom type assignment. For example, deep learning techniques have been used to predict the crystal structure of a compound based on its chemical composition, which can help to identify the types of atoms present in the crystal.

#### 3.2b.4 Use of Crystallographic Constraints

Crystallographic constraints can also be used to help resolve atom type ambiguities. These constraints are based on the known properties of the crystal, such as its symmetry, lattice parameters, and thermal factors. By applying these constraints, it is possible to narrow down the possible atom types and make an informed assignment. For example, if the crystal has a known symmetry, this can be used to determine the position and type of atoms in the crystal lattice.

#### 3.2b.5 Use of Chemical Knowledge

Finally, chemical knowledge can be used to help resolve atom type ambiguities. This involves using knowledge about the chemical properties of different types of atoms to make an informed assignment. For example, if the crystal contains a metal atom, it is likely to have a high electron density and a strong scattering factor. This information can be used to distinguish it from other types of atoms in the crystal.

In conclusion, there are several strategies that can be used to resolve atom type ambiguities in crystal structure refinement. By combining these strategies, it is possible to accurately determine the types of atoms present in a crystal and gain a deeper understanding of its structure and properties. 





### Subsection: 3.2c Case Studies of Atom Type Ambiguities

In this section, we will explore some case studies of atom type ambiguities in crystal structure refinement. These case studies will provide real-world examples of the challenges and strategies involved in resolving atom type ambiguities.

#### 3.2c.1 Case Study 1: [Re<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>8</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>

The crystal structure of [Re<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>8</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> presents a challenging case of atom type ambiguity. The primary orbital interactions (PIO) analysis of this compound reveals four primary orbital interactions, which corresponds to the quadruple bond (one σ, two π, and one δ). This complex bonding situation can make it difficult to distinguish between different types of atoms in the crystal structure.

To resolve this ambiguity, additional experimental techniques such as neutron diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy were used. These techniques provided complementary information about the magnetic properties and electronic structure of the crystal, which helped to distinguish between different types of atoms.

#### 3.2c.2 Case Study 2: Properties of Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals

Another challenging case of atom type ambiguity is found in the properties of metals, metalloids, and nonmetals. Within each category, elements can be found with one or two properties very different from the expected norm, or that are otherwise notable. This can make it difficult to assign atom types in these compounds.

To resolve this ambiguity, computational methods such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used. These methods provided insights into the electronic structure and dynamics of the crystal, which helped to distinguish between different types of atoms.

#### 3.2c.3 Case Study 3: Atoms for Peace

The Atoms for Peace project, which aimed to provide nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, also presents a case of atom type ambiguity. The project involved the use of various types of atoms, including isotopes, in nuclear reactors and other applications.

## Chapter: Chapter 4: Disorder in Crystal Structure Refinement:

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamental concepts of crystal structure refinement, including the determination of atomic positions and thermal factors. However, in many real-world scenarios, the crystal structures are not perfectly ordered, and there exists a certain degree of disorder. This disorder can arise due to various factors such as temperature, pressure, and chemical composition. In this chapter, we will delve into the topic of disorder in crystal structure refinement and discuss the methods and techniques used to handle it.

The presence of disorder in a crystal structure can significantly affect the accuracy and reliability of the refinement process. It can lead to errors in the determination of atomic positions and thermal factors, resulting in a distorted understanding of the crystal structure. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the nature of disorder and its impact on crystal structure refinement.

We will begin by discussing the different types of disorder that can occur in a crystal structure, such as thermal disorder, compositional disorder, and structural disorder. We will then explore the various methods used to model and refine these types of disorder, including the use of thermal factors, occupancy factors, and the R-factor. We will also discuss the limitations and challenges associated with these methods and how to overcome them.

Furthermore, we will examine the role of disorder in the overall crystal structure refinement process. We will discuss how disorder can affect the accuracy of the refined atomic positions and thermal factors, and how it can be used to gain insights into the physical and chemical properties of the crystal. We will also explore the relationship between disorder and other properties such as symmetry and space group.

In conclusion, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding and handling disorder in crystal structure refinement. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the nature of disorder, its impact on crystal structure refinement, and the methods and techniques used to handle it.

### Subsection: 3.3a Introduction to Disorder in Crystal Structures

Disorder in crystal structures refers to the random or irregular arrangement of atoms or molecules within a crystal lattice. This disorder can arise due to a variety of factors, including thermal motion, defects in the crystal structure, and the presence of impurities. Understanding and characterizing this disorder is crucial for accurately determining the crystal structure and properties of a material.

#### 3.3a.1 Types of Disorder

There are several types of disorder that can occur in crystal structures. These include:

- **Thermal disorder**: This type of disorder is caused by the thermal motion of atoms or molecules within the crystal lattice. At higher temperatures, this thermal motion becomes more pronounced, leading to increased disorder.

- **Structural disorder**: This type of disorder is caused by defects in the crystal structure, such as vacancies or interstitials. These defects can disrupt the regular arrangement of atoms or molecules, leading to disorder.

- **Compositional disorder**: This type of disorder is caused by the presence of impurities or variations in the composition of the crystal. These variations can lead to irregularities in the arrangement of atoms or molecules, resulting in disorder.

#### 3.3a.2 Characterizing Disorder

The degree of disorder in a crystal structure can be characterized by various parameters, including the mean square displacement (MSD) and the radial distribution function (RDF). The MSD is a measure of the average displacement of atoms or molecules from their ideal positions in the crystal lattice. The RDF, on the other hand, provides information about the distribution of atoms or molecules around a reference atom or molecule.

#### 3.3a.3 Disorder and Crystal Structure Refinement

Disorder in crystal structures can pose significant challenges for crystal structure refinement. The presence of disorder can lead to overlapping of atomic or molecular positions, making it difficult to accurately determine the crystal structure. Furthermore, disorder can also affect the accuracy of the refined atomic or molecular positions, leading to errors in the crystal structure.

To address these challenges, various techniques have been developed for dealing with disorder in crystal structure refinement. These include:

- **Average structure refinement**: This method involves refining the average structure of the crystal, taking into account the disorder present in the crystal. This method is particularly useful for systems with significant disorder.

- **Partial occupancy refinement**: This method involves refining the occupancy of different atomic or molecular sites in the crystal. This can be useful for systems with partial occupancy of certain sites.

- **Temperature factor refinement**: This method involves refining the temperature factor of atoms or molecules, which takes into account the thermal motion of atoms or molecules within the crystal lattice.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these methods and explore their applications in dealing with disorder in crystal structure refinement.




### Subsection: 3.3b Identifying Disorder in Diffraction Patterns

Disorder in crystal structures can be identified through the analysis of diffraction patterns. Diffraction patterns are generated when a beam of electromagnetic radiation, such as X-rays or neutrons, is passed through a crystal. The diffraction pattern provides information about the arrangement of atoms or molecules within the crystal lattice.

#### 3.3b.1 Disorder and Diffraction Patterns

The presence of disorder in a crystal structure can significantly alter the diffraction pattern. This is because disorder introduces additional variations in the arrangement of atoms or molecules, which can lead to additional peaks or broadening of existing peaks in the diffraction pattern.

#### 3.3b.2 Analyzing Diffraction Patterns

The analysis of diffraction patterns can be performed using various techniques, including X-ray crystallography and neutron crystallography. These techniques involve the measurement of the intensities of the diffracted beams at different angles. The resulting data can then be compared with theoretical calculations to identify the presence of disorder.

#### 3.3b.3 Disorder and Crystal Structure Refinement

The presence of disorder in a crystal structure can complicate the process of crystal structure refinement. This is because the additional variations introduced by disorder can lead to ambiguity in the interpretation of the diffraction pattern. However, with careful analysis and the use of advanced techniques such as the hybrid input-output (HIO) algorithm, it is possible to accurately determine the crystal structure and properties of a material, even in the presence of disorder.




### Subsection: 3.3c Refining Disordered Structures

Refining disordered structures is a complex process that requires a deep understanding of the underlying principles of crystal structure refinement. The goal of this process is to accurately determine the crystal structure and properties of a material, even in the presence of disorder. This is achieved through the use of advanced techniques such as the hybrid input-output (HIO) algorithm, which combines elements of both input-output and output-only methods.

#### 3.3c.1 The Hybrid Input-Output (HIO) Algorithm

The HIO algorithm is a powerful tool for refining disordered structures. It combines the advantages of both input-output and output-only methods, providing a more robust and accurate approach to crystal structure refinement. The algorithm operates by first generating an initial model of the crystal structure, which is then used as the input for a series of refinement cycles.

In each refinement cycle, the algorithm calculates the expected output based on the current model, and then compares this with the observed output. The difference between the expected and observed outputs is then used to adjust the model parameters, with the goal of minimizing the difference. This process is repeated for a number of cycles, with the model parameters being adjusted at each step.

#### 3.3c.2 Advantages of the HIO Algorithm

The HIO algorithm offers several advantages over traditional input-output and output-only methods. First, it allows for the refinement of disordered structures, which is not possible with either of the other two methods. Second, it provides a more robust and accurate approach to crystal structure refinement, as it combines the strengths of both input-output and output-only methods. Finally, it is a flexible and versatile algorithm, which can be adapted to a wide range of different types of crystal structures.

#### 3.3c.3 Limitations of the HIO Algorithm

Despite its many advantages, the HIO algorithm also has some limitations. One of the main limitations is that it requires a good initial model of the crystal structure. If the initial model is not accurate, the algorithm may not be able to converge on a solution, or may converge on a solution that is not physically meaningful. Additionally, the algorithm can be computationally intensive, particularly for large and complex crystal structures.

In conclusion, the HIO algorithm is a powerful tool for refining disordered structures. While it has its limitations, it offers a robust and accurate approach to crystal structure refinement, and is a valuable tool for researchers in the field.

Each of these techniques provides unique insights into the disorder in a material, and they are often used in combination to gain a comprehensive understanding of the disorder.

X-ray diffraction is a powerful tool for studying the long-range order in a crystal structure. It can provide information about the arrangement of atoms in a material, and can also reveal the presence of disorder through the observation of broadened peaks in the diffraction pattern.

Neutron diffraction is particularly useful for studying the short-range order in a crystal structure. It is sensitive to the magnetic moments of atoms, and can provide information about the magnetic ordering in a material. This can be particularly important in the study of disordered structures, as the presence of disorder can lead to the formation of magnetic domains.

Electron microscopy, on the other hand, provides a high-resolution image of the crystal structure. This can be particularly useful for studying the local structure of a material, and can reveal the presence of disorder through the observation of defects or variations in the atomic arrangement.

#### 3.5a.3 Disorder and Crystal Structure Refinement

The presence of disorder in a crystal structure can complicate the process of crystal structure refinement. The disorder can lead to the overlapping of peaks in the diffraction pattern, making it difficult to determine the atomic positions. However, with the use of advanced refinement algorithms, such as the HIO algorithm, it is possible to accurately determine the crystal structure even in the presence of disorder.

The refinement of the crystal structure of the disordered binary alloy has demonstrated the effectiveness of these algorithms.

#### 3.5b Case Study: Complex Disordered Structure

In this section, we will explore a case study of a complex disordered structure, specifically the crystal structure of a glassy carbon material. Glass carbon is a unique material that is both lightweight and strong, making it a promising material for various applications. However, the complex disordered structure of glass carbon poses significant challenges for crystal structure refinement.

#### 3.5b.1 The Crystal Structure of Glass Carbon

The crystal structure of glass carbon is characterized by a high degree of disorder. This disorder arises from the random arrangement of carbon atoms in the material, which leads to a lack of long-range order. This lack of order is reflected in the diffraction pattern of glass carbon, which is characterized by a broad and featureless peak.

The disorder in glass carbon is further complicated by the presence of amorphous regions in the material. These amorphous regions, which are regions of disordered carbon atoms, are interspersed with regions of ordered carbon atoms. This mixture of ordered and disordered regions adds another layer of complexity to the crystal structure of glass carbon.

#### 3.5b.2 Challenges in Crystal Structure Refinement

The complex disordered structure of glass carbon presents significant challenges for crystal structure refinement. Traditional crystallographic techniques, such as X-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction, are not particularly effective in studying the disorder in glass carbon. This is because these techniques are sensitive to the long-range order in a material, and the lack of long-range order in glass carbon makes it difficult to obtain meaningful data.

Electron microscopy, on the other hand, can provide valuable information about the disorder in glass carbon. However, it is a time-consuming and expensive technique, and it is not suitable for studying the disorder in large samples.

#### 3.5b.3 Future Directions

Despite the challenges, there are several promising directions for future research in the study of the crystal structure of glass carbon. One approach is to use advanced computational techniques, such as molecular dynamics simulations, to model the disorder in glass carbon. These simulations can provide valuable insights into the structure and properties of glass carbon, and can help to guide experimental studies.

Another direction is to develop new experimental techniques that are specifically designed to study the disorder in glass carbon. For instance, Raman spectroscopy, which is sensitive to the vibrational modes of molecules, could be used to study the disorder in glass carbon. This technique could provide complementary information to electron microscopy, and could help to overcome the limitations of traditional crystallographic techniques.

In conclusion, the study of the crystal structure of glass carbon is a complex and challenging field, but it is also a promising field with many potential applications.

However, understanding and accounting for twinning is crucial for obtaining accurate and reliable structural information.

#### 4.1a.1 Types of Twinning

Twinning can be broadly classified into two types: simple twinning and complex twinning. Simple twinning occurs when two crystals are related by a symmetry operation, while complex twinning occurs when more than two crystals are related by symmetry operations.

Simple twinning can be further classified into three types: congruent twinning, incongruent twinning, and pseudo-twinning.

### Introduction

Crystal structure refinement is a crucial process in materials science and crystallography, allowing us to understand the atomic and molecular arrangement within a crystal. However, like any experimental technique, it is not without its limitations and potential sources of error. In this chapter, we will explore the various artefacts that can arise during crystal structure refinement and discuss strategies for their identification and mitigation.

Artefacts in crystal structure refinement can be broadly categorized into two types: those arising from the experimental data, and those arising from the computational models used to interpret the data. We will delve into the details of each of these categories, discussing the potential sources of error, their impact on the refined structure, and strategies for their mitigation.

In the realm of experimental data, artefacts can arise from a variety of sources, including the crystal itself, the experimental setup, and the data collection process. For instance, defects in the crystal can lead to distortions in the diffraction pattern, which can in turn affect the refined structure. Similarly, imperfections in the experimental setup, such as misalignment of the X-ray source or detector, can also introduce errors in the collected data.

On the computational side, artefacts can arise from the models used to interpret the experimental data. These models, which often involve complex mathematical calculations, can introduce errors if they are based on simplifying assumptions that do not accurately reflect the physical system under study. For example, the assumption of isotropic atomic displacement parameters can lead to significant errors in the refined structure if the crystal system is anisotropic.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into each of these topics, providing a comprehensive guide to understanding and mitigating artefacts in crystal structure refinement.




#### 5.1a Introduction to Artefacts in Crystal Structure Refinement

Crystal structure refinement is a powerful tool for understanding the atomic and molecular arrangement within a crystal. However, like any experimental technique, it is not without its limitations and potential sources of error. In this section, we will introduce the concept of artefacts in crystal structure refinement and discuss their impact on the refined structure.

Artefacts in crystal structure refinement can be broadly categorized into two types: those arising from the experimental data, and those arising from the computational models used to interpret the data. We will delve into the details of each of these categories in the following sections.

In the realm of experimental data, artefacts can arise from a variety of sources, including the crystal itself, the experimental setup, and the data collection process. For instance, defects in the crystal can lead to distortions in the diffraction pattern, which can in turn affect the refined structure. Similarly, imperfections in the experimental setup, such as misalignment of the X-ray source or detector, can also introduce errors in the collected data.

For example, the assumption of isotropic atomic displacement parameters can lead to significant errors in the refined structure if the crystal system is anisotropic.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into each of these topics, providing a comprehensive guide to understanding and mitigating artefacts in crystal structure refinement.

#### 5.1b Types of Artefacts

Artefacts in crystal structure refinement can be broadly categorized into two types: experimental artefacts and computational artefacts. 

##### Experimental Artefacts

Experimental artefacts arise from the experimental data collected during the crystal structure refinement process. These can be further divided into two categories: those arising from the crystal itself, and those arising from the experimental setup.

Crystal artefacts can be caused by defects in the crystal, such as impurities, dislocations, or stacking faults. These defects can distort the diffraction pattern, leading to errors in the refined structure. For instance, the presence of impurities can cause additional peaks in the diffraction pattern, which can be mistaken for peaks from the pure crystal. Similarly, dislocations and stacking faults can cause distortions in the diffraction pattern, leading to errors in the refined structure.

Experimental setup artefacts can be caused by imperfections in the experimental setup, such as misalignment of the X-ray source or detector. These imperfections can lead to errors in the collected data, which can in turn affect the refined structure. For example, misalignment of the X-ray source can cause the X-rays to hit the crystal at an angle, leading to errors in the diffraction pattern and the refined structure.

##### Computational Artefacts

Computational artefacts arise from the models used to interpret the experimental data. These can be caused by simplifying assumptions made in the models, which do not accurately reflect the physical system under study. For instance, the assumption of isotropic atomic displacement parameters can lead to significant errors in the refined structure if the crystal system is anisotropic.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into each of these types of artefacts, discussing their causes, effects, and strategies for mitigation.

#### 5.1c Mitigation of Artefacts

Mitigating artefacts in crystal structure refinement involves a combination of experimental and computational strategies. The goal is to minimize the impact of these artefacts on the refined structure, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of the results.

##### Mitigation of Experimental Artefacts

Mitigation of experimental artefacts involves improving the quality of the experimental data and the experimental setup. 

Improving the quality of the experimental data can be achieved by collecting more data. This can be done by increasing the exposure time, taking multiple measurements, or using more sensitive detectors. For instance, increasing the exposure time can help to reduce the impact of crystal defects, as more data can be collected to average out the distortions caused by these defects.

Improving the experimental setup involves checking and adjusting all components to ensure they are functioning properly. This can include checking the alignment of the X-ray source and detector, as well as checking for any sources of noise or interference. For example, misalignment of the X-ray source can be corrected by adjusting the position of the source or the detector.

##### Mitigation of Computational Artefacts

Mitigation of computational artefacts involves refining the models used to interpret the experimental data. This can be achieved by using more sophisticated models, or by refining the parameters of the models.

Using more sophisticated models can help to account for complex physical phenomena that may not be fully captured by simpler models. For instance, the assumption of isotropic atomic displacement parameters can be relaxed by using anisotropic models, which can account for the anisotropic nature of many crystals.

Refining the parameters of the models can help to improve the accuracy of the results. This can be done by using more accurate values for the parameters, or by refining the parameters during the crystal structure refinement process. For example, the atomic displacement parameters can be refined to account for the anisotropic nature of the crystal.

In the next section, we will discuss some specific examples of how these strategies can be applied to mitigate artefacts in crystal structure refinement.

#### 5.1b Identifying Artefacts in Diffraction Patterns

Identifying artefacts in diffraction patterns is a crucial step in crystal structure refinement. These artefacts can significantly affect the accuracy of the refined structure and must be carefully examined and corrected. In this section, we will discuss the various types of artefacts that can occur in diffraction patterns and how to identify them.

##### Experimental Artefacts

Experimental artefacts can arise from a variety of sources, including the crystal itself, the experimental setup, and the data collection process. One common source of experimental artefacts is the crystal itself. Defects in the crystal, such as impurities or defects in the crystal structure, can lead to distortions in the diffraction pattern. These distortions can then be interpreted as part of the crystal structure, leading to an inaccurate refinement.

Another source of experimental artefacts is the experimental setup. Imperfections in the setup, such as misalignment of the X-ray source or detector, can introduce errors in the collected data. These errors can then propagate through the refinement process, leading to an inaccurate structure.

##### Computational Artefacts

Computational artefacts can arise from the models used to interpret the experimental data. These models, which often involve complex mathematical calculations, can introduce errors if they are based on simplifying assumptions that do not accurately reflect the physical system under study. For example, the assumption of isotropic atomic displacement parameters can lead to significant errors in the refined structure if the crystal system is anisotropic.

##### Identifying Artefacts

Identifying artefacts in diffraction patterns can be a challenging task. However, there are several strategies that can be used to help identify and correct these artefacts. One approach is to compare the observed diffraction pattern with the expected pattern based on the known crystal structure. Any significant differences between the observed and expected patterns can indicate the presence of an artefact.

Another approach is to examine the diffraction pattern for any unexpected peaks or features. These features can indicate the presence of impurities or defects in the crystal, which can lead to artefacts in the refined structure.

In the next section, we will discuss some common techniques for correcting these artefacts and improving the accuracy of the refined crystal structure.

#### 5.1c Mitigating Artefacts in Crystal Structure Refinement

Mitigating artefacts in crystal structure refinement is a critical step in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the refined structure. This process involves identifying and correcting the sources of artefacts, as well as implementing strategies to minimize their impact on the refined structure.

##### Mitigating Experimental Artefacts

Mitigating experimental artefacts often involves improving the quality of the experimental data. This can be achieved by optimizing the experimental setup, such as ensuring proper alignment of the X-ray source and detector, and minimizing sources of error, such as radiation damage to the crystal.

In cases where the crystal itself is the source of artefacts, it may be possible to use a different crystal or to prepare a new crystal with fewer defects. Alternatively, advanced techniques such as multiple-crystal refinement can be used to average out the effects of defects in a single crystal.

##### Mitigating Computational Artefacts

Mitigating computational artefacts often involves refining the model used to interpret the experimental data. This can involve relaxing assumptions about the crystal structure, such as the assumption of isotropic atomic displacement parameters, or incorporating more complex models that can account for anisotropic effects.

In some cases, it may be necessary to collect additional experimental data to better constrain the model. For example, if the crystal structure is anisotropic, collecting data at different angles can provide more information about the crystal structure and help to correct for computational artefacts.

##### Minimizing the Impact of Artefacts

In addition to correcting the sources of artefacts, it is also important to minimize their impact on the refined structure. This can be achieved by using robust refinement methods that are less sensitive to small errors in the data.

Furthermore, it is important to carefully validate the refined structure by comparing it with independent data, such as neutron scattering data or high-resolution electron microscopy images. This can help to identify any remaining artefacts and to ensure the accuracy of the refined structure.

In conclusion, mitigating artefacts in crystal structure refinement is a complex but crucial process. By carefully examining the experimental data and the computational model, and by implementing strategies to minimize the impact of artefacts, it is possible to obtain accurate and reliable crystal structures.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the intricacies of crystal structure refinement, exploring the various artefacts that can arise during the process.

#### 5.1c Strategies for Dealing with Artefacts

Once artefacts have been identified in a crystal structure refinement, it is important to have strategies in place to deal with them. These strategies can help to minimize the impact of the artefacts on the final refined structure. In this section, we will discuss some of these strategies and how they can be applied.

##### Experimental Strategies

Experimental strategies can be used to mitigate the impact of experimental artefacts. One such strategy is to collect data from multiple crystals of the same compound. This can help to average out any variations in the crystal structure due to defects or imperfections. Another strategy is to collect data at different temperatures. This can help to identify any temperature-dependent artefacts, which can then be corrected for in the refinement process.

##### Computational Strategies

Computational strategies can be used to deal with computational artefacts. One such strategy is to use more complex models that take into account the anisotropic nature of the crystal system. This can help to reduce errors introduced by the assumption of isotropic atomic displacement parameters. Another strategy is to use multiple methods of structure refinement, such as the Rietveld method and the full-matrix least-squares method, and compare the results. This can help to identify any discrepancies between the methods and potentially correct for any computational artefacts.

### Section 7.1 Anisotropic Refinement:

Anisotropic refinement is a powerful technique used in crystal structure refinement to account for the anisotropic nature of crystals. In this section, we will explore the basics of anisotropic refinement, including its importance and how it is implemented in the refinement process.

#### 7.1a Introduction to Anisotropic Refinement

Anisotropic refinement is a crucial step in the crystal structure refinement process. It allows for a more accurate determination of the crystal structure by taking into account the anisotropic nature of crystals. Anisotropic crystals have different physical properties in different directions, and this can significantly affect the refinement process.

The anisotropic nature of crystals is described by the anisotropic unit cell, which is a generalization of the isotropic unit cell. The anisotropic unit cell is defined by six lattice parameters, including the lengths of the cell edges and the angles between them. These parameters can vary in different directions, making the crystal anisotropic.

To account for the anisotropic nature of crystals, anisotropic refinement involves optimizing the anisotropic unit cell parameters along with the atomic positions and thermal factors. This is done by minimizing the difference between the observed and calculated structure factors, similar to isotropic refinement. However, in anisotropic refinement, the anisotropic unit cell parameters are also optimized, allowing for a more accurate determination of the crystal structure.

One of the key challenges in anisotropic refinement is the increased complexity of the refinement process. The additional parameters to be optimized can make the refinement process more computationally intensive and time-consuming. Additionally, the anisotropic nature of crystals can also lead to more complex and ambiguous diffraction patterns, making it more difficult to determine the crystal structure.

To overcome these challenges, various techniques have been developed for anisotropic refinement. These include the use of direct methods, which involve solving the crystal structure directly from the diffraction data, and indirect methods, which involve using a priori knowledge about the crystal structure to aid in the refinement process.

In the next section, we will explore some of the advanced topics in anisotropic refinement, including the use of direct and indirect methods, as well as the latest developments in the field. We will also discuss the importance of anisotropic refinement in the study of complex crystals and its applications in various fields.

### Subsection: 7.2a Challenges in Refining Large Structures

Refining large structures is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of crystallography and the ability to interpret complex diffraction patterns. In this section, we will discuss some of the challenges that arise when refining large structures and how to overcome them.

#### 7.2a.1 Data Collection

One of the main challenges in refining large structures is collecting high-quality data. Large structures often have a high degree of complexity, which can lead to ambiguous diffraction patterns. This ambiguity can make it difficult to determine the crystal structure, especially if the data collection process is not carefully planned and executed.

To overcome this challenge, it is crucial to collect data from multiple angles and to use advanced techniques such as multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) and single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD). These techniques can provide additional information about the crystal structure and help to resolve ambiguities in the diffraction pattern.

#### 7.2a.2 Structure Determination

Another challenge in refining large structures is structure determination. The complexity of large structures can make it difficult to determine the crystal structure, especially if the structure is not known a priori. This is where advanced techniques such as ab initio structure determination and molecular replacement come into play.

Ab initio structure determination involves solving the crystal structure without any prior knowledge of the structure. This is a challenging task, but it can be achieved by using advanced computational methods and by carefully analyzing the diffraction data.

Molecular replacement, on the other hand, involves using a known structure as a starting model for the unknown structure. This technique can greatly simplify the structure determination process, especially for large structures.

#### 7.2a.3 Refinement

The refinement process is another area where challenges can arise when dealing with large structures. The complexity of large structures can make it difficult to refine the crystal structure, especially if the structure is not well-defined. This is where advanced refinement techniques such as anisotropic refinement and non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) refinement come into play.

Anisotropic refinement involves optimizing all six anisotropic unit cell parameters, along with the atomic positions and thermal factors. This technique can greatly improve the accuracy of the crystal structure, especially for large structures.

Non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) refinement, on the other hand, involves using symmetry to simplify the refinement process. This technique can be particularly useful for large structures that exhibit non-crystallographic symmetry.

In conclusion, refining large structures is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of crystallography and the ability to interpret complex diffraction patterns.

Another strategy is to collect data from multiple angles. This can help to improve the resolution of the diffraction pattern and provide more information about the crystal structure.

#### 7.2b.2 Structure Determination Techniques

For structure determination, it is crucial to have a good starting model. This can be achieved by using a combination of ab initio structure determination and molecular replacement.

Ab initio structure determination can be aided by using advanced computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. These methods can help to generate plausible structures that can be used as starting models for the unknown structure.

Molecular replacement can be used to generate a starting model by using a known structure that is similar to the unknown structure. This technique can greatly simplify the structure determination process, especially for large structures.

#### 7.2b.3 Refinement Techniques

The refinement process can be aided by using advanced techniques, such as simulated annealing and conjugate gradient minimization. These techniques can help to optimize the crystal structure and improve the agreement between the observed and calculated diffraction patterns.

Another important aspect of refinement is the use of restraints. These can be used to constrain certain parameters, such as bond lengths and angles, to known values. This can help to improve the accuracy of the refinement process.

### Subsection: 7.3a Challenges in Refining Low-Symmetry Structures

Refining low-symmetry structures presents a unique set of challenges that are not typically encountered in higher symmetry structures. These challenges arise from the increased complexity of the crystal structure, as well as the limitations of current refinement methods.

#### 7.3a.1 Complexity of Low-Symmetry Structures

Low-symmetry structures often have a high degree of complexity, with many atoms and non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) operations. This complexity can make it difficult to accurately determine the crystal structure, as the number of parameters that need to be refined increases exponentially with the number of atoms and NCS operations.

Moreover, the presence of NCS operations can lead to a high degree of redundancy in the data, which can complicate the refinement process. This is because the NCS operations can cause the same atoms to be observed in multiple places in the unit cell, leading to a high degree of correlation between the parameters that describe these atoms.

#### 7.3a.2 Limitations of Current Refinement Methods

Current refinement methods, such as full-matrix least-squares and maximum-likelihood methods, are not well-suited to handle the complexity of low-symmetry structures. These methods rely on the assumption that the data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), which is often not the case in low-symmetry structures due to the presence of NCS operations.

Furthermore, these methods can be computationally intensive and may not converge to a solution in a reasonable amount of time. This is particularly problematic for large structures with a high degree of complexity, as the number of parameters that need to be refined can lead to a very large number of equations that need to be solved.

#### 7.3a.3 Strategies for Overcoming These Challenges

Despite these challenges, it is still possible to successfully refine low-symmetry structures. One strategy is to use a combination of experimental data and theoretical calculations, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, to determine the crystal structure. This approach can help to reduce the number of parameters that need to be refined, as well as provide additional constraints on the structure.

Another strategy is to use advanced refinement methods, such as the Bijvoet difference method or the TLS (Thermal Lattice System) method, which can handle the complexity of low-symmetry structures more effectively than traditional methods. These methods take advantage of the symmetry of the crystal structure to reduce the number of parameters that need to be refined, and can also handle the presence of NCS operations more effectively.

In conclusion, refining low-symmetry structures presents a unique set of challenges, but with the right strategies and methods, it is still possible to accurately determine the crystal structure. As computational methods continue to improve, it is likely that these challenges will become easier to overcome, leading to a better understanding of the complex structures found in nature.





### Subsection: 7.3b Strategies and Techniques

Refining low-symmetry structures requires a combination of advanced strategies and techniques. These strategies and techniques are designed to address the challenges associated with the complexity of low-symmetry structures and the limitations of current refinement methods.

#### 7.3b.1 Advanced Strategies

Advanced strategies for refining low-symmetry structures include:

- **Use of Non-Crystallographic Symmetry (NCS):** NCS operations can be used to simplify the crystal structure and reduce the number of parameters that need to be refined. By identifying the NCS operations present in the structure, it is possible to reduce the number of unique atoms and bond lengths that need to be determined. This can significantly simplify the refinement process and make it more tractable.

- **Use of Constraints:** Constraints can be used to limit the range of possible values for certain parameters. This can be particularly useful in low-symmetry structures, where the presence of NCS operations can lead to a high degree of correlation between parameters. By imposing constraints, it is possible to reduce this correlation and make the refinement process more stable.

- **Use of Advanced Refinement Methods:** Advanced refinement methods, such as the Bcache method, can be used to handle the complexity of low-symmetry structures. These methods are designed to handle non-i.i.d. data and can be more efficient than traditional methods for large structures with a high degree of complexity.

#### 7.3b.2 Techniques for Overcoming Limitations

Techniques for overcoming the limitations of current refinement methods include:

- **Use of Multiple Methods:** As the limitations of current refinement methods are often due to the complexity of the crystal structure, it can be beneficial to use multiple methods in conjunction. For example, the Bcache method can be used to handle the complexity of the structure, while traditional methods, such as full-matrix least-squares and maximum-likelihood methods, can be used to handle the limitations of these methods.

- **Use of Advanced Computing Techniques:** Advanced computing techniques, such as parallel computing and machine learning, can be used to overcome the computational challenges associated with refining low-symmetry structures. Parallel computing can be used to speed up the refinement process, while machine learning can be used to learn the underlying structure of the data and improve the efficiency of the refinement process.

- **Use of Advanced Software:** Advanced software, such as the EIMI software, can be used to handle the complexity of low-symmetry structures. This software is designed to handle non-i.i.d. data and can be more efficient than traditional software for large structures with a high degree of complexity.

### Subsection: 7.4a Challenges in Refining Structures with Weak Diffraction

Refining structures with weak diffraction is a challenging task due to the limited information available for structure determination. Weak diffraction can be caused by a variety of factors, including low atomic number elements, low crystallographic symmetry, and high atomic disorder. In this section, we will discuss some of the challenges associated with refining structures with weak diffraction and how to overcome them.

#### 7.4a.1 Limited Information

One of the main challenges in refining structures with weak diffraction is the limited information available for structure determination. Weak diffraction patterns often contain few peaks, making it difficult to determine the crystal structure. This is particularly true for structures with low atomic number elements, where the diffraction peaks are often very weak and can easily be obscured by noise.

To overcome this challenge, it is important to collect high-quality diffraction data. This can be achieved by using advanced techniques such as synchrotron radiation or by collecting data at lower temperatures to reduce thermal motion. Additionally, advanced computational methods can be used to enhance the diffraction data and improve the quality of the structure determination.

#### 7.4a.2 Low Crystallographic Symmetry

Another challenge in refining structures with weak diffraction is the presence of low crystallographic symmetry. Low symmetry can make it difficult to solve the crystal structure, as there are fewer symmetry constraints to guide the structure determination. This is particularly true for structures with non-crystallographic symmetry, where the symmetry is not defined by a crystal lattice.

To overcome this challenge, it is important to carefully analyze the diffraction data and look for any symmetry elements that may be present. Advanced computational methods can also be used to generate possible symmetry solutions and compare them to the experimental data. Additionally, the use of advanced refinement techniques, such as the hybrid input-output (HIO) algorithm, can help to overcome the limitations of low symmetry.

#### 7.4a.3 High Atomic Disorder

High atomic disorder can also pose a challenge in refining structures with weak diffraction. Disorder can occur when there is a high degree of flexibility in the molecule or when there is a high degree of disorder in the crystal structure. This can make it difficult to determine the atomic positions and thermal factors, as there is a high degree of uncertainty in the diffraction data.

To overcome this challenge, it is important to carefully analyze the diffraction data and look for any patterns or trends that can help to constrain the atomic positions and thermal factors. Advanced computational methods can also be used to generate possible solutions and compare them to the experimental data. Additionally, the use of advanced refinement techniques, such as the hybrid input-output (HIO) algorithm, can help to overcome the limitations of high atomic disorder.

In conclusion, refining structures with weak diffraction is a challenging task, but with the use of advanced techniques and computational methods, it is possible to overcome these challenges and determine the crystal structure. The hybrid input-output (HIO) algorithm, in particular, has proven to be a powerful tool for phase retrieval in coherent diffraction imaging, making it a valuable tool for refining structures with weak diffraction.

### Subsection (optional): 9.1b Preparing Your Crystal Structure for Refinement

In the previous section, we discussed the importance of planning your refinement strategy. Now, we will delve into the practical aspect of preparing your crystal structure for refinement.

Before beginning the refinement process, it is crucial to ensure that your crystal structure is in a suitable state for refinement. This includes checking for any errors or inconsistencies in the crystal structure, as well as ensuring that the crystal structure is complete and accurate.

One of the first steps in preparing your crystal structure for refinement is to check for any errors or inconsistencies. This can be done by carefully examining the crystal structure and looking for any discrepancies between the crystal structure and the experimental data. This may include checking for any missing atoms, incorrect bond lengths, or improper symmetry.

Next, it is important to ensure that the crystal structure is complete and accurate. This means checking for any missing atoms or molecules, as well as ensuring that the crystal structure is consistent with the experimental data. This may involve making adjustments to the crystal structure, such as repositioning atoms or adjusting bond lengths.

Once your crystal structure is error-free and complete, it is important to save it in a suitable format for refinement. This may include converting the crystal structure to a format that is compatible with your chosen refinement software. It is also important to back up your crystal structure in case of any errors or accidents during the refinement process.

In addition to preparing your crystal structure, it is also important to prepare your experimental data for refinement. This may involve converting the data to a suitable format, such as CIF or HKL, and ensuring that the data is accurate and complete. It is also important to check for any missing or inconsistent data points, as this can greatly impact the accuracy of the refinement process.

Overall, preparing your crystal structure for refinement is a crucial step in the crystal structure refinement process. It ensures that the refinement process is accurate and reliable, and can greatly improve the overall quality of the refined crystal structure.

### Subsection (optional): 9.1c Common Pitfalls in Refinement

In the previous section, we discussed the importance of preparing your crystal structure for refinement. However, even with careful preparation, there are still common pitfalls that can arise during the refinement process. In this section, we will discuss some of these pitfalls and how to avoid them.

One of the most common pitfalls in refinement is overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the refinement process is overly constrained, resulting in a poor fit to the experimental data. This can be caused by using too many parameters or constraints, or by not properly accounting for the uncertainty in the experimental data. To avoid overfitting, it is important to carefully consider the number and type of parameters and constraints used in the refinement process. Additionally, it is important to use a robust optimization algorithm that can handle the uncertainty in the data.

Another common pitfall is the assumption of isotropic thermal factors. In many cases, the thermal factors of atoms in a crystal structure are anisotropic, meaning they vary in different directions. However, many refinement programs assume isotropic thermal factors, which can result in a poor fit to the experimental data. To avoid this pitfall, it is important to carefully consider the anisotropy of the thermal factors and use a refinement program that can handle anisotropic thermal factors.

In addition to these technical pitfalls, there are also common mistakes that can arise during the refinement process. One of these is the use of incorrect symmetry. In some cases, the symmetry of the crystal structure may be incorrectly assigned, resulting in a poor fit to the experimental data. It is important to carefully check the symmetry of the crystal structure and use a refinement program that can handle non-crystallographic symmetry.

Another common mistake is the use of incorrect atomic positions. In some cases, the atomic positions may be incorrectly determined, resulting in a poor fit to the experimental data. This can be caused by errors in the crystal structure or by using an inappropriate refinement method. It is important to carefully check the atomic positions and use a refinement method that is appropriate for the type of crystal structure.

Finally, it is important to be aware of the limitations of the refinement process. While refinement can provide valuable information about the crystal structure, it is not a perfect process and there may be uncertainties or errors in the final results. It is important to carefully consider these limitations and use the refinement results as a starting point for further analysis and validation.

In conclusion, while refinement is a powerful tool for understanding crystal structures, it is important to be aware of these common pitfalls and mistakes in order to obtain accurate and reliable results. By carefully preparing the crystal structure and experimental data, using appropriate refinement methods, and being aware of the limitations of the process, one can avoid these pitfalls and obtain meaningful results.

### Subsection (optional): 9.2a Introduction to Refinement

In the previous section, we discussed the importance of preparing your crystal structure for refinement. Now, we will delve into the practical aspect of refining your crystal structure.

Refinement is the process of adjusting the atomic positions and thermal factors in a crystal structure to improve the fit to experimental data. This is an iterative process, where the crystal structure is refined until the experimental data is satisfactorily reproduced.

The first step in refinement is to determine the initial atomic positions and thermal factors. This can be done using various methods, such as ab initio refinement, where the atomic positions and thermal factors are determined from the experimental data alone, or using a combination of experimental data and prior knowledge, such as known bond lengths or angles.

Once the initial atomic positions and thermal factors are determined, the refinement process begins. This involves adjusting the atomic positions and thermal factors to improve the fit to the experimental data. This is typically done using a least-squares minimization algorithm, which minimizes the difference between the calculated and experimental data.

During the refinement process, it is important to carefully monitor the progress and make adjustments as needed. This may involve adding or removing constraints, changing the optimization algorithm, or manually adjusting the atomic positions and thermal factors.

One of the key aspects of refinement is the use of restraints. These are constraints on the atomic positions and thermal factors that are used to guide the refinement process. Restraints can be based on prior knowledge, such as known bond lengths or angles, or can be derived from the experimental data, such as the anisotropy of the thermal factors.

Another important aspect of refinement is the use of a robust optimization algorithm. This is crucial for handling the uncertainty in the experimental data and avoiding overfitting. Some commonly used optimization algorithms include the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and the BFGS algorithm.

In addition to these technical aspects, it is also important to carefully consider the assumptions and limitations of the refinement process. For example, the assumption of isotropic thermal factors may not be appropriate for all crystal structures, and the use of restraints may introduce bias into the refinement process.

In the next section, we will discuss some common pitfalls and mistakes to avoid during the refinement process.

- **CheckCIF:** This tool is used to check the syntax and data content of CIF (Crystallographic Information File) files. It can be used to identify and correct errors in the CIF file, ensuring that the data is accurate and reliable.

- **CheckMol:** This tool is used to check the molecular geometry of a crystal structure. It can identify and correct errors in bond lengths, angles, and torsion angles, ensuring that the molecular geometry is accurate and realistic.

- **CheckCryst:** This tool is used to check the crystal structure as a whole. It can identify and correct errors in unit cell dimensions, symmetry, and atomic positions, ensuring that the crystal structure is accurate and reliable.

- **CheckRefl:** This tool is used to check the reflections in a crystal structure. It can identify and correct errors in the reflection data, ensuring that the reflections are accurate and reliable.

#### Using PLATON for Structure Validation

To use PLATON for structure validation, follow these steps:

1. Load the crystal structure into PLATON. This can be done by importing a CIF file or by manually entering the atomic coordinates and symmetry information.

2. Run the appropriate validation tool. For example, if you want to check the molecular geometry, run the CheckMol tool.

3. Review the results. PLATON will provide a list of errors and warnings, along with suggestions for correcting them.

4. Make the necessary corrections. This may involve adjusting atomic positions, changing bond lengths, or correcting the CIF file.

5. Re-run the validation tool. This will ensure that the corrections have been successfully made.

By using PLATON for structure validation, you can ensure that your crystal structure is accurate and reliable. It is an essential tool for any crystal structure refinement process.

#### 9.3c Further Validation Techniques

In addition to the tools provided by PLATON, there are several other techniques that can be used for structure validation in crystal structure refinement. These techniques are particularly useful for identifying and correcting errors that may not be caught by the PLATON tools.

##### Ramachandran Plot

The Ramachandran plot is a graphical representation of the allowed rotations of the peptide backbone in a protein structure. It is a powerful tool for identifying errors in protein structures, particularly in the folding of the backbone. The plot is generated by calculating the torsion angles of the backbone and plotting them on a two-dimensional graph. Errors in the backbone folding will result in points outside of the allowed region of the plot. By correcting these errors, the structure can be brought into agreement with the experimental data.

##### RMSD Calculation

The root mean square deviation (RMSD) is a measure of the difference between two structures. It is calculated by aligning the structures and then calculating the deviation of each atom from its ideal position. A high RMSD value indicates a significant difference between the two structures, suggesting that there may be errors in the refined structure. By comparing the RMSD value with the experimental data, these errors can be identified and corrected.

##### Molecular Dynamics Simulations

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be used to validate crystal structures by simulating the behavior of the molecules in the crystal. This can help to identify any unrealistic interactions or conformations that may be present in the structure. By running multiple simulations with different conditions, the stability and reliability of the structure can be assessed.

##### Comparison with Other Structures

Comparing the refined structure with other structures of the same molecule can help to identify any discrepancies or errors. This can be done by superimposing the structures and calculating the RMSD value. If the RMSD value is significantly higher than expected, it may indicate that there are errors in the refined structure.

By using these additional validation techniques, along with the tools provided by PLATON, the accuracy and reliability of the crystal structure can be assured. This is crucial for the successful interpretation of the crystal structure and for further research and development.

### Section: 10.1a Challenges in Refining Inorganic Structures

Inorganic structures are a crucial aspect of materials science and engineering, as they provide the foundation for understanding the properties and behavior of various materials. However, the refinement of inorganic structures can be a challenging task due to the complexity of the structures and the limitations of experimental techniques.

One of the main challenges in refining inorganic structures is the lack of complete and accurate experimental data. Traditional experimental techniques, such as X-ray crystallography, have limitations in terms of the size and complexity of structures that can be studied. This can lead to incomplete or inaccurate data, making it difficult to obtain a reliable crystal structure.

Another challenge is the presence of disorder in inorganic structures. Disorder can arise from various sources, such as defects, impurities, and thermal motion. This can make it difficult to determine the precise atomic positions and bond lengths, as well as the overall structure of the material.

Furthermore, the refinement of inorganic structures can be affected by the presence of non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS). NCS can occur when the symmetry of the structure is lower than the space group, leading to a higher number of symmetry-independent parameters that need to be refined. This can make the refinement process more complex and time-consuming.

In addition to these challenges, the refinement of inorganic structures can also be affected by the choice of structure solution and refinement software. Different software packages may have different strengths and limitations, and the choice of software can greatly impact the accuracy and reliability of the refined structure.

Despite these challenges, advancements in computational methods and software have made it possible to refine more complex inorganic structures. The use of ab initio methods, such as density functional theory (DFT), has allowed for the accurate prediction of atomic positions and bond lengths, providing valuable insights into the structure and properties of materials.

In the next section, we will explore some of the advanced techniques and methods used in the refinement of inorganic structures, including the use of ab initio methods and the incorporation of non-crystallographic symmetry. We will also discuss the latest developments in structure solution and refinement software, and how they can aid in the accurate and reliable refinement of inorganic structures.

### Section: 10.1b Strategies and Techniques

In this section, we will discuss some strategies and techniques that can be used to overcome the challenges of refining inorganic structures.

#### 10.1b.1 Use of Advanced Computational Methods

As mentioned in the previous section, advancements in computational methods have made it possible to refine more complex inorganic structures. One such method is density functional theory (DFT), which is an ab initio method that can be used to calculate the electronic structure of a material. DFT can be used to calculate the atomic positions and bond lengths in a structure, making it a valuable tool for refining inorganic structures.

Another advanced computational method is molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, which can be used to study the thermal motion of atoms in a structure. This can be particularly useful for understanding the disorder present in inorganic structures and can aid in the refinement process.

#### 10.1b.2 Use of Advanced Refinement Software

The choice of structure solution and refinement software can greatly impact the accuracy and reliability of the refined structure. It is important to choose a software package that is suitable for the specific structure being studied. For example, some software packages may be better suited for handling non-crystallographic symmetry, while others may be better for handling disorder.

#### 10.1b.3 Experimental Techniques

In addition to computational methods, experimental techniques can also be used to aid in the refinement of inorganic structures. For example, neutron scattering can be used to study the thermal motion of atoms, providing complementary information to X-ray crystallography. Other techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, can also be used to study the surface of a material and provide valuable information for structure refinement.

#### 10.1b.4 Use of Multiple Data Sets

As mentioned in the previous section, the lack of complete and accurate experimental data can be a challenge in refining inorganic structures. To overcome this challenge, it can be beneficial to use multiple data sets, such as X-ray crystallography, neutron scattering, and microscopy techniques. By combining the data from these different techniques, a more complete and accurate picture of the structure can be obtained, aiding in the refinement process.

In conclusion, the refinement of inorganic structures can be a challenging task, but with the use of advanced computational methods, refinement software, experimental techniques, and multiple data sets, it is possible to obtain reliable and accurate crystal structures. 





### Subsection: 10.1c Case Studies and Lessons Learned

In this section, we will explore some case studies of inorganic structure refinement and discuss the lessons learned from these studies.

#### 10.1c.1 Refinement of the Structure of a Metal Organic Framework (MOF)

One of the most challenging types of inorganic structures to refine is metal organic frameworks (MOFs). These are porous materials composed of metal nodes and organic linkers, and their structures can be highly complex and disordered. However, with the use of advanced computational methods and software, it is possible to refine these structures.

For example, the structure of the MOF [Zn(HCOO)(2)(H2O)(2)] was refined using a combination of X-ray crystallography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The X-ray data was used to determine the overall structure, while the DFT calculations were used to refine the atomic positions and bond lengths. This approach resulted in a highly accurate and reliable refinement of the structure.

#### 10.1c.2 Refinement of the Structure of a Complex Organic Molecule

Another challenging type of inorganic structure to refine is complex organic molecules. These molecules often have multiple conformations and can exhibit significant disorder, making it difficult to determine their structures. However, with the use of advanced computational methods and software, it is possible to refine these structures.

For example, the structure of the organic molecule 2,2'-bipyridine was refined using a combination of X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The X-ray data was used to determine the overall structure, while the MD simulation was used to study the thermal motion of the molecule and aid in the refinement process. This approach resulted in a highly accurate and reliable refinement of the structure.

#### 10.1c.3 Lessons Learned

These case studies demonstrate the importance of using advanced computational methods and software for refining inorganic structures. They also highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach, combining techniques from crystallography, chemistry, and computer science. By using these methods and approaches, it is possible to overcome the challenges of refining inorganic structures and obtain highly accurate and reliable results.

### Subsection: 10.2a Challenges in Refining Organic Structures

Refining organic structures can be a challenging task due to the complexity of these molecules. Organic molecules often have multiple conformations and can exhibit significant disorder, making it difficult to determine their structures. Additionally, the presence of hydrogen atoms, which are crucial for understanding the geometry of these molecules, are often not observed in experimental data. This is because hydrogen atoms are very small and their scattering is often below the detection limit of experimental techniques.

#### 10.2a.1 Hydrogen Atom Placement

The placement of hydrogen atoms is a crucial step in refining organic structures. These atoms are often placed using a variety of methods, including the use of empirical bond lengths and angles, as well as the use of quantum chemical calculations. However, these methods can be unreliable and may result in significant errors in the final structure.

One approach to addressing this challenge is to use the Rigid Hydrogen Bond (RHB) approach. This approach assumes that the hydrogen atoms in a molecule are rigidly attached to the atoms they are bonded to. This allows for the placement of hydrogen atoms based on the positions of the heavier atoms, which are often more accurately determined in experimental data.

#### 10.2a.2 Disorder in Organic Molecules

Another challenge in refining organic structures is the presence of disorder in these molecules. Disorder can arise from a variety of sources, including conformational flexibility, solvent interactions, and crystal packing effects. This disorder can make it difficult to accurately determine the structure of the molecule, as well as the positions of the hydrogen atoms.

To address this challenge, advanced computational methods and software can be used to model the disorder in organic molecules. These methods can take into account the various sources of disorder and can provide a more accurate representation of the molecule. Additionally, experimental techniques such as neutron scattering can be used to study the disorder in organic molecules and aid in the refinement process.

#### 10.2a.3 Limitations of Experimental Techniques

Finally, the limitations of experimental techniques can also pose a challenge in refining organic structures. As mentioned earlier, hydrogen atoms are often not observed in experimental data due to their small size and low scattering. Additionally, other experimental techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, can also have limitations in determining the structure of organic molecules.

To address these limitations, advanced computational methods and software can be used to combine experimental data with theoretical calculations to refine organic structures.

## Mesh improvement

Improving a mesh involves changing its discrete connectivity, the continuous geometric position of its cells, or both. For discrete changes, for simplicial elements one swaps edges and inserts/removes nodes. The same kinds of operations are done for cubical (quad/hex) meshes, although there are fewer possible operations and local changes have global consequences. E.g., for a hexahedral mesh, merging two nodes creates cells that are not hexes, but if diagonally-opposite nodes on a quadrilateral are merged and this is propagated into collapsing an entire face-connected column of hexes, then all remaining cells will still be hexes. 
In adaptive mesh refinement, elements are split (h-refinement) in areas where the function being calculated has a high gradient.
Meshes are also coarsened, removing elements for efficiency. The multigrid method does something similar to refinement and coarsening to speed up the numerical solve, but without actually changing the mesh.

For continuous changes, nodes are moved, or the higher-dimensional faces are moved by changing the polynomial order of elements. Moving nodes to improve quality is called "smoothing" or "r-refinement" and increasing the order of elements is called "p-refinement." Nodes are also moved in simulations where the shape of objects change over time. This degrades the shape of the elements. If the object deforms enough, the entire object is remeshed and the current solution mapped from the old mesh to the new mesh.
