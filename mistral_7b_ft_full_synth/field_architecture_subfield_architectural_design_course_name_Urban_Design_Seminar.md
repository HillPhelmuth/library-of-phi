## Foreward

Welcome to the Urban Design Seminar Companion, a comprehensive guide to understanding and navigating the complex world of urban design. As we embark on this journey, it is important to acknowledge the rich history and legacy of urban design, as well as the current challenges and opportunities facing our cities.

The Urban Design Forum, established in 1969, has been at the forefront of urban design discourse, hosting forums, symposia, and events that have shaped the field. From the "Cities Can Be Designed" conference to the more recent "New York 2030" event, the Forum has consistently pushed the boundaries of urban design, challenging us to think critically about the cities we live in and the ways we design them.

In 2012, the Forum was invited to present the US Pavilion for the 13th Venice Architecture Biennale, showcasing innovative design solutions to urban problems. The interactive exhibit, "Spontaneous Interventions: Design Actions for the Common Good," allowed visitors to engage directly with the issues and solutions presented, highlighting the importance of community involvement in urban design.

More recently, the Forum has been instrumental in shaping the discourse around urban design in New York City. The 2013 roundtable discussions resulted in "Next New York," a collection of 40 innovative proposals for adapting the city in the 21st century. These proposals, ranging from light rail lines to housing solutions, demonstrate the breadth and depth of urban design thinking.

As we delve into the complexities of urban design, it is important to remember that we are not alone. The Urban Design Forum, along with other organizations such as The Architectural League of New York, The Van Alen Institute, The Municipal Art Society, Project for Public Spaces, and The Center for Urban, have been instrumental in shaping the field of urban design. Their work serves as a valuable resource and inspiration for our own.

In the following chapters, we will explore the principles, processes, and applications of urban design, providing a solid foundation for understanding and navigating the complexities of urban design. We will also examine case studies and real-world examples, drawing on the rich history and legacy of urban design to inform our understanding and practice.

Welcome to the Urban Design Seminar Companion. Let's embark on this journey together.

### Section: 2.2 Metro Manila: Zones of Capital by Nina Rappaport

#### 2.2a Analysis of Metro Manila Zones of Capital

In her book "Vertical Urban Factory", Nina Rappaport delves into the concept of zones of capital in Metro Manila. These zones, she argues, are the result of the city's rapid urbanization and the unequal distribution of wealth. Rappaport's analysis of these zones provides valuable insights into the complex dynamics of urban development in Metro Manila.

Rappaport identifies three main zones of capital in Metro Manila: the Central Business District (CBD), the Urban Poor Zone, and the Peripheral Zone. The CBD, located in the heart of the city, is home to the city's financial and commercial hub. It is characterized by high-rise buildings, bustling streets, and a thriving economy. However, this zone is also marked by stark contrasts, with pockets of poverty and inequality coexisting with wealth and prosperity.

The Urban Poor Zone, on the other hand, is characterized by informal settlements and poverty. This zone is home to a large portion of the city's population, and is marked by overcrowding, inadequate infrastructure, and lack of basic services. The Peripheral Zone, located on the outskirts of the city, is characterized by rapid urbanization and the expansion of the city's physical boundaries. This zone is home to a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial activities, and is marked by a lack of planning and regulation.

Rappaport's analysis of these zones highlights the complex and interconnected nature of urban development in Metro Manila. The CBD, for instance, is not just a hub of economic activity, but also a source of wealth and investment that fuels development in the other zones. The Urban Poor Zone, despite its challenges, is also a source of labor and entrepreneurship that contributes to the city's economy. The Peripheral Zone, while marked by rapid urbanization and lack of planning, is also a site of opportunity for development and growth.

Rappaport's analysis also underscores the importance of understanding the dynamics of these zones in any urban design intervention. The CBD, for instance, requires careful planning and regulation to address issues of inequality and overdevelopment. The Urban Poor Zone requires a holistic approach that addresses issues of poverty, overcrowding, and lack of basic services. The Peripheral Zone, on the other hand, requires a strategic approach to manage rapid urbanization and ensure sustainable development.

In conclusion, Rappaport's analysis of Metro Manila's zones of capital provides valuable insights into the complex dynamics of urban development in the city. It underscores the need for a comprehensive and integrated approach to urban design that addresses the needs and challenges of each zone. As we continue to grapple with the challenges of urbanization, Rappaport's work serves as a valuable guide for understanding and addressing the complexities of urban development in Metro Manila.

### The Principles of Intelligent Urbanism

Echeverri's work is heavily influenced by the principles of Intelligent Urbanism (IU), a design approach that aims to create livable and sustainable cities by considering the needs and behaviors of the people who inhabit them. The four principles of IU are: conviviality, adaptability, diversity, and sustainability.

Conviviality, as discussed in the previous section, is the fourth principle of IU and focuses on creating spaces for social interaction and engagement. It recognizes the importance of public domains in fostering a sense of community and belonging. By creating a hierarchy of places, each with its own purpose and function, IU aims to cater to the diverse needs and preferences of individuals.

### A Place for the Individual

One of the key goals of IU is to create spaces for solitude and introspection. These spaces, such as urban forests, parks, and quiet streams, allow individuals to escape the hustle and bustle of city life and find moments of peace and reflection. By incorporating these spaces into the urban fabric, IU promotes a balance between the individual and the community.

### A Place for Friendship

The principle of conviviality also emphasizes the importance of creating spaces for friendship and meaningful social interactions. These spaces, such as public squares, parks, and community centers, provide opportunities for unfettered dialogue and the cultivation of beautiful, intimate friendships. By prioritizing these spaces, IU promotes a sense of community and belonging among its residents.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, Alejandro Echeverri's work in Social Urbanism is heavily influenced by the principles of Intelligent Urbanism. By prioritizing the needs and well-being of the community, IU aims to create livable and sustainable cities that cater to the diverse needs and preferences of its residents. By incorporating principles such as conviviality, adaptability, diversity, and sustainability, IU promotes a sense of community and belonging among its residents.

## Methodology

Integrated Modification Methodology is based on an iterative process involving the following four major phases:
The first phase, Investigation, is a synthesis-based inquiry into the systemic structure of the urban form. It begins with "Horizontal Investigation" in which the area under study is being dismantled into its morphology-generator elements, namely Urban Built-ups, Urban Voids, Types of Uses, and Links. It follows with "Vertical Investigation" that is a study of integral relationships between the mentioned elements. The output of Vertical Investigation is a set of quantitative descriptions and qualitative illustrations of certain attributes named "Key Categories". In a nutshell they are types of emergence that show how elements come to self-organize or to synchronize their states into forming a new level of organization. Hence in IMM, Key Categories are the result of an emergence process of interaction between elementary parts (Urban Built-ups, Urban Voids, Types of Uses, and Links) to form a synergy able to add value to the combined organization. Key categories are the products of the synergy between elementary parts, a new organization that emerge not (simply as a result of)

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will be exploring the world of informal markets through the lens of Teddy Cruz and Fonna Forman. Informal markets, also known as street markets or bazaars, are an integral part of many urban landscapes around the world. They are often characterized by their spontaneity, dynamism, and diversity, making them a rich subject of study for urban designers.

Cruz and Forman, both renowned urban designers, have been studying and working with informal markets for over a decade. Their book, "Informal Market Worlds: Design, Urbanization, and the Informal Economy", provides a comprehensive overview of the topic, drawing on their extensive research and experience.

In this chapter, we will delve into the key themes of the book, including the role of informal markets in urbanization, the design strategies for engaging with these markets, and the broader implications for urban design and planning. We will also explore the concept of the informal economy, and how it intersects with urban design.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the topic, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of the themes in the subsequent sections. We will also be referencing the book extensively, providing a solid foundation for further study. So, let's embark on this journey into the world of informal markets, guided by the insights of Cruz and Forman.




#### 13.1a Introduction to Teddy Cruz and Fonna Forman

Teddy Cruz and Fonna Forman are two of the most influential figures in the field of urban design, particularly in the study and design of informal markets. Their work has been instrumental in shaping our understanding of these complex urban spaces and their role in urbanization.

Teddy Cruz, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, is known for his innovative and participatory approach to urban design. His work often involves engaging directly with the communities that inhabit these informal markets, using their knowledge and experiences as a basis for his designs. This approach has been widely adopted and has had a significant impact on the field of urban design.

Fonna Forman, on the other hand, is a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her work focuses on the intersection of urban design and the informal economy, exploring how these markets contribute to the economic and social fabric of urban spaces. Her book, "Informal Market Worlds: Design, Urbanization, and the Informal Economy", co-authored with Cruz, provides a comprehensive overview of the topic.

Together, Cruz and Forman have been instrumental in bringing attention to the importance of informal markets in urban design. Their work has been featured in numerous publications and exhibitions, and their book has been widely adopted as a key text in urban design education.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the key themes of their work, exploring the role of informal markets in urbanization, the design strategies for engaging with these markets, and the broader implications for urban design and planning. We will also explore the concept of the informal economy, and how it intersects with urban design.

#### 13.1b Key Themes of Cruz and Forman's Work

Cruz and Forman's work is characterized by several key themes that are central to their understanding of informal markets. These themes provide a framework for their analysis and design strategies, and they are fundamental to their approach to urban design.

##### Informal Markets as Spaces of Informal Economy

One of the key themes in Cruz and Forman's work is the concept of informal markets as spaces of informal economy. They argue that these markets are not just physical spaces, but also economic systems that operate outside of formal structures. This means that they are not governed by the same rules and regulations as formal markets, and they often operate in a grey area between legal and illegal activities.

This theme is central to their understanding of the role of informal markets in urbanization. They argue that these markets are not just a product of urbanization, but also a driver of it. They provide a space for economic activity that is not possible in formal markets, and they often play a crucial role in the livelihoods of urban populations.

##### Participatory Design

Another key theme in Cruz and Forman's work is participatory design. This approach involves engaging directly with the communities that inhabit these informal markets, using their knowledge and experiences as a basis for design. This approach is a direct response to the traditional top-down approach to urban design, which often results in designs that are disconnected from the needs and experiences of the people who use them.

Participatory design is a key tool in Cruz and Forman's approach to urban design. It allows them to tap into the local knowledge and experiences of the communities that inhabit these informal markets, and to design spaces that are responsive to their needs and experiences.

##### Design Strategies for Engaging with Informal Markets

Cruz and Forman have developed a range of design strategies for engaging with informal markets. These strategies are based on their understanding of the key themes of informal markets, and they provide a framework for designing spaces that are responsive to the needs and experiences of the people who use them.

These strategies include:

- **Adaptive Reuse**: This strategy involves repurposing existing buildings for new uses, often in response to changes in the local economy. This can be a cost-effective way of creating new spaces, and it can also help to preserve the cultural heritage of the community.

- **Incremental Development**: This strategy involves adding new elements to existing spaces in a gradual and incremental way. This can help to avoid the disruption and displacement that often accompanies large-scale development projects.

- **Mixed-Use Design**: This strategy involves creating spaces that combine different uses, such as residential, commercial, and recreational. This can help to create vibrant and diverse spaces that meet the needs of the community.

In the following sections, we will explore these strategies in more detail, and we will look at how they can be applied in practice.

#### 13.1c Key Projects of Cruz and Forman

Teddy Cruz and Fonna Forman have been involved in a number of key projects that have shaped our understanding of informal markets and their role in urban design. These projects have been instrumental in advancing the field of urban design, and they have had a significant impact on the way we think about and approach informal markets.

##### The San Diego-Tijuana Border Region

One of the most significant projects of Cruz and Forman is their work in the San Diego-Tijuana border region. This region, which straddles the US-Mexico border, is home to a large number of informal markets, and it has been the focus of much of Cruz and Forman's research and design work.

In this region, Cruz and Forman have been involved in a number of projects, including the design of a new public space in the border town of Tijuana, and the development of a master plan for the redevelopment of the border region. These projects have been characterized by a commitment to participatory design, and they have involved extensive engagement with the local communities.

##### The Informal Market Worlds Project

Another key project of Cruz and Forman is the Informal Market Worlds Project. This project, which was funded by the MacArthur Foundation, involved a comprehensive study of informal markets in six cities around the world: Cairo, Lagos, Lima, Mumbai, Nairobi, and San Salvador.

The project aimed to understand the role of informal markets in urbanization, and it involved a range of research methods, including ethnographic research, spatial analysis, and economic analysis. The project resulted in a book, "Informal Market Worlds: Design, Urbanization, and the Informal Economy", which provides a comprehensive overview of the topic.

##### The Informal Market Design Studio

Cruz and Forman have also been involved in the development of the Informal Market Design Studio, a design studio that focuses on the design of informal markets. The studio, which is based at MIT, provides a platform for students to explore the design of informal markets, and it has been involved in a number of projects, including the design of a new informal market in the city of Medellín, Colombia.

These projects have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of informal markets, and they have had a significant impact on the field of urban design. They have demonstrated the potential of participatory design as a tool for engaging with informal markets, and they have highlighted the importance of considering the informal economy in urban design.




#### 13.1b Understanding Informal Market Worlds

Informal markets, also known as informal economies, are complex urban spaces that are often overlooked in traditional urban design and planning. These markets are characterized by their informality, meaning they operate outside of formal legal and regulatory frameworks. They are typically found in developing countries, but are also prevalent in developed cities like New York and Los Angeles.

Cruz and Forman's work has been instrumental in bringing attention to the importance of these informal markets. They argue that these markets are not just spaces of economic activity, but also social and cultural spaces that are deeply embedded in the fabric of urban life. Understanding these markets, therefore, is crucial for understanding the urbanization process.

Their book, "Informal Market Worlds: Design, Urbanization, and the Informal Economy", provides a comprehensive overview of these markets. The book explores the history, culture, and economics of these markets, and offers insights into how they are shaped by urban design and planning.

One of the key themes of their work is the concept of the informal economy. The informal economy refers to all economic activities that are not formally recognized or regulated by the state. This includes activities such as street vending, informal housing, and small-scale manufacturing. The informal economy is often characterized by its flexibility, adaptability, and resilience.

Cruz and Forman argue that the informal economy plays a crucial role in urbanization. It provides employment opportunities, particularly for the urban poor, and contributes to the economic vitality of cities. However, it also faces numerous challenges, including lack of access to formal services, vulnerability to economic shocks, and conflict with formal sector interests.

Their work also highlights the importance of participatory design in engaging with these informal markets. This approach involves engaging directly with the communities that inhabit these markets, using their knowledge and experiences as a basis for design. This approach has been widely adopted and has had a significant impact on the field of urban design.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the design strategies for engaging with these markets, and explore the broader implications for urban design and planning.

#### 13.1c Case Studies of Informal Market Worlds

In this section, we will explore some case studies of informal markets around the world, as presented by Cruz and Forman in their book. These case studies provide a deeper understanding of the complexities and nuances of informal markets, and how they are shaped by urban design and planning.

##### Case Study 1: Kitwe, Zambia

Kitwe is a city in Zambia that is known for its vibrant informal markets. The city has a variety of markets, each with its own unique character and function. For instance, the Mukuba Market is a large, bustling market that sells a wide range of goods, from food to clothing. The Mukuba Market is also a hub of social activity, with locals gathering to gossip, play games, and listen to music.

The Mukuba Market is a prime example of an informal market that is deeply embedded in the social and cultural fabric of the city. It is a space where people come together to buy, sell, and socialize. The market is also a source of employment for many locals, particularly women who operate small businesses.

##### Case Study 2: Midtown Farmers' Market, USA

The Midtown Farmers' Market in the United States is a contrasting example of an informal market. Unlike the Mukuba Market, the Midtown Farmers' Market is a formalized, regulated market. It operates within a legal framework and is subject to various regulations, such as health and safety standards.

Despite its formal nature, the Midtown Farmers' Market still retains many of the characteristics of an informal market. It is a space of economic activity, but it is also a social space where people come together to buy fresh produce, interact with farmers, and engage in community activities.

##### Case Study 3: Chelsea Market, USA

Chelsea Market in New York City is another example of an informal market. It is a large, indoor market that sells a variety of goods, from food to artisanal products. The market is known for its vibrant atmosphere and diverse offerings.

Chelsea Market is a prime example of how informal markets can be integrated into formal urban design and planning. The market is a result of a collaboration between the city government and private developers. It is a testament to the potential of informal markets to contribute to the economic and social vitality of cities.

These case studies highlight the diversity and complexity of informal markets. They show that informal markets are not just spaces of economic activity, but also social and cultural spaces that are deeply embedded in the fabric of urban life. Understanding these markets is crucial for understanding the urbanization process and for designing cities that are inclusive and responsive to the needs of all residents.

# Principles of intelligent urbanism

### Principle four: conviviality

The fourth principle sponsors social interaction through public domains, in a hierarchy of places, devised for personal solace, companionship, romance, domesticity, "neighborliness," community and civic life (Jacobs:1993). According to proponents of intelligent urbanism, vibrant societies are interactive, socially engaging and offer their members numerous opportunities for gathering and meeting one another. The PIU maintain that this can be achieved through design and that society operates within hierarchies of social relations which are space specific. The hierarchies can be conceptualized as a system of social tiers, with each tier having a corresponding physical place in the settlement structure.

#### A place for the individual

A goal of intelligent urbanism is to create places of solitude. These may be in urban forests, along urban hills, beside quiet streams, in public gardens and in parks where one can escape to meditate and contemplate. According to proponents, these are the quiet places wherein the individual consciousness dialogues with the rational mind. Idle and random thought sorts out complexities of modern life and allows the obvious to emerge. It is in these natural settings that the wandering mind finds its measure and its balance. Using ceremonial gates, directional walls and other “silent devices" these spaces are denoted and divined. Places of the individual cultivate introspection. These spaces may also be the forecourts and interior courtyards of public buildings, or even the thoughtful reading rooms of libraries. Meditation focuses one's thought. Intelligent urbanism creates a domain for the individual to mature through self-analysis and self-realization.

#### A place for friendship

The axiom insists that in city plans there must be spaces for “beautiful, intimate friendship" where unfettered dialogue can happen. This principle insists that such places will not exist na

### Subsection: 14.1b Application of Urban Design Principles

The application of urban design principles is a critical aspect of the design process. It involves the practical implementation of the theoretical concepts and principles discussed in the previous section. This section will explore the application of urban design principles, focusing on the principles of intelligent urbanism and form-based codes.

#### Principles of Intelligent Urbanism

The principles of intelligent urbanism provide a framework for creating livable, sustainable, and vibrant cities. These principles are based on the understanding that cities are complex systems that require careful design and management. The principles of intelligent urbanism can be applied in various ways, depending on the specific context and needs of a city.

##### Principle One: Sustainability

The principle of sustainability is central to intelligent urbanism. It involves designing cities in a way that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This principle can be applied by incorporating sustainable practices into the design of buildings, transportation systems, and other urban elements. For example, buildings can be designed to be energy-efficient, using renewable energy sources and sustainable materials. Transportation systems can be designed to reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainable modes of transportation, such as public transit, walking, and cycling.

##### Principle Two: Walkability

The principle of walkability is another key aspect of intelligent urbanism. It involves designing cities in a way that encourages walking and reduces the need for private vehicles. This can be achieved by creating a hierarchy of public spaces, as proposed by Jacobs (1993), and by designing streets and sidewalks that are safe and comfortable for pedestrians. This principle can be applied by incorporating pedestrian-friendly design features, such as wider sidewalks, raised crosswalks, and traffic calming measures.

##### Principle Three: Mixed-Use Development

The principle of mixed-use development is also important in intelligent urbanism. It involves designing cities in a way that promotes a mix of residential, commercial, and recreational uses. This can help to create vibrant, diverse, and livable communities. Mixed-use development can be achieved by incorporating a variety of uses into a single building or block, and by creating public spaces that facilitate interaction between different groups of people.

#### Form-Based Codes

Form-based codes are another important tool in urban design. They provide a set of design guidelines and regulations that govern the physical form of buildings and the public realm. These codes are often used in conjunction with traditional zoning regulations, which control the use of land. Form-based codes can be applied to a variety of urban design problems, including the redevelopment of existing buildings, the design of new developments, and the revitalization of historic districts.

##### History

The use of form-based codes can be traced back to ancient civilizations, as seen in the urban designs of Hippodamus of Miletus and the Laws of the Indies. These early examples demonstrate the importance of regulating urban form to create harmonious and livable cities. In more recent times, form-based codes have been used in cities around the world, including Paris under Baron Haussmann and Philadelphia under William Penn.

##### Emergence

The emergence of modern form-based codes has been driven by the need for more comprehensive and predictable results in urban design. Traditional zoning regulations, which focus on land use, have often failed to produce the desired physical form. Form-based codes, on the other hand, provide a more detailed and specific set of design guidelines, which can help to create more cohesive and harmonious urban environments.

In conclusion, the application of urban design principles is a crucial aspect of creating livable, sustainable, and vibrant cities. By incorporating principles of intelligent urbanism and form-based codes into the design process, urban designers can create cities that meet the needs of their residents and contribute to the overall quality of life in the community.




### Subsection: 14.2a Analysis of Urban Design Case Studies

In this section, we will delve into the analysis of urban design case studies, focusing on the principles of intelligent urbanism and form-based codes. The case studies will provide practical examples of how these principles are applied in real-world urban design projects.

#### Case Study One: The High Line, New York City

The High Line is a 1.45-mile-long elevated linear park built on a former freight rail line in New York City. The project was initiated by a community-based organization, Friends of the High Line, and was completed in 2009. The High Line is a prime example of intelligent urbanism, demonstrating the principles of sustainability and walkability.

##### Sustainability

The High Line project incorporated several sustainable practices. The design team repurposed the existing rail line, rather than demolishing and rebuilding, reducing the environmental impact of the project. The park is also designed to be energy-efficient, with features such as solar-powered lighting and rainwater harvesting. The park also promotes sustainable modes of transportation, such as walking and cycling, reducing the need for private vehicles.

##### Walkability

The High Line is designed to be a pedestrian-friendly space, with wide, landscaped walkways and seating areas. The park also includes a variety of public spaces, from intimate seating areas to larger gathering spaces, creating a sense of community and encouraging social interaction. The High Line is a testament to the principle of walkability, demonstrating how urban design can create vibrant, livable spaces that encourage walking and reduce the need for private vehicles.

#### Case Study Two: The 100 Resilient Cities Initiative

The 100 Resilient Cities Initiative, launched by the Rockefeller Foundation, is a global effort to help cities around the world become more resilient to the physical, social, and economic challenges of the 21st century. The initiative provides a framework for cities to become more resilient, including a set of 10 resilience indicators that cities can use to measure their progress.

##### Resilience Indicators

The 10 resilience indicators are:

1. Health and Well-being: The city is able to ensure the health and well-being of its citizens.
2. Education: The city is able to provide quality education for its citizens.
3. Economy: The city has a strong and diverse economy.
4. Infrastructure: The city has a reliable and sustainable infrastructure.
5. Equity: The city promotes social and economic equity.
6. Disaster Resilience: The city is able to withstand and recover from disasters.
7. Mobility: The city provides efficient and sustainable transportation options.
8. Environment: The city is committed to environmental sustainability.
9. Public Safety: The city provides safe and secure environments for its citizens.
10. Governance: The city has effective governance systems in place.

These indicators provide a comprehensive framework for assessing a city's resilience, and can be used as a guide for urban design projects. By incorporating these indicators into the design process, urban designers can create cities that are better equipped to face the challenges of the future.

#### Case Study Three: The Integrated Modification Methodology (IMM)

The Integrated Modification Methodology (IMM) is a design approach that focuses on the systemic structure of the urban form. The methodology involves an iterative process that includes four major phases: Investigation, Formulation, Transformation, and Evaluation.

##### Investigation

The Investigation phase involves a synthesis-based inquiry into the systemic structure of the urban form. This phase begins with "Horizontal Investigation," where the area under study is broken down into its morphology-generator elements, namely Urban Built-ups, Urban Voids, Types of Uses, and Links. This is followed by "Vertical Investigation," which studies the integral relationships between these elements. The output of Vertical Investigation is a set of quantitative descriptions and qualitative illustrations of certain attributes named "Key Categories". These Key Categories are the result of an emergence process of interaction between elementary parts (Urban Built-ups, Urban Voids, Types of Uses, and Links) to form a synergy that adds value to the combined organization.

##### Formulation

The Formulation phase is a technical assumption of the most critical Key Category and transformation design process. This phase involves the application of the Key Categories to the design of the urban form, creating a synergy that adds value to the combined organization.

##### Transformation

The Transformation phase involves the actual implementation of the design, transforming the urban form according to the Key Categories.

##### Evaluation

The Evaluation phase is a final examination of the system's performance, using a list of verified indicators associated with ecological sustainability. These indicators are used in the CAS retrofitting process necessary for the final evaluation of the system performance.

The IMM provides a systematic approach to urban design, focusing on the systemic structure of the urban form and the emergence of Key Categories. This methodology can be applied to a wide range of urban design projects, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and transforming the urban form.

Sustainable urban design is a multifaceted approach that aims to create livable, environmentally friendly, and economically viable cities. It is a crucial aspect of urban planning and design, as it sets the foundation for the future development of our cities. In this section, we will explore the principles of sustainable urban design and how they guide the creation of sustainable cities.

#### 16.1a Understanding Sustainable Urban Design

Sustainable urban design is a holistic approach that considers the environmental, social, and economic impacts of urban development. It is based on the principles of sustainability, which aim to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This means that sustainable urban design must balance the needs of the current population with the needs of future generations.

One of the key principles of sustainable urban design is the concept of the sustainable urban neighbourhood (SUN). The SUN is a self-contained community that is designed to be sustainable in terms of its environmental, social, and economic impacts. It is organized to promote efficient public transportation, walkability, and environmental sustainability.

#### 16.1b Good Transit

An efficient public transportation system is vital for the SUN. It is designed to provide a real public transport alternative to the car, reducing car use and promoting sustainable transportation options. This is achieved by organizing the SUN to facilitate safe and accessible bus/tram stops for all residents. By providing convenient and efficient public transportation, the SUN promotes a more sustainable and livable community.

Community engagement can take many forms, such as public meetings, workshops, and online surveys. It allows residents to have a say in the design of their community and promotes a sense of ownership and responsibility for the SUN. By involving the community, we can create a more sustainable and livable community that meets the needs of its residents.





### Section: 16.2 Case Studies in Sustainable Urban Design:

In this section, we will explore some real-world examples of sustainable urban design. These case studies will provide a deeper understanding of the principles and concepts discussed in the previous section.

#### 16.2a Analysis of Sustainable Urban Design Case Studies

To analyze the sustainability of urban design, we will use the Integrated Modification Methodology (IMM). This methodology is based on an iterative process involving four major phases: Investigation, Formulation, Transformation, and Evaluation.

##### Investigation Phase

The Investigation phase begins with "Horizontal Investigation," where the area under study is broken down into its morphology-generator elements, namely Urban Built-ups, Urban Voids, Types of Uses, and Links. This is followed by "Vertical Investigation," which studies the integral relationships between these elements. The output of Vertical Investigation is a set of quantitative descriptions and qualitative illustrations of certain attributes known as "Key Categories." These Key Categories are the result of an emergence process, where the elements of the city self-organize and synchronize to form a new level of organization.

##### Formulation Phase

The Formulation phase is a technical assumption of the most critical Key Category identified in the Investigation phase. This involves a deeper analysis of the Key Category and its impact on the overall functioning of the city. It also involves identifying the most critical Key Category and developing a transformation design process to address any issues or challenges identified.

##### Transformation Phase

The Transformation phase is where the actual design and implementation of sustainable urban design solutions take place. This phase involves the application of the transformation design process developed in the Formulation phase. It also involves monitoring and adjusting the design as needed to ensure its effectiveness.

##### Evaluation Phase

The Evaluation phase is the final step in the IMM process. It involves examining the system's performance by referring to a list of verified indicators associated with ecological sustainability. These indicators are used to evaluate the system's performance and identify any areas for improvement.

By using the IMM methodology, we can analyze the sustainability of urban design case studies and identify areas for improvement. This will help us understand the principles and concepts of sustainable urban design and apply them to future urban design projects.





### Subsection: 16.2b Lessons from Sustainable Urban Design Case Studies

Whether you are a student, a professional, or simply someone interested in urban environments, this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for understanding the complex and ever-evolving field of urban design and architecture. So let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of urban design and architecture.




### Section: 17.1 Relationship between Urban Design and Architecture:

Urban design and architecture are two closely related disciplines that work together to create functional, aesthetically pleasing, and sustainable urban environments. In this section, we will explore the relationship between urban design and architecture, and how they complement each other in the design and development of cities.

#### 17.1a Understanding the Relationship between Urban Design and Architecture

Urban design and architecture are often viewed as separate disciplines, with urban design focusing on the overall form and function of a city, and architecture focusing on the design of individual buildings. However, the two are deeply intertwined, with urban design providing the framework for architecture to operate within.

Urban design sets the stage for architecture by establishing the overall form and function of a city. This includes determining the layout of streets, blocks, and public spaces, as well as establishing design guidelines and principles that guide the design of buildings within the city. Architecture, on the other hand, focuses on the design of individual buildings, taking into account the overall urban design context in which they exist.

One of the key ways in which urban design and architecture are related is through the concept of "urban design principles." These principles guide the design of both the city as a whole and individual buildings within it. They are often based on the principles of urbanism, which are the fundamental principles that govern the design and development of cities.

Urban design principles can be categorized into three main areas: form, function, and aesthetics. Form refers to the physical layout and structure of the city, including its streets, blocks, and public spaces. Function refers to the purpose and use of the city, including its economic, social, and cultural activities. Aesthetics refer to the visual and sensory qualities of the city, including its appearance, atmosphere, and overall character.

Architecture plays a crucial role in implementing urban design principles. Architects must consider the overall urban design context when designing buildings, ensuring that their design fits within the larger framework of the city. This can include adhering to design guidelines and principles set by urban planners, as well as incorporating elements of the surrounding context into the design of the building.

In addition to implementing urban design principles, architecture also has the power to shape the character and identity of a city. The design of buildings can greatly impact the overall aesthetic of a city, and can even influence the function and use of certain areas. For example, the design of a skyscraper in a downtown area can create a sense of modernity and bustle, while a row of historic homes in a residential neighborhood can evoke a sense of charm and history.

Overall, the relationship between urban design and architecture is symbiotic. Urban design provides the framework for architecture to operate within, while architecture has the power to shape the character and identity of a city. By working together, urban design and architecture can create vibrant, functional, and aesthetically pleasing urban environments that meet the needs of the people who live, work, and visit them.





### Section: 17.1b Case Studies in Urban Design and Architecture

In this section, we will explore some case studies that demonstrate the relationship between urban design and architecture. These case studies will provide real-world examples of how urban design principles are applied in the design and development of cities.

#### 17.1b.1 The High Line, New York City

The High Line is a 1.45-mile-long elevated linear park built on a former freight rail line in New York City. The project was a collaboration between landscape architecture firm James Corner Field Operations, architecture firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro, and engineering firm Buro Happold. The High Line is a prime example of how urban design and architecture can work together to transform an abandoned industrial site into a vibrant public space.

The urban design principles that guided the design of the High Line include creating a sense of place, promoting walkability, and incorporating sustainable design. The project also adhered to the principles of urbanism, such as creating a sense of enclosure and promoting social interaction.

By understanding and applying urban design principles, architects can create buildings that not only meet the needs of their occupants but also contribute to the overall form and function of the city.





### Section: 17.2 Architectural Principles in Urban Design:

Architectural principles play a crucial role in urban design, shaping the physical form and character of cities. These principles are not only concerned with the design of individual buildings, but also with the overall layout and organization of the urban fabric. In this section, we will explore the key architectural principles that guide urban design and how they contribute to the creation of livable and sustainable cities.

#### 17.2a Understanding Architectural Principles in Urban Design

Architectural principles in urban design can be broadly categorized into two types: formal and functional. Formal principles are concerned with the aesthetic and spatial qualities of the built environment, while functional principles focus on the practical and operational aspects of design.

##### Formal Principles

Formal principles in urban design are concerned with the visual and spatial qualities of the built environment. These include the use of architectural elements such as form, scale, and proportion to create a sense of place and identity. For example, the use of a consistent architectural style or design language can help to create a sense of cohesion and unity within a city.

Another important formal principle is the concept of urban design as a form of art. As noted by architect Christopher Alexander, urban design can be seen as a form of art, with the city as its canvas and the buildings as its brushstrokes. This perspective emphasizes the importance of aesthetic considerations in urban design, and the role of the architect as an artist shaping the urban landscape.

##### Functional Principles

Functional principles in urban design are concerned with the practical and operational aspects of design. These include the use of architectural elements such as orientation, layout, and materials to optimize the performance and functionality of the built environment. For example, the orientation of a building can be designed to maximize natural light and ventilation, while the layout of a city can be optimized for pedestrian and vehicular traffic.

One key functional principle is the concept of sustainability. With the increasing concern for the environmental impact of urban development, architects and urban planners are increasingly incorporating sustainability principles into their designs. This includes the use of sustainable materials, energy-efficient design, and strategies for reducing waste and resource consumption.

#### 17.2b Case Studies in Architectural Principles in Urban Design

To further illustrate the role of architectural principles in urban design, let's examine some case studies.

##### The High Line, New York City

The High Line is a 1.45-mile-long elevated linear park built on a former freight rail line in New York City. The project was a collaboration between landscape architecture firm James Corner Field Operations, architecture firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro, and engineering firm Buro Happold.
