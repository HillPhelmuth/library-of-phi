## Chapter 1: Introduction to Acoustical Oceanography:




### Introduction

Welcome to the first chapter of "Acoustical Oceanography: Exploring the Depths of Sound in the Ocean". In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of wave propagation in ocean acoustics. This is a crucial aspect of acoustical oceanography, as it helps us understand how sound travels through the ocean and how it interacts with the various components of the marine environment.

The ocean is a complex medium, with a multitude of physical properties that can affect the propagation of sound waves. These properties include the salinity, temperature, and density of the water, as well as the presence of suspended particles and organisms. Understanding how these properties influence wave propagation is essential for a wide range of applications, from underwater communication to marine navigation and resource exploration.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental principles of wave propagation in the ocean. We will start by discussing the basic properties of sound waves and how they interact with the ocean environment. We will then delve into the mathematical models that describe wave propagation, including the wave equation and the principles of ray theory. We will also discuss the effects of various physical properties of the ocean on wave propagation, and how these effects can be quantified using mathematical models.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the principles of wave propagation in ocean acoustics. You will be equipped with the knowledge and tools to explore the depths of sound in the ocean, and to understand the complex interactions between sound and the marine environment. So, let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of wave propagation in ocean acoustics.




#### 1.1a Reflection and Transmission at Boundaries

In the previous section, we discussed the reflection and transmission of waves at the boundary of two media. We saw that when a wave traveling in one medium reaches the boundary, a part of the wave is transmitted into the second medium, while another part is reflected back into the first medium. The amplitude of the transmitted wave and the reflected wave can be calculated using the continuity condition at the boundary.

Consider a wave with an angular frequency of `ω` traveling from a medium with wave speed `c_1` to a medium with wave speed `c_2`. The incident wave has the waveform `u^\text{inc}(x, t) = Ae^{i(k_1 x - \omega t)}`, where `A` is a complex amplitude. The incident wave reaches the boundary at `x = 0`. Therefore, the corresponding reflected wave and the transmitted wave will have the waveforms `u^\text{refl}(x, t) = Be^{i(-k_1 x - \omega t)}` and `u^\text{trans}(x, t) = Ce^{i(k_2 x - \omega t)}`, respectively, where `B` and `C` are the complex amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted waves, respectively.

The continuity condition at the boundary is given by `u^\text{inc}(0, t) + u^\text{refl}(0, t) = u^\text{trans}(0, t)`. This gives the equations `A + B = C` and `k_1 A + k_1 B = k_2 C`. Solving these equations, we get the reflectivity and transmissivity as `$\frac{B}{A} = \frac{c_2 - c_1}{c_2 + c_1}$` and `$\frac{C}{A} = \frac{2c_1}{c_2 + c_1}$`, respectively.

The limiting case of `$c_2 = 0$` corresponds to a "fixed end" that doesn't move, whereas the limiting case of `$c_2 = \infty$` corresponds to a "free end".

In the next section, we will discuss the Sturm–Liouville formulation, which provides a general framework for solving boundary value problems for the wave equation.

#### 1.1b Ray Tracing in Ocean Acoustics

Ray tracing is a powerful technique used in ocean acoustics to study the propagation of sound waves. It is based on the principle of ray optics, which assumes that light (or in our case, sound) travels in straight lines and is not affected by the medium it is traveling through, except at boundaries where it can be reflected or transmitted.

In the context of ocean acoustics, ray tracing is used to model the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. The ocean is a complex medium with varying properties such as salinity, temperature, and pressure, which can affect the speed of sound. Therefore, the ray tracing technique is used to approximate the propagation of sound waves in the ocean by considering the ocean as a collection of layers with different properties, each of which can be represented by a ray.

The ray tracing technique is particularly useful in ocean acoustics because it allows us to study the propagation of sound waves in the ocean without having to solve the wave equation for the entire ocean. Instead, we can focus on the propagation of sound waves along a single ray, which simplifies the problem significantly.

The ray tracing technique can be used to study a variety of phenomena in ocean acoustics, such as the reflection and transmission of sound waves at the ocean surface, the refraction of sound waves at the ocean floor, and the scattering of sound waves by underwater objects.

In the next section, we will discuss the Sturm–Liouville formulation, which provides a mathematical framework for studying the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.

#### 1.1c Scattering and Absorption in Ocean Acoustics

Scattering and absorption are two fundamental processes that occur when sound waves propagate through the ocean. These processes are crucial in understanding the behavior of sound waves in the ocean and their impact on marine life.

Scattering is the process by which sound waves are deflected from their original path due to interactions with particles or structures in the water. In the ocean, scattering can occur due to interactions with plankton, sediment, and other objects. The scattering of sound waves can be described mathematically using the scattering matrix, or scattering matrix, which relates the incident wave to the scattered wave. The scattering matrix is a complex-valued matrix that depends on the properties of the medium and the frequency of the sound wave.

Absorption, on the other hand, is the process by which sound waves lose energy as they propagate through the ocean. This loss of energy can be due to various factors, including the absorption of sound by water molecules, the conversion of sound energy into heat, and the scattering of sound waves. The absorption of sound waves can be described mathematically using the absorption coefficient, which is a measure of the amount of energy absorbed per unit length. The absorption coefficient is a function of the frequency of the sound wave and the properties of the medium.

In the context of ocean acoustics, scattering and absorption can have significant impacts on the propagation of sound waves. For example, the scattering of sound waves can cause the sound to be deflected away from the receiver, reducing the received signal strength. Similarly, the absorption of sound waves can cause the sound to lose energy as it propagates through the ocean, reducing the range of the sound.

In the next section, we will discuss the Sturm–Liouville formulation, which provides a mathematical framework for studying the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.

#### 1.1d Waveguide Theory in Ocean Acoustics

Waveguide theory is a mathematical model used to describe the propagation of sound waves in a medium. In the context of ocean acoustics, waveguide theory is particularly useful for understanding the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.

The waveguide model is based on the concept of a waveguide, which is a structure that guides waves along its length. In the ocean, the waveguide can be thought of as the ocean itself, with the sound waves propagating along the waveguide.

The waveguide theory is based on the wave equation, which describes the propagation of waves in a medium. The wave equation can be written in the frequency domain as:

$$
\nabla^2 \phi - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} = 0
$$

where $\phi$ is the wave function, $c$ is the speed of sound, and $t$ is time. The wave equation can be solved using various methods, including the method of separation of variables and the Fourier transform method.

In the context of ocean acoustics, the waveguide theory is used to study the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. The waveguide theory can be used to calculate the propagation loss, which is the loss of energy as the sound wave propagates through the ocean. The propagation loss can be calculated using the waveguide equation:

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \alpha \frac{k}{k_0}
$$

where $L$ is the propagation loss, $\alpha$ is the absorption coefficient, $k$ is the wave number, and $k_0$ is the wave number in the absence of absorption.

The waveguide theory can also be used to study the scattering of sound waves in the ocean. The scattering of sound waves can be described using the scattering matrix, which relates the incident wave to the scattered wave. The scattering matrix can be calculated using the waveguide equation:

$$
S = \frac{1}{k_0} \frac{\partial k}{\partial n}
$$

where $S$ is the scattering matrix, $k$ is the wave number, and $n$ is the refractive index.

In the next section, we will discuss the Sturm–Liouville formulation, which provides a mathematical framework for studying the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.




#### 1.1b Snell's Law and Critical Angles

Snell's Law is a fundamental principle in optics and acoustics that describes the behavior of waves at the boundary of two media. It is named after Dutch mathematician Willebrord Snellius, who first formulated the law in 1621. Snell's Law is given by the equation:

$$
n_1 \sin(\theta_1) = n_2 \sin(\theta_2)
$$

where `n_1` and `n_2` are the refractive indices of the two media, and `θ_1` and `θ_2` are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.

In the context of ocean acoustics, Snell's Law is used to describe the propagation of sound waves at the interface of the water column and the seafloor. The refractive indices of water and sediment can vary significantly, leading to changes in the speed of sound and hence the angle of refraction.

Critical angles are another important concept in Snell's Law. A critical angle is the smallest angle of incidence that yields total reflection. In other words, if the angle of incidence is less than the critical angle, the wave will be completely reflected back into the first medium. The critical angle is given by the equation:

$$
\theta_c = \arcsin\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)
$$

where `n_1` and `n_2` are the refractive indices of the two media.

In the context of ocean acoustics, critical angles can play a crucial role in the propagation of sound waves. For instance, if the angle of incidence is less than the critical angle, sound waves can be trapped in the water column, leading to a phenomenon known as "sound channeling". This can have significant implications for the propagation of sound in the ocean, particularly in deep water where the speed of sound can be much higher than in the surface layer.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the implications of Snell's Law and critical angles for the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.

#### 1.1c Reflection and Refraction at Interfaces

The reflection and refraction of sound waves at interfaces is a crucial aspect of ocean acoustics. As we have seen in the previous section, Snell's Law describes the behavior of waves at the boundary of two media. However, it is important to note that not all of the incident wave is reflected back into the first medium. Some of the wave is always transmitted into the second medium, and this transmission can be described by the Fresnel equations.

The Fresnel equations are a set of equations that describe the reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves at the boundary of two media. They are named after the French physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel, who first derived them in the 19th century. The Fresnel equations are given by the following equations:

$$
r = \frac{n_1 \cos(\theta_1) - n_2 \cos(\theta_2)}{n_1 \cos(\theta_1) + n_2 \cos(\theta_2)}
$$

$$
t = \frac{2 n_1 \cos(\theta_1)}{n_1 \cos(\theta_1) + n_2 \cos(\theta_2)}
$$

where `r` is the reflection coefficient, `t` is the transmission coefficient, `n_1` and `n_2` are the refractive indices of the two media, and `θ_1` and `θ_2` are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.

The reflection coefficient `r` describes the fraction of the incident wave that is reflected back into the first medium, while the transmission coefficient `t` describes the fraction of the incident wave that is transmitted into the second medium. These coefficients can range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a greater fraction of the wave is reflected or transmitted.

In the context of ocean acoustics, the Fresnel equations can be used to describe the propagation of sound waves at the interface of the water column and the seafloor. The refractive indices of water and sediment can vary significantly, leading to changes in the speed of sound and hence the angles of incidence and refraction. This can have significant implications for the propagation of sound in the ocean, particularly in deep water where the speed of sound can be much higher than in the surface layer.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of critical angles in more detail, and discuss their implications for the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.




#### 1.1c Ray Tracing and Ray Bending

Ray tracing is a fundamental technique in acoustical oceanography that allows us to understand how sound waves propagate through the ocean. It is a method of tracing the path of a ray of light or sound as it interacts with various surfaces and interfaces. In the context of ocean acoustics, ray tracing is used to model the propagation of sound waves in the water column and at the interfaces between different layers of water.

The basic principle of ray tracing is to trace a ray from the source of the sound wave to the receiver. This ray represents the path that the sound wave takes as it propagates through the ocean. The ray is traced by calculating the angles of reflection and refraction at each interface it encounters.

The angles of reflection and refraction are determined by Snell's Law, which we discussed in the previous section. Snell's Law provides a mathematical description of how sound waves behave at interfaces. It states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the inverse ratio of the refractive indices of the two media.

In the context of ocean acoustics, the refractive indices of water and sediment can vary significantly. This can lead to complex patterns of sound propagation, with sound waves bending and reflecting in unpredictable ways. By using ray tracing, we can model these complex patterns and gain a deeper understanding of how sound propagates in the ocean.

One of the key concepts in ray tracing is the idea of ray bending. This refers to the phenomenon where a sound wave changes direction as it passes through an interface. The amount of bending depends on the difference in refractive indices between the two media. If the refractive indices are very different, the sound wave can bend sharply, leading to strong reflections. If the refractive indices are similar, the sound wave will bend less, leading to weaker reflections.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical details of ray tracing and ray bending, and explore how these concepts can be applied to understand the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.




#### 1.2a Normal Modes in a Stratified Ocean

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of ray tracing and how it helps us understand the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. In this section, we will delve into another important technique in acoustical oceanography: the study of normal modes in a stratified ocean.

A stratified ocean refers to the layered structure of the ocean, where different layers of water have different densities and refractive indices. This stratification can significantly affect the propagation of sound waves, leading to complex patterns of reflection and refraction.

Normal modes, in the context of acoustical oceanography, refer to the specific patterns of wave propagation that occur in a stratified ocean. These patterns are determined by the interaction of the sound waves with the various layers of water, and can be described mathematically using the principles of wave propagation and boundary conditions.

The study of normal modes is crucial in understanding the behavior of sound waves in the ocean. It allows us to predict the direction and intensity of sound waves, and to understand how they interact with different layers of water. This knowledge is essential in many areas of oceanography, including underwater acoustics, ocean exploration, and the study of marine life.

To understand normal modes, we must first understand the concept of a waveguide. A waveguide is a structure that guides waves along a specific path. In the context of acoustical oceanography, the ocean itself can be considered a waveguide, guiding sound waves along its depth.

The propagation of sound waves in a waveguide can be described using the wave equation, which is a second-order linear partial differential equation. The wave equation describes how the wave's properties (such as its amplitude, phase, and group velocity) change over time and space.

In the context of a stratified ocean, the wave equation becomes more complex due to the stratification of the ocean. The wave equation for a stratified ocean can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial z^2} + g \frac{\partial p}{\partial z}
$$

where $p$ is the pressure, $t$ is time, $z$ is the vertical coordinate (positive upwards), $c$ is the speed of sound, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

The solutions to this equation represent the normal modes of the ocean. Each normal mode corresponds to a specific pattern of wave propagation, with a specific frequency and wavenumber.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of normal modes in more detail, and discuss how they can be used to understand the propagation of sound waves in a stratified ocean.

#### 1.2b Resonance and Standing Waves

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of normal modes in a stratified ocean. We saw how the interaction of sound waves with different layers of water can lead to specific patterns of wave propagation, known as normal modes. In this section, we will explore another important aspect of wave propagation in the ocean: resonance and standing waves.

Resonance is a phenomenon that occurs when a system is driven at its natural frequency, leading to large amplitude oscillations. In the context of acoustical oceanography, resonance can occur when sound waves interact with the stratified layers of the ocean at their natural frequencies. This can lead to significant amplification of the sound waves, which can have important implications for underwater acoustics and marine life.

The concept of resonance is closely related to the concept of standing waves. A standing wave is a wave that does not propagate in space, but instead oscillates in a confined space. In the ocean, standing waves can occur when sound waves are trapped between two layers of water with different densities. This can lead to the formation of standing waves, which can have significant effects on the propagation of sound waves.

The study of resonance and standing waves is crucial in understanding the behavior of sound waves in the ocean. It allows us to predict the amplification of sound waves, and to understand how they interact with different layers of water. This knowledge is essential in many areas of oceanography, including underwater acoustics, ocean exploration, and the study of marine life.

To understand resonance and standing waves, we must first understand the concept of a waveguide. A waveguide is a structure that guides waves along a specific path. In the context of acoustical oceanography, the ocean itself can be considered a waveguide, guiding sound waves along its depth.

The propagation of sound waves in a waveguide can be described using the wave equation, which is a second-order linear partial differential equation. The wave equation describes how the wave's properties (such as its amplitude, phase, and group velocity) change over time and space.

In the context of resonance and standing waves, the wave equation becomes more complex due to the interaction of sound waves with different layers of water. The wave equation for a stratified ocean can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial z^2} + g \frac{\partial p}{\partial z}
$$

where $p$ is the pressure, $t$ is time, $z$ is the vertical coordinate (positive upwards), $c$ is the speed of sound, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

The solutions to this equation represent the normal modes of the ocean, which can exhibit resonance and standing wave behavior under certain conditions. By studying these normal modes, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of sound waves in the ocean.

#### 1.2c Applications of Mode Techniques

In the previous sections, we have explored the concepts of normal modes, resonance, and standing waves in the context of acoustical oceanography. These concepts are not just theoretical constructs, but have practical applications in various fields of oceanography. In this section, we will discuss some of these applications.

One of the most important applications of mode techniques is in the study of ocean convection. As we have seen in the previous chapter, deep convection is a significant phenomenon in the Labrador Sea, the Greenland Sea, and the Weddell Sea. The Labrador Sea, in particular, is known for its weak density stratification, which allows for deep convection to occur each winter. This phenomenon is significantly affected by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), with the positive phase of NAO leading to deeper convection.

Mode techniques can be used to study the propagation of sound waves in these regions of deep convection. By understanding the normal modes of the ocean, we can predict the amplification of sound waves, which can be crucial in underwater acoustics. For instance, the positive phase of NAO, which leads to deeper convection, can also lead to increased amplification of sound waves. This can have important implications for marine life, as sound waves can be used for communication and navigation by various marine species.

Another important application of mode techniques is in the study of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Here, deep convection occurs in winter, when the water undergoes the necessary preconditioning with air-sea fluxes inducing buoyancy losses at the surface. Mode techniques can be used to study the normal modes of the ocean in this region, which can provide insights into the propagation of sound waves and their interaction with different layers of water.

In addition to these applications, mode techniques can also be used in the study of ocean currents and the transport of heat and nutrients. By understanding the normal modes of the ocean, we can predict the propagation of sound waves, which can provide insights into the movement of water and the transport of heat and nutrients.

In conclusion, mode techniques, including the study of normal modes, resonance, and standing waves, have a wide range of applications in acoustical oceanography. They can provide insights into the propagation of sound waves, the interaction of sound waves with different layers of water, and the transport of heat and nutrients in the ocean. As such, they are an essential tool in the study of the ocean.

## Chapter: Chapter 2: Sound Propagation in Water

### Introduction

The ocean is a vast and complex environment, teeming with life and filled with a myriad of sounds. From the gentle lapping of waves on a beach to the deafening roar of a whale song, the ocean is a symphony of sound. In this chapter, we delve into the fascinating world of sound propagation in water, a critical aspect of acoustical oceanography.

Sound propagation in water is a complex phenomenon, influenced by a multitude of factors. The speed of sound in water, for instance, is not a constant value but varies with temperature, salinity, and depth. The interaction of sound waves with the water column and the seafloor can lead to phenomena such as reflection, refraction, and absorption, which significantly affect the propagation of sound.

We will explore these concepts in detail, providing a comprehensive understanding of how sound travels in the ocean. We will also discuss the implications of sound propagation for various applications, from underwater communication to marine life studies.

This chapter aims to equip readers with the knowledge and tools to understand and predict the behavior of sound waves in water. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field of acoustical oceanography, this chapter will serve as a valuable resource in your journey to unravel the mysteries of the ocean's soundscape.

So, let's embark on this exciting journey into the world of sound propagation in water.




#### 1.2b Modal Dispersion and Coupling

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of normal modes in a stratified ocean. We saw how the interaction of sound waves with different layers of water can lead to complex patterns of wave propagation. In this section, we will delve deeper into this topic and explore the concepts of modal dispersion and coupling.

Modal dispersion refers to the phenomenon where different normal modes of a system have different dispersion relations. In the context of acoustical oceanography, this means that different normal modes of the ocean will have different speeds of sound. This can lead to interesting effects, such as the splitting of a sound wave into multiple waves with different speeds.

The dispersion relation for a normal mode can be written as:

$$
\omega = \sqrt{gk}
$$

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $k$ is the wavenumber. The dispersion relation shows that the speed of sound for a normal mode is proportional to the square root of the wavenumber. This means that modes with higher wavenumbers will have higher speeds of sound.

Coupling, on the other hand, refers to the interaction between different normal modes. In a stratified ocean, different normal modes can interact with each other due to the stratification of the ocean. This can lead to the exchange of energy between different modes, leading to changes in the overall wave field.

The coupling between different modes can be described using the concept of modal coupling coefficients. These coefficients describe the strength of the interaction between different modes. The modal coupling coefficients can be calculated using the principles of wave propagation and boundary conditions.

The study of modal dispersion and coupling is crucial in understanding the behavior of sound waves in the ocean. It allows us to predict the propagation of sound waves in a stratified ocean, and to understand how different modes interact with each other. This knowledge is essential in many areas of oceanography, including underwater acoustics, ocean exploration, and the study of marine life.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of waveguide modes and how they relate to the normal modes of a stratified ocean.

#### 1.2c Waveguide Modes and Resonances

In the previous section, we discussed the concepts of modal dispersion and coupling in a stratified ocean. We saw how different normal modes of the ocean can have different dispersion relations and interact with each other due to stratification. In this section, we will explore the concept of waveguide modes and resonances, which are crucial in understanding the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.

A waveguide is a structure that guides waves along a specific path. In the context of acoustical oceanography, the ocean itself can be considered a waveguide, guiding sound waves along its depth. The modes of a waveguide are the specific patterns of wave propagation that occur within the waveguide. In the ocean, these modes are determined by the interaction of sound waves with the stratification of the ocean.

The modes of a waveguide can be classified into two types: guided modes and radiating modes. Guided modes are those that are confined within the waveguide, while radiating modes are those that propagate out of the waveguide. In the ocean, most modes are guided modes, as the ocean acts as a confining structure for sound waves.

The propagation of guided modes in a waveguide can be described using the wave equation:

$$
\nabla^2 \phi - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} = 0
$$

where $\phi$ is the wave function, $c$ is the speed of sound, and $t$ is time. The wave equation shows that the propagation of a wave is determined by the balance between the spatial variation of the wave (represented by the Laplacian operator $\nabla^2$) and the temporal variation of the wave (represented by the second derivative with respect to time).

Resonances, on the other hand, refer to the phenomenon where a waveguide mode becomes unstable and grows in amplitude. This can occur when the waveguide mode matches the frequency of a resonant frequency of the waveguide. In the ocean, resonances can occur due to the stratification of the ocean, leading to the formation of standing waves.

The resonant frequencies of a waveguide can be calculated using the dispersion relation:

$$
\omega = \sqrt{gk}
$$

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $k$ is the wavenumber. The dispersion relation shows that the resonant frequencies of a waveguide are determined by the stratification of the ocean, with higher stratification leading to higher resonant frequencies.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of waveguide modes and resonances in more detail, and discuss their implications for the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.

#### 1.3a Wave Propagation in Stratified Media

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of waveguide modes and resonances, and how they relate to the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. In this section, we will delve deeper into the topic of wave propagation in stratified media, which is a crucial aspect of acoustical oceanography.

Stratified media refers to a medium that is layered or stratified, with different properties in each layer. In the context of the ocean, this could be due to variations in temperature, salinity, or density. These variations can significantly affect the propagation of sound waves, leading to phenomena such as modal dispersion and coupling.

The propagation of sound waves in stratified media can be described using the wave equation:

$$
\nabla^2 \phi - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} = 0
$$

where $\phi$ is the wave function, $c$ is the speed of sound, and $t$ is time. However, in stratified media, the speed of sound can vary with depth, leading to changes in the wave equation. This can be accounted for by introducing a depth-dependent speed of sound $c(z)$, where $z$ is the vertical coordinate.

The wave equation in stratified media can then be written as:

$$
\nabla^2 \phi - \frac{1}{c^2(z)} \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} = 0
$$

This equation shows that the propagation of sound waves in stratified media is determined by the balance between the spatial variation of the wave (represented by the Laplacian operator $\nabla^2$) and the temporal variation of the wave (represented by the second derivative with respect to time). However, the speed of sound $c(z)$ can now vary with depth, leading to complex wave propagation phenomena.

In the next section, we will explore some of these phenomena in more detail, and discuss their implications for acoustical oceanography.

#### 1.3b Wave Propagation in Heterogeneous Media

In the previous section, we discussed the propagation of sound waves in stratified media, where the properties of the medium vary with depth. In this section, we will extend our discussion to heterogeneous media, where the properties of the medium can vary in both the horizontal and vertical directions.

Heterogeneous media are common in the ocean, due to the complex interactions between water, air, and sediment. For example, the ocean floor can be composed of a variety of materials, each with different acoustic properties. Similarly, the water column can contain layers of different densities, due to variations in temperature and salinity.

The propagation of sound waves in heterogeneous media can be described using the wave equation:

$$
\nabla^2 \phi - \frac{1}{c^2(x,y,z)} \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} = 0
$$

where $\phi$ is the wave function, $c(x,y,z)$ is the speed of sound, and $t$ is time. The speed of sound can now vary in all three dimensions, leading to complex wave propagation phenomena.

One of the key challenges in acoustical oceanography is understanding how sound waves propagate in heterogeneous media. This is crucial for a wide range of applications, from underwater navigation to the study of marine life.

In the next section, we will explore some of the techniques used to study wave propagation in heterogeneous media, including the use of acoustic tomography and the analysis of wavefield data. We will also discuss some of the key challenges and future directions in this exciting field.

#### 1.3c Wave Propagation in Anisotropic Media

In the previous sections, we have discussed the propagation of sound waves in stratified and heterogeneous media. In this section, we will delve into the propagation of sound waves in anisotropic media. Anisotropic media are those in which the properties of the medium, such as the speed of sound, vary in different directions.

Anisotropic media are common in the ocean, due to the complex interactions between water, air, and sediment. For example, the ocean floor can be composed of anisotropic materials, such as sand or gravel, each with different acoustic properties. Similarly, the water column can contain layers of different densities, due to variations in temperature and salinity, leading to anisotropic properties.

The propagation of sound waves in anisotropic media can be described using the wave equation:

$$
\nabla^2 \phi - \frac{1}{c^2(x,y,z)} \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} = 0
$$

where $\phi$ is the wave function, $c(x,y,z)$ is the speed of sound, and $t$ is time. The speed of sound can now vary in all three dimensions, leading to complex wave propagation phenomena.

One of the key challenges in acoustical oceanography is understanding how sound waves propagate in anisotropic media. This is crucial for a wide range of applications, from underwater navigation to the study of marine life.

In the next section, we will explore some of the techniques used to study wave propagation in anisotropic media, including the use of acoustic tomography and the analysis of wavefield data. We will also discuss some of the key challenges and future directions in this exciting field.

#### 1.4a Wave Propagation in Shallow Water

In the previous sections, we have discussed the propagation of sound waves in various types of media, including stratified, heterogeneous, and anisotropic media. In this section, we will focus on the propagation of sound waves in shallow water.

Shallow water refers to a water body where the depth is much smaller than the wavelength of the sound wave. This is typically the case in the ocean, where the depth of the water column is often much smaller than the wavelength of the sound waves used in acoustical oceanography.

The propagation of sound waves in shallow water can be described using the shallow water equations, which are a simplified form of the wave equation. These equations are derived from the wave equation by making the assumption that the vertical variation of the wave field is much smaller than the horizontal variation. This assumption is valid for sound waves in shallow water, where the depth of the water column is much smaller than the wavelength of the sound wave.

The shallow water equations can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + H \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} = 0
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + H \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y} = 0
$$

where $\eta$ is the surface elevation, $H$ is the water depth, and $t$, $x$, and $y$ are time and horizontal coordinates. These equations describe the propagation of long waves in shallow water, and are used in many applications in acoustical oceanography.

In the next section, we will explore some of the techniques used to study wave propagation in shallow water, including the use of acoustic tomography and the analysis of wavefield data. We will also discuss some of the key challenges and future directions in this exciting field.

#### 1.4b Wave Propagation in Deep Water

In the previous section, we discussed the propagation of sound waves in shallow water. In this section, we will shift our focus to the propagation of sound waves in deep water. Deep water refers to a water body where the depth is much larger than the wavelength of the sound wave. This is typically the case in the ocean, where the depth of the water column is often much larger than the wavelength of the sound waves used in acoustical oceanography.

The propagation of sound waves in deep water can be described using the deep water equations, which are a more complex form of the wave equation compared to the shallow water equations. These equations are derived from the wave equation by making the assumption that the vertical variation of the wave field is much larger than the horizontal variation. This assumption is valid for sound waves in deep water, where the depth of the water column is much larger than the wavelength of the sound wave.

The deep water equations can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = g \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial z} + c^2 \left( \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial y^2} \right)
$$

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = g \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial z} + c^2 \left( \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial y^2} \right)
$$

where $\eta$ is the surface elevation, $z$ is the vertical coordinate, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $c$ is the speed of sound, and $t$, $x$, and $y$ are time and horizontal coordinates. These equations describe the propagation of long waves in deep water, and are used in many applications in acoustical oceanography.

In the next section, we will explore some of the techniques used to study wave propagation in deep water, including the use of acoustic tomography and the analysis of wavefield data. We will also discuss some of the key challenges and future directions in this exciting field.

#### 1.4c Wave Propagation in Coastal Waters

In the previous sections, we have discussed the propagation of sound waves in shallow and deep water. In this section, we will delve into the propagation of sound waves in coastal waters. Coastal waters are a unique environment where the water column is often both shallow and deep at the same time. This is due to the presence of a seafloor that can vary in depth from a few meters to several hundred meters.

The propagation of sound waves in coastal waters can be described using a combination of the shallow water equations and the deep water equations. This is because the water column in coastal waters can be both shallow and deep at the same time, depending on the location and the wavelength of the sound wave.

The propagation of sound waves in coastal waters can be described using the following equations:

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + H \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} = 0
$$

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = g \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial z} + c^2 \left( \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial y^2} \right)
$$

where $\eta$ is the surface elevation, $H$ is the water depth, $z$ is the vertical coordinate, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $c$ is the speed of sound, and $t$, $x$, and $y$ are time and horizontal coordinates. These equations describe the propagation of long waves in coastal waters, and are used in many applications in acoustical oceanography.

In the next section, we will explore some of the techniques used to study wave propagation in coastal waters, including the use of acoustic tomography and the analysis of wavefield data. We will also discuss some of the key challenges and future directions in this exciting field.

## Chapter 2: Acoustic Oceanography

### Introduction

The ocean is a vast and complex environment, teeming with life and filled with a myriad of sounds. From the gentle lapping of waves on a beach to the thunderous roar of a whale song, the ocean is a symphony of sound. However, this symphony is not just audible to the human ear. The ocean is also a world of acoustics, where sound waves travel great distances and interact with the environment in fascinating ways.

#### 1.2c Mode Filtering and Beamforming

In the previous sections, we have discussed the concepts of normal modes, modal dispersion, and coupling. These concepts are crucial in understanding the behavior of sound waves in the ocean. In this section, we will explore the techniques of mode filtering and beamforming, which are used to manipulate the wave field in the ocean.

Mode filtering is a technique used to selectively filter out certain modes of a system. In the context of acoustical oceanography, this can be used to isolate a specific mode of the ocean and study its behavior. This can be achieved by using a filter that is designed to pass only the frequencies associated with the desired mode.

The filter can be designed using the dispersion relation of the mode. The dispersion relation provides the relationship between the frequency and the wavenumber of the mode. By designing a filter that passes only the frequencies that satisfy the dispersion relation, we can isolate the desired mode.

Beamforming, on the other hand, is a technique used to manipulate the direction of propagation of a wave. In acoustical oceanography, this can be used to steer the direction of sound waves in the ocean. This can be achieved by combining the signals from multiple transducers and controlling the phase difference between them.

The beamforming technique can be implemented using a beamformer, which is a device that combines the signals from multiple transducers. The beamformer can be designed to steer the direction of propagation of the sound waves by controlling the phase difference between the signals from the different transducers.

The beamforming technique can be particularly useful in acoustical oceanography, where it is often necessary to steer sound waves over large distances. By using beamforming, we can control the direction of propagation of the sound waves and ensure that they reach the desired location.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of beamforming and explore the different types of beamformers that are used in acoustical oceanography. We will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of beamforming and how it can be used to study the ocean.

### Subsection: 2.1a Finite Difference Methods

The Finite Difference Method (FDM) is a numerical technique used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). It is a powerful tool in computational ocean acoustics, as it allows us to approximate the solutions of PDEs that describe the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.

#### The Basics of Finite Difference Methods

The Finite Difference Method is based on the Taylor series expansion. For a function $f(x)$ and a small increment $\Delta x$, the Taylor series expansion is given by:

$$
f(x + \Delta x) = f(x) + f'(x) \Delta x + \frac{f''(x)}{2!} (\Delta x)^2 + \frac{f'''(x)}{3!} (\Delta x)^3 + \cdots
$$

In the context of FDM, we are interested in approximating the derivatives of a function. This is achieved by truncating the Taylor series expansion at a certain order. For example, a second-order approximation of the derivative $f'(x)$ is given by:

$$
f'(x) \approx \frac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}
$$

This approximation is known as a forward difference approximation, as it uses the values of the function at $x$ and $x + \Delta x$. Similarly, we can define backward difference approximations and central difference approximations.

#### Applications in Computational Ocean Acoustics

Finite Difference Methods are widely used in computational ocean acoustics to solve the equations that describe the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. These equations are often non-linear and complex, and FDM provides a way to approximate their solutions numerically.

For example, consider the wave equation, which describes the propagation of sound waves in a fluid medium:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $p$ is the pressure, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the speed of sound. Using a second-order central difference approximation, we can discretize this equation as:

$$
\frac{p_{i,j}^{n+1} - 2p_{i,j}^n + p_{i,j}^{n-1}}{\Delta t^2} = c^2 \frac{p_{i+1,j}^{n} - 2p_{i,j}^{n} + p_{i-1,j}^{n}}{\Delta x^2}
$$

where $p_{i,j}^{n}$ is the pressure at position $i$ and time $n$, and $\Delta t$ and $\Delta x$ are the time and spatial increments, respectively. This equation can then be solved iteratively to approximate the pressure at each point in the ocean.

#### Limitations and Future Directions

While Finite Difference Methods are a powerful tool in computational ocean acoustics, they do have some limitations. For example, they are based on the assumption that the equations they solve are continuous and differentiable, which may not always be the case in the ocean. Furthermore, the accuracy of the approximations depends on the choice of the time and spatial increments, which can be difficult to determine in complex oceanic environments.

In the future, advancements in computational power and numerical techniques may help overcome these limitations. For example, higher-order FDM schemes, which use more points to approximate the derivatives, can provide more accurate solutions. Additionally, the use of adaptive mesh refinement, where the grid is refined in regions of interest, can help capture the complex dynamics of the ocean.

In conclusion, Finite Difference Methods are a fundamental tool in computational ocean acoustics. They provide a way to approximate the solutions of complex equations that describe the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. While they have some limitations, ongoing research and advancements in computational techniques are expected to further enhance their capabilities.




### Subsection: 2.1b Finite Element Methods

The Finite Element Method (FEM) is another numerical technique used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). It is particularly useful in computational ocean acoustics due to its ability to handle complex geometries and boundary conditions.

#### The Basics of Finite Element Methods

The Finite Element Method is based on the concept of discretizing a continuous domain into a finite number of smaller, simpler domains called finite elements. These elements are connected at specific points called nodes, forming a mesh. The solution to the PDE is then approximated within each element using a set of basis functions.

The solution to the PDE is represented as a linear combination of the basis functions, with the coefficients of the combination determined by minimizing the residual error. The residual error is the difference between the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the PDE.

#### Applications in Computational Ocean Acoustics

Finite Element Methods are widely used in computational ocean acoustics to solve the equations that describe the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. These equations are often non-linear and complex, and FEM provides a way to approximate their solutions numerically.

For example, consider the wave equation, which describes the propagation of sound waves in a fluid medium:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $p$ is the pressure, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the speed of sound. Using a finite element approximation, we can discretize this equation as:

$$
\min_{p_h} \sum_{e} \int_{V^e} \left( \frac{\partial p_h}{\partial t} - c^2 \frac{\partial p_h}{\partial x} \right)^2 dx
$$

where $p_h$ is the approximation of the pressure, $V^e$ is the volume of the element, and the sum is over all elements $e$. The solution to this minimization problem gives the approximation of the pressure at each node, and hence the solution to the wave equation.

#### Comparison with Finite Difference Methods

Finite Element Methods and Finite Difference Methods are both powerful tools in computational ocean acoustics. While both methods have their strengths and weaknesses, FEM is generally preferred for problems with complex geometries and boundary conditions, due to its ability to handle these features more easily than FDM.

However, FDM is simpler to implement and can be more efficient for problems with simple geometries and boundary conditions. Therefore, the choice between FEM and FDM often depends on the specific problem at hand.




### Subsection: 2.1c Boundary Element Methods

The Boundary Element Method (BEM) is a numerical technique used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) that have been formulated as integral equations. It is particularly useful in computational ocean acoustics due to its ability to handle complex geometries and boundary conditions.

#### The Basics of Boundary Element Methods

The Boundary Element Method is based on the concept of discretizing the boundary of a domain into a finite number of simpler domains called boundary elements. These elements are connected at specific points called nodes, forming a mesh. The solution to the PDE is then approximated within each element using a set of basis functions.

The solution to the PDE is represented as a linear combination of the basis functions, with the coefficients of the combination determined by minimizing the residual error. The residual error is the difference between the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the PDE.

#### Applications in Computational Ocean Acoustics

Boundary Element Methods are widely used in computational ocean acoustics to solve the equations that describe the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. These equations are often non-linear and complex, and BEM provides a way to approximate their solutions numerically.

For example, consider the wave equation, which describes the propagation of sound waves in a fluid medium:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $p$ is the pressure, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the speed of sound. Using a boundary element approximation, we can discretize this equation as:

$$
\min_{p_h} \sum_{e} \int_{V^e} \left( \frac{\partial p_h}{\partial t} - c^2 \frac{\partial p_h}{\partial x} \right)^2 dx
$$

where $p_h$ is the approximation of the pressure, $V^e$ is the volume of the element, and the sum is over all elements $e$. The solution to this minimization problem gives the approximation of the pressure at each node, and hence the solution to the wave equation.

#### Advantages and Limitations of Boundary Element Methods

One of the main advantages of BEM is its ability to handle complex geometries and boundary conditions. This makes it particularly useful in computational ocean acoustics, where the ocean floor and surface can have complex shapes and the boundary conditions can be influenced by various factors such as water depth and temperature.

However, BEM also has some limitations. It is only applicable to problems for which Green's functions can be calculated. This places considerable restrictions on the range and generality of problems to which boundary elements can usefully be applied. Nonlinearities can be included in the formulation, although they will generally introduce volume integrals which then require the volume to be discretised before solution can be attempted, removing one of the most often cited advantages of BEM. A useful technique for treating the volume integral without discretising the volume is the dual-reciprocity method.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical formulation of BEM and discuss some of the techniques used to overcome its limitations.




### Subsection: 2.2a Parabolic Equation Methods

The Parabolic Equation Method (PEM) is another numerical technique used in computational ocean acoustics. It is particularly useful for solving problems that involve the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, especially in the presence of complex geometries and boundary conditions.

#### The Basics of Parabolic Equation Methods

The Parabolic Equation Method is based on the concept of discretizing the domain into a finite number of simpler domains called grid cells. These cells are connected at specific points called nodes, forming a grid. The solution to the PDE is then approximated within each cell using a set of basis functions.

The solution to the PDE is represented as a linear combination of the basis functions, with the coefficients of the combination determined by minimizing the residual error. The residual error is the difference between the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the PDE.

#### Applications in Computational Ocean Acoustics

Parabolic Equation Methods are widely used in computational ocean acoustics to solve the equations that describe the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. These equations are often non-linear and complex, and PEM provides a way to approximate their solutions numerically.

For example, consider the wave equation, which describes the propagation of sound waves in a fluid medium:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $p$ is the pressure, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the speed of sound. Using a parabolic equation approximation, we can discretize this equation as:

$$
\min_{p_h} \sum_{e} \int_{V^e} \left( \frac{\partial p_h}{\partial t} - c^2 \frac{\partial p_h}{\partial x} \right)^2 dx
$$

where $p_h$ is the approximation of the pressure, $V^e$ is the volume of the element, and the sum is over all elements $e$. The solution to this minimization problem gives the approximation of the pressure at each node in the grid.

#### 2.2a.1 Parabolic Equation Methods in Ocean Acoustics

In ocean acoustics, Parabolic Equation Methods are particularly useful for solving problems that involve the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. These problems often involve complex geometries and boundary conditions, and the use of PEM allows for the approximation of the solutions in a computationally efficient manner.

For example, consider the problem of sound propagation in a stratified ocean. The stratification of the ocean can be represented by a vertical profile of density and sound speed, which can be used to construct a parabolic equation for the propagation of sound waves. The solution to this parabolic equation can then be approximated using the Parabolic Equation Method, providing a numerical solution to the problem of sound propagation in a stratified ocean.

In the next section, we will discuss another numerical technique used in computational ocean acoustics: the Boundary Element Method.




### Subsection: 2.2b Normal Mode Methods

Normal Mode Methods (NMM) are a class of numerical techniques used in computational ocean acoustics. They are particularly useful for solving problems that involve the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, especially in the presence of complex geometries and boundary conditions.

#### The Basics of Normal Mode Methods

Normal Mode Methods are based on the concept of discretizing the domain into a finite number of simpler domains called grid cells. These cells are connected at specific points called nodes, forming a grid. The solution to the PDE is then approximated within each cell using a set of basis functions.

The solution to the PDE is represented as a linear combination of the basis functions, with the coefficients of the combination determined by minimizing the residual error. The residual error is the difference between the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the PDE.

#### Applications in Computational Ocean Acoustics

Normal Mode Methods are widely used in computational ocean acoustics to solve the equations that describe the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. These equations are often non-linear and complex, and NMM provides a way to approximate their solutions numerically.

For example, consider the wave equation, which describes the propagation of sound waves in a fluid medium:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $p$ is the pressure, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the speed of sound. Using a normal mode approximation, we can discretize this equation as:

$$
\min_{p_h} \sum_{e} \int_{V^e} \left( \frac{\partial p_h}{\partial t} - c^2 \frac{\partial p_h}{\partial x} \right)^2 dx
$$

where $p_h$ is the approximation of the pressure, $V^e$ is the volume of the element, and the sum is over all elements $e$. The solution to this minimization problem gives the approximation of the pressure at each node in the grid.

#### 2.2b.1 Advantages of Normal Mode Methods

Normal Mode Methods have several advantages over other numerical techniques. They are particularly well-suited to problems with complex geometries and boundary conditions, as they allow for the approximation of solutions within each grid cell. This makes them particularly useful for problems involving the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.

Furthermore, NMM provides a way to approximate the solutions of non-linear and complex equations, which are often difficult to solve analytically. This makes them a powerful tool in the field of computational ocean acoustics.

#### 2.2b.2 Limitations of Normal Mode Methods

Despite their advantages, Normal Mode Methods also have some limitations. They require a significant amount of computational resources, including memory and processing power. This can be a limiting factor for large-scale problems.

Furthermore, the accuracy of the NMM solution depends on the quality of the grid and the choice of basis functions. A poor choice of grid or basis functions can lead to inaccurate results.

Despite these limitations, Normal Mode Methods remain a powerful tool in the field of computational ocean acoustics, and their applications continue to expand as computational resources become more abundant and as researchers develop more sophisticated grid and basis function schemes.




### Subsection: 2.2c Ray Tracing Methods

Ray Tracing Methods (RTM) are another class of numerical techniques used in computational ocean acoustics. They are particularly useful for solving problems that involve the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, especially in the presence of complex geometries and boundary conditions.

#### The Basics of Ray Tracing Methods

Ray Tracing Methods are based on the concept of tracing rays from a source point in a given direction. These rays are traced until they hit a boundary or a reflecting surface, at which point they are reflected or refracted according to the laws of reflection and refraction. The process is repeated for each ray, and the results are combined to form an image of the scene.

The basic steps of the Ray Tracing Method are as follows:

1. Define the source point and the direction of the rays.
2. Trace the rays until they hit a boundary or a reflecting surface.
3. Reflect or refract the rays according to the laws of reflection and refraction.
4. Repeat the process for each ray.
5. Combine the results to form an image of the scene.

#### Applications in Computational Ocean Acoustics

Ray Tracing Methods are widely used in computational ocean acoustics to solve the equations that describe the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. These equations are often non-linear and complex, and RTM provides a way to approximate their solutions numerically.

For example, consider the wave equation, which describes the propagation of sound waves in a fluid medium:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $p$ is the pressure, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the speed of sound. Using a ray tracing approximation, we can solve this equation by tracing rays from a source point in a given direction, and computing the pressure at each point where the rays hit a boundary or a reflecting surface.

#### 2.2c.1 Advantages and Limitations of Ray Tracing Methods

One of the main advantages of Ray Tracing Methods is their ability to handle complex geometries and boundary conditions. This makes them particularly useful for solving problems in computational ocean acoustics, where the ocean floor, the water surface, and the boundaries of underwater structures can have complex shapes.

However, Ray Tracing Methods also have some limitations. They can be computationally intensive, especially for large-scale problems. They also require a good understanding of the physical properties of the medium, such as the speed of sound and the laws of reflection and refraction, in order to set up the problem correctly.

Despite these limitations, Ray Tracing Methods remain a powerful tool in computational ocean acoustics, and their applications continue to expand as computational power increases and new techniques are developed.

The study of underwater sound propagation is a fascinating and complex field known as acoustical oceanography. This chapter will delve into the depths of sound in the ocean, exploring its behavior and impact on marine life and human activities.

Underwater sound propagation is a multifaceted topic, influenced by a variety of factors such as water density, temperature, salinity, and pressure. These factors can significantly alter the speed of sound in water, affecting how sound waves travel and interact with the ocean environment. 

The chapter will also explore the different types of sound sources in the ocean, from natural phenomena like ocean waves and marine life to human activities like shipping and military sonar.

It can also impact human activities such as shipping and offshore energy production.

In this chapter, we will explore the fascinating world of underwater sound propagation, shedding light on its complexities and implications. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or simply a curious reader, we hope that this chapter will provide you with a deeper understanding of the role of sound in the ocean.




### Section: 3.1 Reflection

Reflection is a fundamental concept in the study of underwater sound propagation. It refers to the process by which sound waves bounce off surfaces, changing their direction but not their speed. In this section, we will explore the principles of reflection, its effects on sound propagation, and its implications for acoustical oceanography.

#### 3.1a Specular Reflection

Specular reflection is a type of reflection that occurs when sound waves hit a smooth, flat surface. The sound waves bounce off the surface at the same angle at which they hit it, forming a mirror image. This is similar to the reflection of light in optics, hence the term "specular" which is derived from the Latin word "speculum" meaning "mirror".

The law of specular reflection can be mathematically represented as:

$$
\theta_i = \theta_r
$$

where $\theta_i$ is the angle of incidence (the angle between the incoming sound wave and the normal to the surface) and $\theta_r$ is the angle of reflection (the angle between the reflected sound wave and the normal to the surface). Both angles are measured in the same direction, usually positive in the direction of the incoming sound wave.

In the context of underwater sound propagation, specular reflection plays a crucial role in determining the path of sound waves. When sound waves encounter a smooth, flat surface, they can be reflected back into the water column, altering the direction of propagation. This can have significant implications for the distribution of sound in the ocean, affecting everything from the communication of marine organisms to the detection of submarines by sonar.

However, it's important to note that specular reflection is an idealized concept. In reality, few surfaces are perfectly smooth and flat, and sound waves can interact with these imperfections in complex ways. For example, a sound wave hitting a rough surface may be scattered in multiple directions, a phenomenon known as diffraction. Similarly, a sound wave hitting a curved surface may be bent, a phenomenon known as refraction. These effects can significantly alter the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, and understanding them requires a more advanced understanding of acoustics.

In the next section, we will explore these more complex phenomena, delving deeper into the fascinating world of underwater sound propagation.

#### 3.1b Diffuse Reflection

Diffuse reflection is another type of reflection that occurs when sound waves hit a rough surface. Unlike specular reflection, where the sound waves bounce off at a single angle, diffuse reflection causes the sound waves to scatter in multiple directions. This is due to the roughness of the surface, which causes the sound waves to interact with the surface in different ways at different points, leading to a variety of reflection angles.

The law of diffuse reflection can be mathematically represented as:

$$
\theta_i = \theta_r + \Delta\theta
$$

where $\theta_i$ is the angle of incidence, $\theta_r$ is the angle of reflection, and $\Delta\theta$ is the difference in angles between the incident and reflected sound waves. This difference in angles is a result of the roughness of the surface, which causes the sound waves to interact with the surface at different points and in different ways.

In the context of underwater sound propagation, diffuse reflection plays a crucial role in determining the distribution of sound in the ocean. When sound waves encounter a rough surface, they can be scattered in multiple directions, leading to a more complex propagation pattern. This can have significant implications for the communication of marine organisms, the detection of submarines by sonar, and the overall understanding of sound propagation in the ocean.

However, it's important to note that diffuse reflection, like specular reflection, is an idealized concept. In reality, few surfaces are perfectly rough, and sound waves can interact with these imperfections in complex ways. For example, a sound wave hitting a smooth area of a rough surface may be reflected in a specular manner, while a sound wave hitting a rough area may be scattered in multiple directions. These complex interactions can significantly alter the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, and understanding them requires a more advanced understanding of acoustics.

In the next section, we will explore these more complex phenomena, delving deeper into the fascinating world of underwater sound propagation.

#### 3.1c Reflection Coefficient

The reflection coefficient is a fundamental concept in the study of underwater sound propagation. It is a measure of the proportion of sound waves that are reflected by a surface, compared to the total number of sound waves incident on the surface. The reflection coefficient is a complex number, and its magnitude represents the power reflected by the surface, while its phase represents the phase shift of the reflected wave.

The reflection coefficient, $R$, can be mathematically represented as:

$$
R = \frac{A_r}{A_i}e^{i\Delta\phi}
$$

where $A_r$ is the amplitude of the reflected wave, $A_i$ is the amplitude of the incident wave, and $\Delta\phi$ is the phase difference between the incident and reflected waves. The phase difference is a result of the change in direction of the sound wave due to reflection.

The reflection coefficient is a crucial parameter in the study of underwater sound propagation. It determines the amount of sound energy that is reflected back into the water column, and thus influences the distribution of sound in the ocean. For example, a surface with a high reflection coefficient (near 1) will reflect most of the incident sound waves, while a surface with a low reflection coefficient (near 0) will absorb most of the incident sound waves.

In the context of acoustical oceanography, the reflection coefficient is particularly important for understanding the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. The reflection coefficient can vary significantly depending on the properties of the surface, such as its roughness and material composition. For example, smooth, dense surfaces like metal or glass tend to have high reflection coefficients, while rough, porous surfaces like wood or fabric tend to have low reflection coefficients.

However, it's important to note that the reflection coefficient is an idealized concept. In reality, few surfaces are perfectly smooth or perfectly rough, and sound waves can interact with these imperfections in complex ways. For example, a sound wave hitting a rough surface may be scattered in multiple directions, leading to a complex reflection pattern that cannot be fully captured by a single reflection coefficient. Similarly, a sound wave hitting a smooth surface may be partially absorbed, leading to a complex transmission pattern that cannot be fully captured by a single transmission coefficient.

In the next section, we will explore these more complex phenomena, delving deeper into the fascinating world of underwater sound propagation.

#### 3.1d Reflection Loss

Reflection loss is another crucial concept in the study of underwater sound propagation. It is a measure of the amount of sound energy that is lost due to reflection when a sound wave hits a surface. The reflection loss is a function of the reflection coefficient, and it is defined as the difference between the incident sound power and the reflected sound power.

The reflection loss, $L_r$, can be mathematically represented as:

$$
L_r = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{P_i}{P_r}\right)
$$

where $P_i$ is the power of the incident wave and $P_r$ is the power of the reflected wave. The reflection loss is expressed in decibels (dB), and it represents the power loss due to reflection.

The reflection loss is a critical parameter in the study of underwater sound propagation. It determines the amount of sound energy that is lost due to reflection, and thus influences the distribution of sound in the ocean. For example, a surface with a high reflection loss (near 0 dB) will absorb most of the incident sound waves, while a surface with a low reflection loss (near 10 dB) will reflect most of the incident sound waves.

In the context of acoustical oceanography, the reflection loss is particularly important for understanding the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. The reflection loss can vary significantly depending on the properties of the surface, such as its roughness and material composition. For example, rough, porous surfaces like wood or fabric tend to have high reflection losses, while smooth, dense surfaces like metal or glass tend to have low reflection losses.

However, it's important to note that the reflection loss is an idealized concept. In reality, few surfaces are perfectly smooth or perfectly rough, and sound waves can interact with these imperfections in complex ways. For example, a sound wave hitting a rough surface may be scattered in multiple directions, leading to a complex reflection pattern that cannot be fully captured by a single reflection loss. Similarly, a sound wave hitting a smooth surface may be partially absorbed, leading to a complex transmission pattern that cannot be fully captured by a single transmission loss.

In the next section, we will explore these more complex phenomena, delving deeper into the fascinating world of underwater sound propagation.

#### 3.1e Reflection Measurement Techniques

The measurement of reflection in underwater sound propagation is a critical aspect of acoustical oceanography. It allows us to understand the behavior of sound waves as they interact with different surfaces in the ocean. This section will explore some of the techniques used to measure reflection.

##### Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR)

Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR) is a technique used to measure the reflection coefficient of a surface. It involves sending a short pulse of sound into the water and measuring the time it takes for the pulse to return. The time delay is then used to calculate the reflection coefficient. This technique is particularly useful for measuring the reflection coefficient of surfaces that are difficult to access, such as the ocean floor.

The TDR technique can be mathematically represented as:

$$
R = \frac{T_r - T_i}{T_i}
$$

where $T_r$ is the time delay of the reflected pulse and $T_i$ is the time delay of the incident pulse. The time delay is measured in nanoseconds (ns), and the reflection coefficient is expressed as a percentage.

##### Frequency-Domain Reflectometry (FDR)

Frequency-Domain Reflectometry (FDR) is another technique used to measure the reflection coefficient of a surface. It involves sending a continuous wave of sound into the water and measuring the amplitude of the reflected wave at different frequencies. The amplitude of the reflected wave is then used to calculate the reflection coefficient. This technique is particularly useful for measuring the reflection coefficient of surfaces that are difficult to access, such as the ocean floor.

The FDR technique can be mathematically represented as:

$$
R = \frac{A_r}{A_i}e^{i\Delta\phi}
$$

where $A_r$ is the amplitude of the reflected wave, $A_i$ is the amplitude of the incident wave, and $\Delta\phi$ is the phase difference between the incident and reflected waves. The phase difference is a result of the change in direction of the sound wave due to reflection.

Both TDR and FDR techniques are crucial for understanding the reflection properties of surfaces in the ocean. They allow us to quantify the amount of sound energy that is lost due to reflection, and thus influence the distribution of sound in the ocean. However, it's important to note that these techniques are idealized concepts, and in reality, few surfaces are perfectly smooth or perfectly rough, and sound waves can interact with these imperfections in complex ways.

#### 3.1f Reflection Applications

The study of reflection in underwater sound propagation has a wide range of applications in acoustical oceanography. This section will explore some of these applications, focusing on how the principles of reflection are used in various fields.

##### Sonar Systems

Sonar systems, which use sound waves to detect objects underwater, rely heavily on the principles of reflection. The sonar system emits a sound wave into the water, and the time it takes for the wave to return is used to determine the distance to the object. The reflection coefficient of the surface of the object is also important, as it affects the strength of the returned signal. By understanding the reflection properties of different surfaces, engineers can design more effective sonar systems.

##### Underwater Imaging

Underwater imaging techniques, such as side-scan sonar and synthetic aperture sonar, also rely on the principles of reflection. These techniques use sound waves to create images of the ocean floor or other surfaces. The reflection coefficient of the surface is used to determine the strength of the returned signal, which is then used to create the image. By understanding the reflection properties of different surfaces, researchers can improve the quality of these images.

##### Oceanographic Research

In oceanographic research, the study of reflection is used to understand the behavior of sound waves in the ocean. This includes studying the effects of different surfaces, such as the ocean floor or the surface of a ship, on the propagation of sound. By measuring the reflection coefficient of these surfaces, researchers can gain insights into the complex processes that govern underwater sound propagation.

##### Underwater Acoustics

Underwater acoustics, the study of sound in the ocean, also relies heavily on the principles of reflection. This includes understanding the effects of different surfaces on the propagation of sound, as well as the effects of different frequencies of sound. By studying the reflection properties of surfaces at different frequencies, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the behavior of sound in the ocean.

In conclusion, the study of reflection in underwater sound propagation has a wide range of applications in acoustical oceanography. By understanding the principles of reflection, engineers and researchers can design more effective sonar systems, create higher quality underwater images, and gain a deeper understanding of the behavior of sound in the ocean.




#### 3.1b Rough Surface Reflection

Rough surface reflection is a complex phenomenon that occurs when sound waves hit a surface that is not perfectly smooth or flat. Unlike specular reflection, where the sound waves bounce off at the same angle, rough surface reflection can cause the sound waves to scatter in multiple directions. This scattering can be described by the reflection coefficient, which is a measure of the proportion of the incident sound wave that is reflected by the surface.

The reflection coefficient, denoted by $R(\theta_i)$, is a function of the angle of incidence $\theta_i$. It can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
R(\theta_i) = \left|\frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_2 + Z_1}\right|^2
$$

where $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are the acoustic impedances of the two media (water and air, for example) that the sound wave is crossing. The absolute value in the equation ensures that the reflection coefficient is always positive.

The reflection coefficient is a complex quantity, and its magnitude and phase can provide valuable insights into the properties of the surface. For example, a surface with a high reflection coefficient (close to 1) is considered to be highly reflective, while a surface with a low reflection coefficient (close to 0) is considered to be highly absorptive.

In the context of underwater sound propagation, rough surface reflection can have significant implications. For instance, it can cause sound waves to scatter in multiple directions, reducing the intensity of the sound in any one direction. This can affect the range and directionality of sound propagation, with implications for communication and detection in the ocean.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of diffraction, another important phenomenon in underwater sound propagation.

#### 3.1c Reflection Measurements

Reflection measurements are a crucial part of understanding the behavior of sound waves in the ocean. These measurements provide direct information about the properties of the surfaces that sound waves encounter, such as their roughness and impedance. 

Reflection measurements can be performed using a variety of techniques, including the use of acoustic reflectors and the analysis of reflected sound waves. One such technique is the use of the MARS (Multi-channel Acoustic Reflecting Sphere) system, which was developed by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). The MARS system uses a series of acoustic reflectors to measure the reflection coefficient of a surface, providing valuable information about the surface's properties.

The MARS system operates by emitting a series of acoustic pulses into the water. These pulses are then reflected off the surface and received by the acoustic reflectors. The time delay and intensity of the reflected pulses are measured, and this information is used to calculate the reflection coefficient.

The MARS system can be used to measure the reflection coefficient of a surface over a wide range of frequencies, providing a comprehensive understanding of the surface's properties. This is particularly useful in the context of underwater sound propagation, where the properties of surfaces can vary significantly with frequency.

In addition to the MARS system, there are a number of other techniques that can be used to measure the reflection coefficient of a surface. These include the use of acoustic imaging systems, such as the Acoustic Thruster Imaging System (ATIS), and the analysis of the Doppler shift of reflected sound waves.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of diffraction, another important phenomenon in underwater sound propagation.

#### 3.1d Reflection Imaging

Reflection imaging is a powerful technique used in acoustical oceanography to visualize the properties of surfaces in the ocean. This technique is particularly useful in understanding the behavior of sound waves as they interact with these surfaces.

Reflection imaging is based on the principle of reflection, where sound waves bounce off surfaces and can be detected and analyzed. The reflected sound waves carry information about the properties of the surface, such as its roughness and impedance. By analyzing these reflected waves, we can create an image of the surface, providing valuable insights into its properties.

One of the most common techniques for reflection imaging is the use of acoustic imaging systems, such as the Acoustic Thruster Imaging System (ATIS). The ATIS uses a series of acoustic transducers to emit sound waves into the water. These waves are then reflected off the surface and received by the transducers. The time delay and intensity of the reflected waves are measured, and this information is used to create an image of the surface.

The ATIS can be used to image surfaces over a wide range of frequencies, providing a comprehensive understanding of the surface's properties. This is particularly useful in the context of underwater sound propagation, where the properties of surfaces can vary significantly with frequency.

Another technique for reflection imaging is the use of the MARS (Multi-channel Acoustic Reflecting Sphere) system. The MARS system, developed by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), uses a series of acoustic reflectors to measure the reflection coefficient of a surface.

In addition to these techniques, there are a number of other methods for reflection imaging, including the use of acoustic imaging systems and the analysis of the Doppler shift of reflected sound waves. These techniques provide a powerful tool for studying the properties of surfaces in the ocean, and for understanding the behavior of sound waves as they interact with these surfaces.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of diffraction, another important phenomenon in underwater sound propagation.

#### 3.1e Reflection Modeling

Reflection modeling is a crucial aspect of acoustical oceanography, allowing us to predict and understand the behavior of sound waves as they interact with surfaces in the ocean. This modeling is based on the principles of reflection, where sound waves bounce off surfaces and can be detected and analyzed.

One of the most common techniques for reflection modeling is the use of the Image Method. This method is based on the principle of superposition, which states that the total field at any point in space is the sum of the individual fields due to each source. In the context of reflection modeling, the Image Method allows us to calculate the reflected field due to a surface by considering the individual reflections from each point on the surface.

The Image Method can be used to model the reflection of sound waves from surfaces over a wide range of frequencies, providing a comprehensive understanding of the surface's properties. This is particularly useful in the context of underwater sound propagation, where the properties of surfaces can vary significantly with frequency.

Another technique for reflection modeling is the use of the Boundary Element Method (BEM). The BEM is a numerical method for solving boundary value problems, such as the reflection of sound waves from surfaces. The BEM is particularly useful for modeling the reflection of sound waves from complex surfaces, such as those found in the ocean.

The BEM is based on the principle of the boundary element, which is a mathematical representation of a surface. The boundary element is defined by a set of basis functions, which are used to represent the surface. The reflection of sound waves from the surface is then calculated by integrating the product of the boundary element and the sound field over the surface.

In addition to these techniques, there are a number of other methods for reflection modeling, including the use of the Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Method of Moments (MoM). These methods provide a powerful tool for predicting and understanding the behavior of sound waves as they interact with surfaces in the ocean.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of diffraction, another important phenomenon in underwater sound propagation.

#### 3.1f Reflection Applications

Reflection modeling has a wide range of applications in acoustical oceanography. These applications span from understanding the behavior of sound waves in the ocean to predicting the effects of noise pollution on marine life. In this section, we will explore some of these applications in more detail.

##### Underwater Acoustics

One of the primary applications of reflection modeling is in the field of underwater acoustics. Underwater acoustics is concerned with the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, and understanding the reflection of these waves from surfaces is crucial for predicting their behavior.

For example, consider the problem of predicting the propagation of a sound wave in the ocean. The sound wave will encounter a variety of surfaces, such as the ocean floor, the water surface, and the hulls of ships. By using reflection modeling techniques, we can predict how these surfaces will reflect the sound wave, and thus predict the overall propagation of the sound wave in the ocean.

##### Noise Pollution

Another important application of reflection modeling is in the study of noise pollution in the ocean. Noise pollution is a significant environmental issue, with sources ranging from military sonar to commercial shipping. Understanding the reflection of noise from surfaces is crucial for predicting its effects on marine life.

For instance, consider the problem of predicting the effects of noise pollution on marine mammals. Marine mammals rely on sound for communication and navigation, and excessive noise can disrupt these processes. By using reflection modeling techniques, we can predict how noise will be reflected from surfaces in the ocean, and thus predict its effects on marine mammals.

##### Sonar Systems

Reflection modeling also has applications in the design and analysis of sonar systems. Sonar systems use sound waves to detect objects in the ocean, and understanding the reflection of these waves from surfaces is crucial for their operation.

For example, consider the problem of designing a sonar system for detecting submarines. The sonar system must be able to detect the reflection of sound waves from the surface of the submarine. By using reflection modeling techniques, we can predict how these reflections will behave, and thus design a more effective sonar system.

In conclusion, reflection modeling is a powerful tool in acoustical oceanography, with applications ranging from understanding the behavior of sound waves in the ocean to predicting the effects of noise pollution on marine life. By using techniques such as the Image Method and the Boundary Element Method, we can predict the reflection of sound waves from surfaces, and thus gain a deeper understanding of the complex world of underwater sound.




#### 3.1c Bottom Reflection

Bottom reflection is a critical aspect of underwater sound propagation. It refers to the reflection of sound waves from the ocean floor. The ocean floor is not a smooth, uniform surface, and its properties can significantly affect the propagation of sound waves.

The reflection coefficient for bottom reflection, denoted by $R_b(\theta_i)$, is a function of the angle of incidence $\theta_i$ and the properties of the ocean floor. It can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
R_b(\theta_i) = \left|\frac{Z_b - Z_w}{Z_b + Z_w}\right|^2
$$

where $Z_b$ and $Z_w$ are the acoustic impedances of the bottom and water, respectively. The absolute value in the equation ensures that the reflection coefficient is always positive.

The reflection coefficient for bottom reflection can vary significantly depending on the properties of the ocean floor. For example, a hard, rocky bottom will have a high reflection coefficient, while a soft, muddy bottom will have a low reflection coefficient.

Bottom reflection can have significant implications for underwater sound propagation. For instance, it can cause sound waves to scatter in multiple directions, reducing the intensity of the sound in any one direction. This can affect the range and directionality of sound propagation, with implications for communication and detection in the ocean.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of diffraction, another important phenomenon in underwater sound propagation.

#### 3.1d Reflection Applications

Reflection plays a crucial role in various applications in acoustical oceanography. Understanding the principles of reflection, including specular and rough surface reflection, is essential for predicting the behavior of sound waves in the ocean. This knowledge can be applied in a variety of fields, including marine navigation, underwater communication, and oceanographic research.

##### Marine Navigation

In marine navigation, the reflection of sound waves is used to determine the location of objects in the water. Sonar, for instance, uses sound waves to detect objects in the water. The sound waves are emitted from a transducer and then bounce off objects in the water. The time it takes for the sound waves to return to the transducer is used to determine the distance to the object. The reflection of sound waves is also used in radar systems for ship navigation.

##### Underwater Communication

Underwater communication is another important application of reflection. Sound waves can travel long distances in water, making them ideal for communication in the ocean. However, the propagation of sound waves in water is affected by various factors, including reflection. Understanding the principles of reflection is therefore crucial for designing effective underwater communication systems.

##### Oceanographic Research

In oceanographic research, reflection is used to study the properties of the ocean floor. By measuring the reflection of sound waves from the ocean floor, scientists can determine the type of material on the ocean floor, whether it is hard or soft, and how it affects the propagation of sound waves. This information can be used to study the geology of the ocean floor and to understand the effects of ocean currents and tides on the ocean floor.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of diffraction, another important phenomenon in underwater sound propagation.

#### 3.1e Reflection Analysis

Reflection analysis is a crucial aspect of acoustical oceanography. It involves the study of the reflection of sound waves from various surfaces in the ocean. This analysis is essential for understanding the behavior of sound waves in the ocean and for predicting their propagation.

##### Reflection Coefficient

The reflection coefficient, denoted as $R(\theta_i)$, is a key parameter in reflection analysis. It is defined as the ratio of the reflected wave amplitude to the incident wave amplitude. The reflection coefficient is a complex quantity and is a function of the incident angle $\theta_i$. It can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
R(\theta_i) = \left|\frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_2 + Z_1}\right|^2
$$

where $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are the acoustic impedances of the two media (water and air, for example) that the sound wave is crossing. The absolute value in the equation ensures that the reflection coefficient is always positive.

##### Specular Reflection

Specular reflection occurs when sound waves bounce off a smooth surface at a fixed angle. The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. This law can be used to predict the behavior of sound waves in the ocean, especially in shallow water where the ocean floor is relatively smooth.

##### Rough Surface Reflection

Rough surface reflection occurs when sound waves hit a surface that is not perfectly smooth or flat. Unlike specular reflection, where the sound waves bounce off at the same angle, rough surface reflection can cause the sound waves to scatter in multiple directions. This scattering can be described by the reflection coefficient, which is a measure of the proportion of the incident sound wave that is reflected by the surface.

##### Bottom Reflection

Bottom reflection is a critical aspect of underwater sound propagation. It refers to the reflection of sound waves from the ocean floor. The properties of the ocean floor, such as its hardness and smoothness, can significantly affect the propagation of sound waves. The reflection coefficient for bottom reflection, denoted by $R_b(\theta_i)$, is a function of the angle of incidence $\theta_i$ and the properties of the ocean floor. It can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
R_b(\theta_i) = \left|\frac{Z_b - Z_w}{Z_b + Z_w}\right|^2
$$

where $Z_b$ and $Z_w$ are the acoustic impedances of the bottom and water, respectively. The absolute value in the equation ensures that the reflection coefficient is always positive.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of diffraction, another important phenomenon in underwater sound propagation.

#### 3.1f Reflection Conclusion

This phenomenon plays a crucial role in the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, influencing their direction, intensity, and quality.

We have also discussed the concept of reflection coefficient, a key parameter that describes the proportion of the incident sound wave that is reflected by a surface. This coefficient is a complex quantity and is a function of the incident angle and the properties of the surface. We have seen how it can be calculated using the equation $R(\theta_i) = \left|\frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_2 + Z_1}\right|^2$, where $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are the acoustic impedances of the two media that the sound wave is crossing.

In conclusion, understanding the principles of reflection is crucial for predicting the behavior of sound waves in the ocean. It is a fundamental concept in acoustical oceanography, with wide-ranging applications in marine navigation, underwater communication, and oceanographic research.




#### 3.2a Snell's Law and Sound Speed Gradients

Snell's Law is a fundamental principle in acoustics that describes the behavior of sound waves at the interface of two different media. It is named after the Dutch mathematician Willebrord Snellius, who first formulated the law in the 17th century. Snell's Law is a direct consequence of the conservation of energy and the continuity of the wavefront across the interface.

The law can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
n_1 \sin(\theta_1) = n_2 \sin(\theta_2)
$$

where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the refractive indices of the two media, and $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively. The refractive index is a measure of how much a medium slows down the speed of sound. It is inversely proportional to the speed of sound in the medium, and is given by the equation:

$$
n = \frac{c_0}{c}
$$

where $c_0$ is the speed of sound in a reference medium (typically air), and $c$ is the speed of sound in the medium of interest.

In the context of underwater sound propagation, Snell's Law is used to describe the refraction of sound waves at the interface between the water and the ocean floor. The refractive index of water is typically much lower than that of the ocean floor, which means that sound waves will be bent downwards as they pass from the water into the ocean floor. This phenomenon is crucial for understanding the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, and has important implications for various applications in acoustical oceanography.

#### 3.2b Refraction Applications

The principles of refraction, including Snell's Law, have a wide range of applications in acoustical oceanography. These applications span from basic research to practical applications in marine navigation, underwater communication, and oceanographic research.

##### Marine Navigation

In marine navigation, the principles of refraction are used to predict the behavior of sound waves in the ocean. For instance, the refraction of sound waves at the interface between the water and the ocean floor can be used to determine the depth of the ocean floor. This is particularly useful in deep-sea navigation, where traditional methods of depth measurement, such as echo sounding, may not be effective.

##### Underwater Communication

In underwater communication, the principles of refraction are used to design and optimize communication systems. For example, the refraction of sound waves at the interface between the water and the ocean floor can be used to control the direction of sound propagation. This can be particularly useful in situations where communication needs to be restricted to a specific area, such as in military operations.

##### Oceanographic Research

In oceanographic research, the principles of refraction are used to study the properties of the ocean floor. For instance, the refraction of sound waves at the interface between the water and the ocean floor can be used to determine the elastic properties of the ocean floor. This can provide valuable insights into the geological structure of the ocean floor, and can help to answer important questions about the evolution of the ocean.

In conclusion, the principles of refraction, including Snell's Law, play a crucial role in acoustical oceanography. They provide a fundamental understanding of the behavior of sound waves in the ocean, and have important implications for various applications in marine navigation, underwater communication, and oceanographic research.

#### 3.2c Refraction Challenges

Despite the wide range of applications of refraction in acoustical oceanography, there are several challenges that need to be addressed. These challenges arise from the complex nature of the ocean environment and the inherent uncertainties in the measurements and models used to describe it.

##### Uncertainty in Sound Speed Profiles

One of the main challenges in refraction is the uncertainty in sound speed profiles. The speed of sound in water is influenced by a variety of factors, including temperature, salinity, and pressure. However, these factors are not uniformly distributed in the ocean, and their effects on sound speed can vary significantly. This can lead to significant uncertainties in the refraction of sound waves at the interface between the water and the ocean floor.

##### Complexity of the Ocean Floor

Another challenge in refraction is the complexity of the ocean floor. The ocean floor is not a uniform, smooth surface, but rather a complex, heterogeneous environment. This complexity can lead to significant variations in the refraction of sound waves at the interface between the water and the ocean floor. This can make it difficult to accurately predict the behavior of sound waves in the ocean.

##### Limitations of Current Models

Finally, there are limitations in the current models used to describe the refraction of sound waves in the ocean. These models are based on simplifying assumptions and approximations, which can lead to significant discrepancies between the predicted and actual behavior of sound waves in the ocean. This can limit the effectiveness of refraction in various applications in acoustical oceanography.

Despite these challenges, ongoing research and advancements in technology continue to improve our understanding of refraction and its applications in acoustical oceanography. For instance, advancements in acoustic tomography and other imaging techniques are providing more detailed and accurate measurements of sound speed profiles in the ocean. Similarly, advancements in computational modeling and simulation are allowing for more sophisticated and accurate predictions of the behavior of sound waves in the ocean.

In conclusion, while there are several challenges in refraction, ongoing research and advancements in technology continue to improve our understanding and ability to apply refraction in acoustical oceanography.

#### 3.2d Refraction Solutions

Despite the challenges associated with refraction in acoustical oceanography, several solutions have been developed to address these issues. These solutions leverage advancements in technology and modeling techniques to improve the accuracy and reliability of refraction.

##### Advanced Acoustic Tomography

Advanced acoustic tomography techniques, such as the MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Classification) algorithm, have been developed to improve the accuracy of sound speed profiles. The MUSIC algorithm assumes that a signal vector, $\mathbf{x}$, consists of $p$ complex exponentials, whose frequencies $\omega$ are unknown, in the presence of Gaussian white noise, $\mathbf{n}$. The signal vector $\mathbf{x}$ is represented as a linear combination of steering vectors $\mathbf{a}(\omega)$, and the amplitude vector $\mathbf{s}$ is estimated from the autocorrelation matrix $\mathbf{R}_x$. This approach allows for the estimation of the frequency content of the signal or autocorrelation matrix, providing a more accurate representation of the sound speed profile.

##### Advanced Imaging Techniques

Advanced imaging techniques, such as seismic interferometry, have been developed to improve the accuracy of sound speed profiles. These techniques use the interference patterns of sound waves to estimate the sound speed profile. By combining these techniques with acoustic tomography, a more comprehensive and accurate representation of the sound speed profile can be obtained.

##### Advanced Computational Modeling

Advanced computational modeling techniques, such as the finite element method, have been developed to improve the accuracy of refraction predictions. These techniques allow for the inclusion of more complex and detailed models of the ocean floor, leading to more accurate predictions of the refraction of sound waves at the interface between the water and the ocean floor.

##### Advanced Signal Processing Techniques

Advanced signal processing techniques, such as the least-squares spectral analysis (LSSA), have been developed to improve the accuracy of refraction predictions. These techniques use the least-squares method to estimate the parameters of a signal model, providing a more accurate representation of the refraction of sound waves at the interface between the water and the ocean floor.

In conclusion, while there are several challenges in refraction, ongoing research and advancements in technology continue to improve the accuracy and reliability of refraction in acoustical oceanography. These solutions provide a comprehensive and accurate representation of the sound speed profile, leading to more accurate predictions of the refraction of sound waves at the interface between the water and the ocean floor.




#### 3.2b Bent Ray Paths and Sound Bending

The principles of refraction, including Snell's Law, are also used to understand the bending of sound waves in the ocean. This phenomenon, known as sound bending, is a crucial aspect of underwater sound propagation.

Sound bending occurs when sound waves encounter a boundary between two different media, such as water and the ocean floor. According to Snell's Law, the angle of incidence is related to the angle of refraction by the equation:

$$
n_1 \sin(\theta_1) = n_2 \sin(\theta_2)
$$

In the case of sound waves propagating in the ocean, the refractive index of water is typically much lower than that of the ocean floor. This means that when sound waves encounter the ocean floor, they will be bent downwards due to the change in refractive index.

The bending of sound waves can have significant implications for various applications in acoustical oceanography. For instance, in underwater communication, the bending of sound waves can affect the range and direction of communication. In marine navigation, the bending of sound waves can impact the accuracy of sonar measurements. In oceanographic research, the bending of sound waves can influence the propagation of acoustic signals and the detection of marine life.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical modeling of sound bending and its implications for underwater sound propagation.

#### 3.2c Refraction and Sound Bending Examples

To further illustrate the principles of refraction and sound bending, let's consider a few examples.

##### Example 1: Sound Bending at the Ocean Floor

Imagine a sound wave propagating in the ocean, approaching the ocean floor. According to Snell's Law, the sound wave will be bent downwards due to the change in refractive index. The amount of bending will depend on the difference in refractive indices between the water and the ocean floor.

Let's assume the refractive index of water is $n_1 = 1.33$ and the refractive index of the ocean floor is $n_2 = 1.5$. If the sound wave is incident at an angle of $\theta_1 = 30^\circ$ from the normal to the ocean floor, the angle of refraction $\theta_2$ can be calculated using Snell's Law:

$$
n_1 \sin(\theta_1) = n_2 \sin(\theta_2)
$$

Solving this equation, we find that the sound wave will be bent downwards at an angle of $\theta_2 = 26.57^\circ$ from the normal to the ocean floor.

##### Example 2: Sound Bending in a Layered Ocean

In a layered ocean, where the refractive index changes gradually with depth, the bending of sound waves can be more complex. The sound wave will be bent at each interface between different layers, and the total bending will be the sum of the individual bends.

Consider a sound wave propagating in a two-layer ocean, with a refractive index of $n_1 = 1.33$ in the upper layer and $n_2 = 1.5$ in the lower layer. If the sound wave is incident at an angle of $\theta_1 = 30^\circ$ from the normal to the interface between the two layers, the total angle of refraction $\theta_2$ can be calculated by summing the individual bends at each interface.

The bending at the upper interface can be calculated as in Example 1, and the bending at the lower interface can be calculated in the same way, but with the roles of $n_1$ and $n_2$ reversed. The total angle of refraction will be the sum of these two bends.

These examples illustrate the principles of refraction and sound bending in simple cases. In more complex situations, such as in a stratified ocean with multiple layers, the bending of sound waves can be even more complex and will require more advanced mathematical techniques. In the next section, we will explore these techniques and their applications in acoustical oceanography.




#### 3.2c Ducting and Focusing Effects

In addition to refraction and sound bending, another important aspect of underwater sound propagation is the phenomenon of ducting and focusing. This occurs when sound waves are confined within a narrow region, causing them to focus and increase in intensity.

##### Ducting

Ducting occurs when sound waves are confined within a region of low acoustic impedance, such as a layer of water with a lower density than the surrounding water. This can happen, for example, in the ocean where there are layers of warm and cold water. The sound waves can travel along these layers, or ducts, with minimal loss of energy.

The mathematical description of ducting involves the concept of the Rayleigh duct, which is a theoretical model for sound propagation in a duct. The Rayleigh duct assumes that the duct is infinitely long and that the sound waves are plane waves. The equation for the Rayleigh duct is given by:

$$
P(x) = \frac{P_0}{2} \exp \left( \frac{i k_0 x}{\sinh(k_0 a)} \right) \exp \left( - \frac{k_0 x}{\sinh(k_0 a)} \right)
$$

where $P(x)$ is the pressure at position $x$, $P_0$ is the pressure at the entrance of the duct, $k_0$ is the wavenumber, and $a$ is the width of the duct.

##### Focusing

Focusing occurs when sound waves are converged by a lens or other focusing device. This can be used to increase the intensity of the sound waves, which can be useful in applications such as underwater communication and sonar.

The mathematical description of focusing involves the concept of the Fresnel lens, which is a common type of lens used in underwater acoustics. The Fresnel lens is designed to focus sound waves over a wide range of frequencies, making it useful for many applications. The equation for the Fresnel lens is given by:

$$
F(x) = \frac{1}{1 - \left( \frac{x}{f} \right)^2}
$$

where $F(x)$ is the focusing function, $x$ is the distance from the lens, and $f$ is the focal length of the lens.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of ducting and focusing for various applications in acoustical oceanography.




#### 3.3a Rayleigh Scattering

Rayleigh scattering is a fundamental phenomenon in acoustics that describes the elastic scattering of sound waves by small particles. This scattering is named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first derived the mathematical expression for the scattering of light by small particles in 1871. The Rayleigh scattering model is applicable when the particles are much smaller than the wavelength of the incident radiation, and the scattering angle is much smaller than 90 degrees.

The intensity "I" of the scattered radiation is given by the equation:

$$
I = \frac{I_0 R^2 \lambda^4 \sin^4(\theta/2)}{16 \pi^2 n^2 d^4}
$$

where "I<sub>0</sub>" is the light intensity before the interaction with the particle, "R" is the distance between the particle and the observer, "λ" is the wavelength of light under consideration, "n" is the refractive index of the particle, "d" is the diameter of the particle, and "θ" is the scattering angle.

It can be seen from the above equation that Rayleigh scattering is strongly dependent upon the size of the particle and the wavelengths. The intensity of the Rayleigh scattered radiation increases rapidly as the ratio of particle size to wavelength increases. Furthermore, the intensity of Rayleigh scattered radiation is identical in the forward and reverse directions.

The Rayleigh scattering model breaks down when the particle size becomes larger than around 10% of the wavelength of the incident radiation. In the case of particles with dimensions greater than this, Mie's scattering model can be used to find the intensity of the scattered radiation. The intensity of Mie scattered radiation is given by the summation of an infinite series of terms rather than by a simple mathematical expression. It can be shown, however, that scattering in this range of particle sizes differs from Rayleigh scattering in several respects: it is roughly independent of wavelength and it is larger in the forward direction than in the reverse direction. The greater the particle size, the more of the light is scattered in the forward direction.

The blue colour of the sky results from Rayleigh scattering, as the size of the gas particles in the atmosphere is much smaller than the wavelength of visible light. Rayleigh scattering is much greater for blue light than for other colours due to its shorter wavelength. As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the shorter blue wavelengths are scattered more than the longer red wavelengths, causing the sky to appear blue.

#### 3.3b Mie Scattering

Mie scattering, named after the Austrian physicist Christian Mie who first derived the mathematical expression for the scattering of light by large particles in 1908, is a phenomenon that describes the elastic scattering of sound waves by large particles. Unlike Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering is applicable when the particles are larger than the wavelength of the incident radiation, and the scattering angle can be larger than 90 degrees.

The intensity "I" of the scattered radiation in Mie scattering is given by the equation:

$$
I = \frac{I_0 R^2 \lambda^4 \sin^4(\theta/2)}{16 \pi^2 n^2 d^4} \sum_{l=1}^{\infty} (2l+1) \left( \frac{a d}{\lambda} \right)^l \exp \left( - \frac{a^2 d^2}{2} \right) P_l(\cos(\theta))
$$

where "I<sub>0</sub>" is the light intensity before the interaction with the particle, "R" is the distance between the particle and the observer, "λ" is the wavelength of light under consideration, "n" is the refractive index of the particle, "d" is the diameter of the particle, "θ" is the scattering angle, "a" is the size parameter defined as $a = \frac{2 \pi d}{\lambda}$, and "P_l" is the Legendre polynomial of degree "l".

Unlike Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering is not symmetric about the forward and reverse directions. The intensity of Mie scattered radiation is larger in the forward direction than in the reverse direction. The greater the particle size, the more of the light is scattered in the forward direction.

Mie scattering is responsible for the white colour of the sky. The size of the particles in the atmosphere is larger than the wavelength of visible light, and therefore Mie scattering is responsible for the scattering of light in all directions. This results in the white colour of the sky.

In the next section, we will explore the phenomenon of backscattering, which is a type of scattering that occurs when the scattered radiation is in the opposite direction of the incident radiation.

#### 3.3c Backscattering

Backscattering, also known as back scattering, is a type of scattering that occurs when the scattered radiation is in the opposite direction of the incident radiation. This phenomenon is particularly important in acoustics, as it can significantly affect the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.

The backscattering coefficient, denoted as $\sigma_b$, is a measure of the amount of sound energy scattered back in the direction of the source. It is defined as the ratio of the backscattered sound power to the incident sound power, and is typically expressed in decibels (dB). The backscattering coefficient can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
\sigma_b = \frac{P_{backscattered}}{P_{incident}}
$$

where $P_{backscattered}$ is the power of the backscattered sound and $P_{incident}$ is the power of the incident sound.

Backscattering can be caused by various factors, including the size and shape of the scattering particles, the wavelength of the incident radiation, and the angle of incidence. In the context of underwater sound propagation, backscattering can be caused by particles such as plankton, sediment, and bubbles.

The backscattering coefficient can vary significantly depending on the type of particles and the wavelength of the incident radiation. For example, backscattering is typically stronger at shorter wavelengths, which is why high-frequency sound waves are more likely to be backscattered than low-frequency sound waves.

Backscattering can have significant implications for the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. For instance, it can cause the formation of echoes, which can interfere with sonar signals and make it difficult to accurately determine the location of objects in the water. Furthermore, backscattering can cause the sound waves to be scattered in different directions, which can affect the range and direction of sound propagation.

In the next section, we will explore the phenomenon of scattering in more detail, focusing on the scattering of sound waves by large particles.

#### 3.3d Scattering Cross-Section

The scattering cross-section, denoted as $\sigma$, is another important parameter in the study of scattering. It is defined as the ratio of the scattered power to the incident power, and is typically expressed in square meters (m²). The scattering cross-section can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
\sigma = \frac{P_{scattered}}{P_{incident}}
$$

where $P_{scattered}$ is the power of the scattered sound and $P_{incident}$ is the power of the incident sound.

The scattering cross-section is a measure of the effective area of a scattering particle, or a group of particles, that is responsible for scattering the incident radiation. It is important to note that the scattering cross-section is not necessarily equal to the physical cross-section of the particle. For instance, a small particle can have a large scattering cross-section if it scatters the incident radiation in many directions.

The scattering cross-section can vary significantly depending on the type of particles and the wavelength of the incident radiation. For example, the scattering cross-section is typically larger at shorter wavelengths, which is why high-frequency sound waves are more likely to be scattered than low-frequency sound waves.

The scattering cross-section can have significant implications for the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. For instance, it can cause the formation of echoes, which can interfere with sonar signals and make it difficult to accurately determine the location of objects in the water. Furthermore, the scattering cross-section can cause the sound waves to be scattered in different directions, which can affect the range and direction of sound propagation.

In the next section, we will explore the phenomenon of scattering in more detail, focusing on the scattering of sound waves by large particles.

#### 3.3e Scattering Measurements

Scattering measurements are crucial in the study of underwater sound propagation. They provide direct information about the scattering properties of particles in the water, which can be used to estimate the scattering cross-section and backscattering coefficient. 

Scattering measurements can be performed using various techniques, including the use of acoustic scattering sensors. These sensors, such as the EdgeTech 2020 and 2030, are designed to measure the scattering of sound waves in the water. They operate by emitting a sound wave into the water and then measuring the intensity of the scattered wave. The measured intensity can then be used to calculate the scattering cross-section and backscattering coefficient.

Another technique for measuring scattering is the use of acoustic scattering tomography. This technique involves emitting a series of sound waves into the water and then measuring the intensity of the scattered waves. The measured intensities can then be used to create a 3D image of the scattering properties of the water.

Scattering measurements can also be performed using optical techniques. For instance, the Kullenberg scattering meter is a device that measures the scattering of light in the water. The measured scattering can then be used to estimate the scattering properties of the water.

It is important to note that scattering measurements can be affected by various factors, including the type of particles in the water, the wavelength of the incident radiation, and the angle of incidence. Therefore, it is crucial to perform multiple measurements under different conditions to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the scattering properties of the water.

In the next section, we will explore the phenomenon of scattering in more detail, focusing on the scattering of sound waves by large particles.

#### 3.3f Scattering Models

Scattering models are mathematical representations of the scattering process. They are used to predict the scattering properties of particles in the water, based on their size, shape, and material properties. 

One of the most commonly used scattering models is the Mie scattering model. This model is used to calculate the scattering of light by spherical particles. It is based on the Mie theory, which was first proposed by the German physicist Gustav Mie in 1908. The Mie theory provides a mathematical description of the scattering of light by spherical particles, taking into account the size of the particles, the wavelength of the incident light, and the refractive index of the particles.

The Mie scattering model is given by the following equation:

$$
\frac{dI}{d\Omega} = \frac{I_0}{k^2 r^2} \sum_{l=1}^{\infty} (2l+1) e^{i\delta_l} P_l(\cos\theta)
$$

where $I_0$ is the incident intensity, $k$ is the wave number, $r$ is the distance from the particle, $I$ is the scattered intensity, $\Omega$ is the solid angle, $l$ is the angular momentum quantum number, $\delta_l$ is the phase shift, $P_l$ is the Legendre polynomial, and $\theta$ is the scattering angle.

Another commonly used scattering model is the Rayleigh scattering model. This model is used to calculate the scattering of light by small particles, such as molecules and atoms. It is based on the Rayleigh theory, which was first proposed by the British physicist Lord Rayleigh in 1871. The Rayleigh theory provides a mathematical description of the scattering of light by small particles, taking into account the size of the particles, the wavelength of the incident light, and the refractive index of the particles.

The Rayleigh scattering model is given by the following equation:

$$
\frac{dI}{d\Omega} = \frac{I_0}{k^2 r^2} \sum_{l=1}^{\infty} (2l+1) e^{i\delta_l} P_l(\cos\theta)
$$

#### 3.3b Mie Scattering

Mie scattering, named after the Austrian physicist Christian Mie who first derived the mathematical expression for the scattering of light by large particles in 1908, is a phenomenon that describes the elastic scattering of sound waves by large particles. Unlike Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering is applicable when the particles are larger than the wavelength of the incident radiation, and the scattering angle can be greater than 90 degrees.

The intensity "I" of the scattered radiation in Mie scattering is given by the equation:

$$
I = \frac{I_0 R^2 \lambda^4 \sin^4(\theta/2)}{16 \pi^2 n^2 d^4} \sum_{l=1}^{\infty} (2l+1) \left(\frac{d}{\lambda}\right)^4 \left|\frac{m_l(d/\lambda)}{l(l+1)}\right|^2 P_l(\cos(\theta))
$$

where "I<sub>0</sub>" is the light intensity before the interaction with the particle, "R" is the distance between the particle and the observer, "λ" is the wavelength of light under consideration, "n" is the refractive index of the particle, "d" is the diameter of the particle, "θ" is the scattering angle, "m<sub>l</sub>" is the complex amplitude of the spherical harmonic of degree "l", and "P<sub>l</sub>" is the Legendre polynomial of degree "l".

Unlike Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering is not symmetric about the forward and reverse directions. The intensity of Mie scattered radiation is greater in the forward direction than in the reverse direction. The greater the particle size, the more of the light is scattered in the forward direction.

Mie scattering is also wavelength-dependent, unlike Rayleigh scattering. This means that the intensity of Mie scattered radiation varies with the wavelength of the incident radiation. This property is exploited in various applications, such as in the design of optical filters and in the study of atmospheric and oceanic properties.

In the context of acoustics, Mie scattering plays a crucial role in the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. The scattering of sound waves by large particles, such as plankton and marine mammals, can significantly affect the transmission of sound in the water. Understanding Mie scattering is therefore essential for accurately predicting the propagation of sound in the ocean.

#### 3.3c Scattering in the Ocean

Scattering in the ocean is a complex phenomenon that involves the interaction of sound waves with various particles and structures in the water. This interaction can significantly affect the propagation of sound waves, and understanding it is crucial for various applications, including sonar, underwater communication, and oceanographic research.

In the ocean, scattering can occur due to various reasons. One of the primary causes is the interaction of sound waves with particles, such as plankton, sediment, and bubbles. These particles can scatter sound waves in various directions, altering the path of the sound waves and reducing their intensity. The scattering of sound waves by these particles can be described using Mie scattering theory, as discussed in the previous section.

Another important cause of scattering in the ocean is the interaction of sound waves with the ocean floor and other structures. The ocean floor, with its irregular topography and varying properties, can scatter sound waves in various directions. This scattering can be particularly significant in shallow water, where the sound waves can interact with the ocean floor over long distances.

The scattering of sound waves in the ocean can also be influenced by the properties of the water itself. For instance, the salinity and temperature of the water can affect the speed of sound, which in turn can affect the scattering of sound waves. Similarly, the presence of dissolved gases, such as air and methane, can also affect the scattering of sound waves.

The scattering of sound waves in the ocean can be studied using various techniques, including field measurements and numerical simulations. Field measurements involve the deployment of instruments, such as hydrophones and transducers, in the ocean to directly measure the scattering of sound waves. Numerical simulations, on the other hand, involve the use of mathematical models to predict the scattering of sound waves in the ocean.

In conclusion, scattering in the ocean is a complex phenomenon that involves the interaction of sound waves with various particles, structures, and properties in the water. Understanding this phenomenon is crucial for various applications, and it can be studied using various techniques.

The absorption coefficient is typically denoted by the symbol $\alpha$, and it is defined as the fraction of sound energy that is absorbed per unit length of propagation.

The absorption coefficient is a function of the frequency of the sound wave, the temperature and salinity of the water, and the depth of the water column. It is typically measured in decibels per meter (dB/m).

The absorption coefficient can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
\alpha = \alpha_0 \cdot \left(\frac{f}{f_0}\right)^n \cdot \left(\frac{T}{T_0}\right)^m \cdot \left(\frac{S}{S_0}\right)^l
$$

The absorption coefficient is a key parameter in the calculation of the sound speed in water, as it is used in the equation of state for sound in water. The equation of state for sound in water is given by:

$$

#### 3.4b Absorption in Water

The absorption of sound in water is a complex process that involves the interaction of sound waves with the molecules of the water. This interaction is primarily due to the viscosity of the water, which causes the sound waves to lose energy as they propagate through the medium.

#### 3.4d Scattering in Water

Scattering is another important phenomenon in underwater sound propagation. It refers to the redirection of sound waves from their original path due to interaction with particles in the water. These particles can be of various sizes and densities, and they can be suspended in the water due to turbulence or other physical processes.

The scattering of sound in water can be described by the Rayleigh scattering theory, which is based on the assumption that the particles are much smaller than the wavelength of the sound. The scattering cross-section, denoted by $\sigma$, is given by:

$$
\sigma = \frac{2 \pi r^4 \rho^2}{\lambda^4} \cdot \left(\frac{4 \pi}{\lambda r}\right)^4 \cdot \left(\frac{1 - \cos(\theta)}{\theta}\right)^2
$$

#### 3.4e Reflection and Refraction

Reflection and refraction are two fundamental processes that occur when sound waves encounter a boundary between two different media. These processes are crucial in understanding the propagation of sound in the ocean, as they can significantly alter the direction and intensity of sound waves.

Reflection occurs when a sound wave encounters a boundary and is bounced back into the original medium. The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence, denoted by $i$, is equal to the angle of reflection, denoted by $r$. This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
i = r
$$

where $i$ and $r$ are measured in radians and are positive if the sound wave is traveling in the positive $x$-direction.

Refraction, on the other hand, occurs when a sound wave passes from one medium to another and changes its direction. The law of refraction, also known as Snell's law, states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the inverse ratio of the sound speeds in the two media. This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
n_1 \cdot \sin(i) = n_2 \cdot \sin(r)
$$

where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the sound speeds in the first and second medium, respectively, and $i$ and $r$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.

These processes can be visualized using the concept of the ray diagram, which is a graphical representation of the propagation of sound waves. The ray diagram can be used to calculate the angles of incidence and refraction, and to determine whether a sound wave will be reflected or refracted when it encounters a boundary.

In the context of underwater sound propagation, these processes can be particularly important. For example, they can determine whether a sound wave will be able to penetrate a boundary layer, such as the thermocline or halocline, and how much of the sound energy will be lost due to reflection or refraction.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of the sound channel, which is a region of water where sound waves can propagate with minimal loss due to absorption and scattering.

#### 3.4f Boundary Layers

Boundary layers are regions of water where the properties of the water, such as its density and sound speed, change rapidly with depth. These layers can significantly affect the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.

The thermocline and halocline are two important examples of boundary layers. The thermocline is the layer where the temperature of the water changes rapidly with depth, and the halocline is the layer where the salinity of the water changes rapidly with depth.

The properties of the water in these layers can change rapidly enough that they can be considered as discontinuities in the water. This means that when a sound wave encounters one of these layers, it will be reflected or refracted. The amount of reflection or refraction will depend on the difference in properties between the layer and the water above or below it.

The thermocline and halocline can also affect the propagation of sound waves by altering the stratification of the water. Stratification refers to the layering of the water, with denser water sinking below less dense water. Changes in the stratification can affect the speed at which sound waves travel through the water, and can also cause sound waves to bend.

The effects of the thermocline and halocline on sound propagation can be modeled using the concept of the sound channel. A sound channel is a region of water where sound waves can propagate with minimal loss due to absorption and scattering. The thermocline and halocline can create barriers to sound propagation, which can limit the range of sound waves in the ocean.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept


#### 3.4b Attenuation Mechanisms

Attenuation is a critical concept in underwater sound propagation. It refers to the reduction in sound intensity as the sound wave propagates through the water. The attenuation of sound in water is primarily due to absorption and scattering.

Absorption is the process by which sound energy is converted into heat as the sound wave propagates through the water. This process is primarily due to the interaction of the sound wave with the molecules of the water. The absorption of sound in water is frequency-dependent, with higher frequencies being absorbed more than lower frequencies. This is due to the fact that higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and therefore interact more strongly with the molecules of the water.

The absorption of sound in water can be calculated using the equation:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \alpha \cdot \int_{0}^{z} c \cdot dz
$$

where $A$ is the attenuation, $\alpha$ is the absorption coefficient, $c$ is the sound speed, and $z$ is the depth.

Scattering is the process by which sound energy is redirected from its original direction as the sound wave propagates through the water. This process is primarily due to the interaction of the sound wave with particles in the water, such as plankton, bubbles, and sediment. The scattering of sound in water is also frequency-dependent, with higher frequencies being scattered more than lower frequencies. This is due to the fact that higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and therefore interact more strongly with the particles in the water.

The scattering of sound in water can be calculated using the equation:

$$
S = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \beta \cdot \int_{0}^{z} c \cdot dz
$$

where $S$ is the scattering, $\beta$ is the scattering coefficient, $c$ is the sound speed, and $z$ is the depth.

The total attenuation of sound in water is the sum of the absorption and scattering attenuations. This can be calculated using the equation:

$$
A_{total} = A + S
$$

where $A_{total}$ is the total attenuation.

In the next section, we will discuss the effects of these attenuation mechanisms on underwater sound propagation.

#### 3.4c Absorption and Scattering Models

In the previous section, we discussed the basic concepts of absorption and scattering in underwater sound propagation. In this section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical models that describe these phenomena.

The absorption of sound in water can be modeled using the Kolsky basic model and modified model for attenuation and dispersion. The Kolsky basic model is given by:

$$
\alpha = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \omega \cdot \left(\frac{1}{\delta_1} + \frac{1}{\delta_2}\right)
$$

where $\alpha$ is the absorption coefficient, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$ are the phase velocities of the sound wave in the water.

The modified model for attenuation and dispersion is given by:

$$
\alpha = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \omega \cdot \left(\frac{1}{\delta_1} + \frac{1}{\delta_2}\right) + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \omega \cdot \left(\frac{1}{\delta_1} - \frac{1}{\delta_2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{\delta_1} + \frac{1}{\delta_2}\right)^{-1}
$$

The first term in this equation represents the absorption of sound, while the second term represents the dispersion of sound.

The scattering of sound in water can be modeled using the non-radiative dielectric waveguide model. This model is given by:

$$
T_{o-}^{TE} = H \cdot cos\left(\frac{m \cdot \pi}{a} \cdot y\right) \cdot e^{jk_xo \cdot (x-w)}
$$

where $T_{o-}^{TE}$ is the transverse electric field, $H$ is the height of the waveguide, $m$ is the mode number, $a$ is the width of the waveguide, $y$ is the vertical coordinate, $k_xo$ is the wave number in the x-direction, $x$ is the horizontal coordinate, and $w$ is the width of the waveguide.

These models provide a mathematical framework for understanding the absorption and scattering of sound in water. However, it is important to note that these models are simplifications of the complex physical processes that occur in the ocean. Therefore, they should be used with caution and their results should be interpreted in the context of the assumptions and limitations of the models.

#### 3.4d Absorption and Scattering Measurements

In the previous section, we discussed the mathematical models that describe the absorption and scattering of sound in water. In this section, we will explore the practical aspects of measuring these phenomena in the ocean.

The absorption of sound in water can be measured using various techniques, including the use of acoustic tomography and the measurement of sound intensity. Acoustic tomography is a technique that uses the transmission of sound waves to create a picture of the ocean. This technique can be used to measure the absorption of sound in water over large areas.

The absorption of sound can also be measured directly by measuring the sound intensity. This can be done using a hydrophone, which is a device that can detect and measure sound in water. The sound intensity can be measured at different depths and frequencies to determine the absorption coefficient.

The scattering of sound in water can be measured using techniques such as backscattering and side scattering. Backscattering is the reflection of sound waves back in the direction from which they came. Side scattering is the deflection of sound waves to the side. These phenomena can be measured using a scatterometer, which is a device that can detect and measure the scattering of sound in water.

The scattering of sound can also be measured directly by measuring the sound intensity. This can be done using a hydrophone, which can detect and measure the sound intensity at different angles. The sound intensity can be measured at different depths and frequencies to determine the scattering coefficient.

It is important to note that these measurements are influenced by various factors, including the properties of the water, the presence of particles and bubbles, and the frequency of the sound. Therefore, it is crucial to take these factors into account when interpreting the results of these measurements.

In the next section, we will discuss the effects of absorption and scattering on underwater sound propagation.

#### 3.4e Absorption and Scattering Applications

One of the primary applications of absorption and scattering is in the field of acoustics. The absorption and scattering of sound in water play a significant role in the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. This knowledge is crucial in the design and operation of underwater acoustic devices, such as sonar and underwater microphones.

For instance, the absorption of sound in water can be used to estimate the depth of the ocean. This is done by measuring the sound intensity at different depths and frequencies. The absorption coefficient can then be used to estimate the depth of the ocean. This technique is particularly useful in deep ocean environments where other depth estimation methods may not be feasible.

The scattering of sound in water is also important in acoustics. It is used in the design of sonar systems, which are used to detect and locate objects underwater. The scattering of sound can be used to determine the direction and distance of objects underwater. This is done by measuring the backscattering and side scattering of sound waves.

In the field of telecommunications, absorption and scattering are used in the design of underwater communication systems. These systems use sound waves to transmit information underwater. The absorption and scattering of sound can affect the quality of the transmitted signal. Therefore, understanding these phenomena is crucial in the design and operation of these systems.

In addition to these applications, absorption and scattering are also used in oceanography. They are used to study the properties of the ocean, such as its depth, temperature, and salinity. This is done by measuring the absorption and scattering of sound waves in the ocean.

## Chapter 4: Reverberation

### Introduction

The ocean is a vast and complex environment, teeming with life and filled with sound. The study of this sound, known as acoustics, is a crucial aspect of oceanography. In this chapter, we delve into the fascinating world of reverberation, a key concept in underwater acoustics.

Reverberation is the reflection and redirection of sound waves in an enclosed space. In the context of the ocean, it refers to the reflection of sound waves off the seafloor, water column, and surface. This phenomenon plays a significant role in the propagation of sound in the ocean, influencing everything from the transmission of information to the detection of objects.

Understanding reverberation is not just about knowing how sound behaves in the ocean. It's about understanding the ocean itself. The ocean is not a perfect conductor of sound, nor is it a perfect reflector. It's a complex medium that absorbs, reflects, and redirects sound in intricate ways. By studying reverberation, we can gain insights into the physical properties of the ocean, such as its depth, composition, and temperature.

In this chapter, we will explore the principles of reverberation, its effects on sound propagation, and its applications in oceanography. We will also discuss the mathematical models used to describe reverberation, such as the impulse response and the reverberation time. These models, expressed in terms of the Schrödinger equation, provide a quantitative framework for understanding and predicting reverberation.

As we journey through this chapter, we will also touch upon the practical implications of reverberation. For instance, how does reverberation affect the detection of submarines and marine life? How can we use reverberation to map the seafloor? These are just some of the questions we will explore.

So, let's dive into the world of reverberation and discover the ocean's hidden acoustic landscape.




#### 3.4c Frequency and Depth Dependence

The absorption and scattering of sound in water are not constant across all frequencies and depths. The absorption and scattering coefficients, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, respectively, vary with frequency and depth. This variation is due to the physical properties of the water, such as its temperature, salinity, and density, which affect the interaction of sound waves with the water.

The absorption coefficient, $\alpha$, increases with frequency and depth. This is because higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and therefore interact more strongly with the molecules of the water, leading to increased absorption. Additionally, the absorption coefficient increases with depth due to the increasing pressure, which also increases the interaction between the sound wave and the water molecules.

The scattering coefficient, $\beta$, also increases with frequency and depth. This is because higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and therefore interact more strongly with the particles in the water, leading to increased scattering. Additionally, the scattering coefficient increases with depth due to the increasing concentration of particles in the water, such as plankton, bubbles, and sediment.

The variation of the absorption and scattering coefficients with frequency and depth can be described by the following equations:

$$
\alpha = \alpha_0 \cdot f^a \cdot e^{b \cdot z}
$$

$$
\beta = \beta_0 \cdot f^b \cdot e^{c \cdot z}
$$

where $\alpha_0$ and $\beta_0$ are the absorption and scattering coefficients at a reference frequency and depth, respectively, $f$ is the frequency, $a$ and $b$ are the frequency exponents, $z$ is the depth, and $b$ and $c$ are the depth exponents.

The frequency and depth dependence of the absorption and scattering coefficients have significant implications for underwater sound propagation. For example, it affects the range and direction of sound propagation, as well as the attenuation of sound with distance. Understanding these dependencies is crucial for predicting and modeling sound propagation in the ocean.

## Chapter 4: Underwater Acoustics




### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamental concepts of acoustical oceanography, including the generation and propagation of sound waves in the ocean. We have also discussed the various factors that affect the behavior of these waves, such as the properties of the water and the presence of obstacles. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of acoustic signal processing, which is a crucial aspect of studying sound in the ocean.

Acoustic signal processing involves the manipulation and analysis of acoustic signals to extract useful information about the ocean. This information can range from the identification of marine life to the detection of underwater objects. The use of acoustic signals has become increasingly important in oceanography, as it allows us to study the ocean in a non-invasive and cost-effective manner.

This knowledge will not only enhance their understanding of the ocean but also provide them with the necessary tools to conduct their own research in this fascinating field. So let us embark on this journey of exploring the depths of sound in the ocean through the lens of acoustic signal processing.




### Section: 4.1 Time-Frequency Analysis

Time-frequency analysis is a powerful tool in acoustical oceanography that allows us to study the behavior of acoustic signals over time and frequency. It is particularly useful in understanding the complex nature of sound waves in the ocean, which can exhibit both temporal and spectral variations.

#### 4.1a Fourier Transform and Spectrogram

The Fourier Transform is a mathematical tool that decomposes a signal into its constituent frequencies. In the context of acoustical oceanography, it is often used to analyze the spectral content of acoustic signals. The Fourier Transform is defined as:

$$
F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t)e^{-j\omega t} dt
$$

where $x(t)$ is the signal of interest, $\omega$ is the frequency, and $j$ is the imaginary unit. The Fourier Transform provides a frequency domain representation of the signal, where each frequency component is represented by a complex number.

The Spectrogram, on the other hand, is a time-frequency representation of a signal. It provides a visual representation of the spectral content of a signal over time. The Spectrogram is computed by applying a series of Fourier Transforms to the signal at different time intervals. The result is a two-dimensional plot where the horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents frequency. The intensity of the plot at each point represents the power of the signal at that particular time and frequency.

The Spectrogram is particularly useful in acoustical oceanography as it allows us to visualize the changes in the spectral content of acoustic signals over time. This can be particularly useful in understanding the behavior of sound waves in the ocean, which can exhibit both temporal and spectral variations due to factors such as water depth, temperature, and salinity.

In the next section, we will explore the implementation of the Fourier Transform and Spectrogram in MATLAB, and discuss their applications in acoustical oceanography.

#### 4.1b Wavelet Transform and Wavelet Spectrum

The Wavelet Transform is another powerful tool in time-frequency analysis. Unlike the Fourier Transform, which provides a frequency domain representation of a signal, the Wavelet Transform provides a time-scale representation. This is particularly useful in acoustical oceanography, where we often need to analyze the temporal variations of acoustic signals.

The Wavelet Transform is defined as:

$$
W(a, b) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{|a|}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) \psi^* \left(\frac{t - b}{a}\right) dt
$$

where $x(t)$ is the signal of interest, $\psi(t)$ is the wavelet function, $a$ is the scale parameter, and $b$ is the translation parameter. The Wavelet Transform provides a time-scale representation of the signal, where each scale component is represented by a complex number.

The Wavelet Spectrum, similar to the Spectrogram, is a time-frequency representation of a signal. However, unlike the Spectrogram, which provides a frequency domain representation, the Wavelet Spectrum provides a time-scale representation. The Wavelet Spectrum is computed by applying a series of Wavelet Transforms to the signal at different scales. The result is a two-dimensional plot where the horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents scale. The intensity of the plot at each point represents the power of the signal at that particular time and scale.

The Wavelet Spectrum is particularly useful in acoustical oceanography as it allows us to visualize the changes in the temporal variations of acoustic signals over scale. This can be particularly useful in understanding the behavior of sound waves in the ocean, which can exhibit both temporal and scale variations due to factors such as water depth, temperature, and salinity.

In the next section, we will explore the implementation of the Wavelet Transform and Wavelet Spectrum in MATLAB, and discuss their applications in acoustical oceanography.

#### 4.1c Least-Squares Spectral Analysis

The Least-Squares Spectral Analysis (LSSA) is a method used to estimate the power spectrum of a signal. It is based on the principle of least squares, which minimizes the sum of the squares of the residuals (the difference between the observed and predicted values). The LSSA is particularly useful in acoustical oceanography, where we often need to estimate the power spectrum of acoustic signals.

The LSSA involves computing the least-squares spectrum by performing the least-squares approximation multiple times, each time to get the spectral power for a different frequency. This is done by computing "m" spectral values, where "m" is the desired number of frequencies. For each frequency, sine and cosine functions are evaluated at the times corresponding to the data samples, and dot products of the data vector with the sinusoid vectors are taken and appropriately normalized.

The LSSA treats each sinusoidal component independently, even though they may not be orthogonal to data points. This is in contrast to the Lomb/Scargle periodogram method, which can use an arbitrarily high number of, or density of, frequency components, as in a standard periodogram. However, the LSSA cannot fit more components (sines and cosines) than there are data samples, which is a limitation that the Lomb/Scargle periodogram method does not have.

The LSSA can be implemented in MATLAB using the following code:

```
function [P, f] = LSSA(y, fs, m)
    % y is the signal of interest
    % fs is the sampling rate
    % m is the desired number of frequencies

    % Compute the least-squares spectrum
    P = zeros(m, 1);
    for i = 1:m
        t = (0:length(y)-1)/fs; % time vector
        s = sin(2*pi*i/length(y)*t); % sine vector
        c = cos(2*pi*i/length(y)*t); % cosine vector
        r = y'*s; % dot product of data vector with sine vector
        g = y'*c; % dot product of data vector with cosine vector
        P(i) = (r^2 + g^2)/(length(y)*fs); % power at frequency i
    end

    % Compute the frequencies
    f = (0:m-1)*fs/length(y); % frequencies
end
```

The LSSA provides a frequency domain representation of a signal, where each frequency component is represented by a power value. This can be particularly useful in acoustical oceanography, where we often need to analyze the spectral content of acoustic signals.

In the next section, we will explore the implementation of the LSSA in MATLAB, and discuss its applications in acoustical oceanography.

#### 4.1d Applications of Time-Frequency Analysis

Time-frequency analysis has a wide range of applications in acoustical oceanography. It allows us to study the behavior of acoustic signals over time and frequency, providing valuable insights into the complex nature of sound waves in the ocean. In this section, we will discuss some of the key applications of time-frequency analysis in acoustical oceanography.

##### 4.1d.1 Underwater Acoustics

One of the primary applications of time-frequency analysis in acoustical oceanography is in the study of underwater acoustics. The ocean is a complex medium, with properties such as water depth, temperature, and salinity affecting the propagation of sound waves. Time-frequency analysis allows us to study the behavior of sound waves in the ocean, providing insights into how these properties affect the propagation of sound.

For example, the Least-Squares Spectral Analysis (LSSA) can be used to estimate the power spectrum of acoustic signals. This can be particularly useful in understanding the behavior of sound waves in the ocean, as it allows us to estimate the power at different frequencies. This can be particularly useful in understanding the behavior of sound waves in the ocean, as it allows us to estimate the power at different frequencies.

##### 4.1d.2 Sonar Systems

Time-frequency analysis also plays a crucial role in the design and analysis of sonar systems. Sonar systems use sound waves to detect objects underwater. The behavior of these sound waves can be complex, with factors such as water depth, temperature, and salinity affecting their propagation. Time-frequency analysis allows us to study the behavior of these sound waves, providing insights into how these factors affect their propagation.

For example, the Wavelet Transform and Wavelet Spectrum can be used to analyze the temporal variations of acoustic signals over scale. This can be particularly useful in understanding the behavior of sound waves in the ocean, as it allows us to visualize the changes in the temporal variations of acoustic signals over scale.

##### 4.1d.3 Oceanographic Research

Time-frequency analysis is also used in a variety of oceanographic research, including the study of marine ecosystems and the detection of underwater objects. For example, the Spectrogram can be used to visualize the changes in the spectral content of acoustic signals over time. This can be particularly useful in understanding the behavior of sound waves in the ocean, as it allows us to visualize the changes in the spectral content of acoustic signals over time.

In conclusion, time-frequency analysis is a powerful tool in acoustical oceanography, providing valuable insights into the behavior of sound waves in the ocean. Its applications range from the study of underwater acoustics to the design and analysis of sonar systems, and from oceanographic research to the detection of underwater objects.




#### 4.1b Short-Time Fourier Transform

The Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is a variation of the Fourier Transform that allows us to analyze the spectral content of a signal over short periods of time. This is particularly useful in acoustical oceanography, where the spectral content of acoustic signals can change rapidly over time due to factors such as water depth, temperature, and salinity.

The STFT is computed by dividing the signal into short segments, and applying a Fourier Transform to each segment. The result is a two-dimensional plot where the horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents frequency. The intensity of the plot at each point represents the power of the signal at that particular time and frequency.

The STFT is particularly useful in acoustical oceanography as it allows us to visualize the changes in the spectral content of acoustic signals over time. This can be particularly useful in understanding the behavior of sound waves in the ocean, which can exhibit both temporal and spectral variations due to factors such as water depth, temperature, and salinity.

The STFT can be computed using the following formula:

$$
X[m,r]=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}{f[n]w[rL-n]e^{-i2\pi \frac{mn}{N}}}
$$

where $f[n]$ is the signal of interest, $w[n]$ is a window function, $L$ is the separation in time between adjacent short-time sections, and $R = \left \lceil \frac{N+W-1}{L} \right \rceil$ is the number of short-time sections considered.

The STFT can also be computed using the sliding window interpretation, which involves using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Let $w_r[n]=w[rL-n]$ be the window element obtained from shifted and flipped window $\mathbf{w}$. Then we have

$$
\mathbf{Y}=[\mathbf{Y}_0,\mathbf{Y}_1...,\mathbf{Y}_{R-1}]
$$

where $\mathbf{Y}_r = \mathbf{x}\circ\mathbf{w}_r$.

The STFT phase retrieval problem can be stated as: Find $\mathbf{x}$ such that $
\mathbf{Z}_{w}[m,r]=|Y[m,r]|^2
$ where $\mathbf{W}_{r}$ is the $N \times N$ diagonal matrix with diagonal elements $\left(w_{r}[0], w_{r}[1], \ldots, w_{r}[N-1]\right)$.

In the next section, we will explore the implementation of the STFT in MATLAB, and discuss its applications in acoustical oceanography.

#### 4.1c Wavelet Transform

The Wavelet Transform is another powerful tool in time-frequency analysis, particularly useful in acoustical oceanography. It allows us to analyze the spectral content of a signal over time, but unlike the STFT, it does not require the signal to be divided into segments. This makes it particularly useful for signals that do not have a fixed frequency content, such as those found in the ocean.

The Wavelet Transform is computed using a wavelet function, which is a mathematical function that describes the shape of a wave. The wavelet function is convolved with the signal of interest, and the result is a two-dimensional plot where the horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents frequency. The intensity of the plot at each point represents the power of the signal at that particular time and frequency.

The Wavelet Transform is particularly useful in acoustical oceanography as it allows us to visualize the changes in the spectral content of acoustic signals over time. This can be particularly useful in understanding the behavior of sound waves in the ocean, which can exhibit both temporal and spectral variations due to factors such as water depth, temperature, and salinity.

The Wavelet Transform can be computed using the following formula:

$$
X[m,r]=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}{f[n]w[rL-n]e^{-i2\pi \frac{mn}{N}}}
$$

where $f[n]$ is the signal of interest, $w[n]$ is a wavelet function, $L$ is the separation in time between adjacent short-time sections, and $R = \left \lceil \frac{N+W-1}{L} \right \rceil$ is the number of short-time sections considered.

The Wavelet Transform can also be computed using the sliding window interpretation, which involves using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Let $w_r[n]=w[rL-n]$ be the window element obtained from shifted and flipped window $\mathbf{w}$. Then we have

$$
\mathbf{Y}=[\mathbf{Y}_0,\mathbf{Y}_1...,\mathbf{Y}_{R-1}]
$$

where $\mathbf{Y}_r = \mathbf{x}\circ\mathbf{w}_r$.

The Wavelet Transform phase retrieval problem can be stated as: Find $\mathbf{x}$ such that $
\mathbf{Z}_{w}[m,r]=|Y[m,r]|^2
$ where $\mathbf{W}_{r}$ is the $N \times N$ diagonal matrix with diagonal elements $\left(w_{r}[0], w_{r}[1], \ldots, w_{r}[N-1]\right)$.

In the next section, we will explore the implementation of the Wavelet Transform in MATLAB, and discuss its applications in acoustical oceanography.

#### 4.1d Applications of Time-Frequency Analysis

Time-frequency analysis, particularly the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Wavelet Transform, has a wide range of applications in acoustical oceanography. These techniques are used to analyze the spectral content of acoustic signals over time, providing valuable insights into the behavior of sound waves in the ocean.

One of the primary applications of time-frequency analysis in acoustical oceanography is in the study of ocean acoustics. The ocean is a complex medium, with its properties such as water depth, temperature, and salinity varying significantly. These variations can cause the spectral content of acoustic signals to change rapidly over time. Time-frequency analysis allows us to visualize these changes, providing a deeper understanding of how sound propagates in the ocean.

Another important application of time-frequency analysis is in the detection and classification of marine mammals. Marine mammals, such as whales and dolphins, communicate using acoustic signals. These signals can be analyzed using time-frequency techniques to identify the species of the mammal and its location. This information is crucial for monitoring and protecting these endangered species.

Time-frequency analysis is also used in the design and testing of underwater acoustic devices. By analyzing the spectral content of the signals emitted by these devices, engineers can optimize their performance and ensure that they meet the required specifications.

In addition to these applications, time-frequency analysis is also used in the study of ocean currents, the detection of underwater objects, and the analysis of ocean noise. The versatility of these techniques makes them an essential tool in the field of acoustical oceanography.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the implementation of time-frequency analysis techniques in MATLAB, providing step-by-step instructions and examples to help you apply these techniques in your own research.




#### 4.1c Wavelet Transform

The Wavelet Transform is a mathematical tool that allows us to analyze the time-varying frequency content of a signal. This is particularly useful in acoustical oceanography, where the frequency content of acoustic signals can change rapidly over time due to factors such as water depth, temperature, and salinity.

The Wavelet Transform is computed by dividing the signal into short segments, and applying a Wavelet Transform to each segment.

\mathbf{Z}_{w}[m,r]=|Y[m,r]|^2
$ where $\mathbf{W}_{r}$ is the $N \times




#### 4.2a Beamforming Techniques

Beamforming is a signal processing technique used in acoustical oceanography to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of received signals. It involves combining the signals received by multiple sensors to form a directional beam. This beam can then be steered in a specific direction to focus on the desired signal and suppress noise from other directions.

There are several beamforming techniques used in acoustical oceanography, each with its own advantages and limitations. In this section, we will discuss some of the most commonly used beamforming techniques.

##### Delay and Sum Beamforming

Delay and Sum Beamforming is a time domain approach that is simple to implement. It works by delaying the signals received by each sensor by a different amount, and then summing the delayed signals. The amount of delay is determined by the distance between the sensors and the source of the signal. This technique can poorly estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of the signal, but this can be improved by using a frequency domain approach.

##### Frequency Domain Beamforming

Frequency Domain Beamforming uses the Fourier transform to convert the time domain signals into the frequency domain. This allows the time delay between adjacent sensors to be represented as a phase shift. The array output vector at any time "t" can be denoted as $\boldsymbol x(t) = x_1(t)\begin{bmatrix} 1 & e^{-j\omega\Delta t} & \cdots & e^{-j\omega(M-1)\Delta t} \end{bmatrix}^T$, where $x_1(t)$ stands for the signal received by the first sensor.

The spatial covariance matrix, represented by $\boldsymbol R=E\{ \boldsymbol x(t) \boldsymbol x^T(t)\}$, carries the spatial and spectral information of the incoming signals. Assuming zero-mean Gaussian white noise, the basic model of the spatial covariance matrix is given by

$$
\boldsymbol R = \boldsymbol V \boldsymbol S \boldsymbol V^H + \sigma^2 \boldsymbol I \ \ (4)
$$

where $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the white noise, $\boldsymbol I$ is the identity matrix and $\boldsymbol V$ is the array manifold vector $\boldsymbol V = \begin{bmatrix} \boldsymbol v_1 & \cdots & \boldsymbol v_k \end{bmatrix}^T$ with $\boldsymbol v_i = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & e^{-j\omega\Delta t_i} & \cdots & e^{-j\omega(M-1)\Delta t_i} \end{bmatrix}^T$. This model is of central importance in frequency domain beamforming algorithms.

##### Conventional (Bartlett) Beamformer

The Bartlett Beamformer is a natural extension of conventional spectral analysis (spectrogram) to the sensor array. Its spectral power is represented by

$$
\hat{P}_{Bartlett}(\theta)=\boldsymbol v^H \boldsymbol R \boldsymbol v \ \ (5)
$$

The Bartlett Beamformer is particularly useful in situations where the signal of interest is stationary or slowly varying. However, it can be less effective in situations where the signal is rapidly varying or contains strong non-stationary components.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the challenges and limitations of beamforming in acoustical oceanography.

#### 4.2b Beamforming Algorithms

Beamforming algorithms are used to process the signals received by the sensors in a sensor array. These algorithms are designed to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the received signals, and to steer the beam in a specific direction. In this section, we will discuss some of the most commonly used beamforming algorithms.

##### Least Variance Beamforming

The Least Variance Beamforming (LVB) algorithm is a frequency domain beamforming algorithm that minimizes the variance of the beamformer output. The LVB algorithm is based on the assumption that the noise is white and Gaussian. The LVB algorithm can be represented as:

$$
\hat{\mathbf{w}}_{\text{LVB}} = \frac{\mathbf{R}^{-1}\mathbf{d}}{\mathbf{d}^{\ast}\mathbf{R}^{-1}\mathbf{d}}
$$

where $\mathbf{R}$ is the spatial covariance matrix, $\mathbf{d}$ is the desired signal vector, and $\mathbf{w}$ is the beamforming vector. The LVB algorithm can be used to estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of the signal, and to steer the beam in the direction of the estimated DOA.

##### MUSIC Beamforming

The MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Classification) Beamforming algorithm is a frequency domain beamforming algorithm that uses the eigenvalues of the spatial covariance matrix to estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of the signal. The MUSIC algorithm can be represented as:

$$
\hat{\mathbf{w}}_{\text{MUSIC}} = \frac{\mathbf{R}^{-1}\mathbf{d}}{\sqrt{\mathbf{d}^{\ast}\mathbf{R}^{-1}\mathbf{d}}}
$$

where $\mathbf{R}$ is the spatial covariance matrix, $\mathbf{d}$ is the desired signal vector, and $\mathbf{w}$ is the beamforming vector. The MUSIC algorithm can be used to estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of the signal, and to steer the beam in the direction of the estimated DOA.

##### ESPRIT Beamforming

The ESPRIT (Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques) Beamforming algorithm is a frequency domain beamforming algorithm that uses the eigenvalues of the spatial covariance matrix to estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of the signal. The ESPRIT algorithm can be represented as:

$$
\hat{\mathbf{w}}_{\text{ESPRIT}} = \frac{\mathbf{R}^{-1}\mathbf{d}}{\sqrt{\mathbf{d}^{\ast}\mathbf{R}^{-1}\mathbf{d}}}
$$

where $\mathbf{R}$ is the spatial covariance matrix, $\mathbf{d}$ is the desired signal vector, and $\mathbf{w}$ is the beamforming vector. The ESPRIT algorithm can be used to estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of the signal, and to steer the beam in the direction of the estimated DOA.

##### Beamforming with Constraints

In some applications, it may be desirable to impose constraints on the beamforming vector. For example, the beamforming vector may be required to have a certain magnitude or phase. In such cases, the beamforming algorithm can be modified to incorporate these constraints. For example, the LVB algorithm can be modified to include a constraint on the magnitude of the beamforming vector, as follows:

$$
\hat{\mathbf{w}}_{\text{LVB}} = \frac{\mathbf{R}^{-1}\mathbf{d}}{\mathbf{d}^{\ast}\mathbf{R}^{-1}\mathbf{d}}
$$

where $\mathbf{R}$ is the spatial covariance matrix, $\mathbf{d}$ is the desired signal vector, and $\mathbf{w}$ is the beamforming vector. The LVB algorithm can be used to estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of the signal, and to steer the beam in the direction of the estimated DOA.

#### 4.2c Beamforming Applications

Beamforming techniques have a wide range of applications in acoustical oceanography. These applications include, but are not limited to, the following:

##### Sonar Systems

Sonar systems are a common application of beamforming techniques. Sonar systems use sound waves to detect objects underwater. Beamforming allows these systems to focus on a specific direction, improving the signal-to-noise ratio and increasing the range at which objects can be detected.

##### Underwater Acoustics

Underwater acoustics is another important application of beamforming techniques. Underwater acoustics involves the study of sound propagation in water. Beamforming can be used to steer the beam in a specific direction, allowing for the study of sound propagation in a particular direction.

##### Oceanographic Research

Beamforming techniques are also used in oceanographic research. For example, beamforming can be used to estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of a signal, which can be useful in studying the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.

##### Underwater Imaging

Underwater imaging is a technique used to create images of objects underwater. Beamforming can be used to focus the beam in a specific direction, improving the resolution of the image.

##### Underwater Communication

Underwater communication is a technique used to transmit information underwater. Beamforming can be used to focus the beam in a specific direction, improving the reliability of the communication.

#### 4.2b Array Processing Algorithms

Array processing algorithms are mathematical techniques used to process signals received by an array of sensors. These algorithms are essential in acoustical oceanography as they allow us to extract useful information from the received signals. In this section, we will discuss some of the most commonly used array processing algorithms.

##### Least Squares Beamforming

#### 4.2c Adaptive Beamforming

Adaptive beamforming is a technique used in array processing to estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of a signal in real-time. This is achieved by continuously adjusting the beamforming weights to compensate for changes in the signal environment. In this section, we will discuss the principles and applications of adaptive beamforming.

##### Principles of Adaptive Beamforming

Adaptive beamforming is based on the principle of minimizing the mean square error (MSE) between the received signal and the estimated signal. The MSE is defined as the sum of the squares of the differences between the received signals and the estimated signals. The adaptive beamforming weights are then adjusted to minimize this MSE.

The adaptive beamforming process can be represented as follows:

$$
\hat{x}(n) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i(n) y_i(n)
$$

where $\hat{x}(n)$ is the estimated signal, $w_i(n)$ is the weight of the $i$th element at time $n$, and $y_i(n)$ is the received signal from the $i$th element at time $n$.

##### Applications of Adaptive Beamforming

Adaptive beamforming has a wide range of applications in acoustical oceanography. One of the most common applications is in sonar systems. Sonar systems use sound waves to detect and locate objects underwater. Adaptive beamforming is used to estimate the direction of arrival of the sound waves, which is crucial for accurately detecting and locating objects.

Another important application of adaptive beamforming is in acoustic tomography. Acoustic tomography is a technique used to image the interior of the Earth by sending sound waves into the ground and measuring the time it takes for the waves to return. Adaptive beamforming is used to estimate the direction of arrival of the sound waves, which is crucial for accurately imaging the interior of the Earth.

##### Adaptive Beamforming Algorithms

There are several algorithms used for adaptive beamforming, including the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm, the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm, and the recursive least mean squares (RLMS) algorithm. These algorithms differ in their complexity and performance, and the choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the application.

In the next section, we will discuss the implementation of adaptive beamforming in more detail, including the design of the adaptive beamforming weights and the performance evaluation of the adaptive beamforming system.

#### 4.2d Beamforming Applications

Beamforming, both fixed and adaptive, has a wide range of applications in acoustical oceanography. In this section, we will explore some of these applications and how beamforming is used to solve specific problems in the field.

##### Sonar Systems

As mentioned in the previous section, sonar systems are one of the primary applications of beamforming. Sonar systems use sound waves to detect and locate objects underwater. Beamforming is used in sonar systems to estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of the sound waves. This is crucial for accurately detecting and locating objects underwater.

In sonar systems, fixed beamforming is often used due to its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, adaptive beamforming can provide better performance in environments with changing signal conditions. For example, in a dynamic underwater environment, the signal conditions can change rapidly due to factors such as water currents and reflections from underwater structures. In such cases, adaptive beamforming can adjust the beamforming weights in real-time to compensate for these changes, resulting in improved performance.

##### Acoustic Tomography

Another important application of beamforming in acoustical oceanography is acoustic tomography. Acoustic tomography is a technique used to image the interior of the Earth by sending sound waves into the ground and measuring the time it takes for the waves to return. Beamforming is used in acoustic tomography to estimate the direction of arrival of the sound waves. This is crucial for accurately imaging the interior of the Earth.

In acoustic tomography, adaptive beamforming is often used due to its ability to handle changing signal conditions. The Earth's interior is a complex and dynamic environment, and the signal conditions can change rapidly due to factors such as changes in the Earth's composition and temperature. Adaptive beamforming can adjust the beamforming weights in real-time to compensate for these changes, resulting in improved imaging performance.

##### Underwater Acoustics

#### 4.3a Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA)

Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) is a crucial concept in acoustical oceanography, particularly in the field of source localization. It is a method used to determine the direction of arrival of a sound source by measuring the time difference between the arrival of the sound at different receivers.

##### Principles of TDOA

The principle behind TDOA is based on the speed of sound in water. The speed of sound in water is approximately 1500 meters per second. Therefore, if two receivers are located at a known distance apart and receive a sound signal at the same time, the source of the sound must be located along a line connecting the two receivers. The direction of the source can then be determined by the receiver that received the sound first.

The TDOA can be represented as follows:

$$
TDOA = T_2 - T_1
$$

where $TDOA$ is the time difference of arrival, $T_2$ is the time of arrival at the second receiver, and $T_1$ is the time of arrival at the first receiver.

##### Applications of TDOA

TDOA has a wide range of applications in acoustical oceanography. One of the most common applications is in underwater acoustics. In underwater acoustics, TDOA is used to localize the source of a sound signal, which is crucial for detecting and tracking marine animals and underwater vehicles.

Another important application of TDOA is in acoustic tomography. Acoustic tomography is a technique used to image the interior of the Earth by sending sound waves into the ground and measuring the time it takes for the waves to return. TDOA is used to determine the direction of arrival of the sound waves, which is crucial for accurately imaging the interior of the Earth.

##### Principles of RSS

The principle behind RSS is based on the inverse square law of sound propagation. The strength of a sound signal decreases as the distance from the source increases. Therefore, if two receivers are located at a known distance apart and receive a sound signal of the same strength, the source of the sound must be located along a line connecting the two receivers. The direction of the source can then be determined by the receiver that received the signal of the highest strength.

The RSS can be represented as follows:

$$
RSS = P_r
$$

where $RSS$ is the received signal strength, and $P_r$ is the power received at the receiver.

##### Applications of RSS

RSS has a wide range of applications in acoustical oceanography. One of the most common applications is in underwater acoustics. In underwater acoustics, RSS is used to localize the source of a sound signal, which is crucial for detecting and tracking marine animals and underwater vehicles.

Another important application of RSS is in acoustic tomography.

## Chapter: Chapter 5: Acoustic Imaging

### Introduction

The ocean, with its vast expanse and mysterious depths, has always been a subject of fascination and exploration. The ability to see into these depths, to visualize the underwater world, has been a dream of scientists and explorers for centuries. This dream has been made possible by the field of acoustical oceanography, which uses sound waves to create images of the ocean floor and the objects within it. This chapter, "Acoustic Imaging," delves into the fascinating world of acoustical oceanography, exploring the principles, techniques, and applications of acoustic imaging.

Acoustic imaging, also known as sonar imaging, is a technique that uses sound waves to create images of the ocean floor and the objects within it. This technique is based on the principle of echo, where sound waves are emitted into the water and the reflected waves are received and processed to create an image. The sound waves travel through the water, bounce off the ocean floor and objects, and return to the receiver. The time it takes for the sound to return provides information about the distance to the ocean floor or objects. By combining this information with the known speed of sound, the depth and location of the ocean floor or objects can be determined.

In this chapter, we will explore the various aspects of acoustic imaging, including the generation and propagation of sound waves, the reception and processing of the reflected waves, and the interpretation of the resulting images. We will also discuss the applications of acoustic imaging in oceanography, such as mapping the ocean floor, studying marine life, and detecting underwater objects.

The journey into the depths of the ocean through acoustic imaging is a fascinating one, filled with scientific principles, technological advancements, and a wealth of information about the ocean.

The steering vector is calculated based on the known geometry of the receiver array and the time of arrival of the sound signal at each receiver.

The AOA can be represented as follows:

$$

#### 4.4b Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about a population based on a sample. In the context of acoustical oceanography, hypothesis testing can be used to determine the presence or absence of a signal in a received signal.

##### Principles of Hypothesis Testing

The principle behind hypothesis testing is based on the concept of a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis is a statement about the population that is assumed to be true until evidence suggests otherwise. The alternative hypothesis is the statement that we are testing for.

In the context of acoustical oceanography, the null hypothesis could be that there is no signal present in the received signal, while the alternative hypothesis could be that there is a signal present.

##### Applications of Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing has a wide range of applications in acoustical oceanography. One of the most common applications is in the detection of signals in noise. By setting a significance level (usually 0.05) and conducting a hypothesis test, we can determine whether a signal is present in the received signal with a certain level of confidence.

Another important application of hypothesis testing is in the estimation of parameters. By setting a confidence interval and conducting a hypothesis test, we can estimate the parameters of a signal with a certain level of confidence.

#### 4.4d Signal Detection in Noise

Signal detection in noise is a fundamental problem in acoustical oceanography. The presence of noise can significantly degrade the performance of a detection system, making it difficult to detect signals of interest. In this section, we will discuss some techniques for detecting signals in noise.

##### Principles of Signal Detection in Noise

The principles behind signal detection in noise are based on the concept of a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The SNR is a measure of the strength of a signal relative to the noise. A higher SNR indicates a stronger signal.

One common technique for detecting signals in noise is the matched filter. The matched filter is a linear filter that maximizes the SNR of a signal. It works by convolving the received signal with a template signal, which is known to be the signal of interest. The output of the matched filter is then compared to a threshold to determine whether the signal is present.

Another technique for detecting signals in noise is the energy detector. The energy detector works by computing the energy of the received signal over a certain time interval. If the energy exceeds a predetermined threshold, the signal is considered to be present.

##### Applications of Signal Detection in Noise

Signal detection in noise has a wide range of applications in acoustical oceanography. One of the most common applications is in the detection of acoustic signals in the ocean. These signals can be used to study the properties of the ocean, such as its temperature and salinity.

Another important application of signal detection in noise is in the detection of biologically relevant sounds. These sounds can be used to study the behavior of marine animals and their interactions with the environment.

#### 4.4e Signal Detection in Non-Gaussian Noise

In the previous sections, we have discussed signal detection techniques in Gaussian noise. However, in many real-world scenarios, the noise is non-Gaussian. Non-Gaussian noise can be caused by a variety of factors, such as the presence of strong non-stationary signals, interference from other sources, or the use of non-linear processing techniques. In this section, we will explore some techniques for detecting signals in non-Gaussian noise.

##### Principles of Signal Detection in Non-Gaussian Noise

The principles behind signal detection in non-Gaussian noise are based on the concept of a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Similar to Gaussian noise, a higher SNR indicates a stronger signal. However, in non-Gaussian noise, the SNR is often not a good measure of the strength of a signal. This is because the noise distribution can significantly affect the SNR, even when the signal is the same.

One common technique for detecting signals in non-Gaussian noise is the energy detector. The energy detector works by computing the energy of the received signal over a certain time interval. If the energy exceeds a predetermined threshold, the signal is considered to be present. This technique is particularly useful in non-Gaussian noise because it does not rely on the assumption of Gaussian noise.

Another technique for detecting signals in non-Gaussian noise is the likelihood ratio test. The likelihood ratio test works by comparing the likelihood of the received signal given the signal hypothesis to the likelihood of the received signal given the noise hypothesis. If the likelihood ratio exceeds a predetermined threshold, the signal is considered to be present. This technique is more sensitive to changes in the noise distribution, making it useful in non-Gaussian noise.

##### Applications of Signal Detection in Non-Gaussian Noise

Signal detection in non-Gaussian noise has a wide range of applications in acoustical oceanography. One of the most common applications is in the detection of acoustic signals in the ocean. These signals can be used to study the properties of the ocean, such as its temperature and salinity.

#### 4.4c Statistical Detection Algorithms

Statistical detection algorithms are a class of signal detection techniques that use statistical methods to determine the presence or absence of a signal in a received signal. These algorithms are particularly useful in acoustical oceanography, where signals can be weak and corrupted by noise and interference.

##### Principles of Statistical Detection Algorithms

Statistical detection algorithms are based on the principles of hypothesis testing, as discussed in the previous section. However, they also take into account the statistical properties of the received signal and the noise. This allows them to make more accurate decisions about the presence or absence of a signal.

One of the key principles behind statistical detection algorithms is the use of a decision threshold. This threshold is determined based on the statistical properties of the received signal and the noise. If the received signal exceeds this threshold, the algorithm concludes that a signal is present. If the received signal falls below the threshold, the algorithm concludes that there is no signal present.

##### Types of Statistical Detection Algorithms

There are several types of statistical detection algorithms that are commonly used in acoustical oceanography. These include:

- **Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT):** This test compares the likelihood of the received signal given the presence of a signal to the likelihood of the received signal given the absence of a signal. If the likelihood of the received signal given the presence of a signal is greater than the likelihood of the received signal given the absence of a signal, the LRT concludes that a signal is present.

- **Neyman-Pearson Criterion (NPC):** This criterion sets a fixed decision threshold based on the statistical properties of the received signal and the noise. If the received signal exceeds this threshold, the NPC concludes that a signal is present. If the received signal falls below the threshold, the NPC concludes that there is no signal present.

- **Bayesian Criterion (BC):** This criterion uses Bayesian statistics to determine the probability of a signal being present given the received signal. If the probability is above a certain threshold, the BC concludes that a signal is present. If the probability is below the threshold, the BC concludes that there is no signal present.

##### Applications of Statistical Detection Algorithms

Statistical detection algorithms have a wide range of applications in acoustical oceanography. They are used to detect signals in noise, estimate the parameters of a signal, and make decisions about the presence or absence of a signal. These algorithms are particularly useful in situations where the received signal is weak and corrupted by noise and interference.

One of the primary applications of signal detection in acoustical oceanography is the detection of marine life. Marine mammals, such as whales and dolphins, emit high-frequency sounds that can be detected using acoustic sensors. These sounds can be used to locate and track marine mammals, providing valuable information about their behavior and migration patterns.

For example, the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) can be used to detect the presence of a whale's call in a received signal. The LRT compares the likelihood of the received signal given the presence of a whale's call to the likelihood of the received signal given the absence of a whale's call. If the likelihood of the received signal given the presence of a whale's call is greater than the likelihood of the received signal given the absence of a whale's call, the LRT concludes that a whale's call is present.

##### Estimation of Ocean Properties

Signal detection techniques are also used to estimate the properties of the ocean. For instance, the Neyman-Pearson Criterion (NPC) can be used to estimate the depth of the ocean. The NPC sets a fixed decision threshold based on the statistical properties of the received signal and the noise. If the received signal exceeds this threshold, the NPC concludes that the ocean is shallow. If the received signal falls below the threshold, the NPC concludes that the ocean is deep.

##### Detection of Underwater Noise

Underwater noise, such as ship noise and seismic activity, can interfere with the detection of signals in the ocean. Statistical detection algorithms, such as the Bayesian Criterion (BC), can be used to detect and analyze underwater noise. The BC uses Bayesian statistics to determine the probability of a signal being present given the received signal. If the probability is above a certain threshold, the BC concludes that a signal is present. If the probability is below the threshold, the BC concludes that there is no signal present.

In conclusion, signal detection techniques play a crucial role in acoustical oceanography. They provide a means to detect and analyze signals in the ocean, providing valuable information about the ocean's acoustic properties and the presence of marine life.

### Subsection: 5.1b Biological Noise

Biological noise is a significant component of ocean ambient noise. It is generated by various marine organisms, including marine mammals, fish, and invertebrates. The noise generated by these organisms can be categorized into two types: vocal noise and non-vocal noise.

#### 5.1b.1 Vocal Noise

Vocal noise is generated by marine mammals, such as dolphins, harbour porpoises, and harbour seals, as well as fish and invertebrates. This type of noise is used for communication, navigation, and defense. The characteristics of vocal noise can vary significantly depending on the species and the purpose of the communication.

For instance, the vocal noise generated by dolphins and porpoises is characterized by high-frequency, short-duration pulses. These pulses are used for echolocation, a process by which these animals use sound waves to navigate and detect prey. The vocal noise generated by fish and invertebrates, on the other hand, is typically lower in frequency and longer in duration. This noise is used for communication and defense, particularly in species that live in large groups.

#### 5.1b.2 Non-Vocal Noise

Non-vocal noise is generated by the movement of marine organisms through the water. This type of noise is typically lower in frequency and longer in duration compared to vocal noise. The characteristics of non-vocal noise can vary depending on the size and type of the organism.

For instance, the non-vocal noise generated by large marine mammals, such as whales, is characterized by low-frequency, long-duration sounds. These sounds are used for communication and navigation. The non-vocal noise generated by smaller organisms, such as fish and invertebrates, is typically higher in frequency and shorter in duration. This noise is used for propulsion and maneuvering.

The impact of biological noise on the marine environment is a topic of ongoing research. Studies have shown that biological noise can disrupt the communication and navigation of marine animals, leading to changes in their behavior and potentially affecting their survival. Furthermore, biological noise can also interfere with the detection of acoustic signals used in underwater communication and navigation, posing a safety risk for ships.

To mitigate the impact of biological noise, various measures have been proposed, including the use of quieter engines and hull designs, as well as the implementation of noise-reducing technologies. Additionally, regulations have been put in place to limit the noise generated by ships, particularly in sensitive marine areas.




### Subsection: 5.1c Geological Noise

Geological noise is a significant component of ocean ambient noise. It is generated by various geological processes, including ocean waves, tides, and seismic activity. The noise generated by these processes can be categorized into two types: continuous noise and transient noise.

#### 5.1c.1 Continuous Noise

Continuous noise is generated by ongoing geological processes, such as ocean waves and tides. Ocean waves, in particular, are a major source of continuous noise in the ocean. The characteristics of this noise can vary significantly depending on the type of ocean wave, the depth of the water, and the presence of underwater topography.

Ocean waves can be categorized into two types: wind-generated waves and tidal waves. Wind-generated waves are generated by the wind blowing over the surface of the ocean. These waves are characterized by high-frequency, short-duration pulses. Tidal waves, on the other hand, are generated by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun. These waves are characterized by lower frequencies and longer durations.

The presence of underwater topography can also significantly impact the characteristics of ocean waves. For instance, the interaction of ocean waves with underwater ridges and valleys can lead to the generation of secondary waves with different frequencies and durations.

#### 5.1c.2 Transient Noise

Transient noise is generated by sudden geological events, such as earthquakes and underwater landslides. These events can generate high-amplitude, low-frequency noise that can last for extended periods. The characteristics of this noise can vary significantly depending on the type of event and the properties of the ocean floor.

Earthquakes, for instance, can generate noise with frequencies as low as 0.1 Hz and durations of several minutes. The noise generated by underwater landslides, on the other hand, can be characterized by high-amplitude, low-frequency noise that can last for hours.

The study of geological noise is crucial for understanding the dynamics of the ocean and its interaction with the Earth's crust. It can also provide valuable information about the properties of the ocean floor and the presence of underwater topography.




### Subsection: 5.1d Anthropogenic Noise

Anthropogenic noise, also known as human-generated noise, is a significant contributor to the overall ambient noise in the ocean. This noise is primarily generated by human activities such as shipping, offshore industries, and military operations.

#### 5.1d.1 Shipping Noise

Shipping is a major source of anthropogenic noise in the ocean. The International Maritime Organization estimates that there are over 100,000 merchant ships and 1,000 cruise ships in the world, and these vessels generate significant levels of noise. The noise generated by ships can be categorized into two types: continuous noise and transient noise.

Continuous noise is generated by the engines of the ships and can be heard over long distances. The characteristics of this noise can vary depending on the type of engine, the speed of the ship, and the weather conditions. Transient noise, on the other hand, is generated by sudden events such as collisions or equipment failures. These events can generate high-amplitude, low-frequency noise that can last for extended periods.

#### 5.1d.2 Noise from Offshore Industries

Offshore industries such as oil and gas exploration and production, wind farms, and wave energy converters also contribute significantly to anthropogenic noise in the ocean. These industries often use equipment such as seismic airguns, pile drivers, and pumps that generate high levels of noise.

Seismic airguns, for instance, are used to explore for oil and gas deposits. These guns emit high-intensity pulses of sound waves into the water, which can be heard over long distances. The noise generated by these guns can be harmful to marine life, particularly to cetaceans, which can suffer permanent hearing loss if exposed to sound levels above 230 dB.

Pile drivers and pumps are also significant sources of noise. Pile drivers are used to drive piles into the seafloor, and they generate high levels of noise that can be heard over long distances. Pumps, on the other hand, are used to move fluids such as oil and gas, and they can generate continuous noise that can be heard over long distances.

#### 5.1d.3 Noise from Military Operations

Military operations, particularly naval exercises and maneuvers, also contribute to anthropogenic noise in the ocean. These operations often involve the use of sonar systems, which emit high levels of sound waves into the water. The noise generated by these systems can be harmful to marine life, particularly to cetaceans, which can suffer permanent hearing loss if exposed to sound levels above 230 dB.

In addition to sonar systems, military operations also involve the use of explosives, which can generate high levels of noise. These explosions can cause significant damage to marine life and infrastructure, and they can also generate noise that can be heard over long distances.

In conclusion, anthropogenic noise is a significant contributor to the overall ambient noise in the ocean. It is generated by a variety of human activities, and it can have significant impacts on marine life and ecosystems. As human activities continue to expand into the ocean, it is crucial to find ways to mitigate the impacts of anthropogenic noise.




### Subsection: 5.2a Power Spectral Density

The power spectral density (PSD) is a fundamental concept in the study of acoustical oceanography. It is a mathematical function that describes how the power of a signal is distributed over the frequency spectrum. In the context of ocean ambient noise, the PSD provides a comprehensive view of the noise spectrum, allowing us to understand the relative contributions of different sources of noise.

#### 5.2a.1 Definition of Power Spectral Density

The power spectral density of a signal $x(t)$ is defined as the Fourier transform of its autocorrelation function $R_x(\tau)$. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
S_x(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} R_x(\tau) e^{-j2\pi f\tau} d\tau
$$

where $S_x(f)$ is the power spectral density, $R_x(\tau)$ is the autocorrelation function, $j$ is the imaginary unit, and $f$ is the frequency.

The PSD provides a measure of the power of the signal at each frequency. The power at a given frequency is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the signal at that frequency. Therefore, the PSD can be thought of as a measure of the "strength" of the signal at each frequency.

#### 5.2a.2 Power Spectral Density and Ambient Noise

In the context of ocean ambient noise, the PSD can be used to analyze the noise spectrum and identify the sources of noise. The PSD can be estimated from a time series of noise measurements, providing a snapshot of the noise spectrum at a particular time and location.

The PSD can also be used to identify the dominant frequencies in the noise spectrum. For example, if a particular frequency is significantly higher than the surrounding frequencies, it may indicate the presence of a strong source of noise at that frequency.

#### 5.2a.3 Power Spectral Density and Anthropogenic Noise

Anthropogenic noise, as discussed in the previous section, is a significant contributor to the overall ambient noise in the ocean. The PSD can be used to analyze the impact of anthropogenic noise on the ocean's acoustic environment.

For instance, the PSD can be used to analyze the noise generated by offshore industries. The PSD can provide insights into the frequency spectrum of the noise generated by these industries, allowing us to understand the impact of this noise on marine life.

Similarly, the PSD can be used to analyze the noise generated by shipping. The PSD can provide insights into the frequency spectrum of the noise generated by ships, allowing us to understand the impact of this noise on marine life.

In conclusion, the power spectral density is a powerful tool in the study of acoustical oceanography. It provides a comprehensive view of the noise spectrum, allowing us to understand the relative contributions of different sources of noise. In the next section, we will explore another important concept in acoustical oceanography: the cross power spectral density.




### Subsection: 5.2b Octave Band Analysis

Octave band analysis is a method used in acoustics to analyze the frequency content of a signal. It involves dividing the frequency spectrum into octave bands, each spanning a range of frequencies that are an octave apart. This method is particularly useful in the study of ocean ambient noise, as it allows us to focus on specific frequency ranges and identify the sources of noise within those ranges.

#### 5.2b.1 Definition of Octave Band Analysis

Octave band analysis is a method of spectral analysis that divides the frequency spectrum into octave bands. An octave is a range of frequencies that are twice as high or low as the central frequency of the band. The central frequency of each band is a power of two, and the bandwidth is constant across all bands.

The octave band analysis is typically represented as a function $H(f)$, where $f$ is the frequency and $H(f)$ is the amplitude of the signal at that frequency. The function $H(f)$ is defined as:

$$
H(f) = \begin{cases}
A_0, & \text{if } f \in [f_0, f_0 + B_0] \\
A_1, & \text{if } f \in [f_1, f_1 + B_1] \\
\vdots & \vdots \\
A_n, & \text{if } f \in [f_n, f_n + B_n]
\end{cases}
$$

where $A_i$ is the amplitude of the signal at the center frequency $f_i$ of the $i$-th band, and $B_i$ is the bandwidth of the $i$-th band.

#### 5.2b.2 Octave Band Analysis and Ambient Noise

In the context of ocean ambient noise, octave band analysis can be used to identify the sources of noise within specific frequency ranges. For example, if a particular octave band is significantly louder than the surrounding bands, it may indicate the presence of a strong source of noise at those frequencies.

Octave band analysis can also be used to compare the noise spectra at different times and locations. By comparing the amplitude of the signal at the same frequencies, we can identify changes in the noise spectrum over time and across different regions of the ocean.

#### 5.2b.3 Octave Band Analysis and Anthropogenic Noise

Anthropogenic noise, as discussed in the previous sections, is a significant contributor to the overall ambient noise in the ocean. Octave band analysis can be used to identify the frequencies at which anthropogenic noise is most prevalent. This can help us understand the impact of human activities on the ocean's acoustic environment and develop strategies to mitigate the effects of anthropogenic noise.

In the next section, we will discuss another method of spectral analysis, the fast Fourier transform, and its application in the study of ocean ambient noise.

This chapter, "Ocean Noise Reduction," delves into the intricacies of this issue, exploring the sources of ocean noise, its impact on marine life, and the strategies for reducing it.

The ocean is not just a silent underwater world. It is teeming with sounds, from the gentle lapping of waves to the roar of ocean currents. However, the human-induced noise, such as the noise from ships, oil rigs, and sonar systems, has been significantly altering this natural acoustic environment. This noise not only disrupts the communication and behavior of marine animals but also poses a threat to their survival.

In this chapter, we will explore the various sources of ocean noise, including anthropogenic noise and natural noise. We will also delve into the impact of this noise on marine life, from the smallest organisms to the largest mammals. The chapter will also discuss the strategies for reducing ocean noise, including technological advancements and policy changes.

The study of ocean noise reduction is a multidisciplinary field, involving acoustics, marine biology, and environmental science. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of this field, equipping readers with the knowledge and understanding necessary to appreciate the complexity of the issue and contribute to its solution.

As we delve into the depths of ocean noise reduction, we will also explore the broader implications of this issue. The ocean is not just a source of food and resources; it is a vital part of our planet's ecosystem. The health of the ocean, and by extension, the health of the planet, is inextricably linked to the health of its acoustic environment. This chapter will provide a deeper understanding of this critical issue, paving the way for more informed and effective action.

### Subsection: 5.3a Hydrophone Calibration

Hydrophone calibration is a critical step in the measurement of ocean ambient noise.

This calibration is necessary to ensure accurate and reliable measurements of ocean ambient noise.

Hydrophone calibration is the process of determining the relationship between the output voltage of a hydrophone and the pressure of the water. This relationship is typically represented as a calibration curve, which plots the output voltage of the hydrophone against the pressure of the water.

The calibration curve is typically linear, but it can also be non-linear due to factors such as temperature changes or mechanical stress on the hydrophone. The calibration curve is used to correct the output voltage of the hydrophone to account for these non-linearities.

There are several techniques for hydrophone calibration. One common technique is the use of a reference pressure standard, which is a device that produces a known pressure at a known frequency. The hydrophone is then calibrated by comparing its output voltage to the output voltage of the reference pressure standard.

Another technique is the use of a calibration tank, which is a controlled environment where the hydrophone can be exposed to a known pressure at a known frequency. The hydrophone is then calibrated by comparing its output voltage to the known pressure and frequency.

### Subsection: 5.3c Signal-to-Noise Ratio Estimation

The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is a critical parameter in the analysis of ambient noise recordings. It provides a measure of the quality of a signal, defined as the ratio of the power of the signal to the power of the noise. The SNR is usually expressed in decibels (dB).

#### 5.3c.1 Definition of Signal-to-Noise Ratio Estimation

Signal-to-Noise Ratio Estimation is the process of determining the SNR of a signal. This is typically done by measuring the power of the signal and the power of the noise, and then calculating the ratio of these two powers.

The power of a signal can be measured using a spectrum analyzer, which can provide a visual representation of the power of the signal at different frequencies.

### Section: 6.1 Modulation Schemes:

Modulation is a crucial aspect of underwater acoustic communication, as it allows for the efficient transmission of information through the use of varying properties of a carrier signal. In this section, we will explore the different types of modulation schemes used in underwater acoustic communication, with a focus on amplitude shift keying (ASK).

#### 6.1a Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)

Amplitude shift keying (ASK) is a type of digital modulation scheme that uses variations in the amplitude of a carrier signal to represent digital data. It is a form of amplitude modulation, where the amplitude of the carrier signal is varied to represent different symbols.

In ASK, a symbol, representing one or more bits, is sent by transmitting a fixed-amplitude carrier wave at a fixed frequency for a specific time duration. The amplitude of the carrier signal is then varied to represent different symbols. For example, if each symbol represents a single bit, then the carrier signal could be transmitted at nominal amplitude when the input value is 1, but transmitted at reduced amplitude or not at all when the input value is 0.

The demodulator, which is designed specifically for the symbol-set used by the modulator, determines the amplitude of the received signal and maps it back to the symbol it represents, thus recovering the original data. Frequency and phase of the carrier are kept constant.

ASK is a linear and sensitive to atmospheric noise, distortions, and propagation conditions. Both ASK modulation and demodulation processes are relatively inexpensive. The ASK technique is also commonly used to transmit digital data over optical fiber. For LED transmission, ASK is used because it is simple and inexpensive to implement.

In the next section, we will explore the advantages and disadvantages of ASK, as well as its applications in underwater acoustic communication.





### Section: 6.1 Modulation Schemes:

Modulation is a crucial aspect of underwater acoustic communication, as it allows for the efficient transmission of information through the use of varying properties of a carrier signal. In this section, we will explore the different types of modulation schemes used in underwater acoustic communication, with a focus on frequency shift keying (FSK).

#### 6.1b Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)

Frequency shift keying (FSK) is a type of digital modulation scheme that uses variations in the frequency of a carrier signal to represent digital data. It is a form of frequency modulation, where the frequency of the carrier signal is varied to represent different symbols.

In FSK, a symbol, representing one or more bits, is sent by transmitting a fixed-frequency carrier wave at a fixed amplitude for a specific time duration. The frequency of the carrier signal is then varied to represent different symbols. For example, if each symbol represents a single bit, then the carrier signal could be transmitted at a higher frequency when the input value is 1, but transmitted at a lower frequency when the input value is 0.

The demodulator, which is designed specifically for the symbol-set used by the modulator, determines the frequency of the received signal and maps it back to the symbol it represents, thus recovering the original data. Amplitude and phase of the carrier are kept constant.

FSK is a non-linear and less sensitive to atmospheric noise, distortions, and propagation conditions compared to ASK. However, it is more complex and expensive to implement. The FSK technique is also commonly used in wireless communication systems.

In the next section, we will explore the advantages and disadvantages of FSK, as well as its applications in underwater acoustic communication.





### Introduction to Underwater Acoustic Communication

Underwater acoustic communication is a crucial aspect of oceanography, allowing for the transmission of information and data in the underwater environment. This chapter will explore the various techniques and methods used for underwater acoustic communication, with a focus on modulation schemes.

Modulation is a fundamental concept in communication systems, where the information signal is modulated onto a carrier signal for transmission. In underwater acoustic communication, modulation is essential for efficient and reliable communication, as it allows for the transmission of information over long distances and through complex underwater environments.

In this chapter, we will delve into the different types of modulation schemes used in underwater acoustic communication, including frequency shift keying (FSK), phase shift keying (PSK), and amplitude shift keying (ASK). We will also explore the advantages and disadvantages of each scheme, as well as their applications in underwater acoustic communication.

Furthermore, we will discuss the challenges and limitations of underwater acoustic communication, such as signal propagation and interference, and how modulation schemes can help mitigate these issues. We will also touch upon the latest advancements and developments in underwater acoustic communication, such as cognitive radio and software-defined radio, and how they are shaping the future of this field.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of underwater acoustic communication, with a focus on modulation schemes, and their role in exploring the depths of sound in the ocean. 





#### 6.1d Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a digital modulation scheme that is widely used in underwater acoustic communication. It is a form of frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) where multiple signals are transmitted simultaneously over a single communication channel. OFDM is particularly useful in underwater acoustic communication due to its ability to achieve high data rates and its resistance to multipath fading.

##### Key Features of OFDM

The advantages and disadvantages of OFDM are further discussed in the Characteristics and principles of operation section below.

##### Characteristics and Principles of Operation

OFDM is a specialized form of FDM, with the additional constraint that all subcarrier signals within a communication channel are orthogonal to one another. This means that the subcarriers are carefully chosen so that they are orthogonal to each other, resulting in no crosstalk between the sub-channels. This greatly simplifies the design of both the transmitter and the receiver, as unlike conventional FDM, a separate filter for each sub-channel is not required.

The orthogonality of OFDM requires that the subcarrier spacing is $\Delta f = \frac{k}{T_U}$ Hertz, where $T_U$ seconds is the useful symbol duration (the receiver-side window size), and $k$ is a positive integer, typically equal to 1. This stipulates that each carrier frequency undergoes $k$ more complete cycles per symbol period than the previous carrier. Therefore, with $N$ subcarriers, the total passband bandwidth will be $B \approx N\Delta f$ (Hz).

The orthogonality also allows for high spectral efficiency, with a total symbol rate near the Nyquist rate for the equivalent baseband signal (i.e., near half the Nyquist rate for the double-side band physical passband signal). Almost the whole available frequency band can be used, resulting in a nearly 'white' spectrum, giving OFDM benign electromagnetic interference properties with respect to other co-channel users.

However, OFDM also requires very accurate frequency synchronization between the receiver and the transmitter. With frequency deviation, the subcarriers will no longer be orthogonal, causing inter-carrier interference (ICI) (i.e., cross-talk between the subcarriers). This can significantly degrade the performance of OFDM systems.

##### OFDM in Underwater Acoustic Communication

OFDM has been widely adopted in underwater acoustic communication due to its ability to achieve high data rates and its resistance to multipath fading. In underwater environments, signals can take multiple paths to reach the receiver, resulting in delayed and distorted versions of the transmitted signal. OFDM's use of multiple subcarriers allows for the detection and correction of these delayed and distorted signals, making it more robust to multipath fading than other modulation schemes.

Furthermore, OFDM's ability to achieve high data rates makes it suitable for applications that require large amounts of data to be transmitted, such as underwater imaging and mapping. Its high spectral efficiency also allows for efficient use of the limited bandwidth available in underwater communication.

In conclusion, OFDM is a powerful modulation scheme that is widely used in underwater acoustic communication. Its ability to achieve high data rates, its resistance to multipath fading, and its efficient use of bandwidth make it a valuable tool for exploring the depths of sound in the ocean. 





#### 6.2a Error Detection and Correction Codes

In the previous section, we discussed the use of Hamming codes for error detection and correction. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of error detection and correction codes, exploring their role in underwater acoustic communication.

##### Error Detection and Correction Codes

Error detection and correction codes are a crucial component of underwater acoustic communication. They are used to ensure the integrity of transmitted data, detecting and correcting errors that may occur during transmission. These codes are particularly important in underwater acoustics due to the challenging propagation conditions, which can lead to high error rates.

##### Types of Error Detection and Correction Codes

There are several types of error detection and correction codes, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most commonly used types include Hamming codes, Reed-Solomon codes, and convolutional codes.

###### Hamming Codes

Hamming codes are a family of linear error-correcting codes. They are named after Richard Hamming, who first introduced them in 1950. Hamming codes are designed to detect and correct single-bit errors. They work by adding redundant parity bits to the transmitted data, which can be used to detect and correct single-bit errors.

###### Reed-Solomon Codes

Reed-Solomon codes are a family of cyclic error-correcting codes. They were first introduced by Irving S. Reed and Gustave Solomon in 1960. Reed-Solomon codes are particularly well-suited for correcting burst errors, making them ideal for use in underwater acoustic communication.

###### Convolutional Codes

Convolutional codes are a family of linear error-correcting codes. They are particularly well-suited for correcting burst errors, making them ideal for use in underwater acoustic communication. Convolutional codes work by convolving the transmitted data with a set of generator polynomials, which can be used to detect and correct burst errors.

##### Error Detection and Correction Codes in Underwater Acoustic Communication

In underwater acoustic communication, error detection and correction codes are used to ensure the integrity of transmitted data. They are particularly important due to the challenging propagation conditions, which can lead to high error rates. The choice of error detection and correction code depends on the specific requirements of the communication system, including the type of errors that need to be detected and corrected, the complexity of the code, and the computational resources available.

In the next section, we will explore the use of error detection and correction codes in more detail, discussing their implementation and performance in underwater acoustic communication.

#### 6.2b Channel Capacity and Shannon's Theorem

In the previous section, we discussed the importance of error detection and correction codes in underwater acoustic communication. In this section, we will explore the concept of channel capacity and Shannon's theorem, which provide a theoretical limit on the maximum rate at which information can be reliably transmitted over a noisy channel.

##### Channel Capacity

Channel capacity, denoted by $C$, is a fundamental concept in information theory. It represents the maximum rate at which information can be reliably transmitted over a noisy channel. In the context of underwater acoustic communication, the channel is the medium through which the acoustic signals travel, and the noise is the interference caused by the propagation conditions.

The channel capacity is determined by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is the ratio of the power of the signal to the power of the noise. The higher the SNR, the higher the channel capacity. However, in underwater acoustics, the SNR is often low due to the challenging propagation conditions.

##### Shannon's Theorem

Shannon's theorem, named after Claude Shannon, provides a theoretical limit on the maximum rate at which information can be reliably transmitted over a noisy channel. It states that the maximum rate of reliable communication over a noisy channel is given by the channel capacity minus the entropy of the noise.

In the context of underwater acoustic communication, Shannon's theorem can be used to determine the maximum rate at which information can be reliably transmitted over the channel. This can be useful in designing communication systems, as it provides a theoretical limit on the performance of the system.

##### Implications for Underwater Acoustic Communication

The concept of channel capacity and Shannon's theorem has important implications for underwater acoustic communication. It provides a theoretical limit on the performance of communication systems, which can be used to guide the design of these systems. It also highlights the importance of error detection and correction codes, as they can help to increase the channel capacity by reducing the entropy of the noise.

In the next section, we will explore the practical implications of these concepts, discussing how they can be applied in the design of underwater acoustic communication systems.

#### 6.2c Modulation and Demodulation Techniques

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of channel capacity and Shannon's theorem, which provide a theoretical limit on the maximum rate at which information can be reliably transmitted over a noisy channel. In this section, we will explore the practical aspects of underwater acoustic communication, focusing on modulation and demodulation techniques.

##### Modulation Techniques

Modulation is the process of varying one or more properties of a carrier signal to transmit information. In underwater acoustic communication, the carrier signal is the acoustic wave, and the properties that are varied are typically the amplitude, frequency, and phase of the wave.

There are several types of modulation techniques used in underwater acoustic communication, including amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), phase modulation (PM), and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Each of these techniques has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of modulation technique depends on the specific requirements of the communication system.

##### Demodulation Techniques

Demodulation is the process of extracting the information from a modulated signal. In underwater acoustic communication, demodulation is typically performed by a receiver that is located near the transmitter.

The demodulation process involves converting the modulated signal back into its original form, which can then be decoded to recover the transmitted information. The choice of demodulation technique depends on the type of modulation used in the communication system.

##### Implications for Underwater Acoustic Communication

The choice of modulation and demodulation techniques has a significant impact on the performance of underwater acoustic communication systems. The choice of modulation technique affects the bandwidth of the transmitted signal, the power requirements, and the robustness of the signal against noise and interference. The choice of demodulation technique affects the complexity of the receiver, the sensitivity to synchronization errors, and the ability to decode the signal in the presence of noise and interference.

In the next section, we will explore some specific examples of modulation and demodulation techniques, and discuss their applications in underwater acoustic communication.

#### 6.2d Multiple Access Techniques

In the previous sections, we have discussed the concepts of modulation and demodulation techniques, which are fundamental to underwater acoustic communication. In this section, we will delve into the topic of multiple access techniques, which are essential for enabling multiple users to share the same communication channel.

##### Multiple Access Techniques

Multiple access techniques are used to allow multiple users to share the same communication channel. This is particularly important in underwater acoustic communication, where the available bandwidth is often limited and expensive.

There are several types of multiple access techniques used in underwater acoustic communication, including time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), and code division multiple access (CDMA). Each of these techniques has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of multiple access technique depends on the specific requirements of the communication system.

##### Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)

In time division multiple access (TDMA), different users are assigned different time slots in a shared communication channel. Each user is allowed to transmit during their assigned time slot, and the channel is shared among the users in a time-division manner.

TDMA is simple to implement and provides good spectral efficiency. However, it requires a synchronous clock at each user, which can be difficult to achieve in practice.

##### Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)

In frequency division multiple access (FDMA), different users are assigned different frequency bands in a shared communication channel. Each user is allowed to transmit in their assigned frequency band, and the channel is shared among the users in a frequency-division manner.

FDMA provides good spectral efficiency and is relatively easy to implement. However, it requires a wide bandwidth, which can be expensive.

##### Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)

In code division multiple access (CDMA), different users are assigned different spreading codes, which are used to spread the transmitted signals over a wide frequency band. Each user's signal is then combined with the signals of other users in the receiver, and the signals are separated using the same spreading codes.

CDMA provides good spectral efficiency and is robust against interference. However, it requires complex signal processing at the receiver, which can be difficult to implement in practice.

##### Implications for Underwater Acoustic Communication

The choice of multiple access technique has a significant impact on the performance of underwater acoustic communication systems. The choice of multiple access technique affects the bandwidth requirements, the complexity of the receiver, the robustness against interference, and the scalability of the system.

In the next section, we will explore some specific examples of multiple access techniques, and discuss their applications in underwater acoustic communication.

#### 6.2b Convolutional Codes

Convolutional codes are a type of error detection and correction code that are particularly well-suited for correcting burst errors. They are a family of linear error-correcting codes that work by convolving the transmitted data with a set of generator polynomials. This process allows them to detect and correct burst errors, making them ideal for use in underwater acoustic communication.

##### Convolutional Codes in Underwater Acoustic Communication

In underwater acoustic communication, the propagation conditions can be challenging, leading to high error rates. Convolutional codes are particularly useful in these conditions due to their ability to correct burst errors. This is because burst errors are common in underwater acoustics, where the signal can be disrupted by various factors such as water temperature, salinity, and pressure.

##### Convolutional Codes and the Viterbi Algorithm

The Viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states in a hidden Markov model. In the context of convolutional codes, the Viterbi algorithm is used for decoding the transmitted data. The algorithm works by finding the most likely sequence of transmitted data given the received data.

##### Concatenation with Outer Algebraic Codes

One issue with convolutional codes is their susceptibility to error floors. An error floor is a phenomenon where the error rate does not decrease significantly even as the code rate is decreased. To address this issue, concatenation with an outer algebraic code, such as a Reed-Solomon code, can be used. This approach allows for the benefits of both types of codes, providing good performance at high code rates and also addressing the issue of error floors.

##### Implicit Data Structure

The implicit data structure is a concept that is closely related to convolutional codes. It is a data structure that is used to represent the convolutional code. The implicit data structure is particularly useful in the context of underwater acoustic communication, where the propagation conditions can be challenging and the use of efficient data structures is crucial.

##### Further Reading

For more information on convolutional codes and their applications in underwater acoustic communication, we recommend reading the publications of Hervé Brönnimann, J. Ian Munro, and Greg Frederickson. These authors have made significant contributions to the field and their work provides valuable insights into the use of convolutional codes in underwater acoustics.

#### 6.2c Applications of Channel Coding

Channel coding, particularly convolutional codes, have a wide range of applications in underwater acoustic communication. These applications extend beyond error detection and correction, and include the use of channel coding in distributed source coding and multi-focus image fusion.

##### Distributed Source Coding

Distributed source coding is a technique used in data compression where the source data is distributed among multiple nodes. This technique is particularly useful in underwater acoustic communication, where the propagation conditions can be challenging and the use of efficient data compression techniques is crucial. Convolutional codes can be used in distributed source coding to compress the source data, making it easier to transmit over the channel.

##### Multi-focus Image Fusion

Multi-focus image fusion is a technique used in image processing to combine multiple images of the same scene taken at different focus settings. This technique is particularly useful in underwater acoustic communication, where the propagation conditions can be challenging and the use of high-quality images is crucial. Convolutional codes can be used in multi-focus image fusion to compress the multiple images, making it easier to transmit them over the channel.

#### 6.2d Future Directions in Channel Coding

As technology continues to advance, the field of channel coding is expected to evolve and expand. The development of new coding schemes and the improvement of existing ones will be crucial in meeting the increasing demand for reliable and efficient communication in underwater acoustics.

##### Turbo Codes

Turbo codes, a class of iterated short convolutional codes, are expected to play a significant role in the future of channel coding. These codes closely approach the theoretical limits imposed by Shannon's theorem with much less decoding complexity than the Viterbi algorithm on the long convolutional codes that would be required for the same performance. The concatenation with an outer algebraic code (e.g., Reed–Solomon) addresses the issue of error floors inherent to turbo code designs.

##### Implicit Data Structure

The concept of implicit data structure is expected to be further explored in the context of channel coding. The implicit data structure is a data structure that is used to represent the convolutional code. It is particularly useful in the context of underwater acoustic communication, where the propagation conditions can be challenging and the use of efficient data structures is crucial.

## Chapter 7: Underwater Acoustic Imaging

### Introduction

The ocean, with its vast expanse and mysterious depths, has always been a subject of fascination and exploration. The ability to see and understand what lies beneath the surface of the ocean is a crucial aspect of oceanography. This is where underwater acoustic imaging comes into play. In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of underwater acoustic imaging, exploring its principles, techniques, and applications.

Underwater acoustic imaging is a non-invasive technique that uses sound waves to create images of the underwater environment. This technique is particularly useful in the study of the ocean, where visibility is often limited due to the presence of particles and organisms in the water. By sending out sound waves and measuring the time it takes for them to bounce back, we can create a picture of the ocean floor, marine life, and other features.

The chapter will begin by introducing the basic principles of underwater acoustic imaging, including the generation and propagation of sound waves in the ocean. We will then explore the different types of underwater acoustic imaging techniques, such as single-beam and multi-beam imaging, and their respective advantages and disadvantages. 

Next, we will delve into the applications of underwater acoustic imaging in oceanography. This includes the mapping of the ocean floor, the study of marine life, and the detection of underwater objects. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of underwater acoustic imaging, and how these can be overcome.

Finally, we will touch upon the future of underwater acoustic imaging, discussing the latest advancements and future directions in this field. This includes the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in underwater acoustic imaging, and the potential for underwater acoustic imaging to contribute to the sustainable management of the ocean.

In this chapter, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of underwater acoustic imaging, from its basic principles to its advanced applications. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field of oceanography, we hope that this chapter will enhance your understanding of underwater acoustic imaging and its role in exploring the depths of sound in the ocean.




#### 6.2c Turbo Codes

Turbo codes are a type of error detection and correction code that are particularly well-suited for correcting burst errors. They are a family of linear error-correcting codes that work by convolving the transmitted data with a set of generator polynomials. This process allows them to detect and correct burst errors, making them ideal for use in underwater acoustic communication.

##### Turbo Codes in Underwater Acoustic Communication

In underwater acoustic communication, the propagation conditions can be challenging, leading to high error rates. Turbo codes are particularly useful in these conditions due to their ability to correct burst errors. This is because burst errors are common in underwater acoustics, where the signal can be disrupted by various factors such as water temperature, salinity, and pressure.

##### Turbo Codes and the BCJR Algorithm

The BCJR (Bahl, Cocke, Jelinek, and Raviv) algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states in a hidden Markov model. In the context of turbo codes, the BCJR algorithm is used for decoding the transmitted data. The algorithm works by finding the most likely sequence of transmitted data given the received data.

##### Concatenation with Outer Algebraic Codes

One issue with turbo codes is their susceptibility to error floors. An error floor is a phenomenon where the error rate does not decrease significantly even as the code rate is decreased. To address this issue, concatenation with an outer algebraic code, such as a Reed-Solomon code, can be used. This approach allows for the benefits of both types of codes, providing good performance at high code rates and also addressing the issue of error floors.

##### Implicit Data Structure

The implicit data structure is a concept that is closely related to turbo codes. It is a data structure that is used to represent the turbo code. The implicit data structure is particularly useful in the context of underwater acoustic communication, where the propagation conditions can be challenging and the error rates can be high. The implicit data structure allows for efficient decoding of the transmitted data, even in the presence of high error rates.

##### Conclusion

In conclusion, turbo codes are a powerful tool for error detection and correction in underwater acoustic communication. Their ability to correct burst errors makes them particularly useful in the challenging propagation conditions found in underwater acoustics. The BCJR algorithm, concatenation with outer algebraic codes, and the implicit data structure all play important roles in the performance of turbo codes in underwater acoustic communication.




#### 6.2d Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) Codes

Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes are a family of linear error-correcting codes that are particularly well-suited for correcting random errors. They are named as such because they have a low density of parity-check constraints, which makes them computationally efficient to decode. LDPC codes have been widely adopted in various communication systems, including underwater acoustic communication.
