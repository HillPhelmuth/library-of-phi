## Foreward

Welcome to "Competition in Telecommunications: A Comprehensive Guide". This book aims to provide a thorough understanding of the complex and ever-evolving landscape of competition in the telecommunications industry. As technology continues to advance and consumer demands shift, the telecommunications sector is constantly adapting and evolving. This book will delve into the various aspects of competition in this industry, from the strategic interactions between firms to the role of government policies and regulations.

The book is structured around the concept of hypercompetition, a term coined by Richard D'Aveni. Hypercompetition is a dynamic and multidimensional view of competition, where firms are constantly jockeying for position in the market. D'Aveni's theory of hypercompetition is based on four arenas of competition: price/quality, product variety, distribution channels, and speed. These arenas are not mutually exclusive, and firms must navigate them all to gain a competitive edge.

In the first arena, price/quality, firms compete on the basis of price and quality. This is where the concept of hypercompetition is most evident, as firms engage in price wars, quality and price positioning, and other strategic interactions. The goal is to gain a competitive advantage by offering products at a lower price or with higher quality than competitors. However, as D'Aveni points out, there is a tradeoff between quality and price, and firms must carefully navigate this tradeoff to achieve success.

The second arena, product variety, is where firms compete on the basis of the variety of products they offer. This can include product line length, product line depth, and product variety. Firms must constantly innovate and introduce new products to stay ahead of the competition.

The third arena, distribution channels, is where firms compete on the basis of how they distribute their products. This can include traditional methods such as retail stores and catalogs, as well as newer methods such as e-commerce and direct marketing. Firms must carefully consider which distribution channels will be most effective for their products.

The fourth arena, speed, is where firms compete on the basis of how quickly they can respond to changes in the market. This can include speed to market, speed to adapt, and speed to learn. In today's fast-paced telecommunications industry, speed is crucial for success.

Throughout the book, we will explore these arenas in more detail and discuss how they interact with each other. We will also examine real-world examples and case studies to illustrate these concepts and provide a deeper understanding of competition in the telecommunications industry.

I hope this book will serve as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and industry professionals interested in understanding the complexities of competition in telecommunications. Let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of hypercompetition in this dynamic and ever-changing industry.

### Section: 3.1 Economies of Scale and Scope:

### Subsection: 3.1a Definition and Examples

Economies of scale and scope are two important concepts in the economics of networks. They refer to the cost savings that can be achieved by increasing the size or scope of a network. In this section, we will define these concepts and provide some examples to illustrate their significance in the telecommunications industry.

#### Economies of Scale

Economies of scale refer to the cost savings that can be achieved by increasing the size of a network. This is often achieved through the law of large numbers, where the cost per unit decreases as the size of the network increases. In the telecommunications industry, this can be seen in the cost savings achieved by large telecommunications companies through economies of scale. For example, AT&T, one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world, can achieve significant cost savings by purchasing equipment and services in bulk, resulting in lower costs per unit.

Another example of economies of scale in the telecommunications industry is the concept of network externalities. Network externalities refer to the benefits that one user of a network receives from another user. In the telecommunications industry, this can be seen in the increased value of a network as more users join. For example, the more people who use a particular mobile network, the more valuable it becomes to each user, as they can connect with more people. This results in cost savings for the network provider, as they can charge higher prices for their services.

#### Economies of Scope

Economies of scope refer to the cost savings that can be achieved by expanding the scope of a network. This can be achieved through the use of common resources or by offering a wider range of services. In the telecommunications industry, this can be seen in the integration of different networks, such as mobile and internet networks. By using common resources, such as infrastructure and equipment, telecommunications companies can achieve cost savings and improve efficiency.

Another example of economies of scope in the telecommunications industry is the concept of bundling. Bundling refers to the practice of offering multiple services or products together at a discounted price. In the telecommunications industry, this can be seen in the bundling of mobile and internet services. By offering these services together, telecommunications companies can achieve cost savings and increase customer satisfaction.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, economies of scale and scope play a crucial role in the economics of networks in the telecommunications industry. By understanding these concepts and their implications, we can gain a better understanding of the dynamics of this industry and the factors that influence its behavior.

# Small cell

## Purpose

Small cells can be used to provide in-building and outdoor wireless service. Mobile operators use them to extend their service coverage and/or increase network capacity.

ABI Research argues that small cells also help service providers discover new revenue opportunities through their location and presence information. If a registered user enters a femtozone, the network is notified of their location. The service provider, with the user's permission, could share this location information to update user's social media status, for instance. Opening up small-cell APIs to the wider mobile ecosystem could enable a long-tail effect.

Rural coverage is also a key market that has developed as mobile operators have started to install public access metrocells in remote and rural areas that either have only 2G coverage or no coverage at all. The cost advantages of small cells compared with macro cells make it economically feasible to provide coverage of much smaller communities – from a few ten to a few hundred. The Small Cell Forum have published a white paper outlining the technology and business case aspects. Mobile operators in both developing and developed countries are either trialing or installing such systems. The pioneer in providing rural coverage using small cells was SoftBank Mobile – the Japanese mobile operator – who have installed more than 3000 public access 3G small cells on post offices throughout rural Japan. In the UK, Vodafone's Rural Open Sure Signal program and EE's rural 3G/4G scheme increase geographic coverage.

## Future mobile networks

Small cells are an integral part of LTE networks. In 3G networks, small cells are viewed as an offload technique. In 4G networks, the principle of heterogeneous network (HetNet) is introduced where the mobile network is constructed with layers of small and large cells. In LTE, all cells will be self-organizing, drawing upon the principles laid down in current Home NodeB (HNB), the 3GPP term for small cells. This will allow for more efficient use of spectrum and improve network performance.

Sunk costs are a fundamental concept in economics that play a crucial role in the telecommunications industry. In this subsection, we will define sunk costs and provide examples of how they impact competition in the industry.

#### Definition of Sunk Costs

Sunk costs are costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered. In other words, they are costs that have already been sunk into a project or investment. These costs are considered sunk because they cannot be recovered, regardless of the outcome of the project or investment.

In the context of telecommunications, sunk costs can refer to the initial investment made by telecommunications companies to build and maintain their networks. This includes the cost of infrastructure, equipment, and licenses. Once these costs have been incurred, they cannot be recovered, even if the company decides to exit the market.

#### Examples of Sunk Costs in Telecommunications

One example of sunk costs in telecommunications is the investment made by telecommunications companies to build and maintain their 4G networks. As mentioned in the previous section, the development and implementation of 5G networks is a highly anticipated future trend. This means that many telecommunications companies have already invested significant resources into building and maintaining their 4G networks.

However, with the imminent arrival of 5G networks, these investments may become obsolete. This is because 5G networks require different infrastructure and equipment than 4G networks. As a result, telecommunications companies may face significant costs in upgrading their networks to accommodate 5G technology.

Another example of sunk costs in telecommunications is the investment made by telecommunications companies to obtain licenses for spectrum. Spectrum licenses are essential for providing wireless services, and they can be expensive. Once a company has obtained a license, it cannot recover the cost if it decides to exit the market.

In conclusion, sunk costs play a crucial role in the telecommunications industry. They can impact competition by creating barriers to entry and exit, as well as influencing pricing strategies. Understanding sunk costs is essential for analyzing the economics of networks and regulation in the telecommunications industry.





### Subsection: 3.2b Impact on Telecoms Industry

The concept of sunk costs has a significant impact on the telecommunications industry. As mentioned earlier, sunk costs can refer to the initial investment made by telecommunications companies to build and maintain their networks. These costs are considered sunk because they cannot be recovered, regardless of the outcome of the project or investment.

In the telecommunications industry, sunk costs can have a significant impact on competition. Telecommunications companies that have already invested significant resources into building and maintaining their networks may face barriers to entry for new companies. This is because new companies would also need to make similar investments, which can be a significant barrier to entry.

Furthermore, sunk costs can also impact the decisions made by telecommunications companies. For example, if a company has already invested significant resources into building a 4G network, they may be hesitant to invest in 5G technology. This is because the costs of upgrading their network to accommodate 5G technology can be significant. As a result, they may choose to wait until the technology becomes more affordable or until they have recovered their initial investment.

Moreover, sunk costs can also impact the pricing strategies of telecommunications companies. Companies that have already invested significant resources into building their networks may choose to maintain high prices to recover their sunk costs. This can limit competition and hinder the entry of new companies into the market.

In conclusion, sunk costs play a crucial role in the telecommunications industry. They can impact competition, decision-making, and pricing strategies. As the industry continues to evolve, it is essential for telecommunications companies to consider the impact of sunk costs on their operations and strategies. 





#### 3.2c Strategies to Manage Sunk Costs

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of sunk costs and their impact on the telecommunications industry. In this section, we will explore some strategies that telecommunications companies can use to manage sunk costs and make more informed decisions.

One strategy that companies can use to manage sunk costs is to conduct a cost-benefit analysis. This involves evaluating the costs and benefits of a project or investment, taking into account both tangible and intangible factors. By considering the potential benefits of a project, companies can determine if the sunk costs are worth the potential gains. This can help them make more informed decisions about whether to continue with a project or invest in new technologies.

Another strategy is to consider the concept of "sunk cost fallacy." This refers to the tendency for individuals to continue investing in a project or relationship, even when the costs have already been incurred. In the telecommunications industry, this can lead to companies continuing to invest in outdated technologies or unprofitable markets, simply because they have already invested significant resources into them. By recognizing and avoiding the sunk cost fallacy, companies can make more rational decisions about where to allocate their resources.

In addition to these strategies, companies can also use game theory to manage sunk costs. Game theory is a mathematical framework for analyzing decision-making in situations where the outcome of one's choices depends on the choices of others. In the telecommunications industry, game theory can be used to analyze the behavior of competitors and make strategic decisions about investments and pricing. By considering the potential actions and reactions of competitors, companies can better manage their sunk costs and make more informed decisions.

Furthermore, companies can also use the concept of "option value" to manage sunk costs. Option value refers to the potential value of a project or investment that has not yet been fully realized. By considering the option value of a project, companies can determine if the potential gains outweigh the sunk costs. This can help them make more informed decisions about whether to continue with a project or invest in new technologies.

In conclusion, managing sunk costs is crucial for telecommunications companies to make more informed decisions and stay competitive in the industry. By conducting cost-benefit analyses, avoiding the sunk cost fallacy, using game theory, and considering option value, companies can better manage their sunk costs and make more strategic decisions. 





#### 3.3a Definition and Examples

Barriers to entry are a crucial aspect of competition in the telecommunications industry. They refer to the obstacles that prevent new companies from entering the market and competing with existing players. These barriers can take various forms, including high start-up costs, regulatory barriers, and network effects.

High start-up costs are a common barrier to entry in the telecommunications industry. The cost of building and maintaining a telecommunications network can be prohibitively high for new entrants, especially in developed markets where infrastructure is already well-established. This can limit the ability of new companies to enter the market and compete with existing players.

#### 3.4a Definition and Examples

Unbundled network elements (UNEs) are individual components of a telecommunications network that are made available for sale or lease to other telecommunications providers. This concept is a key aspect of network unbundling, a regulatory requirement in many countries that aims to promote competition and increase consumer choice in the telecommunications market.

UNEs can include a wide range of network elements, from physical infrastructure such as fibre-optic cables and cell towers, to software-based elements such as call routing and billing systems. The specific list of UNEs can vary depending on the regulatory framework in a particular country.

The concept of UNEs is closely related to the concept of network unbundling. Network unbundling refers to the separation of a telecommunications network into its individual components, which are then made available for sale or lease to other providers. This is in contrast to the traditional model of network ownership and control by a single provider.

The goal of network unbundling and the sale of UNEs is to promote competition in the telecommunications market. By allowing other providers to access and use the network elements, new entrants can enter the market more easily and compete with existing providers. This can lead to increased innovation, improved network quality, and lower prices for consumers.

However, the implementation of network unbundling and the sale of UNEs can be complex and challenging. It requires a robust regulatory framework to ensure fair and transparent access to network elements, as well as effective dispute resolution mechanisms. It also requires significant investment in network infrastructure and technology, which may not be feasible for all providers.

Deregulation in the telecommunications industry has been a topic of significant debate and discussion since the 1980s. The concept of deregulation, or the removal of government control and oversight, has been applied to various industries, including telecommunications, with the aim of promoting competition and innovation. In the United States, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 marked a significant step towards deregulation in the telecommunications industry.

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was a comprehensive piece of legislation that aimed to modernize the telecommunications industry and promote competition. It was a response to the rapid technological advancements in the industry and the increasing demand for telecommunications services. The Act was designed to create a level playing field for all telecommunications providers, regardless of their size or type of service.

One of the key provisions of the Telecommunications Act was the introduction of the Local Loop Unbundling (LLU) regime. This regime allowed other telecommunications providers to access the local loop, or the final section of the telephone network that connects a customer's premises to the telephone exchange. This was a significant departure from the previous regime, where the local loop was considered a natural monopoly and was therefore not subject to competition.

The LLU regime was designed to promote competition by allowing other telecommunications providers to offer services directly to customers, without having to build their own infrastructure. This was expected to drive down prices and stimulate innovation in the industry. However, the implementation of LLU has been a complex and contentious issue, with various challenges and limitations.

In the next sections, we will delve deeper into the impact of deregulation and the Telecommunications Act on the telecommunications industry. We will explore the challenges and opportunities that have arisen, and discuss the implications for competition and innovation in the industry.

The telecommunications industry is a highly regulated sector, with governments around the world playing a crucial role in shaping the industry and ensuring its smooth functioning. In the United States, the government's involvement in telecommunications dates back to the early 20th century, with the establishment of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1934. The FCC is an independent agency responsible for regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable.

The primary goal of government regulation in telecommunications is to promote competition and ensure that consumers have access to affordable and reliable services. This is achieved through various policies and regulations, such as licensing requirements, spectrum allocation, and antitrust laws. The government also plays a crucial role in addressing issues such as privacy and security, as well as promoting innovation and technological advancements in the industry.

One of the key aspects of government regulation in telecommunications is spectrum allocation. Spectrum is a limited resource, and its allocation is a complex and contentious issue. The government is responsible for managing and allocating spectrum to different users, such as telecommunications companies, broadcasters, and government agencies. This is done through a process of licensing, where the government grants licenses to use specific frequencies for a certain period of time. The government also sets rules and regulations for spectrum usage, such as power limits and interference standards, to ensure fair and efficient use of spectrum.

Another important aspect of government regulation is antitrust laws. These laws are designed to promote competition and prevent monopolies from forming in the market. In the telecommunications industry, antitrust laws are used to prevent companies from merging or acquiring other companies that would result in a dominant market position. This is done to ensure that there is enough competition in the market to keep prices low and services high-quality.

The government also plays a crucial role in addressing issues such as privacy and security in the telecommunications industry. With the increasing use of technology and the collection of vast amounts of data, there are concerns about privacy and the protection of personal information. The government has implemented regulations, such as the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), to ensure that telecommunications companies provide law enforcement agencies with access to communication data for legitimate purposes. Additionally, the government also plays a role in addressing cybersecurity threats and ensuring the protection of critical infrastructure in the telecommunications industry.

In conclusion, government regulation plays a vital role in shaping the telecommunications industry in the United States.

One of the main drawbacks of spectrum auctions is the potential for demand reduction and collusive bidding. As mentioned in the previous section, when bidder competition is weak and one bidder holds an apparent advantage to win the auction for specific licenses, other bidders may choose not to bid for higher prices. This reduces the final revenue generated by the auction and can be seen as a form of collusion among bidders. This can be difficult to identify and regulate, as the structure of spectrum auctions can make it challenging to distinguish collusive from non-collusive bidding.

#### Complexity and Cost

Another drawback of spectrum auctions is their complexity and cost. Spectrum auctions require a significant amount of resources, both in terms of time and money. The process of auctioning off spectrum licenses can be lengthy and involve multiple rounds of bidding, which can be costly for both the government and the bidders. Additionally, the complexity of the auction process can make it difficult for smaller companies to participate, limiting competition and innovation in the market.

#### Spectrum Hoarding

Spectrum auctions can also lead to spectrum hoarding, where companies acquire more spectrum licenses than they actually need. This can limit the availability of spectrum for other companies and hinder competition in the market. Spectrum hoarding can also result in inefficient use of spectrum, as companies may not utilize all of the spectrum they have acquired.

#### Alternative Allocation Methods

Finally, there are alternative methods for allocating spectrum resources that may be more efficient and effective than spectrum auctions. For example, the government could allocate spectrum licenses directly to companies based on their need and ability to utilize the spectrum. This method can avoid the potential drawbacks of spectrum auctions, such as collusive bidding and spectrum hoarding, while still promoting competition and innovation in the market.

In conclusion, while spectrum auctions have proven to be a valuable tool for allocating spectrum resources, they also have some drawbacks that must be considered. It is important for policymakers and regulators to carefully consider these drawbacks and potential alternatives in order to make informed decisions about spectrum allocation.

## Chapter 18: The Role of Government Policies in Telecoms




### Subsection: 17.2a Impact of Market Forces on Regulatory Framework

Market forces play a crucial role in shaping the regulatory framework for telecommunications. The competitive dynamics of the market, including the number and size of players, the level of market concentration, and the intensity of competition, all have a significant impact on the regulatory landscape.

#### Market Concentration and Regulation

Market concentration, as defined by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), is a key factor in determining the level of competition in a market. A high level of market concentration can lead to a decrease in competition and increased market power for the dominant firms. This can result in higher costs, less quality, fewer options, and less innovation for consumers. Therefore, regulators often monitor market concentration levels to ensure that competition is not stifled.

However, the relationship between market concentration and innovation is complex and not always straightforward. Schumpeter (1950) argued that a higher concentrated market would facilitate innovation, as firms with the greatest market share have the greatest opportunity to benefit from their innovations. This is particularly true through investment into research and development (R&D). However, Arrow (1962) posited that a greater market concentration would decrease incentive to innovate because a firm within a monopoly or monopolistic market would have already reached profit levels that greatly exceed costs.

In practice, there are complications in observing the direct correlation between market concentration and its effect on innovation. For example, Connelly and Hirschey (1984) found a negative correlation, explaining that the correlation evidenced a decreased expenditure on R&D by oligopolistic firms to benefit from greater monopolised profits. However, Blundell et al. observed a positive correlation by tallying the patents lodged by firms. This general observation was also shared by Aghion et al. in 2005.

#### Regulatory Response to Market Forces

In response to these market forces, regulators often implement policies to promote competition and prevent market power from being abused. This can include setting price caps, limiting mergers and acquisitions, and promoting network neutrality. Regulators also monitor market concentration levels to ensure that competition is not stifled.

However, the relationship between market concentration and innovation is complex and not always straightforward. Therefore, regulators must balance the need for competition with the potential negative effects of market concentration on innovation. This can be a challenging task, as it requires a deep understanding of both market dynamics and the technological opportunities that drive innovation.

In conclusion, market forces play a crucial role in shaping the regulatory framework for telecommunications. Understanding the impact of market forces on regulation is essential for anyone studying or working in this field.

In response to this, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has implemented various regulations to promote competition and prevent anti-competitive practices. For instance, the FCC has imposed net neutrality rules to prevent internet service providers (ISPs) from discriminating against certain content providers. It has also implemented rules to promote competition in the mobile market, such as the Open Handset Alliance, which aims to promote open standards for mobile devices.

However, the effectiveness of these regulations is a subject of ongoing debate. Some argue that they have not been able to significantly increase competition, while others argue that they have been instrumental in promoting innovation and consumer welfare.

#### Case Study 2: The Impact of Market Forces on Regulation in the European Telecommunications Market

The European telecommunications market, unlike the US market, is characterized by a high level of market concentration. This has led to concerns about stifled competition and reduced innovation.

In response to this, the European Commission has implemented various regulations to promote competition and prevent anti-competitive practices. For instance, it has imposed regulations to promote network neutrality and prevent discrimination against certain content providers. It has also implemented regulations to promote competition in the mobile market, such as the Mobile Termination Rates (MTR) regulation, which aims to reduce the cost of mobile termination calls.

However, the effectiveness of these regulations is also a subject of ongoing debate. Some argue that they have not been able to significantly increase competition, while others argue that they have been instrumental in promoting innovation and consumer welfare.

### 19.3 Mergers and Acquisitions and Competition

#### 19.3a Impact of Mergers and Acquisitions on Competition

Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have a profound impact on competition in the telecommunications industry. The process of M&A can either enhance or reduce competition, depending on the nature of the transaction and the market conditions.

One of the key ways in which M&A can impact competition is through the creation of market power. When two companies merge, they can potentially create a dominant player in the market, with the ability to influence prices and market conditions. This can lead to reduced competition, as the merged entity can use its market power to limit competition and raise prices. This is particularly true in industries with high barriers to entry, such as the telecommunications industry.

However, M&A can also enhance competition by creating efficiencies and driving innovation. When two companies merge, they can combine their resources and expertise to create new products and services, or to improve existing ones. This can lead to increased competition, as the merged entity can offer more innovative and competitive products and services.

Moreover, M&A can also lead to increased competition by creating a more level playing field. When a larger company acquires a smaller one, the smaller company can benefit from the resources and expertise of the larger company, potentially allowing it to compete more effectively with larger players in the market.

However, M&A can also lead to reduced competition if the transaction results in a significant reduction in the number of competitors in the market. This can be particularly problematic if the transaction results in a dominant player in the market, with the ability to influence prices and market conditions.

In conclusion, M&A can have a significant impact on competition in the telecommunications industry.
