### Subsection: 1.1a Defining Sustainability

Sustainability is a normative concept, meaning it is based on what people value or find desirable. It is a concept that is constantly evolving and adapting to the changing needs and values of society. The 1983 UN Commission on Environment and Development (Brundtland Commission) had a significant influence on how we use the term "sustainability" today. The commission's 1987 Brundtland Report provided a definition of sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs". This definition helped bring "sustainability" into the mainstream of policy discussions and popularized the concept of "sustainable development".

Some other key concepts to illustrate the meaning of sustainability include:

- Environmental sustainability: This refers to the ability to maintain the natural resources and ecosystems that support life on Earth. It involves balancing the use of resources with their conservation to ensure their availability for future generations.
- Economic sustainability: This refers to the ability to maintain a stable and thriving economy without depleting resources or causing harm to the environment. It involves responsible economic practices that consider the long-term impacts on society and the environment.
- Social sustainability: This refers to the ability to maintain a just and equitable society that meets the needs of all individuals and communities. It involves promoting social equity, inclusivity, and human rights in all aspects of development.

In everyday usage, "sustainability" often focuses on the environmental dimension. However, it is important to recognize that sustainability is a holistic concept that encompasses all three dimensions. A truly sustainable development must balance environmental, economic, and social factors to ensure a better quality of life for both present and future generations.

### Conclusion

### Subsection: 1.1b Importance of Sustainability

Sustainability is a crucial concept in today's world. It is a response to the growing concern for the long-term maintenance of well-being in the face of complex environmental, economic, and social change. The term "sustainability" has been widely used since the 1987 Brundtland Report, which defined sustainable development as development that "meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs". This definition highlights the importance of considering the long-term impacts of our actions on the environment, economy, and society.

The concept of sustainability is closely tied to the idea of resilience. Resilience is the ability to withstand and recover from shocks and stresses, and it is a key factor in achieving sustainability. A resilient system is one that can maintain its functions and structures in the face of disturbances, and can adapt and grow in response to changes. This is especially important in the context of sustainable development, as we must be able to withstand and adapt to the complex and interconnected challenges we face.

In the next section, we will explore the global problems that have led to the need for sustainable development, and the local actions that can be taken to address these issues.

## Chapter 1:: Framing Sustainability: Global Problems and Local Actions




### Subsection: 1.2a Economic Perspective

The economic perspective is a crucial aspect of framing sustainability. It is through this lens that we can understand the trade-offs and opportunities that arise in the pursuit of sustainable development. In this section, we will explore the economic dimensions of sustainability and how they intersect with environmental and social considerations.

#### The Economy, Economics for a Changing World

The economy is a complex system that encompasses the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. It is a key driver of social and environmental change, and therefore plays a significant role in sustainability. The CORE Team's book, "The Economy, Economics for a Changing World", provides a comprehensive overview of the economy and its role in sustainability.

The book begins by defining the economy as "the system that connects the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services". This definition highlights the interconnectedness of economic activity and its impact on society and the environment. The book then delves into the principles of economics, including supply and demand, market equilibrium, and economic growth.

The CORE Team also explores the concept of economic security, which is widely believed to involve a trade-off between economic security and economic opportunity. This trade-off is a key consideration in the pursuit of sustainable development, as it requires balancing the needs of the present generation with the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

#### The Role of Economics in Sustainability

Economics plays a crucial role in sustainability, as it provides the tools and frameworks for understanding and addressing global problems. The CORE Team's book emphasizes the importance of considering the long-term impacts of economic activity on the environment and society. This is in line with the principles of sustainable development, which aim to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

The book also highlights the role of economics in promoting sustainable practices. For example, it discusses the concept of green growth, which involves promoting economic growth while reducing environmental impact. This is achieved through policies and incentives that encourage the use of sustainable technologies and practices.

#### The Economy and Sustainable Development

The economy is a key driver of sustainable development, as it is responsible for the majority of environmental and social impacts. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the economic dimensions of sustainability when planning for sustainable development. This includes understanding the economic impacts of environmental and social policies, as well as promoting economic growth that is both environmentally and socially sustainable.

In conclusion, the economic perspective is a crucial aspect of framing sustainability. It provides the tools and frameworks for understanding the trade-offs and opportunities in the pursuit of sustainable development. By considering the economic dimensions of sustainability, we can better plan for a future that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.





### Subsection: 1.2b Environmental Perspective

The environmental perspective is another crucial aspect of framing sustainability. It is through this lens that we can understand the impact of human activities on the natural world and the steps that can be taken to mitigate these impacts. In this section, we will explore the environmental dimensions of sustainability and how they intersect with economic and social considerations.

#### The Environment, A System of Systems

The environment is a complex system that encompasses all living and non-living things. It is a system of systems, each with its own unique characteristics and interdependencies. The environment is not just the natural world, but also the built environment, which includes all the structures and systems that humans have created.

The environment is also a system that is constantly changing. These changes can be driven by natural processes, such as climate change, or by human activities, such as deforestation and pollution. These changes can have significant impacts on the health and well-being of both humans and the natural world.

#### The Role of the Environment in Sustainability

The environment plays a crucial role in sustainability. It is the foundation upon which all human activity depends. Without a healthy environment, human well-being is at risk. Therefore, sustainability requires a commitment to preserving and enhancing the environment for future generations.

The environmental perspective also highlights the importance of understanding the interdependencies between the environment, economy, and society. For example, economic activity can have significant impacts on the environment, and these impacts can in turn have economic and social consequences. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of sustainability requires a deep understanding of these interdependencies.

#### The Environmental Perspective in Practice

The environmental perspective is not just a theoretical concept, but a practical approach to sustainability. It involves taking action to protect and enhance the environment, while also considering the economic and social impacts of these actions. This can involve a range of activities, from reducing carbon emissions to promoting sustainable land use practices.

The environmental perspective also involves a commitment to long-term thinking. This means considering the impacts of our actions not just on the present generation, but also on future generations. It requires a shift from short-term thinking to long-term thinking, and a recognition that our actions today will have consequences for generations to come.

In conclusion, the environmental perspective is a crucial aspect of framing sustainability. It provides a framework for understanding the complex interdependencies between the environment, economy, and society, and for taking action to promote sustainable development.




### Subsection: 1.2c Social Perspective

The social perspective is a crucial aspect of framing sustainability. It is through this lens that we can understand the impact of human activities on society and the steps that can be taken to mitigate these impacts. In this section, we will explore the social dimensions of sustainability and how they intersect with economic and environmental considerations.

#### Society, A System of Systems

Society is a complex system that encompasses all human beings and their interactions. It is a system of systems, each with its own unique characteristics and interdependencies. Society is also a system that is constantly changing. These changes can be driven by social, economic, political, and cultural factors.

The social system is not just the human world, but also the system of human-environment interactions. These interactions can have significant impacts on both humans and the environment. For example, social norms and behaviors can influence environmental practices, and environmental changes can impact social structures and interactions.

#### The Role of Society in Sustainability

The social perspective plays a crucial role in sustainability. It is through society that we can understand and address the global problems that we face. Society is the context in which these problems arise, and it is through societal action that we can find solutions.

The social perspective also highlights the importance of understanding the interdependencies between society, economy, and environment. For example, economic policies can have significant social impacts, and these impacts can in turn have environmental consequences. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of sustainability requires a deep understanding of these interdependencies.

#### The Social Perspective in Practice

The social perspective is not just a theoretical concept, but a practical approach to sustainability. It involves understanding the complex interactions between individuals, groups, and institutions, and how these interactions can be managed to promote sustainability.

One practical application of the social perspective is the concept of social sustainability. This refers to the ability of a society to meet the needs of its current members without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It involves promoting social equity, social cohesion, and social resilience.

Another practical application is the concept of social innovation. This refers to the development and implementation of new ideas, products, and processes that can address social problems and promote sustainability. It involves collaboration between different sectors, including government, business, and civil society.

In conclusion, the social perspective is a crucial aspect of framing sustainability. It provides a lens through which we can understand the complex interactions between humans and their environment, and the steps that can be taken to promote sustainability.




### Subsection: 1.3a Sustainability in Developed Countries

Developed countries, also known as industrialized countries, are typically characterized by high levels of economic development, industrialization, and urbanization. These countries are often the leaders in technological advancements and have a high standard of living. However, their development has also brought about significant environmental and social challenges that need to be addressed in the pursuit of sustainability.

#### The Environmental Perspective

The environmental perspective of sustainability in developed countries is often characterized by a focus on reducing waste and pollution. Developed countries, particularly the United States, are known for their high levels of waste generation. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), per capita waste generation in OECD countries has increased by 14% since 1990, and 35% since 1980. This is largely due to the high levels of consumption and the types of waste generated, which include plastics, metals, and paper.

However, there have been efforts to reduce waste generation in developed countries. For instance, the European Union has implemented the Waste Framework Directive, which aims to reduce the amount of waste generated and promote recycling and recovery of waste. Similarly, the United States has the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which regulates the management of hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste.

#### The Social Perspective

The social perspective of sustainability in developed countries is often focused on addressing social inequalities and promoting social inclusion. Developed countries have some of the highest levels of income inequality in the world. According to the OECD, the richest 10% of the population in OECD countries earn on average 9.6 times more than the poorest 10%. This inequality can have significant social and environmental impacts.

For instance, low-income households in developed countries often face challenges in accessing affordable and healthy food options, leading to food insecurity. This not only has social implications but also environmental implications, as these households may resort to cheaper, less environmentally friendly food options.

#### The Intersection of Environmental and Social Perspectives

The environmental and social perspectives of sustainability are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they often intersect and influence each other. For instance, efforts to reduce waste generation in developed countries can also address social inequalities. By promoting recycling and recovery of waste, developed countries can create job opportunities, particularly for marginalized communities. Similarly, addressing food insecurity can also have environmental benefits, as it can lead to a shift towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly food production and consumption practices.

In conclusion, sustainability in developed countries is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive understanding of the environmental, social, and economic dimensions. By addressing these dimensions in a holistic manner, developed countries can work towards a more sustainable future.




### Subsection: 1.3b Sustainability in Developing Countries

Developing countries, also known as emerging markets, are typically characterized by lower levels of economic development, industrialization, and urbanization compared to developed countries. These countries often face unique challenges in their pursuit of sustainability, which are often intertwined with their efforts to achieve economic growth and development.

#### The Environmental Perspective

The environmental perspective of sustainability in developing countries is often characterized by a focus on resource conservation and pollution reduction. Developing countries often have limited natural resources and face significant environmental challenges, such as deforestation, water scarcity, and air and water pollution.

For instance, in Sub-Saharan Africa, deforestation rates are among the highest in the world, with an average annual loss of 2.8% of tree cover between 2001 and 2015. This deforestation is primarily driven by the expansion of agriculture, which is a major contributor to the region's economy. However, it also exacerbates environmental challenges, such as soil degradation and loss of biodiversity.

In terms of pollution, developing countries often have lower levels of air and water pollution compared to developed countries. However, their levels of pollution are increasing rapidly as they industrialize and urbanize. For instance, in China, the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, emissions have increased by 1,000% since 1990.

#### The Social Perspective

The social perspective of sustainability in developing countries is often focused on addressing social inequalities and promoting social inclusion. Developing countries often have high levels of income inequality, with the richest 10% of the population earning on average 60 times more than the poorest 10%. This inequality can have significant social and environmental impacts.

For instance, low-income households in developing countries often lack access to basic services, such as clean water, sanitation, and education. This can lead to a range of social and environmental issues, such as malnutrition, disease, and environmental degradation.

#### The Economic Perspective

The economic perspective of sustainability in developing countries is often focused on achieving economic growth and development while minimizing negative environmental and social impacts. This can be a challenging balance, as developing countries often need to invest in infrastructure and industries to stimulate economic growth. However, these investments can also have significant environmental and social impacts.

For instance, large-scale infrastructure projects, such as dams and roads, can displace communities and disrupt ecosystems. Similarly, the expansion of industries, such as mining and manufacturing, can lead to pollution and resource depletion.

In conclusion, sustainability in developing countries is a complex issue that requires a holistic approach. It involves balancing environmental, social, and economic considerations to achieve long-term development goals. This requires a commitment from all stakeholders, including governments, businesses, and communities, to work together towards a sustainable future.




### Subsection: 1.3c Comparing Sustainability Practices

As we have seen in the previous sections, sustainability practices vary greatly across different countries and regions. This is due to a variety of factors, including cultural norms, economic development, and environmental conditions. In this section, we will delve deeper into the comparison of sustainability practices, focusing on the United States and the European Union.

#### The United States

The United States has been a leader in the development and implementation of sustainability practices. The country has a long history of environmental activism and has been at the forefront of many environmental initiatives. For instance, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established in 1970, and has since been instrumental in setting and enforcing environmental standards.

In terms of energy efficiency, the US has made significant strides. The Energy Policy Act of 2005, for example, introduced a number of energy efficiency provisions, including tax incentives for energy-efficient buildings and appliances. The Act also established the Energy Star program, which sets energy efficiency standards for a wide range of products, from computers to dishwashers.

However, the US still faces significant challenges in terms of sustainability. The country is one of the largest consumers of energy and resources in the world, and its high levels of consumption have significant environmental impacts. For instance, the US is the world's second largest emitter of carbon dioxide, with emissions that have increased by 15% since 1990.

#### The European Union

The European Union (EU) has also been a leader in the development of sustainability practices. The EU has been instrumental in setting and enforcing environmental standards, and has been a pioneer in the development of green technologies. For instance, the EU's Renewable Energy Directive, adopted in 2009, set a target of 20% renewable energy consumption by 2020.

In terms of energy efficiency, the EU has made significant strides. The EU's Energy Efficiency Directive, adopted in 2012, set a target of 20% energy efficiency improvement by 2020. The EU has also been a leader in the development of energy-efficient buildings, with initiatives such as the Passiv Haus standard and the BREEAM certification scheme.

However, the EU also faces significant challenges in terms of sustainability. The EU is home to some of the world's largest and most energy-intensive industries, and its high levels of consumption have significant environmental impacts. For instance, the EU is the world's third largest emitter of carbon dioxide, with emissions that have increased by 10% since 1990.

In conclusion, while both the US and the EU have made significant strides in terms of sustainability, there is still much work to be done. The comparison of sustainability practices in these two regions highlights the importance of a comprehensive and integrated approach to sustainability, one that takes into account not only environmental considerations, but also social and economic factors.

## Chapter 2: Understanding and Managing Change in Organizational Settings:




### Subsection: 2.1a Role of Innovation in Sustainability

Innovation plays a crucial role in the pursuit of sustainability. It is the driving force behind the development of new products, processes, and technologies that can help organizations reduce their environmental impact and contribute to a more sustainable future. In this section, we will explore the role of innovation in sustainability and how it can be effectively managed in organizational settings.

#### The Importance of Innovation in Sustainability

Innovation is essential for sustainability because it allows organizations to develop new ways of doing things that can help them reduce their environmental impact. This can include the development of new products that are more environmentally friendly, the implementation of new processes that use resources more efficiently, or the adoption of new technologies that can help reduce emissions or waste.

Moreover, innovation can also play a crucial role in addressing the challenges and opportunities that come with sustainable development. For instance, the need to reduce carbon emissions can drive organizations to innovate and develop new technologies or processes that can help them achieve this goal. Similarly, the need to adapt to changing environmental conditions can also spur innovation, as organizations look for new ways to respond to these changes.

#### Managing Innovation for Sustainability

Managing innovation for sustainability involves creating an environment that encourages and supports the development of new ideas and technologies. This can include creating a culture of innovation, where employees are encouraged to think creatively and come up with new ideas. It can also involve providing resources and support for innovation, such as funding for research and development or training for employees.

In addition, managing innovation for sustainability also involves effectively managing the change that comes with innovation. This can include communicating the benefits of innovation to employees and stakeholders, involving them in the process, and providing support and resources for the implementation of new ideas or technologies.

#### Eco-Innovation and Sustainability

Eco-innovation, as defined by Klaus Rennings, refers to three kinds of changes related to sustainable development: technological, social, and institutional innovation. Technological innovation involves the development of new products and processes that reduce environmental impact. Social innovation focuses on changing societal attitudes and behaviors towards sustainability, while institutional innovation involves creating new policies and regulations that support sustainable development.

Eco-innovation plays a crucial role in sustainability as it allows organizations to address the environmental, social, and institutional aspects of sustainable development. By promoting eco-innovation, organizations can contribute to a more sustainable future and help address the global challenges we face.

In conclusion, innovation plays a vital role in sustainability, and managing it effectively is crucial for organizations to achieve their sustainability goals. By creating an environment that encourages innovation and effectively managing the change that comes with it, organizations can contribute to a more sustainable future.




### Subsection: 2.1b Sustainable Innovation Practices

Sustainable innovation practices are essential for organizations to achieve long-term success in business. These practices involve the integration of sustainability principles into the innovation process, resulting in the development of products, processes, and technologies that not only address the needs of current customers but also create new markets and displace established competitors.

#### Sustainable Innovation and Disruptive Technology

Sustainable innovation is often enabled by disruptive technology. Disruptive technology, as defined by Marco Iansiti and Karim R. Lakhani, is a foundational technology that has the potential to create new foundations for global technology systems over the longer term. These technologies tend to transform business operating models, leading to the emergence of new business models and the gradual and steady adoption of the innovation, resulting in waves of technological and institutional change that gain momentum more slowly.

One example of disruptive technology is the packet-switched communication protocol TCP/IP, which was originally introduced in 1972 to support a single use case for the United States Department of Defense electronic communication (email). It gained widespread adoption only in the mid-1990s with the advent of the World Wide Web, leading to a disruptive innovation that transformed the way we communicate and access information.

#### Sustainable Innovation and the Four Types Innovation Model

Another framework for understanding innovation is the four types innovation model proposed by Henderson and Clark. This model divides innovation into four types: process innovation, product innovation, marketing innovation, and organizational innovation. While these types of innovation are often discussed in terms of technical innovation, there are other kinds of innovation as well, such as service innovation and organizational innovation.

#### Non-economic Innovation

The classical definition of innovation, as proposed by Henderson and Clark, is limited to economic innovation. However, there are other kinds of innovation that are not driven by economic factors. For instance, social innovation refers to the development of new solutions to social problems, while environmental innovation focuses on the development of products, processes, and technologies that have a positive impact on the environment.

In conclusion, sustainable innovation practices involve the integration of sustainability principles into the innovation process, resulting in the development of products, processes, and technologies that not only address the needs of current customers but also create new markets and displace established competitors. This can be achieved through the effective management of change, communication, and collaboration within the organization.

### Section: 3.1 Building a Story about Change:

Change is a fundamental aspect of sustainable development. It is the driving force behind any development project, whether it is a small-scale community initiative or a large-scale government program. However, change is not always easy to achieve, and it requires careful planning and consideration. In this section, we will explore the importance of building a story about change in the planning process for sustainable development.

#### 3.1a Understanding Change

Before we can effectively plan for change, we must first understand what change is and how it can be achieved. Change is the process of moving from one state to another, and it can be brought about by various factors such as external influences, internal forces, or a combination of both. In the context of sustainable development, change is often driven by the need to address environmental, social, or economic issues.

To effectively plan for change, we must first identify the current state and the desired state. The current state is the existing situation, while the desired state is the desired outcome or goal. The gap between these two states is where change needs to occur. By understanding the current state and the desired state, we can identify the necessary steps to bridge the gap and achieve the desired change.

#### 3.1b Building a Story about Change

Once we have identified the current state and the desired state, we can begin building a story about change. This story is a narrative that explains the need for change, the steps that will be taken to achieve it, and the expected outcomes. It is a powerful tool for communicating the importance of change and gaining support for it.

Building a story about change involves understanding the stakeholders involved and their perspectives. Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have a vested interest in the project or development. They can include community members, government officials, NGOs, and other organizations. By understanding their perspectives, we can tailor the story to address their concerns and gain their support.

#### 3.1c Communicating Change

Communicating change is a crucial aspect of the planning process. It involves effectively conveying the story of change to stakeholders and the wider community. This can be done through various means, such as presentations, workshops, and community meetings. The goal of communication is to create awareness and understanding of the need for change and the steps that will be taken to achieve it.

Effective communication also involves addressing any concerns or questions that stakeholders may have. This can be done through open and transparent dialogue, where stakeholders are given the opportunity to voice their concerns and have them addressed. By addressing these concerns, we can build trust and support for the proposed change.

#### 3.1d In-class Critique

In-class critique is a valuable tool for evaluating and refining the story of change. It involves presenting the story to a group of peers and receiving feedback and critiques. This can help identify any weaknesses or areas that need improvement in the story. It also allows for a collaborative approach to building the story, where peers can offer suggestions and ideas for improvement.

In-class critique can also be a valuable learning experience for students. By critiquing the stories of their peers, they can gain a deeper understanding of the planning process and the challenges involved in achieving change. It also allows for a more interactive and engaging learning experience, where students can learn from each other and apply their knowledge to real-world scenarios.

In conclusion, building a story about change is a crucial aspect of the planning process for sustainable development. It involves understanding the current state and desired state, communicating the need for change, and addressing stakeholder concerns. In-class critique is a valuable tool for refining the story and gaining a deeper understanding of the planning process. By effectively building and communicating a story about change, we can create a more sustainable future for all.

## Design

While improved systems of governance, decision-making and planning can assist, biophysical sustainability is ultimately a design problem. To compensate for past system design errors, fundamental reforms of design methods and processes are required. PD proposes means to reduce material flows without tradeoffs by, for example, creating mutual gains and ‘low-impact luxury’ environments. PD contends that eco-positive design is already possible, partly through the integration of natural systems with building structures, spaces and surfaces (e.g. ‘living machines’, mycology, ‘algaetecture’). PD contributes other design concepts (e.g. ‘design for eco-services’, ‘green scaffolding’ ‘green space walls’, ‘solar core’ and ‘piggyback roof, ‘playgardens’).Digital sustainability can stimulate empirical advances in entrepreneurship, innovation and strategy and has the potential to have a positive impact on society.

### Design for Eco-services

The term ‘ecosystem services’ generally applies only to human benefits, which are usually valued by units (e.g. money, carbon or energy. PD uses the term ‘eco-services’ to include not only nature's instrumental (pragmatic) values like ecosystem goods and services, but its intrinsic (priceless) and ‘biophilic’ values. PD considers the value of nature to be ‘infinite’ as it is not only the basis of the economy, but essential to human existence itself. To counteract the ecological footprint of existing development, ‘surplus’ natural and social capital - assessed from fixed biophysical baselines - must be created both off-site and on-site by design.

### Carbon-neutral Design

Net positive energy is barred by the laws of physics. Moreover, calculations of ‘net energy’ seldom include the embodied energy - let alone ecological impacts incurred during resource extraction, production and transportation. With substantial passive solar design and renewable energy, buildings can send unused energy back to the grid, but this is not enough to achieve carbon-neutrality. To achieve this, PD proposes a new approach to design that focuses on reducing energy consumption and promoting energy efficiency. This approach, known as ‘carbon-neutral design’, aims to create buildings that produce as much energy as they consume, resulting in a net-zero carbon footprint. This approach is crucial in the fight against climate change and can be achieved through various strategies, including incorporating renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and implementing sustainable building materials. By adopting carbon-neutral design, we can work towards a more sustainable future and reduce our impact on the environment.
