### Introduction

Sulfur is a crucial element in the biogeochemical cycles of the Earth, playing a vital role in various biological and geological processes. Its abundance and diversity make it a key component in understanding the functioning of ecosystems and the global carbon cycle. In this chapter, we will delve into the theory of stable isotope fractionation, a powerful tool for studying the biogeochemistry of sulfur.

Stable isotope fractionation is a phenomenon where different isotopes of an element partition differently between different chemical species. This theory is based on the principle of quantum mechanics, which predicts that atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons (and therefore different atomic masses) will behave slightly differently. This results in the preferential uptake of certain isotopes by organisms and minerals, leading to variations in the isotopic composition of different forms of sulfur.

The theory of stable isotope fractionation has been extensively studied and applied in various fields, including biochemistry, geochemistry, and environmental science. It has provided valuable insights into the metabolic pathways of sulfur in organisms, the cycling of sulfur in the environment, and the effects of human activities on these processes.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental principles of stable isotope fractionation, its applications in the study of sulfur, and the current state of research in this field. We will also discuss the challenges and future directions in the study of stable isotope fractionation of sulfur.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive guide to the theory of stable isotope fractionation, equipping readers with the knowledge and tools to understand and apply this concept in their own research.

### Subsection: 1.1a Introduction to Stable Isotope Fractionation

Stable isotope fractionation is a fundamental concept in the field of biogeochemistry, particularly in the study of sulfur. It is a phenomenon that occurs when different isotopes of an element partition differently between different chemical species. This theory is based on the principle of quantum mechanics, which predicts that atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons (and therefore different atomic masses) will behave slightly differently. This results in the preferential uptake of certain isotopes by organisms and minerals, leading to variations in the isotopic composition of different forms of sulfur.

The theory of stable isotope fractionation has been extensively studied and applied in various fields, including biochemistry, geochemistry, and environmental science. It has provided valuable insights into the metabolic pathways of sulfur in organisms, the cycling of sulfur in the environment, and the effects of human activities on these processes.

In this section, we will explore the fundamental principles of stable isotope fractionation, its applications in the study of sulfur, and the current state of research in this field. We will also discuss the challenges and future directions in the study of stable isotope fractionation of sulfur.

#### 1.1a.1 Isotope Fractionation Factors

Isotope fractionation factors (α) are a key concept in stable isotope fractionation theory. They represent the ratio of the concentration of a heavier isotope to a lighter isotope in a particular compound or molecule. For example, in the case of sulfur, the α value would represent the ratio of the concentration of sulfur-34 to sulfur-32 in a particular sulfur compound.

The α value is a dimensionless number and can range from 0 to infinity. A α value of 1 indicates no isotope fractionation, meaning that the heavier and lighter isotopes are present in equal amounts. A α value greater than 1 indicates that the heavier isotope is preferentially taken up, while a α value less than 1 indicates that the lighter isotope is preferentially taken up.

#### 1.1a.2 Applications of Stable Isotope Fractionation in Sulfur Studies

Stable isotope fractionation has been widely used in the study of sulfur in various fields. In biochemistry, it has been used to study the metabolic pathways of sulfur in organisms, particularly in the synthesis of amino acids and other sulfur-containing compounds. In geochemistry, it has been used to study the cycling of sulfur in the environment, including its role in oceanic and terrestrial systems.

In environmental science, stable isotope fractionation has been used to study the effects of human activities on the sulfur cycle. For example, the burning of fossil fuels and industrial processes have been shown to alter the isotopic composition of sulfur in the atmosphere, leading to changes in the sulfur cycle.

#### 1.1a.3 Challenges and Future Directions

Despite the many advances in the study of stable isotope fractionation, there are still many challenges and unanswered questions. One of the main challenges is the development of more accurate and precise methods for measuring isotope ratios. This is particularly important for studying the sulfur cycle, where small changes in isotope ratios can have significant implications for the environment.

Another challenge is the integration of stable isotope fractionation theory with other biogeochemical models. This will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the sulfur cycle and its interactions with other elements and processes.

In the future, it is likely that stable isotope fractionation will continue to play a crucial role in the study of sulfur. With the development of new technologies and methods, we can expect to gain even more insights into the complex world of sulfur isotop




### Subsection: 1.1b Theoretical Framework

The theoretical framework of stable isotope fractionation is based on the principles of quantum mechanics and thermodynamics. Quantum mechanics predicts that atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons will behave slightly differently, leading to the preferential uptake of certain isotopes by organisms and minerals. Thermodynamics, on the other hand, provides a framework for understanding the energy changes associated with these processes.

#### 1.1b.1 Quantum Mechanics and Isotope Fractionation

Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that describes the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level. It is based on the principles of wave-particle duality and uncertainty, which have profound implications for the behavior of atoms and molecules.

In the context of stable isotope fractionation, quantum mechanics predicts that atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons will behave slightly differently. This is due to the slight differences in the mass of these atoms, which can affect their energy levels and therefore their behavior in chemical reactions.

For example, consider the case of sulfur. Sulfur has three stable isotopes: sulfur-32, sulfur-33, and sulfur-34. These isotopes differ in their mass by only a few percent, but this difference can have a significant impact on their behavior in chemical reactions.

The behavior of these isotopes can be described using the Schrödinger equation, which is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics. The Schrödinger equation describes the wave-like behavior of particles, and it can be used to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a particular state. In the case of isotopes, this state could be the presence of a particular isotope in a molecule.

#### 1.1b.2 Thermodynamics and Isotope Fractionation

Thermodynamics is a branch of physics that deals with the study of energy and its transformations. In the context of stable isotope fractionation, thermodynamics provides a framework for understanding the energy changes associated with the preferential uptake of certain isotopes by organisms and minerals.

The energy changes associated with isotope fractionation can be calculated using the Gibbs free energy equation, which is a fundamental equation in thermodynamics. The Gibbs free energy equation describes the energy change associated with a process at constant temperature and pressure, and it can be used to calculate the equilibrium constant of a reaction.

In the case of isotope fractionation, the Gibbs free energy equation can be used to calculate the equilibrium constant of a reaction involving the preferential uptake of a particular isotope. This equilibrium constant can then be used to calculate the isotope fractionation factor (α), which is a key concept in stable isotope fractionation theory.

In conclusion, the theoretical framework of stable isotope fractionation is based on the principles of quantum mechanics and thermodynamics. These principles provide a powerful framework for understanding the behavior of isotopes in chemical reactions, and they have been extensively tested and validated through empirical research.

For example, the Selli Event, a major oceanic anoxic event that occurred approximately 120 million years ago, has been studied using stable isotope analysis. This event was characterized by a spike in marine productivity, likely driven by an increase in iron availability. Stable isotope analysis of sediments from this period has shown a shift in the isotopic composition of sulfur, indicating an increase in hydrogen sulfide production, which is consistent with increased iron availability (Paytan et al., 2004).

For example, the study of sulfur isotopes in the Amazon Basin has shown that human activities, such as deforestation and agriculture, can significantly alter the isotopic composition of sulfur in the atmosphere and soil. This, in turn, can affect the cycling of sulfur in the ecosystem and have implications for air quality and human health (Sobek et al., 2008).

#### 1.1c.3 Isotope Fractionation in Geological Systems

Stable isotope fractionation theory has been used to study a wide range of geological systems, from the formation of hydrocarbons to the cycling of elements in sedimentary rocks. For example, the study of sulfur isotopes in hydrocarbons has provided insights into the processes of hydrocarbon formation and the effects of thermal maturation. Similarly, the study of sulfur isotopes in sedimentary rocks has provided insights into the cycling of sulfur during the formation of these rocks (Schoene et al., 1999).

### Subsection: 1.2a Basic Principles

In the previous section, we discussed the principles of stable isotope fractionation and how it can be used to study various biogeochemical processes. In this section, we will delve deeper into the calculation of equilibrium mass-dependent isotope effects, a crucial aspect of stable isotope fractionation theory.

#### 1.2a.1 Equilibrium Mass-Dependent Isotope Effects

Equilibrium mass-dependent isotope effects refer to the changes in the isotopic composition of an element when it is in equilibrium with another element. This phenomenon is governed by the principles of quantum mechanics and thermodynamics. 

The equilibrium mass-dependent isotope effect can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
\alpha = \frac{k}{k_0}
$$

where $\alpha$ is the equilibrium mass-dependent isotope effect, $k$ is the rate constant for the reaction at a given temperature, and $k_0$ is the rate constant for the same reaction at a reference temperature.

The equilibrium mass-dependent isotope effect is a crucial parameter in stable isotope fractionation theory as it provides insights into the kinetics of various biogeochemical processes. By studying the equilibrium mass-dependent isotope effects, researchers can gain a better understanding of the mechanisms driving these processes.

#### 1.2a.2 Calculating Equilibrium Mass-Dependent Isotope Effects

The calculation of equilibrium mass-dependent isotope effects involves several steps. First, the reaction of interest must be identified, and the rate constants for the reaction at the desired temperature and at the reference temperature must be determined. 

The rate constants can be calculated using various methods, including quantum chemical calculations and experimental measurements. Once the rate constants are known, the equilibrium mass-dependent isotope effect can be calculated using the equation above.

In the next section, we will discuss some case studies that illustrate the application of these principles in the study of various biogeochemical processes.

#### 1.2a.3 Applications of Equilibrium Mass-Dependent Isotope Effects

The calculation of equilibrium mass-dependent isotope effects has numerous applications in the field of biogeochemistry. One such application is in the study of the Selli Event, a major oceanic anoxic event that occurred approximately 120 million years ago.

There are several types of mathematical models used in stable isotope fractionation theory. These include:

- **Deterministic models**: These models make predictions based on a set of initial conditions and a set of equations that describe the system. They assume that the system will evolve in a predictable manner over time.

- **Stochastic models**: These models take into account the randomness and variability in the system. They are often used when the system is influenced by external factors that are not fully understood or cannot be accurately predicted.

- **Dynamic models**: These models describe the changes in the system over time. They can be used to simulate the behavior of the system under different conditions and test hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms driving the system.

#### 1.2b.3 Use of Mathematical Models in Stable Isotope Fractionation

Mathematical models are used in stable isotope fractionation to describe and predict the behavior of various biogeochemical processes.

#### 1.2c.2 Types of Experimental Validation

There are several types of experimental validation used in stable isotope fractionation theory. These include:

- **Direct validation**: This type of validation involves conducting experiments to directly test the predictions of the model. For example, if a model predicts the fractionation of sulfur isotopes during sulfate reduction, an experiment could be conducted to measure the fractionation of sulfur isotopes during sulfate reduction and compare it to the predicted value.

- **Indirect validation**: This type of validation involves conducting experiments to test the underlying assumptions of the model. For example, if a model assumes that the system is in equilibrium, an experiment could be conducted to test this assumption by measuring the rate of change of the system over time.

- **Sensitivity analysis**: This type of validation involves conducting experiments to test the sensitivity of the model to changes in the input parameters. This can help to identify which parameters have the most significant impact on the model's predictions and to refine the model based on these results.

## Chapter: The Selli Event: A Case Study of Biogeochemical Changes

### Introduction

The Selli Event, named after the Selli Mountains in Italy, is a significant geological event that occurred approximately 120 million years ago during the Cretaceous period. This event is marked by a spike in marine productivity, as evidenced by an increase in the concentration of certain elements in the seafloor sediments. This chapter will delve into the biogeochemical changes that occurred during the Selli Event, providing a comprehensive study of the event's impact on the Earth's sulfur cycle.

The Selli Event is particularly interesting from a biogeochemical perspective due to its unique characteristics. It is one of the few events in Earth's history where a significant increase in marine productivity was accompanied by a decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. This event has been linked to a series of volcanic eruptions that released large amounts of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, which in turn led to the formation of sulfuric acid in the oceans. This acidification of the oceans is believed to have stimulated marine productivity, leading to the increase in elemental concentrations observed in the sediments.

In this chapter, we will explore the various factors that contributed to the Selli Event, including the role of volcanic activity, ocean acidification, and changes in marine productivity. We will also discuss the implications of these changes for the Earth's sulfur cycle, and how they may have influenced the evolution of life on Earth. By studying the Selli Event, we can gain valuable insights into the complex interactions between biology, geology, and chemistry that shape our planet's biogeochemical cycles.

The heavier isotope, sulfur-34, is more likely to be incorporated into certain molecules or minerals, while the lighter isotope, sulfur-32, may prefer other species.

The study of sulfur isotope fractionation has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the Earth's biogeochemical cycles. By analyzing the distribution of sulfur isotopes in different compounds, scientists can trace the pathways of sulfur through various biological and geological processes. This has been particularly useful in studying the sulfur cycle, which involves the transfer of sulfur between the atmosphere, land, and water bodies.

### Section: 2.1 Biogeochemistry of Sulfur Isotopes:

Sulfur is a versatile element that plays a crucial role in various biological and geological processes. Its isotopes, particularly sulfur-34 and sulfur-32, have been extensively studied due to their unique properties and applications in various fields. In this section, we will delve into the fascinating world of sulfur isotope fractionation, exploring its causes, mechanisms, and implications in the biogeochemical cycles of the Earth.

#### 2.1a Sulfur Cycle and Isotopes

The sulfur cycle is a complex biogeochemical cycle that involves the transfer of sulfur between the atmosphere, land, and water bodies. Sulfur is a key component of many biological molecules, including amino acids and proteins. It is also a major component of the Earth's crust and is released into the atmosphere through volcanic eruptions.

The sulfur cycle can be divided into several main processes: volcanic release, atmospheric deposition, biological uptake, and weathering. Volcanic release is the primary source of sulfur to the atmosphere, with an estimated 90% of sulfur emissions originating from volcanic activity. The remaining 10% is contributed by anthropogenic activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and industrial processes.

Atmospheric deposition is another important process in the sulfur cycle. Sulfur is transported through the atmosphere and deposited onto the Earth's surface through precipitation, dry deposition, and dust. This process is responsible for the distribution of sulfur across the globe and plays a crucial role in the global sulfur budget.

Biological uptake is a key process in the sulfur cycle, as it is the primary means by which sulfur is incorporated into living organisms. Sulfur is essential for the synthesis of amino acids and proteins, and it is therefore required for all forms of life. Plants, in particular, play a crucial role in the sulfur cycle, as they are able to take up sulfur from the atmosphere and soil and incorporate it into their tissues.

Weathering is the final process in the sulfur cycle, and it is responsible for the return of sulfur to the Earth's crust. Sulfur is released from rocks and minerals through weathering, and it is then transported through rivers and streams to the ocean, where it is eventually deposited on the seafloor.

The study of sulfur isotopes has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the sulfur cycle. Sulfur has three stable isotopes: sulfur-32, sulfur-33, and sulfur-34. The relative abundance of these isotopes can vary depending on the source of the sulfur, and this can provide valuable insights into the processes involved in the sulfur cycle.

For example, sulfur-34 is more abundant in volcanic sulfur than in biological sulfur. This is due to the preferential incorporation of sulfur-34 into certain minerals during volcanic processes. On the other hand, sulfur-32 is more abundant in biological sulfur, as it is the lighter isotope and is therefore more likely to be incorporated into living organisms.

The study of sulfur isotopes has also revealed the presence of sulfur-36, a radioactive isotope with a half-life of 87 days. This isotope is produced by cosmic rays and is present in very small quantities in the Earth's atmosphere. Its presence can provide valuable information about the age of sulfur-containing materials, as it decays at a known rate.

In conclusion, the study of sulfur isotopes has greatly enhanced our understanding of the sulfur cycle and its role in the Earth's biogeochemical processes. By studying the distribution and behavior of sulfur isotopes, we can gain valuable insights into the complex processes involved in the transfer of sulfur between the atmosphere, land, and water bodies. 





#### 2.1b Isotope Fractionation Processes

Isotope fractionation is a fundamental process in the biogeochemical cycle of sulfur. It refers to the preferential uptake of one isotope of an element over another. In the case of sulfur, the most common isotopes are sulfur-34 and sulfur-32. Isotope fractionation can occur during various processes, including biological uptake, volcanic release, and atmospheric deposition.

##### Biological Uptake

Biological uptake is a key process in the sulfur cycle, as it is the primary means by which sulfur is incorporated into living organisms. Sulfur is essential for the synthesis of amino acids and proteins, and it is therefore required for all forms of life. Plants, in particular, play a crucial role in the sulfur cycle, as they are able to take up sulfur from the atmosphere and incorporate it into their tissues.

During biological uptake, plants preferentially take up sulfur-34 over sulfur-32. This is due to the fact that sulfur-34 is more readily available in the atmosphere, and plants have evolved to preferentially take up the more abundant isotope. This process can lead to significant isotope fractionation, with sulfur-34 being enriched in plant tissues compared to the atmosphere.

##### Volcanic Release

Volcanic release is the primary source of sulfur to the atmosphere, with an estimated 90% of sulfur emissions originating from volcanic activity. During volcanic eruptions, sulfur is released from the Earth's mantle, which is enriched in sulfur-34 compared to the atmosphere. This leads to an increase in the sulfur-34 to sulfur-32 ratio in the atmosphere, which can be detected by studying the sulfur isotopic composition of volcanic gases.

##### Atmospheric Deposition

Atmospheric deposition is another important process in the sulfur cycle. Sulfur is transported through the atmosphere and deposited onto the Earth's surface through precipitation, dry deposition, and dust. During this process, sulfur-34 and sulfur-32 are deposited at different rates, leading to isotope fractionation. This process can be influenced by various factors, including the composition of the atmosphere and the type of precipitation.

In conclusion, isotope fractionation is a crucial process in the biogeochemical cycle of sulfur. It occurs during various processes, including biological uptake, volcanic release, and atmospheric deposition. By studying the sulfur isotopic composition of different sources, we can gain valuable insights into the global sulfur cycle and its role in the Earth's biogeochemical processes.

Climate change is a global phenomenon that has significant impacts on the environment, including changes in the biogeochemical cycles of various elements. Sulfur is one such element that is closely linked to climate change. Changes in the isotopic composition of sulfur can provide valuable insights into the impacts of climate change on the environment.

For instance, the increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels due to human activities has led to changes in the isotopic composition of sulfur. The increase in CO<sub>2</sub> levels has been shown to increase the isotopic fractionation of sulfur, leading to an increase in the sulfur-34 to sulfur-32 ratio in the atmosphere. This change can be detected by studying the sulfur isotopic composition of atmospheric sulfur compounds.

##### Sulfur Isotopes and Volcanic Activity

Volcanic activity is another important process that can be studied using sulfur isotopes. The release of sulfur from volcanoes can provide valuable insights into the sulfur cycle and the processes that govern it. The isotopic composition of sulfur released from volcanoes can be used to understand the origin of the sulfur and the processes that have influenced its isotopic composition.

For instance, the isotopic composition of sulfur released from volcanoes can be used to understand the role of volcanic activity in the global sulfur cycle. This can be achieved by studying the isotopic composition of sulfur released from different types of volcanoes, as well as the changes in the isotopic composition of sulfur over time.

##### Sulfur Isotopes and Biological Processes

Sulfur is an essential element for all forms of life, and its isotopic composition can provide valuable insights into biological processes. The isotopic composition of sulfur in living organisms can be used to understand the processes that govern the uptake and metabolism of sulfur.

For instance, the preferential uptake of sulfur-34 over sulfur-32 by plants can be studied using sulfur isotopes. This process, known as isotope fractionation, can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms that govern the uptake and metabolism of sulfur in plants.

## Chapter: Sulfur Isotope Fractionation in Geological Systems

### Introduction

Sulfur, an element abundant in the Earth's crust, plays a crucial role in various geological processes. It is a key component of many minerals and compounds, and its isotopic composition can provide valuable insights into the origin and evolution of these materials. In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of sulfur isotope fractionation in geological systems.

Sulfur isotope fractionation refers to the preferential distribution of different sulfur isotopes between different compounds or phases. This phenomenon is governed by the principles of thermodynamics and kinetics, and it can be influenced by various factors such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of other elements. By studying the sulfur isotope composition of different materials, we can gain a better understanding of the processes that have shaped the Earth's crust and mantle.

In this chapter, we will explore the various geological systems where sulfur isotope fractionation occurs, including hydrothermal systems, sedimentary environments, and magmatic systems. We will also discuss the techniques and methods used to measure sulfur isotopes, and how these measurements can be used to infer the origin and evolution of geological materials.

The study of sulfur isotope fractionation in geological systems is a rapidly evolving field, with new discoveries and advancements being made on a regular basis. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge in this field, and to highlight some of the key areas of research that are currently being explored. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or simply a curious reader, we hope that this chapter will provide you with a deeper understanding of the role of sulfur isotopes in geological systems.




### Introduction to Sulfur and Oxygen Isotope Fractionation in Biological Systems

In the previous chapter, we explored the concept of sulfur isotope fractionation and its importance in biogeochemistry. We learned that sulfur isotopes are not all the same, and their distribution can provide valuable insights into the biogeochemical processes occurring in our environment. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of isotope fractionation, focusing on the fractionation of sulfur and oxygen isotopes in biological systems.

The fractionation of sulfur and oxygen isotopes during microbial sulfide oxidation (MSO) has been studied extensively to assess its potential as a proxy to differentiate it from the abiotic oxidation of sulfur. The light isotopes of the elements that are most commonly found in organic molecules, such as <sup>12</sup>C, <sup>16</sup>O, <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>14</sup>N and <sup>32</sup>S, form bonds that are broken slightly more easily than bonds between the corresponding heavy isotopes, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>18</sup>O, <sup>2</sup>H, <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>34</sup>S. This is due to the lower energetic cost associated with the use of light isotopes, and enzymatic processes usually discriminate against the heavy isotopes.

The formation of sulfate in aerobic conditions involves the incorporation of four oxygen atoms from water, and when coupled with dissimilatory nitrate reduction (DNR) -the preferential reduction pathway under anoxic conditions- can have a contribution of oxygen atoms from nitrate as well. The δ<sup>18</sup>O value of the newly formed sulfate thus depends on the δ<sup>18</sup>O value of the water, the isotopic fractionation associated with the incorporation of oxygen atoms from water to sulfate and a potential exchange of oxygen atoms between sulfur and nitrogen intermediates and water. MSO has been found to produce small fractionations in <sup>18</sup>O compared to water (~5‰).

In the following sections, we will explore the mechanisms behind sulfur and oxygen isotope fractionation in biological systems, and discuss the various factors that can influence these fractionations. We will also delve into the applications of sulfur and oxygen isotope fractionation in various fields, including environmental science, geochemistry, and biology. By understanding the principles behind isotope fractionation and applying them in our research, we can gain a deeper understanding of the biogeochemical processes that shape our world.




### Subsection: 2.2c Isotope Fractionation in Plants and Animals

In the previous sections, we have explored the isotopic fractionation of sulfur and oxygen in biological systems, specifically in microbial sulfide oxidation. In this section, we will extend our understanding to the isotopic fractionation of sulfur and oxygen in plants and animals.

#### 2.2c Isotope Fractionation in Plants and Animals

Plants and animals, like microorganisms, also exhibit isotopic fractionation of sulfur and oxygen. This fractionation is primarily driven by the biological processes involved in the uptake and metabolism of these elements.

In plants, the primary process responsible for sulfur and oxygen isotope fractionation is photosynthesis. As mentioned in the previous section, photosynthesis is the primary process by which carbon moves from the atmosphere into living things. This process also involves the uptake of sulfur and oxygen from the environment. The differential uptake of the three carbon isotopes leads to a preferential uptake of lighter sulfur and oxygen isotopes, resulting in a higher <sup>12</sup>C, <sup>16</sup>O, and <sup>1</sup>H content in the plant.

The degree of isotopic fractionation that takes place in a given plant can be determined by measuring the amounts of both <sup>12</sup>C and <sup>13</sup>C, and calculating the resulting <delta|13|C> value. This value is typically negative due to the higher proportion of <sup>13</sup>C in the PDB standard. For C3 plants, the <delta|13|C> values typically range from −30‰ to −22‰, with an average of −27‰. For C4 plants, the range is −15‰ to −9‰, with an average of −13‰.

In animals, the primary process responsible for sulfur and oxygen isotope fractionation is the consumption of plant and animal matter. Animals, like plants, exhibit a preference for lighter sulfur and oxygen isotopes, resulting in a higher <sup>12</sup>C, <sup>16</sup>O, and <sup>1</sup>H content in the animal. However, the degree of isotopic fractionation in animals is influenced by a variety of factors, including the type of food consumed, the animal's metabolic rate, and the environmental conditions.

In conclusion, the isotopic fractionation of sulfur and oxygen in plants and animals is primarily driven by biological processes, with photosynthesis and consumption of plant and animal matter being the primary processes responsible. The degree of isotopic fractionation can be determined by measuring the amounts of both <sup>12</sup>C and <sup>13</sup>C, and calculating the resulting <delta|13|C> value.




#### 2.2d Implications for Ecosystem Studies

The study of sulfur and oxygen isotope fractionation in biological systems has significant implications for ecosystem studies. The isotopic composition of sulfur and oxygen can provide valuable insights into the biogeochemical processes occurring within an ecosystem, and can help us understand the impacts of environmental changes on these processes.

One of the key implications of sulfur and oxygen isotope fractionation in ecosystem studies is the potential to track the movement of elements within an ecosystem. By studying the isotopic composition of sulfur and oxygen in different organisms, we can trace the pathways of these elements as they move from the atmosphere, to plants, to animals, and back to the atmosphere. This can help us understand the cycling of these elements within an ecosystem, and how changes in the environment can affect this cycling.

For example, the depletion of megafauna, as mentioned in the related context, can have significant implications for the lateral transport of mineral nutrients in an ecosystem. The loss of these large animals can reduce the transport of nutrients from areas of high abundance to areas of lower abundance, potentially leading to nutrient depletion in certain parts of the ecosystem. This can have cascading effects on the ecosystem, affecting the growth and survival of plants and animals.

Furthermore, the loss of megafauna can also impact the emission of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Large populations of herbivores, such as sauropods in the Mesozoic, can contribute significantly to the atmospheric concentration of methane. However, the loss of these animals can reduce this emission, potentially mitigating the effects of climate change.

In addition to these implications, the study of sulfur and oxygen isotope fractionation can also provide insights into the impacts of environmental changes on ecosystems. For instance, the warmer climate of the Mesozoic, estimated to be up to 10°C warmer than at present, can be linked to the high emission of methane by sauropods. This suggests that changes in the environment can significantly impact the biogeochemical processes occurring within an ecosystem.

In conclusion, the study of sulfur and oxygen isotope fractionation in biological systems has significant implications for ecosystem studies. It can help us understand the cycling of elements within an ecosystem, the impacts of environmental changes on these processes, and the role of megafauna in these processes.

## Chapter 3: Sulfur Biogeochemistry:




### Introduction

The ocean is a vast and complex system, covering over 70% of the Earth's surface. It is home to a diverse array of ecosystems, each with its own unique characteristics. One such ecosystem is the sulfidic ocean, a region where sulfide ions are the primary form of sulfur present. This chapter will delve into the biogeochemistry of sulfur in the ocean, specifically focusing on the sulfidic ocean.

The sulfidic ocean is a fascinating and important part of the marine environment. It is characterized by high levels of hydrogen sulfide, a compound that is toxic to most forms of life.

So, let's dive in and explore the biogeochemistry of sulfur in the sulfidic ocean.




### Section: 3.1 Evidence and Implications:

#### 3.1a Geological Evidence for Sulfidic Oceans

The geological evidence for sulfidic oceans is vast and varied, spanning from the early Earth to the present day. This evidence includes the presence of hydrogen sulfide in ancient sediments, the occurrence of sulfide minerals in the oceanic crust, and the detection of hydrogen sulfide in hydrothermal vents and cold seeps.

One of the earliest pieces of evidence for sulfidic oceans comes from the early Earth, during the Hadean Eon (4.5–4.0 Ga). The presence of hydrogen sulfide in ancient sediments, as indicated by the presence of pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>) and sphalerite (ZnS), suggests that the ocean was sulfidic in nature (Kringel 2000). This early sulfidic ocean was likely a result of high levels of volcanic activity and the lack of oxygen in the atmosphere, which prevented the oxidation of sulfide ions.

More recent evidence for sulfidic oceans comes from the modern ocean. The presence of hydrogen sulfide in hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, as well as the occurrence of sulfide minerals in the oceanic crust, suggests that these environments are still sulfidic in nature (Kringel 2000). These environments are characterized by high levels of hydrogen sulfide, which is produced by the reduction of sulfate ions in the presence of hydrogen gas.

The geological evidence for sulfidic oceans has significant implications for our understanding of the Earth's history and the role of sulfur in the ocean. For instance, the presence of hydrogen sulfide in ancient sediments suggests that the early Earth was a reducing environment, with high levels of volcanic activity and low levels of oxygen. This is in contrast to the modern Earth, which is characterized by lower levels of volcanic activity and higher levels of oxygen.

Furthermore, the presence of hydrogen sulfide in modern hydrothermal vents and cold seeps suggests that these environments are important sites for sulfur cycling. The reduction of sulfate ions in these environments results in the production of hydrogen sulfide, which is then transported to the surface where it can be oxidized to sulfate ions. This cycling of sulfur is crucial for the overall biogeochemical balance of the ocean.

In conclusion, the geological evidence for sulfidic oceans is vast and varied, spanning from the early Earth to the present day. This evidence suggests that the ocean has been a sulfidic environment for much of its history, and that these environments are still important sites for sulfur cycling in the modern ocean.

#### 3.1b Implications of Sulfidic Oceans

The implications of sulfidic oceans are far-reaching and have significant implications for our understanding of the Earth's history and the role of sulfur in the ocean. The presence of hydrogen sulfide in ancient sediments and modern hydrothermal vents and cold seeps suggests that these environments have been important sites for sulfur cycling throughout the Earth's history.

One of the most significant implications of sulfidic oceans is their role in the global carbon cycle. The reduction of sulfate ions in these environments results in the production of hydrogen sulfide, which is then transported to the surface where it can be oxidized to sulfate ions. This process is crucial for the global carbon cycle, as it helps to regulate the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The oxidation of hydrogen sulfide results in the absorption of carbon dioxide, which helps to reduce the levels of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.

Furthermore, the presence of hydrogen sulfide in ancient sediments suggests that the early Earth was a reducing environment, with high levels of volcanic activity and low levels of oxygen. This is in contrast to the modern Earth, which is characterized by lower levels of volcanic activity and higher levels of oxygen. This suggests that the Earth's atmosphere has changed significantly over time, and that the sulfidic ocean played a crucial role in this process.

The implications of sulfidic oceans also extend to the study of life on Earth. The presence of hydrogen sulfide in these environments suggests that there may be a diverse range of microbial life forms that are capable of thriving in these conditions. These microbes may provide valuable insights into the early stages of life on Earth, as well as potential sources of new drugs and other useful compounds.

In conclusion, the implications of sulfidic oceans are vast and varied, and have significant implications for our understanding of the Earth's history, the global carbon cycle, and the study of life on Earth. Further research into these environments will continue to provide valuable insights into the role of sulfur in the ocean and its impact on the Earth as a whole.

#### 3.1c Future Directions in Sulfidic Ocean Research

As our understanding of sulfidic oceans continues to evolve, there are several key areas that warrant further investigation. These include the role of sulfidic oceans in the global carbon cycle, the potential for life in these environments, and the impact of human activities on sulfidic oceans.

##### Sulfidic Oceans and the Global Carbon Cycle

The role of sulfidic oceans in the global carbon cycle is a critical area of research. As we have seen, the reduction of sulfate ions in these environments results in the production of hydrogen sulfide, which is then transported to the surface where it can be oxidized to sulfate ions. This process plays a crucial role in regulating the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. However, the exact mechanisms by which this process operates, and the potential impacts of climate change on these processes, are still not fully understood.

#### 3.1b Implications for Early Life

The implications of a sulfidic ocean for early life on Earth are profound and far-reaching. The presence of hydrogen sulfide in the early ocean not only provided a reducing environment conducive to the development of life, but also served as a source of energy and nutrients for early organisms.

The reduction of sulfate ions to hydrogen sulfide, as seen in modern hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, was likely a common process in the early Earth's ocean. This process not only removed sulfate ions from the ocean, but also produced hydrogen gas, which served as a source of energy for early organisms (Kringel 2000). Furthermore, the hydrogen sulfide itself was a valuable nutrient, providing sulfur and hydrogen for the development of early life forms.

The presence of hydrogen sulfide in the early ocean also had implications for the composition of the atmosphere. The reduction of sulfate ions to hydrogen sulfide resulted in the release of hydrogen gas, which contributed to the early atmosphere's reducing nature. This reducing atmosphere was crucial for the development of early life, as it prevented the oxidation of essential elements such as iron and sulfur (Kringel 2000).

The implications of a sulfidic ocean for early life are not limited to the early Earth. The study of sulfidic oceans and their implications for early life has important implications for the search for extraterrestrial life. The presence of hydrogen sulfide in the early Earth's ocean suggests that similar environments may exist on other planetary bodies, providing a potential habitat for life.

#### 3.2c Geochemical Evidence

The geochemical evidence from the Proterozoic era provides a wealth of information about the sulfidic ocean and its role in the evolution of life on Earth. This evidence includes the analysis of sedimentary rocks, the study of stable isotopes, and the examination of microfossils.

Sedimentary rocks from the Proterozoic era show a clear signature of hydrogen sulfide. The presence of iron sulfides, such as pyrite and marcasite, indicates that these rocks were formed in an anoxic environment where hydrogen sulfide was abundant. This is supported by the analysis of stable isotopes, which show a depletion in the ratio of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16, a characteristic feature of anoxic conditions.

The study of stable isotopes also provides insights into the cycling of nutrients in the sulfidic ocean. The analysis of sulfur isotopes, for example, reveals a shift from a predominance of sulfur-34 to sulfur-32 in the sediments. This shift suggests a preferential removal of sulfur-34 from the ocean, likely through the formation of iron sulfides. This process would have had a significant impact on the marine ecosystem, altering the availability of nutrients and influencing the evolution of life.

Microfossils from the Proterozoic era provide further evidence of the anoxic conditions in the sulfidic ocean. These microfossils, known as stromatolites, are formed by microbial mats that thrive in extreme environments, such as hydrothermal vents and sulfidic oceans. The presence of stromatolites in Proterozoic sediments indicates that these microbial mats were able to survive and thrive in the anoxic conditions of the sulfidic ocean.

In conclusion, the geochemical evidence from the Proterozoic era provides a comprehensive picture of the sulfidic ocean and its role in the evolution of life on Earth. This evidence includes the analysis of sedimentary rocks, the study of stable isotopes, and the examination of microfossils. Together, these lines of evidence paint a vivid picture of a dynamic and diverse marine ecosystem, shaped by the cycling of nutrients and the influence of hydrogen sulfide.

The process of sulfate reduction is a fundamental aspect of the biogeochemical cycle of sulfur. It is a microbial process that involves the reduction of sulfate ions to hydrogen sulfide. This process is primarily driven by anaerobic bacteria and archaea, which utilize sulfate as an electron acceptor in the absence of oxygen. The reduction of sulfate is a crucial step in the sulfur cycle, as it allows for the recycling of sulfur from the ocean floor back into the water column.

In this chapter, we will delve into the intricacies of sulfate reduction, exploring its role in the global sulfur cycle and its implications for marine ecosystems. We will discuss the microorganisms involved in sulfate reduction, their metabolic pathways, and the environmental conditions that favor this process. We will also examine the geochemical signatures of sulfate reduction and how they can be used to trace the process in the ocean.

The study of sulfate reduction is not only important for understanding the biogeochemical processes in the ocean, but also has implications for climate change. Sulfate reduction is a key process in the biological carbon cycle, as it can lead to the burial of carbon in sediments. This process can help to mitigate the effects of climate change by reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.

In the following sections, we will explore these topics in more detail, providing a comprehensive guide to sulfate reduction.

#### 3.3b Lipids as Indicators of Euxinia

Lipids, particularly isoprenoid hydrocarbons, have been used as indicators of ocean euxinia. The presence of these lipids, particularly pristane (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane) and phytane (2,6,10,14-tetramethylhexadecane), can be used as a proxy for the presence of hydrogen sulfide in the ocean.

Pristane and phytane are isoprenoid hydrocarbons that are produced by certain bacteria and archaea. They are not produced by higher organisms, making them ideal biomarkers for the study of ancient environments. The presence of these lipids in sedimentary rocks can indicate the presence of hydrogen sulfide in the ancient ocean.

The discovery of pristane and phytane in sedimentary rocks dates back to the 1960s. However, their significance as indicators of ocean euxinia was not fully appreciated until the 1980s. Since then, numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the distribution and significance of these lipids in the ocean.

The distribution of pristane and phytane in the ocean is influenced by a variety of factors, including the presence of hydrogen sulfide, the type of sediment, and the presence of certain microorganisms. For example, pristane and phytane are more abundant in sediments that are rich in hydrogen sulfide and in sediments that are dominated by sulfate-reducing bacteria.

In addition to their use as indicators of ocean euxinia, pristane and phytane have also been used to study the evolution of life on Earth. The presence of these lipids in sedimentary rocks can provide insights into the types of microorganisms that were present in the ancient ocean. This information can be used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of life on Earth.

In conclusion, lipids, particularly isoprenoid hydrocarbons, are powerful indicators of ocean euxinia.

##### Case Study 1: The Selli Event

The Selli Event, a period of intense oceanic anoxia and sulfide production, provides a unique opportunity to study the role of lipids in ocean euxinia. During this event, the ocean became highly acidic and anoxic, leading to a significant increase in hydrogen sulfide production. This event was accompanied by a spike in the concentration of pristane and phytane, indicating a shift towards a more sulfidic ocean.

The Selli Event also saw a significant increase in the concentration of other lipids, such as squalene and hopane. These lipids, like pristane and phytane, are produced by certain bacteria and archaea and can serve as additional indicators of ocean euxinia.

##### Case Study 2: The Role of Lipids in Sulfate Reduction

The process of sulfate reduction plays a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycling of sulfur in the ocean. This process is primarily carried out by certain bacteria and archaea, which use hydrogen sulfide as an electron acceptor. The presence of lipids, such as pristane and phytane, can provide insights into the activity of these microorganisms.

In a study conducted by Jenkyns (2001), the distribution of pristane and phytane was found to be correlated with the distribution of sulfate-reducing bacteria. This suggests that these lipids can serve as proxies for the activity of these microorganisms, providing valuable insights into the biogeochemical processes occurring in the ocean.

##### Case Study 3: The Role of Lipids in the Evolution of Life

The study of lipids in the ocean has also provided insights into the evolution of life on Earth. The presence of certain lipids, such as pristane and phytane, can indicate the presence of hydrogen sulfide in the ancient ocean. This, in turn, can provide insights into the types of microorganisms that were present in the ocean at that time.

For example, a study conducted by Summons et al. (1999) found the presence of pristane and phytane in sedimentary rocks dating back to the Archean era. This suggests that these lipids have been present in the ocean for at least 3.5 billion years, indicating the long-term presence of hydrogen sulfide and sulfate-reducing microorganisms.

In conclusion, the analysis of lipids in the sulfidic ocean has provided valuable insights into the biogeochemical processes occurring in the ocean. From understanding the Selli Event to the role of lipids in sulfate reduction and the evolution of life, lipid analysis continues to be a crucial tool in the study of the sulfidic ocean.

This is because the enzyme responsible for the production of DMS, dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) lyase, is temperature-dependent. As the temperature rises, the enzyme becomes more active, leading to increased production of DMS.

Light also plays a crucial role in the production of DMS. Marine microorganisms, particularly phytoplankton, require light for photosynthesis. As light levels increase, so does the photosynthetic activity of these organisms, leading to higher production of DMS. This is because DMS production is closely linked to photosynthesis, with DMSP lyase being a key enzyme in the production of DMS.

Nutrient availability is another important factor influencing the production of DMS. Marine microorganisms require nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, for growth and metabolism. As nutrient levels increase, so does the growth and metabolic activity of these organisms, leading to higher production of DMS. This is because DMS production is closely linked to the metabolic activity of marine microorganisms, with DMSP lyase being a key enzyme in this process.

In addition to their role in the atmospheric sulfur cycle, DMS also play a crucial role in climate regulation. They are known to have a cooling effect on the Earth's climate by increasing the albedo of clouds. This is because DMS reacts with sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) in the atmosphere to form dimethylsulfonium propionate (DMSP), which can then react with water to form sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). This sulfuric acid can then condense with water to form sulfate particles, which can increase the albedo of clouds and reflect incoming solar radiation back into space.

In conclusion, dimethylsulfides play a crucial role in the atmospheric sulfur cycle, influencing the production of sulfur in the atmosphere. Their production is influenced by several factors, including temperature, light, and nutrient availability. They also play a crucial role in climate regulation by increasing the albedo of clouds. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex interactions between DMS and the atmospheric sulfur cycle.

#### 4.1b Production of Dimethylsulfides

The production of dimethylsulfides (DMS) by marine microorganisms is a complex process that involves several steps. The primary source of DMS is dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), a compound produced by marine microorganisms, particularly phytoplankton. DMSP is a key component of the marine sulfur cycle, and its production is influenced by several factors, including temperature, light, and nutrient availability.

The production of DMSP begins with the uptake of sulfate by marine microorganisms. Sulfate is a key component of sulfur metabolism in these organisms, and its availability can significantly influence the production of DMSP. Once sulfate is taken up, it is reduced to hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) by a process known as assimilatory sulfate reduction. This hydrogen sulfide is then incorporated into the amino acid cysteine, which is a key component of proteins.

The production of DMSP from cysteine involves a series of biochemical reactions. First, cysteine is converted to cysteine sulfinic acid (CysSO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) by a process known as sulfination. This sulfinic acid is then converted to DMSP by a process known as sulfinate reduction. This process is catalyzed by the enzyme DMSP synthase, which is temperature-dependent and requires light for its activity.

The production of DMS from DMSP is a key step in the atmospheric sulfur cycle. DMSP is a labile compound that can easily be converted to DMS by a process known as DMSP lyase activity. This activity is also temperature-dependent and requires light for its activity. The production of DMS from DMSP is influenced by several factors, including temperature, light, and nutrient availability.

In addition to its role in the atmospheric sulfur cycle, DMS also plays a crucial role in climate regulation. DMS is a potent greenhouse gas, and its production by marine microorganisms can significantly influence the Earth's climate. DMS is also known to have a cooling effect on the Earth's climate by increasing the albedo of clouds. This is because DMS can react with sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) in the atmosphere to form dimethylsulfonium propionate (DMSP), which can then react with water to form sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). This sulfuric acid can then condense with water to form sulfate particles, which can increase the albedo of clouds and reflect incoming solar radiation back into space.

In conclusion, the production of dimethylsulfides (DMS) by marine microorganisms is a complex process that is influenced by several factors, including temperature, light, and nutrient availability. DMS plays a crucial role in the atmospheric sulfur cycle and also has a significant impact on the Earth's climate. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of DMS in these processes.

#### 4.1c Atmospheric Impact of Dimethylsulfides

Dimethylsulfides (DMS) play a significant role in the atmospheric sulfur cycle. They are a key component of the sulfur budget, contributing to the overall sulfur content in the atmosphere. The atmospheric impact of DMS is multifaceted, influencing both the local and global climate.

The primary atmospheric impact of DMS is its role as a precursor to sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>). DMS can be oxidized in the atmosphere to form SO<sub>2</sub>, which is a potent greenhouse gas and a key component of acid rain. The oxidation of DMS to SO<sub>2</sub> is catalyzed by hydroxyl radicals (OH•), which are abundant in the upper atmosphere. This process is known as the DMS-SO<sub>2</sub> cycle.

The DMS-SO<sub>2</sub> cycle is a crucial component of the atmospheric sulfur cycle. It helps to regulate the amount of sulfur in the atmosphere, acting as a sink for excess sulfur. This is particularly important in areas with high sulfur emissions, such as industrialized regions. The DMS-SO<sub>2</sub> cycle helps to reduce the amount of sulfur in the atmosphere, mitigating the effects of sulfur pollution.

In addition to its role in the sulfur cycle, DMS also has a direct impact on the climate. DMS is a potent greenhouse gas, contributing to the warming of the Earth's atmosphere. Its direct contribution to global warming is estimated to be around 10% of the total greenhouse effect.

Furthermore, DMS also plays a role in cloud formation and precipitation. DMS can react with sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) in the atmosphere to form dimethylsulfonium propionate (DMSP), which can then react with water to form sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). This sulfuric acid can then condense with water to form sulfate particles, which can increase the albedo of clouds and reflect incoming solar radiation back into space. This process can have a cooling effect on the Earth's climate, particularly in regions with high levels of DMS emissions.

In conclusion, the atmospheric impact of DMS is multifaceted, influencing both the local and global climate. Its role in the sulfur cycle and its direct contribution to global warming make it a crucial component of the atmospheric sulfur cycle. Its impact on cloud formation and precipitation further highlights its importance in the Earth's climate system.

DMS plays a crucial role in this cycle, as it is a major source of sulfur in the atmosphere. The atmospheric sulfur cycle is influenced by various factors, including volcanic eruptions, industrial activities, and biological processes.

Volcanic eruptions are a significant source of sulfur in the atmosphere. During an eruption, molten rock (magma) is ejected from the volcano, along with gases such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide. These gases can react with water vapor in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid, which can then condense and form sulfur particles. These particles can then be transported by wind and added to the atmospheric sulfur cycle.

Industrial activities, such as burning fossil fuels, also contribute to the atmospheric sulfur cycle. These activities release sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, which can react with water vapor to form sulfuric acid. This acid can then condense and form sulfur particles, similar to volcanic eruptions.

Biological processes, such as the production of DMS by marine microorganisms, also play a crucial role in the atmospheric sulfur cycle. As mentioned earlier, DMS is a significant source of sulfur in the atmosphere, and its production is influenced by temperature, light, and nutrient availability.

### Subsection: 6.1a Organic Sulfur in the Environment

Organic sulfur compounds play a crucial role in the environment, acting as biomarkers for various biological processes. These compounds are found in a diverse range of environments, from the atmosphere to the soil, and are involved in a variety of biological and geological processes.

#### 6.1a.1 Sulfur in the Atmosphere

Sulfur in the atmosphere is primarily derived from volcanic eruptions and the burning of fossil fuels. Volcanic eruptions release large quantities of sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) into the atmosphere, which can react with water vapor to form sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). This acid can then precipitate as sulfate minerals, such as gypsum (CaSO<sub>4</sub> · 2H<sub>2</sub>O) or anhydrite (CaSO<sub>4</sub>).

The burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, also releases sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. This sulfur dioxide can react with other compounds in the atmosphere to form sulfate particles, which can have significant impacts on air quality and human health.

#### 6.1a.2 Sulfur in the Soil

Sulfur in the soil is primarily derived from the weathering of rocks and the decomposition of organic matter. The weathering of rocks releases sulfate ions (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) into the soil, which can be taken up by plants. The decomposition of organic matter also releases sulfur compounds, such as cysteine and methionine, into the soil.

Plants can also acquire sulfur from the atmosphere through the uptake of gaseous and dissolved sulfur compounds. This is particularly evident in trees, where the foliage at the tops of conifers, bull rushes, and deciduous trees has been shown to have δ<sup>34</sup>S values more reflective of the atmosphere, while the lower foliage has δ<sup>34</sup>S values closer to that of soil. This is due to the upper foliage exerting a canopy action on the lower branches, taking up atmospheric sulfur before it can reach lower levels.

#### 6.1a.3 Sulfur in Aquatic Environments

Sulfur in aquatic environments is primarily derived from the weathering of rocks and the decomposition of organic matter. The weathering of rocks releases sulfate ions (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) into the water, which can be taken up by aquatic plants. The decomposition of organic matter also releases sulfur compounds, such as cysteine and methionine, into the water.

Aquatic plants can also acquire sulfur from the atmosphere through the uptake of gaseous and dissolved sulfur compounds. This is particularly evident in epiphytic lichens and mosses, which have δ<sup>34</sup>S values close to atmospheric S compounds due to their lack of access to soil.

In conclusion, organic sulfur compounds play a crucial role in the environment, acting as biomarkers for various biological processes. These compounds are found in a diverse range of environments and are involved in a variety of biological and geological processes. Understanding the role of organic sulfur in the environment is essential for understanding the biogeochemical cycling of sulfur and its impact on the environment.

### Section: 6.1 Organic Sulfur and Preservation of Lipid Biomarkers:

#### 6.1a Organic Sulfur and Lipid Biomarker Preservation

The preservation of lipid biomarkers is a critical aspect of understanding the biogeochemical cycle of sulfur. These biomarkers, which are organic compounds containing sulfur, are often found in sedimentary rocks and can provide valuable insights into past environments and climate changes. However, the preservation of these biomarkers is not always straightforward and requires careful consideration of various factors.

One of the key factors influencing the preservation of lipid biomarkers is the redox potential of the environment. As we have learned in the previous chapters, sulfur can exist in various oxidation states, and the redox potential of the environment can greatly influence the stability of these different forms of sulfur. For instance, in anoxic environments, where the redox potential is low, sulfide ions (S<sup>2-</sup>) are more stable and can react with organic compounds to form lipid biomarkers. On the other hand, in oxidizing environments, where the redox potential is high, sulfate ions (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) are more stable and can inhibit the formation of lipid biomarkers.

Another important factor influencing the preservation of lipid biomarkers is the pH of the environment. The pH can greatly affect the solubility of sulfur compounds, and therefore, the availability of sulfur for biomarker formation. In general, lower pH values (more acidic conditions) can increase the solubility of sulfur compounds, making them more available for biomarker formation.

The composition of the sediment can also play a role in the preservation of lipid biomarkers. For instance, sediments rich in organic matter can provide a more favorable environment for biomarker formation, as they can serve as a source of carbon for the biomarkers. Additionally, the mineral composition of the sediment can also influence the redox potential and pH of the environment, further affecting the preservation of biomarkers.

Finally, the age of the sediment can also impact the preservation of lipid biomarkers. Older sediments can undergo diagenesis, a process that can alter the chemical composition of the sediment and potentially destroy biomarkers. Therefore, the preservation of lipid biomarkers can be particularly challenging in older sediments.

In conclusion, the preservation of lipid biomarkers is a complex process that is influenced by a variety of factors. Understanding these factors is crucial for interpreting the information contained in these biomarkers and for reconstructing past environments and climate changes.

#### 6.1b Analytical Techniques for Organic Sulfur and Lipid Biomarker Analysis

The analysis of organic sulfur and lipid biomarkers requires a combination of analytical techniques. These techniques are used to identify and quantify the different types of organic sulfur compounds present in a sample, as well as to determine their structural features. 

One of the most commonly used techniques for the analysis of organic sulfur compounds is gas chromatography (GC). GC is a powerful tool for the separation and identification of volatile organic compounds. In the context of organic sulfur compounds, GC can be used to separate the different types of sulfur-containing compounds present in a sample, based on their boiling points. The separated compounds can then be identified by comparing their retention times with those of known standards.

Another important technique for the analysis of organic sulfur compounds is mass spectrometry (MS). MS is used to determine the molecular weight and structural features of organic compounds. In the context of organic sulfur compounds, MS can be used to identify the different types of sulfur-containing compounds present in a sample, based on their mass spectra. The mass spectra can then be compared with those of known standards to identify the compounds.

In addition to GC and MS, other techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and infrared (IR) spectroscopy can also be used for the analysis of organic sulfur compounds. NMR spectroscopy can provide information about the connectivity of the atoms within a molecule, while IR spectroscopy can provide information about the functional groups present in a molecule.

For the analysis of lipid biomarkers, additional techniques such as thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can be used. These techniques can be used to separate and identify the different types of lipid biomarkers present in a sample, based on their physical and chemical properties.

In conclusion, the analysis of organic sulfur and lipid biomarkers requires a combination of analytical techniques. These techniques are used to identify and quantify the different types of organic sulfur compounds present in a sample, as well as to determine their structural features. The choice of technique depends on the specific research question and the nature of the sample.

#### 6.1c Case Studies of Organic Sulfur and Lipid Biomarker Preservation

In this section, we will explore some case studies that highlight the preservation of organic sulfur and lipid biomarkers in different environments. These case studies will provide a practical understanding of the concepts discussed in the previous sections.

##### Case Study 1: The Selli Event and Organic Sulfur Preservation

The Selli Event, a major oceanic anoxic event (OAE) that occurred approximately 120 million years ago, provides a unique opportunity to study the preservation of organic sulfur compounds. During this event, large-scale volcanic activity led to a spike in hydrogen sulfide production, which in turn increased the concentration of organic sulfur compounds in the ocean.

The increased hydrogen sulfide production also led to a drop in the pH of seawater, which favored the formation of sulfide minerals. These minerals, such as pyrite and sphalerite, can effectively preserve organic matter, including organic sulfur compounds, for long periods of time. This was demonstrated by the discovery of exceptionally preserved fossils, known as the "Green River Fauna," in the Green River Formation of Colorado and Utah.

The Green River Fauna includes a diverse array of organisms, including fish, crocodilians, and turtles. The exceptional preservation of these fossils is attributed to the rapid burial of the organisms in sediments rich in hydrogen sulfide and iron. These conditions led to the formation of pyrite, which effectively preserved the organic matter, including organic sulfur compounds, for millions of years.

##### Case Study 2: Lipid Biomarker Preservation in the Gulf of Mexico

The Gulf of Mexico is another region where the preservation of lipid biomarkers has been extensively studied. The Gulf of Mexico is characterized by a complex interplay of physical and chemical factors, including temperature, salinity, and sedimentation rates, which can influence the preservation of lipid biomarkers.

Studies have shown that the preservation of lipid biomarkers in the Gulf of Mexico is influenced by a variety of factors, including the redox potential of the sediment, the composition of the sediment, and the age of the sediment. For instance, sediments with high redox potential and high organic matter content tend to preserve lipid biomarkers more effectively than sediments with low redox potential and low organic matter content.

Furthermore, the age of the sediment can also influence the preservation of lipid biomarkers. Older sediments, which have undergone more extensive diagenesis, tend to preserve lipid biomarkers less effectively than younger sediments. This is because diagenesis can alter the chemical composition of the sediment, leading to the destruction of lipid biomarkers.

In conclusion, these case studies highlight the complex interplay of physical, chemical, and biological factors that influence the preservation of organic sulfur and lipid biomarkers. Understanding these factors is crucial for the accurate interpretation of geochemical data and for the reconstruction of past environments.

#### 7.2b Topic Discussion

In this section, we will delve deeper into the topic of "Sulfur and Climate Change". We will explore the various aspects of this topic, starting with an overview of the current state of research in sulfur and climate change.

Sulfur is a key component of the Earth's climate system. It is involved in a variety of processes, including the formation of clouds, the acidity of rain, and the cycling of nutrients in the ocean. Changes in the amount of sulfur in the environment can have significant impacts on climate, both directly and indirectly.

One of the main sources of sulfur in the environment is volcanic activity. Volcanic eruptions release large amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) into the atmosphere, which can react with water vapor to form sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). This sulfuric acid can then fall to the ground as acid rain, which can have detrimental effects on ecosystems and human health.

Another important source of sulfur in the environment is human activity. The burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, releases sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. This sulfur dioxide can react with other compounds to form sulfates, which can have a cooling effect on the climate. However, the release of sulfur dioxide also contributes to air pollution and acid rain.

The effects of sulfur on climate are not limited to its direct impact on temperature. Sulfur also plays a crucial role in the formation of clouds. Clouds are important for regulating the Earth's climate, as they reflect incoming solar radiation back into space. Sulfur dioxide can react with water vapor in the atmosphere to form sulfate aerosols, which can act as cloud condensation nuclei. This can increase the number of clouds in the atmosphere, which can have a cooling effect on the climate.

However, the relationship between sulfur and climate is complex and not fully understood. While some studies have shown a correlation between increased sulfur emissions and cooling temperatures, others have found no significant effect. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of sulfur in climate change.

In the next section, we will explore the potential implications of climate change on sulfur cycling. Climate change can affect the amount of sulfur in the environment, as well as the processes that control its cycling. Understanding these implications is crucial for predicting the future impacts of climate change on sulfur biogeochemistry.

#### 7.2c Topic Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the topic of "Sulfur and Climate Change" in depth. We have discussed the various sources of sulfur in the environment, including volcanic activity and human activity. We have also examined the effects of sulfur on climate, both directly and indirectly.
