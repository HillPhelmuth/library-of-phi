The concept of globalization has been a topic of great interest in the field of architectural history. It is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that has shaped the built environment in profound ways. 

Globalization in architecture can be understood as the process by which architectural styles, techniques, and theories are exchanged and adopted across different regions and cultures. This process is driven by a variety of factors, including economic, political, and social forces. 

One of the key drivers of globalization in architecture is the global economy. The rise of multinational corporations and the increasing interconnectedness of global markets have led to a homogenization of architectural styles and techniques. This can be seen in the proliferation of similar architectural forms across different regions, from the ubiquitous skyscraper to the standardized office building.

Political forces also play a significant role in globalization. The spread of Western political ideologies, such as democracy and capitalism, has led to the adoption of Western architectural styles and techniques in many parts of the world. This can be seen in the proliferation of modernist and postmodernist architectural forms in developing countries, often as a symbol of modernity and progress.

Social forces also contribute to globalization in architecture. The increasing mobility of people across different regions and cultures has led to the spread of architectural styles and techniques. This can be seen in the adoption of local architectural forms by migrant communities, as well as the incorporation of local elements into global architectural styles.

However, globalization in architecture is not without its challenges. The homogenization of architectural styles and techniques can lead to a loss of local identity and cultural diversity. This can be seen in the proliferation of identical buildings in different regions, often built to the same specifications and using the same materials.

In the following sections, we will explore these issues in more detail, examining the various dimensions and implications of globalization in architectural history. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities that arise when trying to write about the global in architectural history, and how these can be addressed.

### Related Context
```
# Architecture of the United States

## Colonial

When the Europeans settled in North America, they brought their architectural traditions and construction techniques for building. The oldest buildings in America have examples of that. Construction was dependent on the available resources. Wood and brick are the most common elements of English buildings in New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the coastal South. It had also brought the conquest, destruction, and displacement of the indigenous peoples existing buildings in their homeland, as their dwelling and settlement construction techniques devalued compared to colonial standards. The colonizers appropriated the territories and sites for new forts, dwellings, missions, churches, and agricultural developments.

### Spanish influences

The Spanish colonial architecture in the United States was markedly different from the European styles adopted in other parts of America such as the simple French colonial houses in the Mississippi Valley, which were consisted of adjoining rooms that opened upon a "galerie". The Spanish architecture (particularly evident in ecclesiastical establishments) built in the states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Florida, and Georgia was similar to the design adopted in Mexico. According to scholars, the Spaniards built without any consideration to the cost, believing that their tenure in America would be eternal.

#### Florida

Spanish colonial architecture was built in Florida and the Southeastern United States from 1559 to 1821. The "conch style" is represented in Pensacola, Florida and other areas of Florida, adorning houses with balconies of wrought iron, as appears in the mostly Spanish-built French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana. Fires in 1788 and 1794 destroyed the original French structures in New Orleans. Many of the city's present buildings date to late-18th-century rebuilding efforts.

The two earliest continuously occupied European settlements in the United States are St. Augustine, Florida, founded in 1565, and Santa Fe, New Mexico, founded in 1610. These settlements have been continuously inhabited since their founding, making them some of the oldest cities in the United States.

The architecture of these settlements reflects the cultural influences of their respective founders. St. Augustine, founded by the Spanish, has a strong Spanish colonial influence in its architecture, while Santa Fe, founded by the Spanish and later occupied by the Mexicans, has a blend of Spanish and Mexican architectural styles.

The architecture of these settlements has evolved over time, reflecting the changing cultural influences and technological advancements. For example, the architecture of St. Augustine has been influenced by the British, French, and American cultures, as well as the development of new building materials and techniques.

The architecture of these settlements also reflects the social and economic conditions of the time. For instance, the Spanish colonial architecture in Florida and the Southeastern United States was characterized by austerity and simplicity, reflecting the limited resources and harsh conditions of the region.

In contrast, the architecture of Santa Fe, which was under the rule of the Spanish and later the Mexicans, was characterized by grandeur and opulence, reflecting the wealth and power of the ruling classes.

The architecture of these settlements also serves as a testament to the resilience and adaptability of human settlements. Despite the challenges of the environment and the changing cultural influences, these settlements have survived and thrived, leaving behind a rich architectural legacy that continues to inspire and influence architectural design today.

These technological advancements have not only changed the way architects work, but also the way people interact with their built environment. For example, the widespread use of smart home technologies has transformed the concept of home, making it more connected and efficient.

##### Economic Forces

Economic forces have also played a crucial role in the globalization of architecture. The globalization of the economy has led to an increase in international trade and investment, which has in turn led to an increase in architectural exchanges. Architects are now more likely to work on projects in different parts of the world, and their designs are often influenced by the cultural and environmental contexts of these places.

Moreover, the globalization of the economy has also led to the homogenization of architectural styles. As global corporations and brands expand their operations across the world, they often bring with them their own architectural styles, which can lead to a loss of local architectural identities.

##### Cultural Exchanges

Cultural exchanges have been another key driver of the globalization of architecture. The increased mobility of people and ideas has led to a greater cross-cultural interaction, which has in turn led to a blending of architectural styles and concepts. For instance, the fusion of Western and Eastern architectural styles in the design of modern skyscrapers is a testament to this cultural exchange.

However, cultural exchanges can also lead to conflicts and tensions. For example, the imposition of Western architectural styles on non-Western cultures can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism. This has led to a growing interest in vernacular architecture, which seeks to preserve and promote local architectural traditions.

In conclusion, the globalization of architecture is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that has been shaped by a variety of factors. It presents both opportunities and challenges for architects, and it requires a deep understanding of the cultural, economic, and technological contexts in which architecture is situated.

Designed by Frank Gehry, an American-Canadian architect, the museum is a testament to the globalization of architectural styles. The building's undulating curves and fluid forms are a departure from traditional architectural norms, yet they are deeply rooted in the local Basque culture. The museum's design was influenced by the Basque tradition of building with stone and wood, and it reflects the Basque people's deep connection to the natural world.

##### The Burj Khalifa, Dubai

The Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, is the tallest building in the world. Its design, by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, an American architectural firm, is a blend of Western and Middle Eastern architectural styles. The building's sleek and minimalist design is reminiscent of modernist architecture, yet it also incorporates elements of Islamic design, such as the use of geometric patterns and calligraphy. The Burj Khalifa is a symbol of the globalization of architectural styles, as it combines elements from different cultural contexts.

##### The Taj Mahal, Agra

The Taj Mahal in Agra, India, is a UNESCO World Heritage site and a symbol of global architectural heritage. The mausoleum, built in the 17th century, is a masterpiece of Mughal architecture, which was heavily influenced by Persian and Islamic architectural styles. However, the Taj Mahal also incorporates elements of Indian architectural traditions, such as the use of sandstone and the use of domes. The Taj Mahal is a testament to the globalization of architectural styles, as it reflects the cultural exchange between India and the Middle East.

These case studies highlight the diversity and interconnectedness of architectural styles across the world. They show how architects are influenced by the cultural and environmental contexts of the places they work, and how they blend these influences to create unique and innovative architectural designs.

The concept of the global has had a profound impact on architecture, shaping the way architects approach design and construction. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, architects are faced with the challenge of creating buildings that not only function well, but also reflect the global nature of our society.

#### The Global City

The concept of the global city, as defined by Sassen (1991), has had a significant impact on architectural design. Sassen's theory posits that cities are increasingly becoming centers of global economic activity, with a growing number of jobs in the service sector. This has led to the development of specialized buildings, such as the corporate headquarters, the convention center, and the luxury hotel. These buildings are designed to cater to the needs of the global elite, and often feature high-end amenities and services.

The concept of the global city has also influenced the design of public spaces. As more people move to cities, there is a growing need for public spaces that can accommodate large numbers of people. This has led to the development of public spaces that are designed to be flexible and adaptable, capable of hosting a variety of events and activities.

#### Globalization and Architectural Design

Globalization, the process of increased interconnectedness and interdependence among countries, has also had a significant impact on architectural design. As architects work in a global context, they are exposed to a wide range of cultural influences, which can be reflected in their designs. This has led to the emergence of new architectural styles, such as postmodernism, which incorporates elements from different cultures and historical periods.

Globalization has also led to the development of new materials and technologies, which have been incorporated into architectural design. For example, the use of computer-aided architectural design (CAAD) has become widespread, allowing architects to create complex and innovative designs. The use of sustainable materials and technologies, such as green roofs and solar panels, has also become more prevalent, reflecting the growing concern for the environment.

### Subsection: 1.4a Definition of Euro-centrism and Ethno-centrism

Euro-centrism and ethno-centrism are two intertwined concepts that have played a significant role in the history of architectural design. Both concepts are rooted in the idea of cultural superiority and have been used to justify various forms of discrimination and exclusion.

#### Euro-centrism

Euro-centrism, also known as Western-centrism, is a worldview that is centered on Western civilization or a biased view that favors it over non-Western civilizations. The exact scope of Euro-centrism varies from the entire Western world to just the continent of Europe or even more narrowly, to Western Europe (especially during the Cold War). When the term is applied historically, it may be used in reference to an apologetic stance toward European colonialism and other forms of imperialism.

The term "Eurocentrism" dates back to the late 1970s but it did not become prevalent until the 1990s, when it was frequently applied in the context of decolonisation and development and humanitarian aid that industrialised countries offered to developing countries. The term has since been used to critique Western narratives of progress, Western scholars who have downplayed and ignored non-Western contributions, and to contrast Western epistemologies with Indigenous ways of knowing.

#### Ethno-centrism

Ethno-centrism, on the other hand, is a form of Euro-centrism that is specifically focused on the ethnic group of the person or group promoting the ideology. It is a form of chauvinism that emphasizes the superiority of one's own ethnic group and devalues or denigrates other ethnic groups. Ethno-centrism can be seen in the way certain architectural styles and techniques are valued and promoted over others, often based on the ethnic background of the architect or the cultural context of the building.

#### The Intersection of Euro-centrism and Ethno-centrism in Architecture

The intersection of Euro-centrism and ethno-centrism in architecture has been a topic of much debate and controversy. The dominance of Western architectural styles and techniques, often at the expense of non-Western ones, has been seen as a manifestation of Euro-centrism and ethno-centrism. This dominance has been perpetuated through various mechanisms, including the education system, where Western architectural history and theory are often given more emphasis than non-Western ones.

However, it is important to note that Euro-centrism and ethno-centrism are not inherent in architectural design. They are products of specific historical and cultural contexts, and can be challenged and transformed through critical analysis and creative innovation. As we delve deeper into the history of architectural design, it is crucial to keep these concepts in mind, and to strive for a more inclusive and equitable approach to architectural education and practice.

The impact of Euro-centrism and ethno-centrism on architectural history is profound and multifaceted. These ideologies have shaped the way architectural history is studied, written, and taught, often to the exclusion of non-Western perspectives and contributions.

#### The Euro-centric Narrative

The Euro-centric narrative of architectural history is deeply rooted in the principles of Euro-centrism and ethno-centrism. This narrative is often characterized by a focus on Western architectural styles and techniques, with little to no consideration of non-Western contributions. This bias is evident in the way architectural history textbooks are organized, with chapters often dedicated to specific Western architectural movements, such as Gothic, Renaissance, and Modernism, while non-Western architectural traditions are often relegated to a single chapter or section.

This Euro-centric narrative has been criticized for its exclusion of non-Western perspectives and contributions. For instance, the architectural traditions of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Indus Valley are often overlooked or marginalized in favor of Western architectural styles. This bias can be traced back to the colonial era, when Western architectural styles were imposed on non-Western societies as a symbol of Western superiority.

#### The Ethno-centric Bias

Ethno-centrism has also played a significant role in shaping architectural history. The promotion of certain architectural styles and techniques over others, often based on the ethnic background of the architect or the cultural context of the building, can be seen as a form of ethno-centrism. This bias can be seen in the way certain architectural styles, such as Art Deco and Modernism, are often associated with specific ethnic groups, such as the French and the Germans, respectively.

This ethno-centric bias can also be seen in the way architectural history is taught. Many architectural history courses focus on the architectural styles and techniques of specific ethnic groups, often to the exclusion of others. This can lead to a narrow and ethno-centric understanding of architectural history, one that fails to recognize the diversity and complexity of architectural traditions around the world.

#### The Need for a More Inclusive Narrative

The impact of Euro-centrism and ethno-centrism on architectural history is not just theoretical. It has real-world implications for the practice of architecture. By promoting a Euro-centric and ethno-centric narrative of architectural history, we risk perpetuating a narrow and exclusionary understanding of architecture.
