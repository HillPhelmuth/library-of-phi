# Brownfield land

Brownfield refers to land that is abandoned or underutilized due to pollution from industrial use. The specific definition of brownfield land varies and is decided by policy makers and/or land developers within different countries. The main difference in definitions of whether a piece of land is considered a brownfield or not depends on the presence or absence of pollution. Overall, brownfield land is a site previously developed for industrial or commercial purposes and thus requires further development before reuse.

Examples of post industrial brownfield sites include abandoned factories, dry cleaning establishments, gas stations, etc. Typical contaminants include hydrocarbon spillages, solvents and pesticides, as well as heavy metals like lead, asbestos, petroleum, etc.

Many contaminated post-industrial brownfield sites sit unused because the cleaning costs may be more than the land is worth after redevelopment. Previously unknown underground wastes can increase the cost for study and clean-up. Depending on the contaminants and damage present adaptive re-use and disposal of a brownfield can require advanced and specialized appraisal analysis techniques.

### Section: 2.2 Brownfield Legislation and Policy:

#### 2.2a Overview of Brownfield Legislation

The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act, also known as the Brownfields Law, was enacted by the United States Congress in 2002. This legislation was designed to provide incentives for the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfield sites, which are abandoned or underutilized properties that have been contaminated by hazardous materials.

The Brownfields Law established two sources of funding for brownfield revitalization: Section 104(k) and Section 128(a). These sections provide $250 million per year for brownfields revitalization, with $200 million going towards assessment, cleanup, revolving loans, and environmental job training, and $50 million to assist state and tribal response programs.

The Environmental Protection Agency's Brownfields Program works in collaboration with federal partners and state agencies to identify and leverage resources for brownfield activities. This collaboration leads to a process of engagement reliant upon public–private partnerships to turn dilapidated properties into viable economic redevelopments or "green-space" throughout the country.

The funding criteria for brownfield revitalization include the extent to which the money will be used to protect human health and the environment, spur redevelopment and create jobs, preserve open space and parks, represent a "fair" distribution between urban and rural areas, address "sensitive populations", and involve the local community.

#### 2.2b Brownfield Legislation and Policy in Practice

The Brownfields Law has been instrumental in the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfield sites across the United States. It has provided funding for assessment, cleanup, and job training, and has encouraged public-private partnerships to transform abandoned properties into productive spaces.

## Chapter 4: Remediation Techniques:




### Related Context
```
# Groundwater remediation

## Techniques

Ground water remediation techniques span biological, chemical, and physical treatment technologies. Most ground water treatment techniques utilize a combination of technologies. Some of the biological treatment techniques include bioaugmentation, bioventing, biosparging, bioslurping, and phytoremediation. Some chemical treatment techniques include ozone and oxygen gas injection, chemical precipitation, membrane separation, ion exchange, carbon absorption, aqueous chemical oxidation, and surfactant enhanced recovery. Some physical treatment techniques include pump and treat, air sparging, and dual phase extraction.

### Biological treatment technologies

#### Bioaugmentation

If a treatability study shows no degradation (or an extended lab period before significant degradation is achieved) in contamination contained in the groundwater, then inoculation with strains known to be capable of degrading the contaminants may be helpful. This process increases the reactive enzyme concentration within the bioremediation system and subsequently may increase contaminant degradation rates over the nonaugmented rates, at least initially after inoculation.

#### Bioventing

Bioventing is an on site remediation technology that uses microorganisms to biodegrade organic constituents in the groundwater system. Bioventing enhances the activity of indigenous bacteria and archaea and stimulates the natural in situ biodegradation of hydrocarbons by inducing air or oxygen flow into the unsaturated zone and, if necessary, by adding nutrients. During bioventing, oxygen may be supplied through direct air injection into residual contamination in soil. Bioventing primarily assists in the degradation of adsorbed fuel residuals, but also assists in the degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as vapors move slowly through biologically active zones.

#### Bioremediation

Bioremediation is a process that uses microorganisms to break down or remove pollutants from the environment. This process can be used to treat a variety of pollutants, including petroleum hydrocarbons, pesticides, and solvents. Bioremediation is a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional methods of pollution cleanup, such as excavation and disposal.

##### Types of Bioremediation

There are several types of bioremediation techniques that can be used to treat pollutants in the environment. These include:

- In Situ Bioremediation: This type of bioremediation involves treating the pollutants in their original location. This can be done through the use of microorganisms that are naturally present in the environment or by introducing specific microorganisms that are known to break down the pollutants.
- Ex Situ Bioremediation: Ex situ bioremediation involves removing the pollutants from their original location and treating them in a controlled environment. This can be done through the use of microorganisms in a bioreactor or through chemical or physical treatment methods.
- Phytoremediation: Phytoremediation uses plants to remove, stabilize, or break down pollutants in the environment. This can be done through the use of hyperaccumulator plants that absorb and store pollutants in their tissues, or through the use of plants that produce enzymes that break down pollutants.
- Biostimulation: Biostimulation involves stimulating the growth of indigenous microorganisms in the environment to break down pollutants. This can be done by adding nutrients or other substances that promote microbial growth.
- Bioaugmentation: Bioaugmentation involves introducing specific microorganisms that are known to break down pollutants into the environment. This can be done through the use of genetically modified microorganisms or through the introduction of naturally occurring microorganisms.

##### Advantages and Limitations of Bioremediation

Bioremediation offers several advantages over traditional methods of pollution cleanup. These include:

- Cost-effectiveness: Bioremediation is generally less expensive than other methods of pollution cleanup, such as excavation and disposal.
- Environmental Friendliness: Bioremediation is a natural process that does not involve the use of harsh chemicals or equipment. This makes it a more environmentally friendly option compared to other methods.
- Versatility: Bioremediation can be used to treat a wide range of pollutants, making it a versatile and adaptable method.

However, bioremediation also has some limitations that must be considered. These include:

- Dependence on Environmental Conditions: Bioremediation is dependent on certain environmental conditions, such as temperature, pH, and nutrient availability. If these conditions are not optimal, the effectiveness of bioremediation may be limited.
- Limited Applicability: Bioremediation may not be suitable for all types of pollutants or all types of environments. For example, some pollutants may not be easily degradable by microorganisms, and some environments may not have the necessary conditions for bioremediation to be effective.
- Potential Risks: There is a risk of contamination if the pollutants are not properly contained during the bioremediation process. Additionally, the use of genetically modified microorganisms in bioremediation may raise ethical concerns.

Despite these limitations, bioremediation remains a valuable tool in the field of environmental management, offering a sustainable and cost-effective solution for pollution cleanup. As research and technology continue to advance, the effectiveness and applicability of bioremediation will only continue to improve.





### Subsection: 3.2b Selection of Remediation Techniques

It involves evaluating the effectiveness, feasibility, and cost of various remediation techniques to determine the most suitable approach for a specific site. This section will discuss the factors that influence the selection of remediation techniques and the process of evaluating and comparing different techniques.

#### Factors Influencing the Selection of Remediation Techniques

The selection of remediation techniques is influenced by a variety of factors, including the type and extent of contamination, site characteristics, regulatory requirements, and cost. 

The type and extent of contamination play a significant role in determining the most effective remediation technique. For instance, biological treatment techniques like bioaugmentation and bioventing may be more suitable for treating organic contaminants, while physical treatment techniques like pump and treat and air sparging may be more effective for inorganic contaminants.

Site characteristics, such as soil type, groundwater flow, and topography, also influence the selection of remediation techniques. For example, the effectiveness of physical treatment techniques like pump and treat and air sparging may be limited by the soil type and groundwater flow.

Regulatory requirements are another important factor to consider. Certain remediation techniques may be required or preferred by regulatory agencies due to their proven effectiveness or minimal environmental impact. For instance, the use of nanomaterials in chemical treatment techniques may be restricted due to potential environmental concerns.

Finally, the cost of remediation techniques is a significant consideration. While some techniques may be more effective, they may also be more expensive. Therefore, a cost-benefit analysis is often necessary to determine the most feasible and cost-effective approach.

#### Process of Evaluating and Comparing Remediation Techniques

The process of evaluating and comparing remediation techniques involves a systematic approach to assess the effectiveness, feasibility, and cost of each technique. This process typically includes the following steps:

1. Identify potential remediation techniques: Based on the type and extent of contamination, site characteristics, and regulatory requirements, a list of potential remediation techniques is identified.

2. Conduct treatability studies: Treatability studies are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each technique on the specific contaminants present at the site. This may involve laboratory testing or field-scale demonstrations.

3. Assess feasibility: The feasibility of each technique is assessed based on the site characteristics and regulatory requirements. This may involve a technical feasibility study or a cost-benefit analysis.

4. Compare and select: The effectiveness, feasibility, and cost of each technique are compared to select the most suitable approach for the site. This may involve a weighted decision matrix or a cost-effectiveness analysis.

In conclusion, the selection of remediation techniques is a critical step in the process of brownfield redevelopment. It requires a thorough understanding of the site characteristics, regulatory requirements, and cost considerations. By following a systematic approach to evaluate and compare different techniques, the most effective and feasible approach can be selected for each site.

### Section: 7.1 Definition and Importance:

#### 7.1a Definition of Sustainable Redevelopment

Sustainable redevelopment is a concept that encompasses the principles of sustainable development and applies them to the redevelopment of existing structures or sites. It is a process that aims to create a balance between the needs of the present and future generations, while also addressing environmental, economic, and social challenges. 

The concept of sustainable redevelopment is closely linked to the principles of sustainable development, as outlined in the 1987 Brundtland Report. This report defined sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." In the context of redevelopment, this means that the redevelopment process should not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their needs.

Sustainable redevelopment is a form of development that coexists with existing forms of development. It is not different from other forms of development, but rather a way of approaching development that takes into account the long-term impacts on the environment, economy, and society. 

The systems for recreation on a small/local level are not universally widespread, but there are several institutions which engage in sustainable development, that can theoretically be carried over to redevelopment. These include the Kyoto Protocol's 12th Article, which speaks to "flexible mechanisms". These mechanisms allow countries which have ratified the Kyoto Protocol to lower their overall emissions through the most economical means, respective, of course, to that country. Theoretically, these mechanisms could be directed towards post-traumatic redevelopment.

#### 7.1b Importance of Sustainable Redevelopment

The importance of sustainable redevelopment cannot be overstated. It is a critical aspect of environmental management, as it allows us to address the environmental, economic, and social challenges associated with the redevelopment of existing structures or sites. 

Sustainable redevelopment is important because it helps to reduce the environmental impact of redevelopment projects. By incorporating sustainable practices into the redevelopment process, we can minimize the negative effects of redevelopment on the environment, such as pollution and resource depletion. 

Sustainable redevelopment is also important because it can contribute to economic development. By using sustainable practices, we can create more efficient and cost-effective redevelopment projects. This can lead to economic benefits, such as job creation and increased property values.

Finally, sustainable redevelopment is important because it can help to address social challenges. By involving the community in the redevelopment process, we can ensure that the redevelopment projects meet the needs of the community and contribute to the overall well-being of its members.

In conclusion, sustainable redevelopment is a crucial aspect of environmental management. It allows us to address the environmental, economic, and social challenges associated with redevelopment projects, while also creating a balance between the needs of the present and future generations.

These events can have a direct impact on brownfield sites, which are often located in areas that have already experienced environmental degradation.

One of the most significant impacts of climate change on brownfield redevelopment is the potential for increased flooding. As sea levels rise and precipitation patterns change, areas that were previously not prone to flooding may experience more frequent and severe flooding. This can make it difficult for developers to redevelop brownfield sites, as they may be located in areas that are now at risk of flooding.

In addition to increased flooding, climate change may also lead to changes in the types of contaminants present on brownfield sites. As temperatures rise, certain contaminants may become more soluble in water, leading to increased groundwater contamination. This can make it more challenging to remediate brownfield sites and may require more advanced and expensive remediation techniques.

Furthermore, climate change may also impact the availability of resources for brownfield redevelopment. As extreme weather events become more frequent, resources may be diverted to address these events, leaving less funding and resources for brownfield redevelopment. This can hinder the progress of brownfield redevelopment projects and delay the revitalization of these properties.

#### 8.1b Strategies for Addressing Climate Change Impacts

To address the potential impacts of climate change on brownfield redevelopment, it is crucial to incorporate climate change considerations into the planning and design of these projects. This can include incorporating climate-resilient design principles, such as elevating buildings to avoid flooding, using sustainable materials, and incorporating green infrastructure to mitigate the effects of extreme weather events.

In addition, it is essential to consider the potential impacts of climate change on brownfield sites during the initial assessment and remediation process. This can include conducting climate change vulnerability assessments to identify potential risks and incorporating climate change projections into remediation plans.

Furthermore, it is crucial to involve local communities in the planning and design process to ensure that their needs and concerns are addressed. This can include involving community members in decision-making processes and providing education and outreach about the potential impacts of climate change on brownfield redevelopment.

#### 8.1c Case Studies in Climate Change and Brownfield Redevelopment

To further illustrate the potential impacts of climate change on brownfield redevelopment, let us examine two case studies: the redevelopment of a former industrial site in New Jersey and the redevelopment of a brownfield site in California.

In New Jersey, a former industrial site was redeveloped into a mixed-use development with residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. However, during the construction process, the site experienced severe flooding due to heavy rainfall and high tides. This flooding delayed the project and increased costs, highlighting the need for climate-resilient design in brownfield redevelopment.

In California, a brownfield site was redeveloped into a solar panel farm. However, during the planning process, the site was identified as being at risk of wildfires due to the changing climate. The project team incorporated fire-resistant materials and design features to mitigate the risk of wildfires. This case study demonstrates the importance of considering climate change impacts during the planning and design process.

In conclusion, climate change is expected to have a significant impact on brownfield redevelopment in the United States. It is crucial to incorporate climate change considerations into the planning and design of these projects to ensure their success and resilience in the face of a changing climate. By involving local communities and incorporating climate-resilient design principles, we can successfully redevelop brownfield sites while addressing the potential impacts of climate change.

### Subsection: 8.2a Overview of Climate Change Mitigation

Climate change mitigation is a critical aspect of environmental management, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment. It involves taking action to limit the impacts of climate change by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases or removing those gases from the atmosphere. The recent rise in global average temperature is primarily due to emissions from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Mitigation can reduce these emissions by transitioning to sustainable energy sources, conserving energy, and increasing efficiency. It is also possible to remove carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) from the atmosphere through processes known as carbon sequestration, which can include enlarging forests, restoring wetlands, and using other natural and technical processes.

Governments and companies have pledged to reduce emissions to prevent dangerous climate change in line with international negotiations to limit warming by reducing emissions. Solar energy and wind power have the greatest potential for mitigation at the lowest cost compared to a range of other options. However, the availability of sunshine and wind is variable. To deal with this, energy storage and improved electrical grids, including long-distance electricity transmission, demand management, and diversification of renewables, can be implemented. Electrifying infrastructure that directly burns fossil fuels, such as vehicles and heating appliances, can also reduce emissions if the electricity comes from renewable sources.

Using heat pumps and electric vehicles can improve energy efficiency. If industrial processes must create carbon dioxide, carbon capture and storage can reduce net emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture include methane as well as nitrous oxide. These emissions can be cut by reducing food waste, switching to a more plant-based diet, protecting ecosystems, and improving farming processes.

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, climate change mitigation strategies can be integrated into the design and implementation of redevelopment projects. This can include incorporating renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and implementing carbon sequestration techniques. By incorporating these strategies, brownfield redevelopment can not only address the environmental impacts of the site but also contribute to global efforts to mitigate climate change.




### Subsection: 8.2b Role of Brownfield Redevelopment in Climate Change Mitigation

Brownfield redevelopment plays a crucial role in climate change mitigation. The redevelopment of brownfields, or abandoned and underutilized properties, can help reduce the need for new development on undeveloped land, thereby preserving natural habitats and ecosystems. This is particularly important in the context of climate change, as undeveloped land often serves as carbon sinks, absorbing and storing large amounts of carbon dioxide. By preserving these areas, we can help mitigate the effects of climate change.

Moreover, brownfield redevelopment can also contribute to climate change mitigation through the use of sustainable remediation practices. Sustainable remediation involves considering not just the immediate environmental implications of a project, but also its long-term social and economic implications. This approach aligns with the principles of sustainability, which aim to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

One aspect of sustainable remediation is co-design, a process that involves engaging in more inclusive conversations with stakeholders and conducting cost-benefit analyses. This approach can help identify the most effective and efficient solutions for brownfield redevelopment, taking into account not just environmental impacts, but also energy and resource consumption. For example, the Society of American Military Engineers has implemented policies to ensure more sustainable practices in land development, including the use of renewable energy sources and energy-efficient design.

In addition to these practices, brownfield redevelopment can also contribute to climate change mitigation by reducing the need for new infrastructure. By reusing existing buildings and materials, we can reduce the energy and resources required for new construction, thereby reducing our carbon footprint. Furthermore, brownfield redevelopment can also help reduce urban sprawl, as it often involves the redevelopment of properties within existing urban areas. This can help preserve open space, forests, and agricultural land, which serve as important carbon sinks.

In conclusion, brownfield redevelopment plays a crucial role in climate change mitigation. By preserving undeveloped land, implementing sustainable remediation practices, and reducing the need for new infrastructure, brownfield redevelopment can help mitigate the effects of climate change. As we continue to grapple with the challenges of climate change, it is essential that we prioritize and invest in brownfield redevelopment as a key strategy for climate change mitigation.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, brownfield redevelopment plays a crucial role in mitigating the impacts of climate change. By repurposing and redeveloping abandoned or underutilized sites, we can reduce the need for new construction and the associated environmental impacts. Moreover, brownfield redevelopment can also contribute to climate change mitigation by promoting sustainable practices and reducing the carbon footprint of urban areas. 

The process of brownfield redevelopment is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach. It involves understanding the environmental, economic, and social aspects of the site, as well as the regulatory and policy frameworks that govern redevelopment. By integrating these aspects, we can develop effective strategies for brownfield redevelopment that not only address environmental concerns but also contribute to sustainable urban development.

As we move forward in the face of climate change, brownfield redevelopment will continue to play a vital role in our efforts to reduce emissions and promote sustainable practices. It is a key component of our environmental management strategy and a testament to our commitment to a sustainable future.

## Chapter: Brownfield Redevelopment and Adaptive Reuse

### Introduction

Brownfield redevelopment and adaptive reuse are two critical aspects of environmental management. Brownfields are abandoned or underutilized properties that are potentially contaminated with hazardous substances. These properties, often located in urban areas, pose significant environmental, health, and economic challenges. However, they also present opportunities for redevelopment and adaptive reuse, which can transform these properties into productive and beneficial spaces.

Adaptive reuse refers to the process of repurposing buildings or structures for uses other than those initially intended. This practice can be particularly beneficial for brownfields, as it allows for the preservation of existing structures while providing new opportunities for development. Adaptive reuse can also contribute to urban revitalization and the creation of more sustainable communities.

In this chapter, we will explore the principles and practices of brownfield redevelopment and adaptive reuse. We will discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with these processes, as well as the environmental, economic, and social benefits they can offer. We will also examine case studies and best practices to provide a comprehensive understanding of these important topics.




### Subsection: 8.2c Case Studies in Climate Change Mitigation

In this section, we will explore some case studies that demonstrate the successful implementation of climate change mitigation strategies in brownfield redevelopment.

#### 8.2c.1 The Greening of Brownfields in the City of Boston

The City of Boston has been a leader in brownfield redevelopment and climate change mitigation. The city has implemented a comprehensive brownfield redevelopment program that includes a focus on climate change mitigation. One of the key strategies used by the city is the use of green infrastructure, which involves incorporating natural systems into the design of urban areas. This approach not only helps to mitigate the effects of climate change, but also improves the quality of life for residents.

For example, the city has implemented a green roof program, which involves the installation of vegetation on the roofs of buildings. This helps to reduce the urban heat island effect, where urban areas are significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas due to human activities. Green roofs also help to reduce stormwater runoff, which can lead to flooding and erosion. This is particularly important in the context of climate change, as more intense rainfall events are expected in the future.

#### 8.2c.2 The Role of Brownfield Redevelopment in the Paris Climate Agreement

Brownfield redevelopment plays a crucial role in this effort. By redeveloping brownfields, we can help communities to adapt to the impacts of climate change, such as more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, and floods.

For example, the ARC-X provides tools for assessing vulnerability to climate change impacts, which can help guide brownfield redevelopment efforts. It also provides tools for developing adaptation plans, which can help communities to incorporate climate change considerations into their brownfield redevelopment plans. This helps to ensure that brownfield redevelopment is not only environmentally sustainable, but also resilient to the impacts of climate change.




### Subsection: 8.3a Definition of Community Resilience

Community resilience is a concept that has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in the context of climate change. It refers to the ability of a community to withstand and recover from shocks and stresses, whether they be natural disasters, economic downturns, or social disruptions. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, community resilience is a crucial aspect to consider, as these sites often pose significant environmental, health, and economic challenges that can impact the surrounding community.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines community resilience as "the ability of a community to utilize available resources to respond to, withstand, and recover from adverse situations." This definition highlights the importance of both the community's ability to respond to a crisis and its capacity to recover and rebuild in the aftermath.

The Post Carbon Institute's online course "Think Resilience" offers a more comprehensive definition of community resilience. It states that resilience is the ability of a community to "rebuild after disaster" and to maintain the economy and ecosystem that the community depends on. This definition emphasizes the importance of both adaptability and prevention in building community resilience.

The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report defines climate resilience as "the capacity of social, economic and ecosystems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganising in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure as well as biodiversity in case of ecosystems while also adapting to changing patterns in climate hazards and variability." This definition highlights the importance of not only recovering from climate-related shocks, but also adapting to the changing climate patterns.

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, community resilience is crucial. These sites often pose significant environmental, health, and economic challenges that can impact the surrounding community. By incorporating community resilience planning into the redevelopment process, we can ensure that the community is able to withstand and recover from the potential impacts of these sites. This includes considering the social needs of the community, as well as dependencies on the "built environment" - buildings and infrastructure systems.

In the next section, we will explore the role of community resilience in brownfield redevelopment and climate change.

### Subsection: 8.3b Role of Community Resilience in Brownfield Redevelopment

### Subsection: 10.2a Definition of Health Impact Assessment

Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is a systematic process that evaluates the potential health effects of a proposed policy, program, or project on the health of a population and the distribution of those effects within the population. It is a combination of procedures, methods, and tools that aim to inform decision-making by identifying potential positive and negative health impacts and developing evidence-based recommendations to maximize the positive impacts and minimize the negative impacts.

HIA is a crucial tool in the field of environmental management, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment. Brownfields are abandoned or underutilized properties that have been contaminated by hazardous substances, pollutants, or other contaminants. The redevelopment of these properties can have significant impacts on public health, both positive and negative. Therefore, conducting an HIA can help identify potential health risks and develop strategies to mitigate them, ensuring that the redevelopment process is safe and beneficial to the community.

The procedures of HIA are similar to those used in other forms of impact assessment, such as environmental impact assessment or social impact assessment. However, HIA is unique in its focus on health impacts and the distribution of those impacts within the population. It seeks to apply existing knowledge and evidence about health impacts to specific social and community contexts, developing evidence-based recommendations that inform decision-making in order to protect and improve community health and well-being.

The main objective of HIA is to identify potential health impacts and develop strategies to mitigate them. This can include recommendations for design and operational aspects of a proposal. For example, in the context of brownfield redevelopment, an HIA might recommend the use of certain construction materials or remediation techniques to minimize exposure to contaminants. It might also recommend the inclusion of health-promoting features, such as green spaces or community gardens, to improve the overall health and well-being of the community.

In addition to its role in informing decision-making, HIA can also be used as a mechanism to identify and redress potential health inequalities. By considering the potential health impacts of a proposed policy, program, or project on different population groups, HIA can help identify areas of potential health inequality and develop strategies to address them.

In conclusion, Health Impact Assessment is a crucial tool in the field of environmental management, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment. It provides a systematic and evidence-based approach to evaluating and mitigating potential health impacts, ensuring that the redevelopment process is safe and beneficial to the community.

### Subsection: 11.1a Overview of Economic Impacts

Brownfield redevelopment has a significant impact on the economy, both positively and negatively. The positive impacts include job creation, increased property values, and reduced urban sprawl. On the other hand, the negative impacts include potential health risks and environmental degradation.

#### Positive Economic Impacts

Brownfield redevelopment can lead to the creation of new jobs. The process of cleaning up and redeveloping these properties requires a variety of skilled and unskilled labor, which can provide employment opportunities for local communities. Furthermore, once the redevelopment is complete, the new businesses and facilities that move into these properties can also create additional jobs.

Redeveloping brownfields can also increase property values in the surrounding areas. As these properties are often located in urban areas, their redevelopment can lead to a ripple effect, where property values in the surrounding areas also increase. This can be beneficial for property owners and can also lead to increased tax revenue for local governments.

Brownfield redevelopment can also help to reduce urban sprawl. By redeveloping existing properties, there is less need to build new developments on undeveloped land. This can help to preserve natural resources and protect sensitive ecosystems.

#### Negative Economic Impacts

Despite the potential benefits, brownfield redevelopment can also have negative economic impacts. The process of cleaning up and redeveloping these properties can be costly, and these costs can be passed on to taxpayers. Furthermore, if not managed properly, brownfield redevelopment can lead to health risks and environmental degradation. For example, if hazardous substances are not properly managed during the cleanup process, they can pose health risks to nearby communities.

#### Economic Impact Analysis

To better understand the economic impacts of brownfield redevelopment, economic impact analyses are often conducted. These analyses estimate the sources of the impacts, including direct, indirect, and induced effects. Direct effects are the results of the money initially spent in the study region by the business or organization being studied. Indirect effects are the results of the money spent by the businesses and organizations that supply goods and services to the direct spending businesses and organizations. Induced effects are the results of the money spent by the employees of the direct and indirect spending businesses and organizations.

In conclusion, brownfield redevelopment has a significant impact on the economy. While it can lead to job creation, increased property values, and reduced urban sprawl, it can also have negative impacts such as increased costs and potential health risks. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider the economic impacts of brownfield redevelopment and to implement strategies to mitigate any negative impacts.

#### 12.1b Role of Social Equity in Brownfield Redevelopment

Social equity plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment. As mentioned earlier, brownfields are often located in disadvantaged communities that have historically borne a disproportionate share of environmental risks and burdens. The redevelopment of these sites can bring about economic benefits, such as job creation and increased property values, which can improve the quality of life in these communities. However, it is essential to ensure that these benefits are equitably distributed among all community members, particularly those who have been historically marginalized or disadvantaged.

The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act, also known as the Brownfields Law, provides funding for brownfield redevelopment. This Act requires an EPA administrator to make contamination on the property publicly available within two years from discovery. This public disclosure can help to ensure that all community members are aware of the potential risks associated with the brownfield and can participate in the decision-making process.

The Brownfields Law also requires an "all appropriate inquiry" to be conducted by the landowner. This inquiry involves investigating the previous use of the land and any potential contamination. The results of this inquiry can help to inform the redevelopment process and ensure that any potential risks are adequately addressed.

In addition to these stipulations, the Brownfields Law also includes provisions for funding brownfield redevelopment. Specifically, $200 million per year is allocated for brownfields assessment, cleanup, revolving loans, and environmental job training, and $50 million per year is allocated to assist State and Tribal response programs. These funds can help to support the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields, but it is crucial to ensure that these funds are used in a way that promotes social equity.

The Brownfields Law also emphasizes the importance of public-private partnerships in brownfield redevelopment. These partnerships can help to leverage resources and expertise to facilitate the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields. However, it is essential to ensure that these partnerships are inclusive and involve all community members, particularly those who have been historically marginalized or disadvantaged.

In conclusion, social equity plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment. It is essential to ensure that the benefits of brownfield redevelopment are equitably distributed among all community members, particularly those who have been historically marginalized or disadvantaged. This requires proactive efforts to involve these communities in the planning and decision-making processes, as well as policies that promote fair distribution of benefits.

# Environmental Management Practicum: Brownfield Redevelopment

## Chapter 13: Brownfield Redevelopment and Sustainable Development




### Introduction

Brownfield redevelopment is a critical aspect of environmental management, particularly in urban areas where industrial or commercial activities have left behind contaminated sites. These sites, known as brownfields, pose significant environmental and health risks to surrounding communities. However, with proper management and remediation, brownfields can be transformed into valuable assets, contributing to economic growth and revitalizing blighted areas.

In this chapter, we will explore the intersection of brownfield redevelopment and environmental justice. Environmental justice is a concept that recognizes the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards on marginalized communities, particularly communities of color and low-income communities. Brownfield redevelopment, if not managed carefully, can exacerbate these injustices. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the environmental justice implications of brownfield redevelopment and to incorporate principles of environmental justice into the planning and implementation of brownfield redevelopment projects.

We will begin by discussing the definition and significance of environmental justice, including its historical context and key principles. We will then delve into the specific environmental justice issues associated with brownfield redevelopment, such as gentrification, displacement, and health risks. We will also explore strategies for promoting environmental justice in brownfield redevelopment, including community engagement, capacity building, and policy advocacy.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of brownfield redevelopment and environmental justice, equipping readers with the knowledge and tools to navigate this complex and critical issue. Whether you are a student, a professional, or a community member, we hope that this chapter will inspire you to think critically about the environmental justice implications of brownfield redevelopment and to advocate for equitable and sustainable solutions.




### Subsection: 13.1a Definition of Environmental Justice

Environmental justice is a concept that encompasses a wide range of issues, including environmental racism, environmental inequality, and ecological distribution conflicts. It is typically defined as distributive justice, which is "the equitable distribution of environmental risks and benefits". This definition recognizes that certain communities, particularly those that are poor or marginalized, bear a disproportionate share of environmental risks, such as exposure to hazardous waste or pollution.

However, environmental justice is not just about distributive justice. It also involves procedural justice, which is the "fair and meaningful participation in decision-making". This aspect of environmental justice recognizes that marginalized communities are often excluded from decision-making processes that affect their environment and health. Finally, environmental justice also involves recognition justice, which is the "recognition of oppression" and "difference" in environmental justice communities. This aspect of environmental justice recognizes the historical and social factors that have led to the current state of environmental injustice.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines environmental justice as:

> the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.

This definition highlights the importance of fairness and meaningful participation in environmental decision-making. It also recognizes the role of environmental laws, regulations, and policies in addressing environmental injustice.

Environmental justice is also discussed as environmental racism or environmental inequality. These terms highlight the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards on marginalized communities, particularly those that are poor or communities of color. This impact can be seen in the higher rates of environmental hazards in these communities, as well as the lack of access to environmental benefits, such as parks and clean water.

Joan Martinez-Alier's influential concept of the environmentalism of the poor further emphasizes the importance of including the perspectives and needs of marginalized communities in environmental decision-making. Martinez-Alier's work also introduces the concept of "ecological distribution conflicts," which are conflicts over access to and control of natural resources and the environmental impacts that result from their use. These conflicts are often rooted in social and economic inequalities, and addressing them is a key aspect of environmental justice.

There are various ways in which everyone can enjoy environmental justices. These include:

- Equitable distribution of environmental risks and benefits: All communities should have equal access to clean air, water, and land, and should not bear an unfair share of environmental risks.
- Meaningful participation in decision-making: All communities should have the opportunity to participate in decisions that affect their environment and health.
- Recognition of oppression and difference: The historical and social factors that have led to environmental injustice should be recognized and addressed.
- Capacity to convert social goods into a flourishing community: All communities should have the resources and capacity to convert environmental benefits into a flourishing community.

In the next section, we will explore the specific environmental justice issues associated with brownfield redevelopment, and discuss strategies for promoting environmental justice in brownfield redevelopment projects.




### Subsection: 13.1b Role of Environmental Justice in Brownfield Redevelopment

Environmental justice plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment. Brownfields are abandoned or underutilized properties that have been contaminated by hazardous substances, pollutants, or other contaminants. These properties often pose significant health and environmental risks to nearby communities, particularly those that are already disadvantaged or marginalized.

The redevelopment of brownfields presents an opportunity to address environmental justice issues. By cleaning up and redeveloping these properties, we can reduce or eliminate environmental hazards and improve the quality of life for nearby communities. However, the process of brownfield redevelopment can also exacerbate environmental justice issues if it is not carried out in a fair and equitable manner.

One of the key challenges in brownfield redevelopment is ensuring that the benefits of redevelopment are equitably distributed. This includes benefits such as improved property values, job creation, and improved environmental conditions. To ensure equitable distribution, it is important to involve the local community in the planning and decision-making processes. This can help to ensure that the needs and concerns of the community are taken into account, and that the benefits of redevelopment are shared fairly.

Another important aspect of environmental justice in brownfield redevelopment is the issue of environmental gentrification. Environmental gentrification occurs when the redevelopment of brownfields leads to an increase in property values and attracts new residents and businesses to the area. This can result in displacement of existing residents, particularly those who are low-income or marginalized. To address this issue, it is important to consider the potential impacts of redevelopment on the local community, and to develop strategies to mitigate any potential negative impacts.

In conclusion, environmental justice plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment. It is important to consider the potential environmental justice impacts of redevelopment, and to involve the local community in the planning and decision-making processes. By doing so, we can ensure that brownfield redevelopment contributes to environmental justice, and helps to create healthier and more equitable communities.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the redevelopment of brownfields is a complex and multifaceted process that requires careful consideration of environmental justice issues. The redevelopment of brownfields can have significant environmental, economic, and social benefits, but it can also exacerbate existing environmental inequalities if not managed carefully. Therefore, it is crucial for environmental managers to incorporate principles of environmental justice into their brownfield redevelopment plans. This includes involving local communities in the decision-making process, conducting thorough environmental assessments, and implementing strategies to mitigate potential environmental and social impacts. By doing so, we can ensure that brownfield redevelopment contributes to the creation of healthier, more sustainable, and more equitable communities.

The redevelopment of brownfields in Richmond has been a priority, as it presents an opportunity to address the environmental and health concerns of the community. However, there have been concerns about the potential for environmental gentrification, as the redevelopment of these properties has led to an increase in property values and attracting new businesses and residents to the area.

#### Case Study 3: The City of Portland, Oregon

The City of Portland in Oregon has taken a proactive approach to brownfield redevelopment, with a focus on environmental justice and community involvement. The city has implemented policies and programs to encourage the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields, and has also established a Community Engagement and Environmental Justice Program to ensure that the needs and concerns of disadvantaged communities are taken into account.

One notable example is the redevelopment of the former Portland Public Schools Central Kitchen site, which was contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons and other hazardous substances. The redevelopment process involved extensive community engagement, and the site was cleaned up and redeveloped into a mixed-use development that includes affordable housing, retail, and public space.

These case studies highlight the complex and multifaceted nature of environmental justice in brownfield redevelopment. They also underscore the importance of community involvement and equitable distribution of benefits in the process. As we continue to address the issue of brownfields, it is crucial that we do so in a way that is fair and just for all communities.




### Subsection: 13.2a Overview of Environmental Justice Strategies

Environmental justice strategies are crucial for addressing the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards on marginalized communities. These strategies aim to promote equitable and sustainable living conditions for all individuals, regardless of their race, color, sex, national origin, or income. In this section, we will provide an overview of environmental justice strategies and their role in brownfield redevelopment.

#### Environmental Justice Strategies

Environmental justice strategies can be broadly categorized into three main areas: prevention, mitigation, and remediation. Prevention strategies aim to prevent the creation of environmental hazards, such as pollution or contamination, in the first place. Mitigation strategies focus on reducing the impact of existing environmental hazards on communities. Remediation strategies involve the cleanup and restoration of contaminated sites.

Prevention strategies are often the most effective in promoting environmental justice, as they prevent the creation of environmental hazards that can disproportionately impact marginalized communities. These strategies can include regulations and policies that limit the use of hazardous materials, promoting sustainable practices, and promoting community involvement in decision-making processes.

Mitigation strategies are also important in addressing environmental justice issues. These strategies aim to reduce the impact of existing environmental hazards on communities. This can include measures such as implementing pollution control technologies, promoting green infrastructure, and providing community education and outreach.

Remediation strategies are crucial for addressing the legacy of environmental hazards in marginalized communities. These strategies involve the cleanup and restoration of contaminated sites, such as brownfields. This not only improves the health and well-being of the community, but also creates opportunities for economic revitalization and community empowerment.

#### Environmental Justice and Brownfield Redevelopment

Brownfield redevelopment presents a unique opportunity to address environmental justice issues. Brownfields are abandoned or underutilized properties that have been contaminated by hazardous substances. These properties are often located in marginalized communities, and their redevelopment can have significant impacts on the surrounding community.

Environmental justice strategies play a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment. Prevention strategies can be used to prevent the creation of new environmental hazards during the redevelopment process. Mitigation strategies can be used to reduce the impact of existing hazards on the community. Remediation strategies can be used to clean up and restore the contaminated site.

In addition to these strategies, community involvement is also essential in brownfield redevelopment. Community members must be involved in the decision-making process and have a say in the redevelopment plans. This not only promotes transparency and accountability, but also ensures that the redevelopment process is equitable and sustainable for all members of the community.

#### Conclusion

Environmental justice strategies are crucial for addressing the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards on marginalized communities. These strategies play a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment, as they aim to promote equitable and sustainable living conditions for all individuals. By incorporating prevention, mitigation, and remediation strategies, as well as promoting community involvement, we can work towards a more just and sustainable future for all.

Green infrastructure is a type of sustainable infrastructure that utilizes natural systems and processes to manage water and improve the quality of the environment. It is a decentralized network of stormwater management practices that includes green roofs, trees, bioretention and infiltration, and permeable pavement. Green infrastructure has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its effectiveness in providing ecological, economic, and social benefits.

Green roofs are a type of green infrastructure that has gained significant attention in recent years. They are roofs that are partially or completely covered with vegetation, planted over a membrane. This includes additional layers, such as a root barrier, drainage and irrigation systems. Green roofs can be categorized into two types: extensive and intensive. Extensive green roofs have a growing media depth ranging from two to six inches, while intensive green roofs have a growing media depth greater than six inches.

Green roofs provide numerous benefits, including reducing stormwater runoff, reducing energy usage, and reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide. By storing water in the growing media, green roofs can reduce the amount of runoff entering the sewer system and waterways, decreasing the risk of combined sewer overflows. They also reduce energy usage by providing additional insulation, reducing the amount of solar radiation on the roof's surface, and providing evaporative cooling, which reduces roof surface temperatures and heat influx. This, in turn, lowers carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation. Additionally, green roofs sequester carbon, further reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.

Another important aspect of green infrastructure is tree planting. Trees provide a host of ecological, social, and economic benefits. They improve air and water quality, provide habitat for wildlife, and enhance the aesthetic appeal of urban areas. Trees also play a crucial role in mitigating the urban heat island effect, reducing temperatures and improving overall air quality.

In the next section, we will explore the intersection of green infrastructure and brownfield redevelopment. We will discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with incorporating green infrastructure into brownfield redevelopment projects, and how it can contribute to creating more sustainable and resilient communities.

#### 14.2a Overview of Green Infrastructure Strategies

Green infrastructure strategies are a set of practices that aim to mimic natural processes to manage water and create healthier urban environments. These strategies are becoming increasingly popular due to their effectiveness in providing ecological, economic, and social benefits. In this section, we will provide an overview of some of the most commonly used green infrastructure strategies, including green roofs, tree planting, bioretention and infiltration, and permeable pavement.

##### Green Roofs

Green roofs are a type of green infrastructure that involves the installation of a layer of vegetation on the roof of a building. This layer is planted over a waterproof membrane and includes additional layers such as a root barrier, drainage, and irrigation systems. Green roofs can be categorized into two types: extensive (with a growing media depth ranging from two to six inches) and intensive (with a growing media depth greater than six inches).

Green roofs provide numerous benefits, including reducing stormwater runoff, reducing energy usage, and reducing the urban heat island effect. They also help to sequester carbon dioxide, which can help to mitigate climate change.

##### Tree Planting

Tree planting is another common green infrastructure strategy that provides a host of ecological, social, and economic benefits. Trees help to improve air quality, reduce the urban heat island effect, and provide habitat for wildlife. They also help to reduce stormwater runoff and improve the aesthetic appeal of an area.

##### Bioretention and Infiltration

Bioretention and infiltration are practices that aim to capture and treat stormwater runoff. These practices use vegetation and soil to filter and break down pollutants in the water, reducing the impact on waterways and sewer systems. Bioretention areas can be designed as shallow or deep systems, depending on the specific needs of the site.

##### Permeable Pavement

Permeable pavement is a type of pavement that allows water to pass through it, reducing the amount of stormwater runoff. This can help to reduce the strain on sewer systems and improve the quality of water entering waterways. Permeable pavement can be made from a variety of materials, including porous asphalt, pervious concrete, and permeable interlocking pavers.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into each of these strategies, discussing their benefits, challenges, and best practices for implementation.

#### 14.2b Benefits of Green Infrastructure Strategies

Green infrastructure strategies offer a multitude of benefits, both ecological and economic. These benefits are often interconnected and can have a cascading effect on the surrounding environment and community. In this section, we will explore some of the key benefits of green infrastructure strategies, including their impact on water quality, energy consumption, and the urban heat island effect.

##### Water Quality

Green infrastructure strategies, particularly bioretention and infiltration, play a crucial role in improving water quality. By capturing and treating stormwater runoff, these strategies help to reduce the amount of pollutants entering waterways and sewer systems. This can have a significant impact on the health of aquatic ecosystems and the communities that rely on these water sources.

For instance, a study conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found that bioretention areas can remove up to 90% of total suspended solids, 85% of oil and grease, and 70% of nitrogen from stormwater runoff[^1^]. This is particularly important in urban areas where impervious surfaces such as concrete and asphalt increase the volume of runoff and the concentration of pollutants.

##### Energy Consumption

Green infrastructure strategies can also help to reduce energy consumption. For example, green roofs can provide additional insulation, reducing the amount of heating and cooling needed in a building. This can lead to significant energy savings over time. Additionally, the use of green roofs can also reduce the urban heat island effect, which occurs when urban areas are significantly warmer than their rural surroundings due to human activities. This can lead to increased energy consumption as buildings need to be cooled more frequently and to higher electricity demand during peak hours[^2^].

##### Urban Heat Island Effect

The urban heat island effect can also be mitigated by other green infrastructure strategies, such as tree planting. Trees can provide shade and evaporative cooling, helping to reduce the temperature of urban areas. This can lead to reduced energy consumption, as mentioned earlier, but also has other benefits such as improved air quality and increased biodiversity.

##### Carbon Sequestration

Finally, green infrastructure strategies can help to sequester carbon dioxide, which can help to mitigate climate change. For example, trees and vegetation can absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, storing it in their tissues. This can help to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is a major contributor to climate change.

In conclusion, green infrastructure strategies offer a multitude of benefits that can have a positive impact on the environment and communities. By incorporating these strategies into urban planning and redevelopment, we can create more sustainable and resilient cities.

### Subsection: 17.1a Definition of Historic Preservation

Historic preservation, also known as built heritage preservation or built heritage conservation, is a field of study that seeks to protect, conserve, and preserve buildings, objects, landscapes, or other artifacts of historical significance. It is a philosophical concept that gained popularity in the twentieth century, which maintains that cities, as products of centuries' development, should be obligated to protect their patrimonial legacy. The term refers specifically to the preservation of the built environment, and not to preservation of, for example, primeval forests or wilderness.

#### 17.1a.1 Areas of Professional, Paid Practice

Paid work, performed by trained professionals, in historic preservation can be divided into five main areas: regulatory compliance, architecture and construction, historic sites/museums, advocacy, and downtown revitalization/rejuvenation. Each of these areas has a different set of expected skills, knowledge, and abilities.

##### Regulatory Compliance

In the United States, about 90% of professional, paid practice in historic preservation is in the area of regulatory compliance. This is driven by laws, regulations, and guidelines promulgated at the federal, state, and local levels. At the federal level, these include the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and associated regulations, such as Section 106 (54 USC 306108, formerly known as 36 CFR 800), National Register of Historic Places (54 USC 302101-302108), and the Secretary of the Interior's Standards (36 CFR 67). Many states have laws that reference these federal regulations or create parallel regulations, using federal regulatory language. At the local level, preservation laws and regulations are known as "preservation ordinances" and define the need for private property owners to seek a "certificate of appropriateness" when making modifications to existing buildings that are listed in a local historical register.

##### Architecture and Construction

The area of architecture and construction in historic preservation involves the design and construction of new buildings that are sensitive to the historical context of the surrounding area. This includes the use of appropriate architectural styles, materials, and construction techniques.

##### Historic Sites/Museums

Historic sites and museums are another important area of professional practice in historic preservation. This involves the preservation and interpretation of historic buildings, objects, and landscapes for educational and cultural purposes.

##### Advocacy

Advocacy in historic preservation involves promoting the importance of preserving our cultural heritage and advocating for the protection of historic buildings and sites. This can involve working with government agencies, community groups, and other stakeholders to ensure that historic preservation is a priority in urban planning and development.

##### Downtown Revitalization/Rejuvenation

Downtown revitalization and rejuvenation is a relatively new area of professional practice in historic preservation. It involves the use of historic preservation principles and techniques to revitalize and rejuvenate downtown areas, often with the goal of attracting new businesses and residents.

In the next section, we will delve into the intersection of brownfield redevelopment and historic preservation, exploring the challenges and opportunities that arise when redeveloping brownfields that also hold historical significance.

#### 18.1a Definition of Food Systems

Food systems are complex networks that encompass all the stages of food production, from cultivation and harvesting to processing, distribution, and consumption. They are interconnected systems and processes that influence nutrition, food, health, community development, and agriculture. A food system includes all processes and infrastructure involved in feeding a population: growing, harvesting, processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, distribution, and disposal of food and food-related items. It also includes the inputs needed and outputs generated at each of these steps.

Food systems fall within agri-food systems, which encompass the entire range of actors and their interlinked value-adding activities in the primary production of food and non-food agricultural products, as well as in food storage, aggregation, post-harvest handling, transportation, processing, distribution, marketing, disposal, and consumption. A food system operates within and is influenced by social, political, economic, technological, and environmental contexts. It also requires human resources that provide labor, research, and education.

Food systems can be conventional or alternative, depending on their model of food lifespan from origin to plate. Conventional food systems follow traditional methods of food production, distribution, and consumption, while alternative food systems, also known as agroecology, aim to create a more sustainable and equitable food system.

Food systems are dependent on a multitude of ecosystem services. For example, natural pest regulations, microorganisms providing nitrogen-fixation, and pollinators. According to the IPCC, the global food system, including all of the various industries involved in sustainable and conventional food systems, provide employment for 1 billion people. This global food system is facing a number of challenges created by impeding global food security issues created by climate change and non-climate change stresses on the system. About 34% of total greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to the global food system. In 2020 an EU evidence review found that food system gas emissions are on course to increase by 30–40% by 2050 due to population growth and dietary change. According to FAO, it is crucial to build the resilience of agrifood systems so that the

This is particularly important in the context of brownfield redevelopment, as these sites are often located in areas with high housing costs and a high concentration of low-income households.

One of the most common affordable housing strategies is the provision of rental housing. This involves the construction of rental units on the brownfield site, which can be managed by a housing authority or a private developer. The rents for these units are typically subsidized by government funding, making them affordable for low-income households.

Another affordable housing strategy is the provision of homeownership opportunities. This involves the construction of homes for sale on the brownfield site. These homes are often sold at a discount to low-income households, with the assistance of government funding. This strategy can be particularly effective in brownfield redevelopment, as it not only provides affordable housing options, but also helps to build community ownership and pride in the redeveloped site.

#### 19.2a.2 Sustainable Housing Strategies

Sustainable housing strategies are also crucial in brownfield redevelopment. These strategies aim to ensure that the redevelopment process is environmentally sustainable, and that the resulting housing options are energy-efficient and healthy for residents.

One of the key sustainable housing strategies is the use of green building practices. These practices involve the use of sustainable materials, energy-efficient design, and renewable energy sources in the construction of housing units. This not only reduces the environmental impact of the redevelopment process, but also results in housing units that are more energy-efficient and healthier for residents.

Another sustainable housing strategy is the incorporation of green spaces into the redevelopment plan. This involves the inclusion of parks, gardens, and other green spaces in the design of the brownfield site. These spaces not only improve the aesthetic appeal of the site, but also provide important environmental benefits, such as improved air quality and reduced urban heat island effect.

#### 19.2a.3 Mixed-Use Housing Strategies

Mixed-use housing strategies involve the integration of residential, commercial, and recreational spaces in the redevelopment of brownfields. This strategy can be particularly effective in brownfield redevelopment, as it helps to create vibrant, livable communities.

The integration of commercial spaces, such as shops and offices, can help to create a sense of community and provide employment opportunities for local residents. The inclusion of recreational spaces, such as parks and community centers, can improve the quality of life for residents and promote community cohesion.

Mixed-use housing strategies can also help to address the economic viability of brownfield redevelopment. By incorporating commercial and recreational spaces, the redevelopment process can generate revenue, helping to offset the costs associated with site cleanup and construction.

In conclusion, housing strategies play a crucial role in the successful redevelopment of brownfields. By incorporating affordable housing, sustainable practices, and mixed-use design, brownfield redevelopment can not only revitalize these sites, but also create vibrant, livable communities for low-income households.




### Subsection: 19.2b Selection of Housing Strategies

The selection of housing strategies for brownfield redevelopment is a complex process that requires careful consideration of various factors. These factors include the specific characteristics of the brownfield site, the needs and preferences of the local community, and the availability of funding and resources.

#### 19.2b.1 Factors Influencing Housing Strategy Selection

The selection of housing strategies is influenced by a variety of factors. These include:

- **Site Characteristics:** The characteristics of the brownfield site, such as its size, location, and contamination levels, can greatly impact the selection of housing strategies. For example, a larger site may allow for the construction of more housing units, while a site with high levels of contamination may require more extensive remediation efforts.

- **Community Needs and Preferences:** The needs and preferences of the local community are also important considerations in the selection of housing strategies. For instance, if there is a high demand for affordable housing in the area, then affordable housing strategies may be prioritized. Similarly, if there is a preference for sustainable housing options, then sustainable housing strategies may be favored.

- **Availability of Funding and Resources:** The availability of funding and resources can also influence the selection of housing strategies. For example, if there is limited funding available, then more cost-effective strategies may be preferred. Similarly, if there are limited resources available, then strategies that require less resources may be favored.

#### 19.2b.2 Process of Housing Strategy Selection

The process of selecting housing strategies typically involves the following steps:

1. **Identify Potential Strategies:** The first step in the process is to identify potential housing strategies that could be used for the brownfield redevelopment. This can be done through research, consultation with experts, and community engagement.

2. **Evaluate Strategies:** Once potential strategies have been identified, they are evaluated based on the factors influencing strategy selection. This may involve conducting cost-benefit analyses, assessing the feasibility of the strategies, and considering the potential impact on the community.

3. **Select Strategies:** Based on the evaluation, one or more housing strategies are selected for the brownfield redevelopment. This may involve a combination of affordable housing strategies and sustainable housing strategies, depending on the specific needs and preferences of the community.

4. **Implement Strategies:** The selected housing strategies are then implemented, which may involve construction, remediation, and other activities. This process requires careful planning and coordination to ensure that the strategies are implemented effectively and efficiently.

#### 19.2b.3 Case Studies of Housing Strategy Selection

To further illustrate the process of housing strategy selection, let's consider two case studies:

- **Case Study 1: Affordable Housing in a High-Cost Area:** In this case, the brownfield site is located in a high-cost area with a high demand for affordable housing. The site is relatively small and has moderate levels of contamination. The community has expressed a strong preference for affordable housing options. Based on these factors, the housing strategy selection process may involve the prioritization of affordable housing strategies, such as the construction of rental units or homeownership opportunities for low-income households.

- **Case Study 2: Sustainable Housing in a Low-Cost Area:** In this case, the brownfield site is located in a low-cost area with a preference for sustainable housing options. The site is larger and has high levels of contamination. The community has expressed a willingness to pay a premium for sustainable housing options. Based on these factors, the housing strategy selection process may involve the prioritization of sustainable housing strategies, such as the construction of energy-efficient homes or the use of renewable energy sources.

In both of these case studies, the selection of housing strategies is influenced by the specific characteristics of the brownfield site, the needs and preferences of the local community, and the availability of funding and resources. By carefully considering these factors, housing strategies can be selected that are both effective and sustainable, contributing to the overall success of the brownfield redevelopment process.





### Subsection: 19.2c Case Studies in Housing Strategies

In this section, we will explore some real-world case studies that illustrate the application of different housing strategies in brownfield redevelopment. These case studies will provide valuable insights into the practical aspects of housing strategy selection and implementation.

## Chapter: Chapter 20: Brownfield Redevelopment and Transportation

### Introduction

Brownfield redevelopment is a critical aspect of environmental management, particularly in urban areas where industrial or commercial activities have left behind sites that are underutilized due to real or perceived environmental contamination. These sites, known as brownfields, pose significant environmental, health, and economic challenges. However, they also present opportunities for revitalization and redevelopment. This chapter, "Brownfield Redevelopment and Transportation," delves into the intersection of brownfield redevelopment and transportation, exploring how transportation infrastructure and planning can facilitate the successful redevelopment of brownfields.

The chapter begins by providing a comprehensive overview of brownfield redevelopment, including its definition, types, and the environmental, health, and economic implications of brownfields. It then delves into the role of transportation in brownfield redevelopment, discussing how transportation infrastructure and planning can support the revitalization of brownfields. This includes the use of transportation as a tool for accessing brownfields, as well as the integration of brownfield redevelopment into broader transportation planning and policy.

The chapter also explores the challenges and opportunities associated with brownfield redevelopment and transportation. These include the potential for increased traffic and transportation demand, the need for transportation infrastructure upgrades, and the potential for brownfield redevelopment to contribute to sustainable transportation and urban development goals.

Finally, the chapter presents case studies of successful brownfield redevelopment projects that have integrated transportation considerations, providing practical examples and lessons learned for practitioners and researchers.

In essence, this chapter aims to equip readers with a comprehensive understanding of the role of transportation in brownfield redevelopment, and to provide practical guidance for integrating transportation considerations into brownfield redevelopment planning and practice.




### Subsection: 19.3a Role of Community Engagement in Housing

Community engagement plays a crucial role in the redevelopment of brownfield sites for housing. It is a process that involves the active participation of community members in decision-making processes and implementation of strategies. This engagement can take various forms, from public meetings and workshops to online platforms and social media.

#### 19.3a.1 Community Engagement in Mixed-Income Housing

Mixed-income housing developments, as discussed in the previous chapter, have been shown to have positive outcomes for residents and neighborhoods. However, these outcomes are often contingent on the active participation of community members, particularly those from lower-income backgrounds. Fraser & Nelson (2007) suggest that community empowerment and participation should accompany mixed-income housing developments to foster neighborhood relations, identify key assets and needs of the community, and maximize the “neighborhood effects” of the new development.

Community engagement can be fostered or inhibited by certain design elements. For instance, creating central, shared community spaces with interesting programming may provide opportunities for mingling and socialization among diverse residents. This can help to break down social barriers and foster a sense of community among residents.

#### 19.3a.2 Community Engagement in Poverty Alleviation

Community engagement is also crucial in the fight against poverty. As discussed in the previous chapter, economically diverse and integrated neighborhoods have been shown to support residents’ opportunities and life chances. However, more research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which this happens. Joseph (2013) begins to examine this in the case of Chicago, and further qualitative research could examine dynamics of neighbor.

Community engagement can play a key role in poverty alleviation. By involving lower-income residents in the process of relocation and providing them with infrastructure for participation, we can ensure that they have as much control over management, maintenance, and subsequent transformation as other residents. This is fundamental to The Right to the City, as suggested by Duke (2009).

In conclusion, community engagement is a critical component of brownfield redevelopment for housing. It not only ensures that the needs and preferences of community members are taken into account, but also fosters a sense of community and belonging among residents. It is a process that requires ongoing commitment and participation from all stakeholders, and is crucial for the success of any brownfield redevelopment project.




### Subsection: 19.3b Techniques for Engaging Community in Housing

Community engagement in housing is a multifaceted process that requires a variety of techniques to be effective. These techniques can be broadly categorized into two types: traditional and digital.

Traditional techniques for community engagement in housing include public meetings, workshops, and focus groups. These methods allow for direct interaction between community members and developers, planners, and policymakers. They provide a platform for community members to voice their concerns, needs, and aspirations, and for developers to gather valuable insights into the local context.

Public meetings, for instance, can be used to present development proposals, discuss potential impacts, and gather feedback. Workshops can be used to brainstorm solutions, test ideas, and build consensus. Focus groups can be used to delve deeper into specific issues or topics.

#### 19.3b.2 Digital Techniques for Community Engagement

Digital techniques for community engagement in housing have become increasingly popular in recent years. These techniques leverage digital platforms and tools to facilitate community engagement in a more accessible, efficient, and interactive manner.

Online platforms, such as community websites, social media, and online forums, can be used to disseminate information, gather feedback, and facilitate discussions. These platforms can be particularly useful for reaching a wider audience, including those who may not be able to attend traditional meetings or workshops.

Digital tools, such as GIS mapping, 3D modeling, and virtual reality, can be used to visualize development proposals, simulate potential impacts, and engage community members in a more immersive and interactive way.

#### 19.3b.3 Hybrid Approaches

Hybrid approaches that combine traditional and digital techniques can be particularly effective in engaging the community in housing. For instance, a public meeting could be followed up with an online discussion, or a workshop could be complemented with a 3D model of the proposed development.

In conclusion, community engagement in housing is a complex process that requires a variety of techniques. The choice of techniques should be guided by the specific context, needs, and preferences of the community.
