## Foreward

Welcome to "Architectural Design, Level II: New Orleans Studio Companion". This book is designed to be a comprehensive guide for advanced undergraduate students at MIT, providing them with the necessary tools and knowledge to excel in the field of architectural design.

The book is structured around the principles and methodologies of Bernhard Hoesli, a renowned architect and educator whose work has had a profound impact on the field. Hoesli's approach to architectural design, as outlined in his book "The Basic Design Course", serves as the foundation for this book.

Hoesli's curriculum overhaul began with the basic design course, where he emphasized the importance of understanding architectural ideas, their development, and treatment. This approach is reflected in the book, with each chapter delving into these aspects in detail. The book also includes several design exercises, similar to those in Hoesli's course, to provide students with practical experience and reinforce the theoretical concepts.

One of the key principles that underpins Hoesli's approach is the concept of space. He believed that architects create space, and this is reflected in the book's focus on spatial organization. The book includes exercises such as 'space within space', where students are asked to design a space that is "defined without indicating and above or below". This exercise, like many others in the book, is designed to encourage students to think creatively and critically about space.

Hoesli's emphasis on function over form is also reflected in the book. He believed that a surface or a defining of space was not necessarily a floor or a ceiling or a wall- those titles are added by people. This concept is explored in depth in the book, with students encouraged to separate function from design in their work.

In writing this book, we have endeavored to capture the essence of Hoesli's approach to architectural design, while also making it accessible and relevant to modern students. We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for students, helping them to develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the field of architectural design.

Thank you for choosing "Architectural Design, Level II: New Orleans Studio Companion". We hope you find it informative and enjoyable.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

#### 3.2c Sketching and Documentation

Sketching and documentation are essential skills for architects, and New Orleans provides a rich source of inspiration for these activities. The city's unique architectural styles, from the grandiose mansions of the French Quarter to the colorful shotgun houses of the Bywater, offer a wealth of subjects for sketching.

##### Sketching

Sketching is a quick and intuitive way to capture the essence of a building or a cityscape. It allows architects to explore their visual ideas and to understand the spatial relationships between different elements. Sketching in New Orleans can be a rewarding experience, as the city's architecture is often characterized by strong geometric forms and intricate details.

When sketching in New Orleans, we recommend using a sketchbook and a set of pencils. The sketchbook should be small enough to carry easily but large enough to accommodate your sketches. The pencils should include a range of hardness, from HB to 2B, to allow for precise drawing and shading.

##### Documentation

Documentation is the process of recording and organizing information about a building or a city. In the context of architectural design, documentation can serve several purposes, from recording design ideas to preparing construction drawings.

In New Orleans, documentation can be a complex task due to the city's rich architectural history. The city's buildings often exhibit a mix of different architectural styles, and their details can be intricate and varied. Therefore, we recommend using a combination of techniques for documentation, including photography, hand-drawn sketches, and digital models.

Photography is a quick and effective way to capture the visual aspects of a building. It allows for a detailed and accurate representation of the building's form and details. However, photography can be limited in its ability to convey the spatial relationships between different elements.

Hand-drawn sketches, on the other hand, can be used to explore these spatial relationships. They can also be used to record design ideas and to communicate these ideas to others.

Digital models, finally, can be used to document the building in a more comprehensive and detailed manner. They can include not only the building's form and details, but also its structural and spatial properties.

In conclusion, sketching and documentation are essential skills for architects, and New Orleans provides a rich source of inspiration for these activities. By combining these skills with a deep understanding of architectural design principles, architects can create innovative and meaningful designs that respond to the city's unique context.

#### 3.4c Cultural Influences on Architecture

The architecture of New Orleans is deeply influenced by its cultural heritage. The city's diverse cultural influences, including French, Spanish, African, and American traditions, are reflected in its architectural styles. These cultural influences have shaped the city's architectural landscape, creating a unique and vibrant architectural culture.

##### French Influence

The French influence on New Orleans architecture is evident in the city's earliest buildings, which were constructed in the late 18th century. The French Quarter, the oldest neighborhood in the city, is a testament to this influence. The grandiose mansions, ornate facades, and spacious interiors of the French Quarter are a direct reflection of the French colonial architecture. The French Quarter is also characterized by its grid-like street layout, which is a reflection of the French urban planning principles of the time.

The French influence is also evident in the city's architectural vocabulary. Terms such as "creole cottage" and "shotgun house" are derived from the French language. The creole cottage, a simple, one-story building with a pitched roof and a wide front porch, is a direct descendant of the French colonial architecture. The shotgun house, a narrow, one-story building with a series of small rooms arranged end-to-end, is also a reflection of the French colonial tradition.

##### Spanish Influence

The Spanish influence on New Orleans architecture is evident in the city's later buildings, which were constructed in the early 19th century. The Spanish colonial architecture is characterized by its simple, functional design and use of local materials. This influence is particularly evident in the city's shotgun houses, which are a direct descendant of the Spanish colonial architecture.

The Spanish influence is also evident in the city's urban planning. The Spanish colonial authorities encouraged the development of a dense, compact city, with narrow, winding streets and small, irregular blocks. This layout is a reflection of the Spanish urban planning principles of the time, which emphasized functionality and practicality over grandeur and symmetry.

##### African Influence

The African influence on New Orleans architecture is evident in the city's vernacular architecture, particularly in the design of the shotgun house. The shotgun house, with its narrow, one-story design and series of small rooms arranged end-to-end, is a direct reflection of the African hut. The wide front porch of the creole cottage, a common feature in African vernacular architecture, is also a nod to the African influence.

The African influence is also evident in the city's cultural practices. The Mardi Gras, for example, is a cultural tradition that originated from the African slaves brought to the city during the colonial era. The Mardi Gras Indians, a group of African Americans who celebrate Mardi Gras in a unique way, are a symbol of the African influence on New Orleans architecture and culture.

In conclusion, the architecture of New Orleans is deeply influenced by its cultural heritage. The city's diverse cultural influences have shaped its architectural landscape, creating a unique and vibrant architectural culture. The city's architectural symbols, such as the French Quarter, the shotgun house, and the Mardi Gras Indians, are a testament to this cultural influence.

Throughout this chapter, we will also highlight real-world examples of resilient design in New Orleans, showcasing the innovative and creative solutions that have been implemented to address the city's unique challenges.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the importance of resilience in architectural design, and how it can be applied in the context of New Orleans. So let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of resilient design in the Crescent City.




### Section: 6.1 Understanding Resilience in Architecture:

Resilience in architecture is a crucial aspect of designing buildings and structures that can withstand and recover from unexpected events or disasters. In the context of New Orleans, where the city has faced numerous natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods, resilience is a key factor in ensuring the safety and functionality of the built environment.

#### 6.1a Defining Resilience in Architecture

Resilience in architecture can be defined as the ability of a building or structure to withstand and recover from unexpected events or disasters. This includes the ability to withstand natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes, as well as man-made disasters such as fires and explosions. Resilience also refers to the ability of a building to adapt and function effectively in the face of changing conditions, such as climate change or technological advancements.

The concept of resilience in architecture is closely tied to the principles of sustainability and adaptability. Sustainability refers to the ability of a building to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Adaptability, on the other hand, refers to the ability of a building to change and evolve over time to meet changing needs and conditions.

To achieve resilience in architecture, it is important to consider the four properties of resilience identified by the MCEER (Multi-Hazard Earthquake Engineering research center): robustness, resourcefulness, redundancy, and rapidity. These properties help to define the functionality of a system in relation to hazard mitigation.

Robustness refers to the ability of a building to withstand and resist damage from external forces. This can be achieved through the use of strong and durable materials, as well as structural design that can withstand high winds and water pressure.

Resourcefulness refers to the ability of a building to adapt and utilize available resources in the face of a disaster. This can include having backup systems in place, such as generators or alternative power sources, as well as incorporating sustainable design features that allow for self-sufficiency in the event of a disaster.

Redundancy refers to the presence of backup systems or alternative solutions in case of failure. This can include having multiple exit points in a building, or incorporating alternative power sources in case of a power outage.

Rapidity refers to the ability of a building to respond quickly and effectively to a disaster. This can include having emergency response plans in place, as well as incorporating features such as rapid deployment systems for emergency equipment.

In addition to these four properties, it is also important to consider the concept of social-ecological resilience, also known as adaptive resilience. This approach shifts the focus to combining the social, ecological, and technical domains of resilience. The adaptive model recognizes the transformable quality of the stable state of a system, and emphasizes the importance of adaptability and flexibility in the face of changing conditions.

In the context of New Orleans, it is crucial to consider the unique challenges and risks faced by the city. The 6R model proposed by Laboy and Fannon adds two additional properties to the MCEER four properties: Recovery and Risk Avoidance. Recovery refers to the ability of a building to bounce back and adapt after a disaster, while Risk Avoidance focuses on preventing or minimizing the impact of a disaster through careful planning and design.

In the planning phase of a building, it is important to consider site selection, building placement, and site conditions to avoid potential risks. This can include choosing a location that is not prone to flooding or building in a way that minimizes vulnerability to natural disasters.

In the operation phase of a building, it is crucial to have a recovery plan in place in case of a disaster. This can include having emergency response plans, as well as incorporating features such as rapid deployment systems for emergency equipment.

Disturbances should not be seen as the end of resilience, but rather as a learning opportunity to assess mistakes and outcomes, and reconfigure for future needs. By incorporating the principles of resilience and adaptability into the design process, we can create buildings and structures that are better equipped to withstand and recover from unexpected events, ultimately making our communities more resilient.

#### Structural resilience

In most developed nations, all new developments are assessed for flood risks. The aim is to ensure flood risk is taken into account in all stages of the planning process to avoid inappropriate development in areas of high risk. When development is required in areas of high risk, structures should be built to flood-resistant standards and living or working areas should be raised well above the worst-case scenario flood levels. For existing structures in high-risk areas, funding should be allocated to i.e. raise the electrical wiring/sockets so any water that enters the home can not reach the electrics. Other solutions are to raise these structures to appropriate heights or make them floating or considerations should be made to relocate or rebuild structures on higher ground. A house in Mexico Beach, Florida which survived Hurricane Michael is an example of a house built to survive tidal surge.

The pre-Incan Uru people of Lake Titicaca in Peru have lived on floating islands made of reeds for hundreds of years. The practice began as an innovative form of protection from competition for land by various groups, and it continues to support the Uru homeland. The manual technique is used to build homes resting on hand-made islands all from simple reeds from the totora plant. Similarly, in the southern wetlands of Iraq, the Marsh Arabs (Arab al-Ahwār) have lived for centuries on floating islands and in arched buildings all constructed exclusively from the local qasab reeds. Without any nails, wood, or glass, buildings are assembled by hand as quickly as within a day. Another aspect of these villages, called Al Tahla, is that the built homes can also be disassembled in a day, transported, and reassembled .

#### Emergency response

As with any disaster, the response to a disaster in New Orleans must be swift and effective. The city has a well-established emergency management system, but it is important to also consider the resilience of the city's infrastructure and buildings in the event of a disaster. This includes having emergency plans in place for power outages, water supply disruptions, and communication breakdowns. It is also crucial to have a system in place for quickly assessing and repairing damage to buildings and infrastructure.

In addition to these practical measures, it is important to also consider the psychological resilience of the community. This includes providing support and resources for those affected by a disaster, as well as promoting a sense of community and belonging. The city of New Orleans has a strong sense of community and a rich cultural heritage, which can serve as a source of resilience in the face of a disaster.

Overall, designing for resilience in New Orleans requires a holistic approach that considers not only the physical aspects of the city, but also the social and psychological factors that contribute to the city's resilience. By incorporating these elements into the design process, we can create a more resilient and sustainable city that is better equipped to withstand and recover from future disasters.
