#### 3.2a Framework for Action

The West Philadelphia Landscape Project is a complex initiative that requires a comprehensive framework for action. This framework is designed to guide the project team in their efforts to create a digital twin of the West Philadelphia landscape and implement other aspects of the project.

The framework for action is based on the MODAF (Modular Data Model for Architecture Framework) developed by the United States Department of Defense. MODAF provides a set of templates, or "Views," that are used to capture information about a business in order to identify ways to improve the business. Each View offers a different perspective on the business, presented in a format that aids understanding of how the business operates.

The Views are grouped into seven Viewpoints, each of which supports different stakeholder interests. These Viewpoints are:

1. Business Viewpoint: This Viewpoint provides an overview of the business and its goals.
2. Capability Viewpoint: This Viewpoint focuses on the capabilities of the business.
3. Information Viewpoint: This Viewpoint deals with the information used by the business.
4. Process Viewpoint: This Viewpoint looks at the processes used by the business.
5. Organization Viewpoint: This Viewpoint focuses on the organization of the business.
6. Resource Viewpoint: This Viewpoint deals with the resources used by the business.
7. Service Viewpoint: This Viewpoint looks at the services provided by the business.

The relationship between the data in the MODAF Views is defined in the MODAF Meta Model, known as the M3. The M3 provides a logical structure for the storage of the data in a database and subsequently provides the necessary coherence for the data to be shared with other MODAF architectures.

The functionality of the framework is primarily used in acquisition domains, programmes and delivery teams to support the delivery of military capability. It is also used by other government departments and agencies, such as GCHQ, and external bodies such as the National Air Traffic Services (NATS). MODAF is used by the Swedish Armed Forces to support the development of military capability, and it has been adapted by NATO to form the core of the NATO Architecture Framework (NAF).

The framework for action in the West Philadelphia Landscape Project is adapted from the MODAF framework. It provides a structured approach to managing the project, ensuring that all aspects of the project are considered and integrated into the overall plan. The framework is flexible and can be adapted to meet the specific needs and goals of the project.
