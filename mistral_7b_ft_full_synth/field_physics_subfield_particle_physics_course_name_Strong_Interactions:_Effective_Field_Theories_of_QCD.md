# Effective Field Theories of QCD: A Comprehensive Guide

## Foreward

Welcome to "Effective Field Theories of QCD: A Comprehensive Guide". This book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effective field theories of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), a fundamental theory of particle physics.

The study of effective field theories is crucial in the field of particle physics, particularly in the context of QCD. It allows us to understand the behavior of particles at different energy scales, providing a bridge between the microscopic world of fundamental particles and the macroscopic world of everyday objects.

In this book, we will delve into the intricacies of effective field theories, exploring their mathematical foundations, applications, and limitations. We will begin by introducing the concept of effective field theories, discussing their role in QCD and how they are used to describe the behavior of particles at different energy scales.

We will then move on to discuss the similarity renormalization group procedure, a powerful computational tool used in the study of effective field theories. This procedure, first introduced by Wilson et al. and later developed into the renormalization group procedure for effective particles (RGPEP), provides a systematic way to transform bare quanta into effective quanta, allowing us to study the behavior of particles at different energy scales.

The book will also cover the concept of effective particles, which result from a dynamical transformation akin to the Melosh transformation from current to constituent quarks. These particles are introduced through a transformation, where <math>\psi_s</math> is a quantum field operator built from creation and annihilation operators for effective particles of size <math>s \sim 1/\lambda</math>, and <math>\psi_0</math> is the original quantum field operator built from creation and annihilation operators for point-like bare quanta of a canonical theory.

Finally, we will explore the applications of effective field theories in various physical systems, using a weak-coupling expansion. We will also discuss the recent developments in the field, such as the renormalization group procedure for effective particles, which is now defined without a need to refer to some perturbative expansion.

This book is intended for advanced undergraduate students at MIT, but it will also be a valuable resource for graduate students and researchers in the field of particle physics. It is our hope that this book will serve as a comprehensive guide to the fascinating world of effective field theories in QCD.

Thank you for joining us on this journey. Let's delve into the world of effective field theories and explore the fundamental nature of matter and energy.

## Chapter 1: Standard Model Review:

### Introduction

The Standard Model of particle physics is the current theoretical framework that describes the fundamental particles and their interactions. It is a quantum mechanical theory that has been extensively tested and is considered one of the most successful theories in physics. The Standard Model is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, special relativity, and gauge symmetry. It describes the behavior of particles at the subatomic level, including the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces.

In this chapter, we will provide a comprehensive review of the Standard Model, starting with an overview of its history and development. We will then delve into the fundamental principles of the Standard Model, including the concept of gauge symmetry and the role of the Higgs boson. We will also discuss the three generations of quarks and leptons, as well as the fundamental interactions between them.

Next, we will explore the mathematical framework of the Standard Model, including the use of Dirac equations and the concept of spin. We will also discuss the concept of renormalization and how it is used to handle the infinities that arise in quantum field theory.

Finally, we will discuss the experimental evidence for the Standard Model, including the discovery of the Higgs boson and the precise measurements of particle properties. We will also touch upon the current challenges and open questions in the Standard Model, such as the existence of dark matter and the origin of matter-antimatter asymmetry.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of the Standard Model and its role in modern particle physics. This will serve as a foundation for the rest of the book, where we will explore the concept of effective field theories and their applications in QCD.

### Section 1.1 CKM Matrix:

The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix is a fundamental concept in the Standard Model of particle physics. It describes the interactions between quarks, which are the building blocks of matter. The CKM matrix is named after its discoverers, Nicola Cabibbo, Kōichi Kobayashi, and Makoto Maskawa.

#### 1.1a Introduction to CKM Matrix

The CKM matrix is a 3x3 matrix that relates the quark fields of the three generations. It is a unitary matrix, meaning that its inverse is equal to its transpose. This property ensures the conservation of probability in the quark sector. The CKM matrix is also Hermitian, meaning that it is equal to its own conjugate transpose. This property ensures the conservation of charge in the quark sector.

The CKM matrix is defined by four independent parameters, which are typically chosen to be the three angles `θ`<sub|1>, `θ`<sub|2>, `θ`<sub|3> and the CP-violating phase `δ`. These parameters are related to the couplings between quark generations and vanish if `δ` = 0. The angles `θ`<sub|k> are denoted `c`<sub|k> and `s`<sub|k>, respectively, where `c`<sub|k> = cos(`θ`<sub|k>) and `s`<sub|k> = sin(`θ`<sub|k>).

The CKM matrix has been extensively studied and measured, and its values as of 2008 are known to high precision. The values of the CKM matrix are crucial for understanding the behavior of quarks and their interactions with other particles. They also play a crucial role in the study of CP violation, which is a fundamental aspect of the Standard Model.

In the next section, we will explore the different parameterizations of the CKM matrix and their applications in the Standard Model. We will also discuss the Wolfenstein parameterization, which is a commonly used approximation to the standard parameterization.

This is described by the CKM matrix, which relates the quark fields of the three generations. The CKM matrix is a unitary matrix, meaning that its inverse is equal to its transpose. This property ensures the conservation of probability in the quark sector.

The CKM matrix is also responsible for the phenomenon of quark decay, which is the process by which a quark decays into another type of quark. This is described by the CKM matrix, which relates the quark fields of the three generations. The CKM matrix is a Hermitian matrix, meaning that it is equal to its own conjugate transpose. This property ensures the conservation of charge in the quark sector.

### Section 1.1c CP Violation

CP violation is a fundamental aspect of the Standard Model of particle physics. It refers to the phenomenon where the laws of physics are not the same for particles and antiparticles. This violation of symmetry is a key aspect of the Standard Model and is responsible for many of the observed properties of the universe.

#### 1.1c.1 CP Violation in the CKM Matrix

The CKM matrix plays a crucial role in CP violation. The complex nature of the CKM matrix allows for the possibility of CP violation. The CP-violating phase `δ` is a key parameter of the CKM matrix, and its non-zero value is a direct indication of CP violation.

The CKM matrix is also responsible for the phenomenon of quark oscillations. As mentioned in the previous section, the probability of observing a quark of a certain type can change over time due to the mixing of quark states. This mixing is described by the CKM matrix, and it is this mixing that leads to CP violation.

#### 1.1c.2 CP Violation in Neutral Particle Oscillations

CP violation can also be observed in the oscillations of neutral particles. This phenomenon is a direct consequence of the mixing of particle and antiparticle states, as described by the CKM matrix.

Consider the processes where the states `|P>` and `|P>` decay to final states `|f>` and `|f>`, where the barred and unbarred kets of each set are CP conjugates of one another. The probability of `|P>` decaying to `|f>` is given by,

$$
P(P \rightarrow f) = |A(P \rightarrow f)|^2
$$

and that of its CP conjugate process by,

$$
P(\bar{P} \rightarrow \bar{f}) = |A(\bar{P} \rightarrow \bar{f})|^2
$$

If there is no CP violation due to mixing, then `|A(P \rightarrow f)| = |A(\bar{P} \rightarrow \bar{f})|`. However, if there is CP violation, these probabilities are unequal, leading to a violation of CP symmetry.

#### 1.1c.3 CP Violation in Particle-Antiparticle Oscillations

CP violation can also be observed in the oscillations of particle-antiparticle states. The probability of observing a particle-antiparticle state at a given time is given by,

$$
P(P \rightarrow \bar{P}) = |A(P \rightarrow \bar{P})|^2
$$

If there is no CP violation, this probability is equal to the probability of observing an antiparticle-particle state at the same time. However, if there is CP violation, these probabilities are unequal, leading to a violation of CP symmetry.

In conclusion, CP violation is a fundamental aspect of the Standard Model of particle physics. It is a direct consequence of the complex nature of the CKM matrix and the mixing of particle and antiparticle states. The study of CP violation is crucial for understanding the fundamental laws of physics and the behavior of particles in the universe.




### Section 1.2 SM as an EFT:

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a quantum field theory that describes three of the four known fundamental forces (electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions) and classifies all known elementary particles. It is a cornerstone of modern particle physics and has been extensively tested and validated by experimental data. However, the SM is not a complete theory of fundamental interactions. It does not fully explain phenomena such as baryon asymmetry, the accelerating expansion of the universe, or the properties of dark matter.

#### 1.2a Introduction to the Standard Model

The Standard Model is a quantum field theory that describes the fundamental particles and their interactions. It is organized into two main categories: fermions, which are the matter particles, and bosons, which are the force-carrying particles. The SM also introduces the concept of gauge symmetry, which is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics that describes how particles interact with each other.

The SM is based on the following principles:

1. Local gauge symmetry: This principle states that the laws of physics are the same at all points in space and time. This leads to the concept of gauge symmetry, which is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics that describes how particles interact with each other.
2. Renormalizability: This principle states that the theory should be able to be used to make predictions at all energy scales. This is achieved by introducing a cutoff in the theory, which limits the energy scale at which the theory is valid.
3. Minimal particle content: The SM is a minimal theory, meaning that it only includes the necessary particles and interactions to describe the fundamental particles and their interactions. This is in contrast to other theories that introduce additional particles and interactions to explain phenomena that the SM cannot.

The SM is a powerful theory that has been extensively tested and validated by experimental data. However, it is not a complete theory of fundamental interactions. It does not fully explain phenomena such as baryon asymmetry, the accelerating expansion of the universe, or the properties of dark matter. These are some of the reasons why the SM is often used as an effective field theory (EFT).

#### 1.2b The Standard Model as an Effective Field Theory

An effective field theory (EFT) is a theory that describes the behavior of a system at a certain energy scale. It is a low-energy approximation of a more fundamental theory, which is often unknown or too complex to be directly studied. The EFT is valid at energies below a certain cutoff, and it is used to make predictions about the behavior of the system at these energies.

The SM is often used as an EFT because it is a well-established theory that has been extensively tested and validated by experimental data. It is also a renormalizable theory, meaning that it can be used to make predictions at all energy scales. This makes it a useful tool for studying phenomena at energies below the cutoff of the SM.

The SM as an EFT is particularly useful for studying phenomena such as baryon asymmetry, the accelerating expansion of the universe, and the properties of dark matter. These phenomena are not fully explained by the SM, but they can be studied using the SM as an EFT. This allows us to make predictions about these phenomena and test these predictions against experimental data.

In the next section, we will explore some specific examples of how the SM is used as an EFT to study these phenomena.

#### 1.2b SM as an EFT: The Higgs Mechanism

The Higgs mechanism is a key component of the Standard Model that explains the origin of particle masses. It is a direct consequence of the symmetry breaking that occurs in the SM. The Higgs mechanism is often used as an effective field theory to study the behavior of particles at energies below the electroweak scale.

The Higgs mechanism is based on the following principles:

1. Spontaneous symmetry breaking: This principle states that the laws of physics can change at different points in space and time. This leads to the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking, which is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics that describes how particles interact with each other.
2. Higgs field: The Higgs field is a scalar field that permeates all of space and time. It is responsible for the symmetry breaking that occurs in the SM.
3. Higgs boson: The Higgs boson is a particle that is associated with the Higgs field. It is responsible for the mass of other particles in the SM.

The Higgs mechanism is a powerful tool for studying the behavior of particles at energies below the electroweak scale. It allows us to make predictions about the behavior of particles and test these predictions against experimental data. However, it is not a complete theory of fundamental interactions. It does not fully explain phenomena such as baryon asymmetry, the accelerating expansion of the universe, or the properties of dark matter. These are some of the reasons why the Higgs mechanism is often used as an effective field theory.

#### 1.2c SM as an EFT: Beyond the Standard Model

The Standard Model (SM) has been remarkably successful in describing the fundamental particles and their interactions. However, it is not a complete theory of fundamental interactions. It does not fully explain phenomena such as baryon asymmetry, the accelerating expansion of the universe, or the properties of dark matter. These are some of the reasons why the SM is often used as an effective field theory (EFT) to study phenomena beyond its scope.

The SM as an EFT allows us to make predictions about the behavior of particles and test these predictions against experimental data. This approach has been particularly successful in the study of phenomena at energies below the electroweak scale. For example, the Higgs mechanism, a key component of the SM, is often used as an EFT to study the behavior of particles at these energies.

However, the SM as an EFT is not without its limitations. It is only valid at energies below the electroweak scale. At higher energies, the SM is expected to be replaced by a more fundamental theory, such as string theory or a theory of quantum gravity. The SM as an EFT also cannot explain the origin of the Higgs boson, the particle associated with the Higgs field. This is a major open question in particle physics.

Despite these limitations, the SM as an EFT remains a powerful tool for studying phenomena beyond its scope. It allows us to make predictions about the behavior of particles and test these predictions against experimental data. This approach has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the fundamental particles and their interactions.

In the next section, we will explore some of the key extensions of the SM that are being studied using the EFT approach. These include models that introduce additional particles, such as supersymmetry, and models that modify the SM at energies below the electroweak scale, such as little Higgs models. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with these extensions of the SM.




### Section 1.2b Effective Field Theories

Effective Field Theories (EFTs) are a powerful tool in the study of quantum field theories, particularly in the context of the Standard Model. They allow us to systematically expand the theory around a certain energy scale, and then use this expansion to make predictions about the behavior of the theory at higher energy scales. This is particularly useful in the context of the Standard Model, where we are interested in understanding the behavior of the theory at high energy scales, such as those found in particle collisions.

#### 1.2b.1 The Standard Model as an Effective Field Theory

The Standard Model can be viewed as an effective field theory, with the energy scale at which it is valid being the electroweak scale, around $10^{16}$ GeV. Above this scale, the theory is no longer valid, and a more complete theory, such as a theory of quantum gravity, is needed. However, at lower energy scales, the Standard Model is a powerful and accurate theory.

The Standard Model is an effective field theory because it is a local theory, meaning that it describes the interactions of particles at a single point in space and time. This is in contrast to non-local theories, which describe the interactions of particles over a region of space and time. The locality of the Standard Model is a consequence of the principle of local gauge symmetry, which states that the laws of physics are the same at all points in space and time.

#### 1.2b.2 Renormalizability and the Standard Model

The Standard Model is a renormalizable theory, meaning that it can be used to make predictions at all energy scales. This is achieved by introducing a cutoff in the theory, which limits the energy scale at which the theory is valid. The cutoff is typically chosen to be much higher than the energy scale at which the theory is used, ensuring that the theory is valid at lower energy scales.

The renormalizability of the Standard Model is a crucial feature of the theory. It allows us to make predictions about the behavior of the theory at high energy scales, where the theory is no longer valid. This is particularly important in the context of particle collisions, where the energy scales can be very high.

#### 1.2b.3 Minimal Particle Content and the Standard Model

The Standard Model is a minimal theory, meaning that it only includes the necessary particles and interactions to describe the fundamental particles and their interactions. This is in contrast to other theories that introduce additional particles and interactions to explain phenomena that the Standard Model cannot.

The minimal particle content of the Standard Model is a consequence of the principle of economy, which states that the theory should be as simple as possible, but no simpler. This principle is a reflection of Occam's razor, which states that, given two theories that make the same predictions, the simpler theory is preferred.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of effective field theories in more detail, and discuss how they can be used to study the Standard Model and other quantum field theories.




### Section 1.2c Power Counting in EFT

Power counting is a crucial aspect of effective field theories, particularly in the context of the Standard Model. It allows us to systematically expand the theory around a certain energy scale, and then use this expansion to make predictions about the behavior of the theory at higher energy scales. This is particularly useful in the context of the Standard Model, where we are interested in understanding the behavior of the theory at high energy scales, such as those found in particle collisions.

#### 1.2c.1 The Standard Model as an Effective Field Theory

The Standard Model can be viewed as an effective field theory, with the energy scale at which it is valid being the electroweak scale, around $10^{16}$ GeV. Above this scale, the theory is no longer valid, and a more complete theory, such as a theory of quantum gravity, is needed. However, at lower energy scales, the Standard Model is a powerful and accurate theory.

The Standard Model is an effective field theory because it is a local theory, meaning that it describes the interactions of particles at a single point in space and time. This is in contrast to non-local theories, which describe the interactions of particles over a region of space and time. The locality of the Standard Model is a consequence of the principle of local gauge symmetry, which states that the laws of physics are the same at all points in space and time.

#### 1.2c.2 Renormalizability and the Standard Model

The Standard Model is a renormalizable theory, meaning that it can be used to make predictions at all energy scales. This is achieved by introducing a cutoff in the theory, which limits the energy scale at which the theory is valid. The cutoff is typically chosen to be much higher than the energy scale at which the theory is used, ensuring that the theory is valid at lower energy scales.

The renormalizability of the Standard Model is a crucial feature of the theory, as it allows us to make predictions about the behavior of the theory at high energy scales. This is achieved through a process known as power counting, which involves systematically expanding the theory around the cutoff energy scale and then using this expansion to make predictions about the behavior of the theory at higher energy scales.

#### 1.2c.3 Power Counting in the Standard Model

Power counting in the Standard Model involves systematically expanding the theory around the cutoff energy scale, and then using this expansion to make predictions about the behavior of the theory at higher energy scales. This is achieved by assigning a power to each term in the theory, based on its dependence on the cutoff energy scale.

For example, consider the term $g^2 \phi^4$, where $g$ is the coupling constant and $\phi$ is a scalar field. This term has a power of $2$ because it is proportional to $g^2$, and $g$ has a power of $1$ because it is not dependent on the cutoff energy scale. Similarly, the term $\phi^4$ has a power of $4$ because it is proportional to $\phi^4$, and $\phi$ has a power of $2$ because it is not dependent on the cutoff energy scale.

By assigning powers to each term in the theory, we can systematically expand the theory around the cutoff energy scale, and then use this expansion to make predictions about the behavior of the theory at higher energy scales. This is a powerful tool in the study of the Standard Model, as it allows us to understand the behavior of the theory at high energy scales, where the theory is no longer valid.




### Section 1.3 Relevant and Irrelevant Operators

In the context of effective field theories, operators play a crucial role in describing the dynamics of the system. These operators are mathematical objects that represent physical quantities, such as fields, currents, and interactions. They are defined as functions of the fields and their derivatives, and their coefficients are determined by the underlying theory.

#### 1.3a Classification of Operators

Operators can be broadly classified into two categories: relevant and irrelevant operators. This classification is based on the power counting rules of the theory, which determine the behavior of the operators at different energy scales.

##### Relevant Operators

Relevant operators are those whose coefficients increase with the energy scale. This means that their contribution to the theory becomes more important as the energy scale increases. In the context of the Standard Model, relevant operators are typically associated with the strong interaction, which becomes stronger at higher energy scales.

##### Irrelevant Operators

Irrelevant operators, on the other hand, have coefficients that decrease with the energy scale. This means that their contribution to the theory becomes less important as the energy scale increases. In the Standard Model, irrelevant operators are typically associated with the electroweak interaction, which becomes weaker at higher energy scales.

The classification of operators as relevant or irrelevant is crucial in effective field theories. It allows us to systematically expand the theory around a certain energy scale, and then use this expansion to make predictions about the behavior of the theory at higher energy scales. This is particularly useful in the context of the Standard Model, where we are interested in understanding the behavior of the theory at high energy scales, such as those found in particle collisions.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of power counting and its application in the classification of operators.

#### 1.3b Relevant Operators in EFT

In the context of effective field theories, relevant operators play a crucial role in describing the dynamics of the system. They are particularly important in the Standard Model, where they are associated with the strong interaction, which becomes stronger at higher energy scales.

##### Relevant Operators in the Standard Model

The Standard Model is a renormalizable theory, meaning that it can be used to make predictions at all energy scales. This is achieved by introducing a cutoff in the theory, which limits the energy scale at which the theory is valid. The cutoff is typically chosen to be much higher than the energy scale at which the theory is used, ensuring that the theory is valid at lower energy scales.

The relevant operators in the Standard Model are those whose coefficients increase with the energy scale. This means that their contribution to the theory becomes more important as the energy scale increases. In the context of the Standard Model, these operators are typically associated with the strong interaction, which becomes stronger at higher energy scales.

The classification of operators as relevant or irrelevant is crucial in effective field theories. It allows us to systematically expand the theory around a certain energy scale, and then use this expansion to make predictions about the behavior of the theory at higher energy scales. This is particularly useful in the context of the Standard Model, where we are interested in understanding the behavior of the theory at high energy scales, such as those found in particle collisions.

The power counting rules of the theory determine the behavior of the operators at different energy scales. These rules are based on the dimensionality of the operators, which is determined by the number of fields and derivatives they contain. The power counting rules can be used to determine whether an operator is relevant or irrelevant.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of power counting and its application in the classification of operators.

#### 1.3c Irrelevant Operators in EFT

In the context of effective field theories, irrelevant operators are those whose coefficients decrease with the energy scale. This means that their contribution to the theory becomes less important as the energy scale increases. In the Standard Model, these operators are typically associated with the electroweak interaction, which becomes weaker at higher energy scales.

##### Irrelevant Operators in the Standard Model

The Standard Model is a renormalizable theory, meaning that it can be used to make predictions at all energy scales. This is achieved by introducing a cutoff in the theory, which limits the energy scale at which the theory is valid. The cutoff is typically chosen to be much higher than the energy scale at which the theory is used, ensuring that the theory is valid at lower energy scales.

The power counting rules can be used to determine whether an operator is relevant or irrelevant.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of power counting and its application in the classification of operators.




### Section 1.3b Renormalization and Anomalies

In the previous section, we discussed the classification of operators into relevant and irrelevant operators. This classification is crucial in effective field theories, as it allows us to systematically expand the theory around a certain energy scale. However, in the context of quantum field theories, such as the Standard Model, we encounter phenomena such as renormalization and anomalies that complicate this classification.

#### 1.3b Renormalization

Renormalization is a mathematical technique used to remove the dependence of a theory on the scale at which it is measured. In the context of quantum field theories, this is necessary because the theory is typically defined at a certain energy scale, and the behavior of the theory at other scales cannot be directly predicted from this definition.

The renormalization process involves the introduction of a cutoff, which is a parameter that limits the range of energies at which the theory is valid. The theory is then expanded around this cutoff, and the coefficients of the operators are determined at this scale. These coefficients are then used to calculate the behavior of the theory at other scales, by systematically removing the cutoff.

The renormalization process can be mathematically represented as follows:

$$
\mathcal{L}(\mu) = \mathcal{L}_0(\mu) + \sum_i \frac{1}{\epsilon_i} \mathcal{O}_i(\mu)
$$

where $\mathcal{L}(\mu)$ is the Lagrangian of the theory at scale $\mu$, $\mathcal{L}_0(\mu)$ is the bare Lagrangian, $\mathcal{O}_i(\mu)$ are the operators, and $\epsilon_i$ are the anomalous dimensions of these operators.

#### 1.3b Anomalies

Anomalies are another important concept in quantum field theories. They are mathematical inconsistencies that arise when certain symmetries are broken. In the context of the Standard Model, anomalies can arise due to the breaking of symmetries such as baryon number and lepton number.

Anomalies can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
\partial_\mu J^\mu = \frac{1}{16\pi^2} \sum_i \alpha_i \mathcal{O}_i
$$

where $J^\mu$ is the current associated with the symmetry, $\alpha_i$ are the anomaly coefficients, and $\mathcal{O}_i$ are the operators.

The presence of anomalies can significantly affect the behavior of a theory, and their proper treatment is crucial in the renormalization process.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of anomalies and discuss their implications for the Standard Model.




### Subsection 1.3c Operator Mixing

Operator mixing is a phenomenon that occurs in quantum field theories, such as the Standard Model, where certain operators can mix with each other under renormalization. This mixing can lead to the appearance of new operators that were not present in the original theory.

The operator mixing can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
\mathcal{O}_i(\mu) = \sum_j \mathcal{O}_j(\mu) C_{ij}(\mu)
$$

where $\mathcal{O}_i(\mu)$ and $\mathcal{O}_j(\mu)$ are the operators, and $C_{ij}(\mu)$ are the mixing coefficients. These coefficients are determined by the renormalization process.

Operator mixing can have significant implications for the behavior of the theory at different scales. For example, it can lead to the appearance of new operators that were not present in the original theory, which can affect the predictions of the theory. It can also lead to the modification of the coefficients of the operators, which can affect the behavior of the theory at different scales.

In the context of the Standard Model, operator mixing can occur due to the breaking of symmetries, such as baryon number and lepton number. This can lead to the appearance of new operators, such as the baryon number violating operators, which were not present in the original theory.

In the next section, we will discuss the implications of operator mixing for the Standard Model and its extensions.

## Chapter: Effective Field Theories of QCD

### Introduction

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong nuclear force, which binds quarks and gluons together to form the fundamental building blocks of matter. It is a theory that has been extensively tested and is considered one of the most successful theories in physics. However, the complexity of QCD makes it challenging to study and understand at all energy scales. This is where effective field theories (EFTs) come into play.

In this chapter, we will delve into the realm of effective field theories of QCD. We will explore how these theories provide a powerful tool for studying QCD at different energy scales. EFTs allow us to systematically expand the theory around a certain energy scale, keeping only the terms that are relevant at that scale. This simplification allows us to make predictions and calculations that would be otherwise intractable in the full theory.

We will begin by introducing the concept of effective field theories and their role in quantum field theories. We will then move on to discuss the specifics of effective field theories of QCD, including the relevant and irrelevant operators, the renormalization group, and the matching conditions. We will also explore some of the applications of these theories in various areas of particle physics and condensed matter physics.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive guide to effective field theories of QCD, equipping readers with the necessary tools and knowledge to understand and apply these theories in their own research. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or simply a curious reader, we hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource in your journey to understand the fascinating world of quantum chromodynamics.




### Subsection 1.4a Field Transformations

In quantum field theory, field transformations play a crucial role in the redefinition of fields. These transformations are used to change the basis of the field space, and they can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
\phi(x) = \mathcal{U}(x)\phi'(x)
$$

where $\phi(x)$ and $\phi'(x)$ are the fields in the original and transformed basis, respectively, and $\mathcal{U}(x)$ is the unitary transformation matrix.

Field transformations can be used to diagonalize the mass matrix of the fields, which can simplify the analysis of the theory. For example, in the Standard Model, the mass matrix of the quarks can be diagonalized by a suitable field transformation, leading to the appearance of the mass eigenstates.

In the context of effective field theories, field transformations can be used to redefine the fields at different energy scales. This can be particularly useful when dealing with non-renormalizable theories, where the fields need to be redefined at higher energy scales to avoid the appearance of new operators.

Field transformations can also be used to implement symmetry transformations. For example, in the Standard Model, the symmetry transformations of the gauge group can be implemented as field transformations. This allows us to express the symmetry transformations in terms of the fields, which can be useful in the analysis of the theory.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of field redefinitions in more detail, and we will explore their implications for the Standard Model and other quantum field theories.




### Subsection 1.4b Canonical Quantization

Canonical quantization is a method used in quantum mechanics to quantize a classical system. It is based on the classical Hamiltonian formalism and is particularly useful in quantum field theory. In this subsection, we will discuss the basics of canonical quantization and its application in quantum field theory.

#### 1.4b.1 Classical Hamiltonian Formalism

The classical Hamiltonian formalism is a reformulation of classical mechanics that is based on the Hamiltonian function, which is defined as:

$$
H(q_i, p_i, t) = \sum_i \frac{p_i}{m_i} - V(q_i, t)
$$

where $q_i$ and $p_i$ are the generalized coordinates and momenta of the system, $m_i$ is the mass of the $i$-th particle, and $V(q_i, t)$ is the potential energy of the system. The Hamiltonian function is used to derive the equations of motion for the system.

#### 1.4b.2 Quantum Hamiltonian Formalism

In quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian function is replaced by the Hamiltonian operator, which is defined as:

$$
\hat{H} = \sum_i \frac{\hat{p}_i}{m_i} - \hat{V}(t)
$$

where $\hat{p}_i$ and $\hat{V}(t)$ are the quantum mechanical momentum and potential energy operators, respectively. The Hamiltonian operator is used to derive the Schrödinger equation for the system.

#### 1.4b.3 Canonical Quantization

Canonical quantization is a method used to quantize a classical system. It involves replacing the classical coordinates and momenta with quantum mechanical operators, and the classical Hamiltonian function with the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian operator. This allows us to derive the Schrödinger equation for the system.

#### 1.4b.4 Application in Quantum Field Theory

In quantum field theory, canonical quantization is used to quantize the fields. The classical fields are replaced with quantum mechanical field operators, and the classical Hamiltonian function is replaced with the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian operator. This allows us to derive the Schrödinger equation for the system, which describes the evolution of the quantum fields.

#### 1.4b.5 Issues and Limitations

While canonical quantization is a powerful method for quantizing classical systems, it is not without its issues and limitations. One of the main issues is the problem of non-commutative operators. In quantum mechanics, the operators representing the coordinates and momenta do not commute, which can lead to difficulties in interpreting the physical meaning of the operators. Additionally, the canonical quantization method is not always applicable to all systems, and there are cases where other methods may be more appropriate.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of field redefinitions and their role in effective field theories.





### Subsection 1.4c Path Integral Formulation

The path integral formulation is a powerful tool in quantum mechanics that allows us to calculate the probability amplitude for a particle to travel from one point to another. It is particularly useful in quantum field theory, where it is used to calculate the probability amplitude for a field to evolve from one state to another.

#### 1.4c.1 Time-Slicing Derivation

One common approach to deriving the path integral formula is to divide the time interval into small pieces. This is done by dividing the time interval `[t_a, t_b]` into `n` segments, where `t_j = t_a + j\Delta t` for `j = 0, ..., n`. The Trotter product formula tells us that the noncommutativity of the kinetic and potential energy operators can be ignored.

For a particle in a smooth potential, the path integral is approximated by zigzag paths, which in one dimension is a product of ordinary integrals. For the motion of the particle from position `x_a` at time `t_a` to `x_b` at time `t_b`, the time sequence can be divided up into smaller segments, where `\Delta t` is of fixed duration.

This process is called "time-slicing". An approximation for the path integral can be computed as proportional to

$$
\int_{x_a}^{x_b} dx_1 \int_{x_a}^{x_b} dx_2 \cdots \int_{x_a}^{x_b} dx_n e^{iL/\hbar}
$$

where `L` is the Lagrangian of the one-dimensional system with position variable `x` and velocity `v` considered, and `dx_j` corresponds to the position at the `j`th time step, if the time integral is approximated by a sum of `n` terms.

In the limit `n → ∞`, this becomes a functional integral, which, apart from a nonessential factor, is directly the product of the probability amplitudes (more precisely, since one must work with a continuous spectrum, the respective densities) to find the quantum mechanical particle at `t_a` in the initial state `x_a` and at `t_b` in the final state `x_b`.

#### 1.4c.2 Lagrangian and Virtual Paths

The Lagrangian `L` is the classical Lagrangian of the one-dimensional system considered, and the abovementioned "zigzagging" corresponds to the appearance of the terms

$$
\int_{x_j}^{x_{j+1}} dx e^{iL/\hbar}
$$

in the Riemann sum approximating the time integral, which are finally integrated over to `x_n` with the integration measure `dx`, `x_̃j` is an arbitrary value of the interval corresponding to `j`, e.g. its center, `x_j + x_{j+1}/2`.

Thus, in contrast to classical mechanics, not only does the stationary path contribute, but actually all virtual paths between `x_a` and `x_b` contribute to the path integral. This is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics, where all possible paths are considered, not just the classical one.




### Subsection 1.5a Wilsonian RG

The Wilsonian Renormalization Group (Wilsonian RG) is a powerful mathematical tool used in quantum field theory to systematically account for the effects of interactions between particles. It is named after physicist Kenneth G. Wilson, who first introduced it in the 1970s.

#### 1.5a.1 Wilsonian RG and Effective Field Theories

The Wilsonian RG is closely related to the concept of effective field theories. In quantum field theory, the interactions between particles can be described by a Lagrangian. However, as the energy scale of the system increases, the effects of higher-order interactions become more significant. The Wilsonian RG allows us to systematically account for these interactions by introducing an energy cutoff.

The Wilsonian RG starts by defining an effective Lagrangian at a certain energy scale. This effective Lagrangian includes only the interactions that are relevant at that energy scale. As the energy scale increases, the effective Lagrangian is modified to include the effects of higher-order interactions. This process is repeated until the desired energy scale is reached.

#### 1.5a.2 Wilsonian RG and the Standard Model

In the context of the Standard Model, the Wilsonian RG is used to systematically account for the effects of interactions between particles. The Standard Model describes the fundamental particles and their interactions, and it is organized into three categories: quarks, leptons, and gauge bosons.

The Wilsonian RG allows us to systematically account for the effects of interactions between these particles. For example, consider the interaction between a quark and a gluon, which is described by the Lagrangian term `$\bar{\psi}_q g \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi_q G^{\mu\nu}$`. As the energy scale increases, the effects of this interaction become more significant. The Wilsonian RG allows us to account for these effects by introducing an energy cutoff and modifying the effective Lagrangian.

#### 1.5a.3 Wilsonian RG and the Gell-Mann Low RG

The Wilsonian RG is closely related to the Gell-Mann Low RG, which is another powerful mathematical tool used in quantum field theory. The Gell-Mann Low RG is used to systematically account for the effects of interactions between particles in the infrared region, while the Wilsonian RG is used to account for the effects of interactions in the ultraviolet region.

Together, the Wilsonian RG and the Gell-Mann Low RG provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the behavior of quantum field theories. They allow us to systematically account for the effects of interactions between particles at all energy scales, providing a powerful tool for understanding the fundamental laws of nature.




### Subsection 1.5b Gell-Mann Low RG

### Subsection 1.5c Beta Function and Anomalous Dimensions

The beta function and anomalous dimensions are two fundamental concepts in quantum field theory, particularly in the context of the Standard Model. They are closely related to the concepts of the Wilsonian and Gell-Mann Low Renormalization Group, and are essential for understanding the behavior of quantum systems at different energy scales.

#### 1.5c.1 Beta Function

The beta function, denoted as $\beta(g)$, is a function of the coupling constant $g$ that describes the change in the coupling constant with respect to the energy scale. It is a key component of the Renormalization Group (RG) equations, which describe how the coupling constants and other parameters of a quantum theory change as the energy scale is varied.

The beta function is particularly important in quantum field theory because it determines the behavior of the theory at different energy scales. For example, in the Standard Model, the beta function for the strong coupling constant $g_s$ is given by the one-loop expression:

$$
\beta(g_s) = -\frac{11}{3}g_s^3
$$

This equation shows that the strong coupling constant increases with increasing energy scale, which is a characteristic feature of non-Abelian gauge theories.

#### 1.5c.2 Anomalous Dimensions

Anomalous dimensions are another important concept in quantum field theory. They describe the change in the dimensions of operators under the RG transformation. In the context of the Standard Model, anomalous dimensions are particularly important for understanding the behavior of the fermion fields.

The anomalous dimension of a fermion field $\psi$ is given by the one-loop expression:

$$
\gamma_{\psi} = \frac{1}{2}T(R)
$$

where $T(R)$ is the Casimir invariant defined in the previous section. This equation shows that the anomalous dimension of a fermion field is proportional to its representation under the gauge group.

#### 1.5c.3 Beta Function and Anomalous Dimensions in the Standard Model

In the Standard Model, the beta function and anomalous dimensions play a crucial role in determining the behavior of the theory at different energy scales. They are particularly important for understanding the behavior of the fermion fields, which are responsible for the confinement of the theory.

The beta function and anomalous dimensions also play a crucial role in the Landau pole problem, which is a fundamental issue in quantum field theory. The Landau pole is a singularity in the theory that occurs at a certain energy scale, and it is related to the behavior of the beta function and anomalous dimensions.

In the next section, we will discuss the solution of the Landau pole problem and its implications for the Standard Model.




### Section 1.6 Neutrinos

Neutrinos are one of the most intriguing particles in the Standard Model. They are massless, electrically neutral, and interact with matter only through the weak force. Despite their elusive nature, neutrinos play a crucial role in our understanding of the universe. They are produced in nuclear reactions in the sun and other stars, and their detection has provided valuable insights into the energy production in these celestial bodies.

#### 1.6a Neutrino Oscillations

One of the most fascinating aspects of neutrinos is their ability to oscillate between different types, or flavors. This phenomenon, known as neutrino oscillations, was first predicted by Bruno Pontecorvo in the 1930s. However, it was not until the 1990s that experimental evidence for neutrino oscillations was found.

The oscillation of a neutrino from one flavor to another can be described by the Schrödinger equation:

$$
i\frac{d}{dt}|\psi\rangle = H|\psi\rangle
$$

where $|\psi\rangle$ is the state vector of the neutrino and $H$ is the Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian operator is given by:

$$
H = \begin{pmatrix}
m_1^2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & m_2^2 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & m_3^2
\end{pmatrix}
$$

where $m_1$, $m_2$, and $m_3$ are the masses of the three types of neutrinos. The off-diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian correspond to the oscillations between different types of neutrinos.

The oscillations of neutrinos have been observed in various experiments, including the Super-Kamiokande experiment and the Daya Bay experiment. These experiments have provided evidence for the existence of three types of neutrinos, known as electron neutrinos ($\nu_e$), muon neutrinos ($\nu_{\mu}$), and tauon neutrinos ($\nu_{\tau}$).

#### 1.6b Neutrino Masses

The masses of the three types of neutrinos are still not fully understood. The current best estimate for the masses is:

$$
m_1 = (0.00086 \pm 0.00034) \, \text{eV}
$$

$$
m_2 = (0.0029 \pm 0.0010) \, \text{eV}
$$

$$
m_3 = (0.051 \pm 0.015) \, \text{eV}
$$

These masses are very small compared to the masses of other particles, such as the electron or the proton. However, they are not zero, which is a significant departure from the original predictions of the Standard Model.

The smallness of the neutrino masses has led to the development of various theories to explain their origin. One of these theories is the seesaw mechanism, which proposes that the smallness of the neutrino masses is due to the existence of a heavy particle, known as the right-handed neutrino, that has not yet been observed.

#### 1.6c Neutrino Mixing

In addition to oscillating between different types, neutrinos can also mix with each other. This means that a neutrino of one type can transform into a neutrino of another type. The degree to which this mixing occurs is described by the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix, which is analogous to the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix in the quark sector.

The PMNS matrix is given by:

$$
U = \begin{pmatrix}
U_{e1} & U_{e2} & U_{e3} \\
U_{\mu 1} & U_{\mu 2} & U_{\mu 3} \\
U_{\tau 1} & U_{\tau 2} & U_{\tau 3}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

where $U_{ej}$ is the probability amplitude for a neutrino of type $j$ to transform into an electron neutrino. The PMNS matrix is complex and unitary, which ensures the conservation of probability.

The mixing of neutrinos has been observed in various experiments, including the T2K experiment and the NOvA experiment. These experiments have provided evidence for the existence of non-zero angles in the PMNS matrix, which is a clear indication of neutrino mixing.

In conclusion, neutrinos are a fascinating and complex part of the Standard Model. Their ability to oscillate between different types and mix with each other has provided valuable insights into the fundamental structure of the universe. Despite their elusive nature, ongoing research continues to shed light on the mysteries of these enigmatic particles.




### Section 1.6b Neutrino Masses and Mixings

The masses of the three types of neutrinos are still not fully understood. The current best estimate for the masses is:

$$
m_1 = (0.00086 \pm 0.00034) \, \text{eV}
$$

$$
m_2 = (0.0029 \pm 0.0010) \, \text{eV}
$$

$$
m_3 = (0.051 \pm 0.015) \, \text{eV}
$$

These masses are extremely small compared to the masses of other particles, and their precise values are still a subject of ongoing research. The smallness of the neutrino masses has led to the development of the concept of the "neutrino mass hierarchy", which refers to the possible ordering of the neutrino masses. The three possibilities are:

1. Normal hierarchy: $m_1 < m_2 < m_3$
2. Inverted hierarchy: $m_1 > m_2 > m_3$
3. Degenerate hierarchy: $m_1 \approx m_2 \approx m_3$

The hierarchy of the neutrino masses has important implications for the oscillations of neutrinos. For example, in the normal hierarchy, the oscillations between different types of neutrinos are more likely to be observed in the laboratory, while in the inverted hierarchy, these oscillations are less likely to be observed.

In addition to their masses, the three types of neutrinos also exhibit a phenomenon known as neutrino mixing. This means that a neutrino of one type can transform into a neutrino of another type. The mixing of neutrinos is described by a matrix known as the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix, which is analogous to the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix in the quark sector.

The PMNS matrix is given by:

$$
U = \begin{pmatrix}
U_{e1} & U_{e2} & U_{e3} \\
U_{\mu 1} & U_{\mu 2} & U_{\mu 3} \\
U_{\tau 1} & U_{\tau 2} & U_{\tau 3}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

where $U_{ej}$ is the probability amplitude for a neutrino of type $j$ to transform into an electron neutrino, and similarly for $U_{\mu j}$ and $U_{\tau j}$. The PMNS matrix is unitary, meaning that it satisfies the condition $UU^\dagger = 1$, where $U^\dagger$ is the Hermitian conjugate of $U$.

The mixing of neutrinos has been observed in various experiments, including the Daya Bay experiment and the RENO experiment. These experiments have provided evidence for the existence of non-zero angles in the PMNS matrix, indicating that neutrino mixing does indeed occur.

In conclusion, the masses and mixings of neutrinos are still not fully understood, and ongoing research is needed to further elucidate these phenomena. However, the current understanding of these topics is crucial for our understanding of the Standard Model and the fundamental laws of nature.




### Section 1.6c Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay

Neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββ) is a rare decay process in which a nucleus emits two electrons and two antineutrinos, without any neutrinos being emitted. This process is forbidden in the Standard Model of particle physics, but it is allowed in many extensions of the Standard Model. The observation of 0νββ would be a clear signal of new physics beyond the Standard Model.

The 0νββ process can be represented as:

$$
A^{0}_{Z} \rightarrow A^{0}_{Z+2} + 2e^{-} + 2\overline{\nu}_{e}
$$

where $A^{0}_{Z}$ is the initial nucleus, $A^{0}_{Z+2}$ is the final nucleus, $e^{-}$ are the emitted electrons, and $\overline{\nu}_{e}$ are the emitted antineutrinos.

The search for 0νββ has been a major focus of experimental research in recent years. The NEMO-3 experiment, for example, reported a 47 kg⋅y search for 0νββ of molybdenum-100 yielded a lower limit on the half-life of T<sub>1/2</sub> > (1.1 x 10^24) years. This can be translated into an upper limit on the effective neutrino mass: $m_{v} < 0.18$ eV.

The NEMO-3 experiment also reported precision 2νββ half-lives for its 7 isotopes and 0νββ limits for <sup>96</sup>Zr, <sup>48</sup>Ca, <sup>150</sup>Nd at Neutrino08. At SUSY08, NEMO-3 reported 2νββ and more 0νββ limits.

The final results of NEMO-3 were published in 2018. The experiment has set the most stringent limits on the 0νββ decay of <sup>100</sup>Mo, <sup>116</sup>Cd, <sup>82</sup>Se and <sup>96</sup>Zr. These results have provided valuable constraints on the parameters of various extensions of the Standard Model, such as the Majoron model.

The search for 0νββ continues, with several ongoing experiments, including SuperNEMO, which aims to improve the sensitivity of the search for 0νββ by a factor of 10. The results of these experiments will provide crucial insights into the nature of neutrinos and the fundamental laws of physics.

### Section 2.1 QCD Handout:

Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong nuclear force, which is responsible for the binding of quarks within hadrons. It is one of the four fundamental forces of nature, along with electromagnetism, the weak force, and gravity. QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, meaning that it describes the interactions of particles through the exchange of force-carrying particles, known as gluons.

The development of QCD has been a significant milestone in the history of particle physics. It has been instrumental in explaining the properties of hadrons and has been extensively tested through various experimental evidence. In this section, we will provide a brief overview of QCD and its key concepts, including quarks, gluons, and the strong force.

#### 2.1a Introduction to QCD

QCD is based on the concept of quarks, which are the fundamental building blocks of matter. Quarks are spin-1/2 particles that come in six flavors: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, and top. These quarks are confined within hadrons, which are particles made up of quarks and gluons. The most common hadrons are protons, neutrons, and pions.

The strong force, also known as the color force, is responsible for the binding of quarks within hadrons. It is a non-abelian gauge force, meaning that it is described by a non-abelian gauge theory. This theory is based on the concept of color, which is a fundamental property of quarks. Quarks come in three colors: red, green, and blue, and the strong force is responsible for the interactions between quarks of different colors.

The theory of QCD is based on the principles of quantum mechanics and special relativity. It describes the behavior of quarks and gluons at the fundamental level, and it is used to explain the properties of hadrons. QCD has been extensively tested through various experimental evidence, and it has been instrumental in explaining the properties of hadrons.

One of the key concepts in QCD is the concept of confinement, which states that quarks and gluons cannot exist as free particles. They are always confined within hadrons, and their behavior is described by the theory of QCD. This concept has been extensively tested through various experimental evidence, and it is one of the key predictions of QCD.

Another important concept in QCD is the concept of asymptotic freedom, which states that at high energies, the strong force becomes weaker, and quarks and gluons can behave as free particles. This concept has been extensively tested through various experimental evidence, and it is another key prediction of QCD.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the theory of QCD and explore its key concepts and principles in more detail. We will also discuss the applications of QCD in various fields, including particle physics, nuclear physics, and condensed matter physics. 





### Subsection 2.1b QCD Lagrangian

The QCD Lagrangian is a fundamental concept in quantum chromodynamics. It is a mathematical expression that describes the dynamics of the theory. The Lagrangian is defined as the difference between the kinetic energy and the potential energy of the system. In the case of QCD, the Lagrangian is used to describe the interactions between quarks and gluons.

The QCD Lagrangian is given by the following expression:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu - m)\psi - \frac{1}{4}G_{\mu\nu}G^{\mu\nu}
$$

where $\psi$ is the quark field, $\bar{\psi}$ is the antiquark field, $D_\mu$ is the covariant derivative, $G_{\mu\nu}$ is the gluon field strength tensor, and $m$ is the quark mass. The first term represents the kinetic energy of the quarks, while the second term represents the potential energy of the gluons.

The QCD Lagrangian is a key tool in the study of QCD. It allows us to calculate the dynamics of the system and make predictions about the behavior of hadrons. The Lagrangian is also used in the development of effective field theories, which are simplified versions of the theory that are used to study specific phenomena.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of effective field theories and their role in QCD. We will also discuss the development of effective field theories and their applications in the study of hadrons.





#### 2.1c Color Confinement

Color confinement is a fundamental concept in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) that describes the behavior of color-charged particles, such as quarks and gluons, within the theory. It is a key aspect of QCD that has been extensively studied and debated since its inception.

In QCD, color confinement is the phenomenon that color-charged particles cannot be isolated, and therefore cannot be directly observed in normal conditions below the Hagedorn temperature of approximately 2 terakelvin (corresponding to energies of approximately 130–140 MeV per particle). This is in contrast to classical electrodynamics, where electric charges can be isolated and directly observed.

The concept of color confinement is closely related to the idea of quark confinement, which states that quarks cannot be isolated and directly observed in normal conditions. This is due to the fact that quarks carry color charge, and according to the principles of color confinement, color-charged particles cannot be isolated.

One of the key pieces of evidence for color confinement is the phenomenon of asymptotic freedom. This is the idea that at high energies, the interactions between quarks and gluons become weaker, allowing them to be observed as individual particles. This is in contrast to low energies, where the interactions between quarks and gluons become stronger, leading to the formation of hadrons.

Another important aspect of color confinement is the concept of color screening. This is the idea that the color charge of a quark can be screened by the surrounding gluons, making it difficult for other particles to detect the quark's color charge. This is similar to the concept of electromagnetic screening, where the electric charge of a particle can be screened by the surrounding electric field.

The study of color confinement has been a major focus of research in QCD, with many different models and theories being proposed to explain its behavior. One such model is the two-dimensional Schwinger model, which exhibits confinement in addition to QCD in four spacetime dimensions. Other models, such as compact Abelian gauge theories and spinons, have also been found to exhibit confinement.

However, there are also alternative models where SU(2) becomes confining above the symmetry breaking scale. These models are quantitatively similar to the Standard Model at lower energies, but dramatically different above symmetry breaking. This raises questions about the significance of such models for the behavior of quarks and gluons in QCD.

In addition to these models, there have also been proposals for fully screened quarks, where the color charge of a quark is completely screened by the surrounding gluons. This idea has been supported by exact solutions of SU(3) classical Yang–Mills theory, which provide full screening of the color charge of a quark. However, these solutions do not take into account non-trivial properties of the QCD vacuum, making their significance unclear.

In conclusion, color confinement is a crucial aspect of QCD that has been extensively studied and debated. Its behavior is still not fully understood, and further research is needed to fully understand the dynamics of color-charged particles within the theory. 





#### 2.2a Dimensional Regularization

Dimensional regularization is a powerful technique used in quantum field theory to handle divergent integrals. It allows us to extend the theory to non-integer dimensions, where the integrals become finite. This technique is particularly useful in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), where it is used to handle the infrared and ultraviolet divergences that arise in the theory.

The basic idea behind dimensional regularization is to extend the space-time dimension from four to a non-integer value, denoted by $d$. This allows us to write the integrals in the form:

$$
\int \frac{d^d k}{(2\pi)^d} \frac{1}{k^2 + m^2}
$$

where $k$ is the momentum of the particle, $m$ is the mass of the particle, and $d$ is the space-time dimension. The integral is then evaluated using techniques from multivariate calculus.

The dimensional regularization technique is particularly useful in QCD because it allows us to handle the infrared and ultraviolet divergences that arise in the theory. The infrared divergences arise when the momentum of the particle approaches zero, while the ultraviolet divergences arise when the momentum of the particle approaches infinity. By extending the space-time dimension to a non-integer value, we can make these divergences finite, and thus obtain a well-defined theory.

However, it is important to note that the dimensional regularization technique is not without its limitations. For example, it cannot be used to handle the divergences that arise in the theory of gravity, where the space-time dimension is already four. Furthermore, the dimensional regularization technique is not applicable to theories that involve non-renormalizable interactions, where the theory becomes inconsistent at high energies.

In the next section, we will discuss another important technique in quantum field theory, known as renormalization. This technique is used to handle the divergences that arise in the theory, and it is particularly important in the study of quantum chromodynamics.

#### 2.2b Renormalization

Renormalization is a fundamental concept in quantum field theory, particularly in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). It is a mathematical technique used to handle the divergent integrals that arise in the theory. The basic idea behind renormalization is to redefine the parameters of the theory in such a way that the theory becomes finite and consistent.

The need for renormalization arises from the fact that the parameters of the theory, such as the coupling constant and the mass of the particles, are not constant but depend on the scale at which the theory is being considered. This is known as the renormalization group effect. The renormalization group equation, which describes the change in the parameters of the theory with respect to the scale, is given by:

$$
\frac{d}{d\ln\mu} g(\mu) = \beta(g(\mu))
$$

where $g(\mu)$ is the coupling constant, $\mu$ is the scale, and $\beta(g(\mu))$ is the beta function. The beta function describes the change in the coupling constant with respect to the scale, and it is given by:

$$
\beta(g(\mu)) = \mu \frac{dg(\mu)}{d\mu}
$$

The renormalization technique is used to solve the renormalization group equation and to obtain a finite and consistent theory. This is achieved by redefining the parameters of the theory in such a way that the theory becomes finite and consistent at all scales.

The renormalization technique is particularly useful in QCD because it allows us to handle the infrared and ultraviolet divergences that arise in the theory. The infrared divergences arise when the momentum of the particle approaches zero, while the ultraviolet divergences arise when the momentum of the particle approaches infinity. By renormalizing the theory, we can make these divergences finite, and thus obtain a well-defined theory.

However, it is important to note that the renormalization technique is not without its limitations. For example, it cannot be used to handle the divergences that arise in the theory of gravity, where the theory becomes inconsistent at high energies. Furthermore, the renormalization technique is not applicable to theories that involve non-renormalizable interactions, where the theory becomes inconsistent at high energies.

In the next section, we will discuss another important technique in quantum field theory, known as the effective field theory. This technique is used to handle the divergences that arise in the theory, and it is particularly useful in the study of quantum chromodynamics.

#### 2.2c Regularization Schemes

Regularization schemes are mathematical techniques used in quantum field theory to handle the divergent integrals that arise in the theory. They are particularly useful in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), where the theory becomes inconsistent at high energies. The basic idea behind regularization schemes is to modify the theory in such a way that the integrals become finite and consistent.

There are several types of regularization schemes, each with its own advantages and limitations. Some of the most commonly used regularization schemes in QCD include dimensional regularization, Pauli-Villars regularization, and lattice regularization.

Dimensional regularization, as discussed in the previous section, is a powerful technique that allows us to extend the space-time dimension to a non-integer value, thereby making the integrals finite. However, it cannot be used to handle the divergences that arise in the theory of gravity, where the theory becomes inconsistent at high energies.

Pauli-Villars regularization is another popular regularization scheme that is particularly useful in QCD. It involves introducing a set of auxiliary particles, known as Pauli-Villars particles, that are used to regulate the integrals. The integrals are then evaluated using techniques from multivariate calculus.

Lattice regularization, on the other hand, involves discretizing the space-time continuum into a lattice. This allows us to handle the divergent integrals that arise in the theory, but it also introduces a new set of problems, such as the need to extrapolate the results from the lattice to the continuum.

The choice of regularization scheme depends on the specific requirements of the theory and the physical problem at hand. For example, dimensional regularization is particularly useful in QCD because it allows us to handle the infrared and ultraviolet divergences that arise in the theory. However, it cannot be used to handle the divergences that arise in the theory of gravity.

In the next section, we will discuss another important concept in quantum field theory, known as the effective field theory. This concept is particularly useful in QCD because it allows us to systematically expand the theory in terms of the energy scale, thereby providing a systematic way to handle the divergences that arise in the theory.

#### 2.3a Power Counting

Power counting is a mathematical technique used in quantum field theory to determine the order of a perturbation theory expansion. It is particularly useful in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), where the theory becomes inconsistent at high energies. The basic idea behind power counting is to estimate the contribution of each term in the perturbation theory expansion based on the powers of the momenta and the coupling constants.

The power counting in QCD is based on the dimensionality of the theory. The theory is four-dimensional, and the integrals are performed over four-dimensional space-time. The momenta and the coupling constants have dimensions of mass and inverse mass, respectively. Therefore, the contribution of each term in the perturbation theory expansion is estimated by counting the number of powers of the momenta and the coupling constants.

The power counting is performed using the Feynman diagrams, which are graphical representations of the perturbation theory expansion. Each Feynman diagram corresponds to a term in the perturbation theory expansion, and its contribution is estimated by counting the number of powers of the momenta and the coupling constants.

The power counting is particularly useful in QCD because it allows us to systematically expand the theory in terms of the energy scale. The theory is expanded in terms of the energy scale, and the contribution of each term is estimated based on the powers of the momenta and the coupling constants. This allows us to handle the divergent integrals that arise in the theory, but it also introduces a new set of problems, such as the need to extrapolate the results from the perturbation theory expansion to the non-perturbative regime.

In the next section, we will discuss another important concept in quantum field theory, known as the effective field theory. This concept is particularly useful in QCD because it allows us to systematically expand the theory in terms of the energy scale, thereby providing a systematic way to handle the divergences that arise in the theory.

#### 2.3b Convergence and Renormalization

Convergence and renormalization are two crucial concepts in quantum field theory, particularly in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Convergence refers to the ability of a perturbation theory expansion to converge to a finite result, while renormalization is the process of removing the divergences that arise in the perturbation theory expansion.

The convergence of the perturbation theory expansion in QCD is a subject of ongoing research. The perturbation theory expansion is based on the assumption that the coupling constant $g$ is small, and the series is expanded in terms of $g$. However, the coupling constant $g$ is not constant but depends on the energy scale $\mu$. This leads to the renormalization group equation, which describes the change of the coupling constant with the energy scale:

$$
\mu \frac{d g}{d \mu} = \beta(g)
$$

where $\beta(g)$ is the beta function. The beta function describes the change of the coupling constant with the energy scale, and it is given by:

$$
\beta(g) = -b_0 g^3 - b_1 g^5 - b_2 g^7 + \ldots
$$

where $b_0$, $b_1$, $b_2$, ... are the coefficients of the beta function. The coefficients $b_0$, $b_1$, $b_2$, ... are positive, and they increase with the order of the perturbation theory expansion. This leads to the conclusion that the perturbation theory expansion is asymptotic, and it cannot converge to a finite result.

The renormalization process is used to remove the divergences that arise in the perturbation theory expansion. The divergences arise from the integration over the large momentum regions, and they are proportional to the powers of the coupling constant. The renormalization process involves the redefinition of the coupling constant and the physical quantities in such a way that the divergences are removed.

The renormalization process is performed using the renormalization group equation. The renormalization group equation describes the change of the coupling constant and the physical quantities with the energy scale, and it is used to remove the divergences that arise in the perturbation theory expansion.

The renormalization process is a crucial aspect of quantum field theory, particularly in QCD. It allows us to handle the divergent integrals that arise in the perturbation theory expansion, and it provides a systematic way to handle the non-perturbative regime of the theory. However, the renormalization process is not without its problems. The renormalization process involves the redefinition of the coupling constant and the physical quantities, and it introduces a new set of problems, such as the need to extrapolate the results from the perturbation theory expansion to the non-perturbative regime.

In the next section, we will discuss another important concept in quantum field theory, known as the effective field theory. This concept is particularly useful in QCD because it allows us to systematically expand the theory in terms of the energy scale, and it provides a systematic way to handle the non-perturbative regime of the theory.

#### 2.3c Bare and Renormalized Coupling

The concept of bare and renormalized coupling is a fundamental aspect of quantum field theory, particularly in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The bare coupling, denoted as $g_0$, is the coupling constant at a reference scale, typically chosen to be the scale of the theory, $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$. The renormalized coupling, denoted as $g(\mu)$, is the coupling constant at a different scale $\mu$.

The bare coupling $g_0$ is the coupling constant that appears in the Lagrangian of the theory. It is the coupling constant that is used to calculate the physical quantities at the scale of the theory, $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$. The bare coupling $g_0$ is related to the renormalized coupling $g(\mu)$ through the renormalization group equation:

$$
\mu \frac{d g}{d \mu} = \beta(g)
$$

where $\beta(g)$ is the beta function. The beta function describes the change of the coupling constant with the energy scale, and it is given by:

$$
\beta(g) = -b_0 g^3 - b_1 g^5 - b_2 g^7 + \ldots
$$

where $b_0$, $b_1$, $b_2$, ... are the coefficients of the beta function. The coefficients $b_0$, $b_1$, $b_2$, ... are positive, and they increase with the order of the perturbation theory expansion. This leads to the conclusion that the perturbation theory expansion is asymptotic, and it cannot converge to a finite result.

The renormalized coupling $g(\mu)$ is the coupling constant that is used to calculate the physical quantities at a different scale $\mu$. The renormalized coupling $g(\mu)$ is related to the bare coupling $g_0$ through the renormalization group equation. The renormalization group equation is used to remove the divergences that arise in the perturbation theory expansion.

The renormalized coupling $g(\mu)$ is a crucial aspect of quantum field theory, particularly in QCD. It allows us to handle the divergent integrals that arise in the perturbation theory expansion, and it provides a systematic way to handle the non-perturbative regime of the theory. However, the renormalization process is not without its problems. The renormalization process involves the redefinition of the coupling constant and the physical quantities, and it introduces a new set of problems, such as the need to extrapolate the results from the perturbation theory expansion to the non-perturbative regime.

In the next section, we will discuss another important concept in quantum field theory, known as the effective field theory. This concept is particularly useful in QCD because it allows us to systematically expand the theory in terms of the energy scale, and it provides a systematic way to handle the non-perturbative regime of the theory.

## Chapter: Effective Field Theory for Heavy Quarks

### Introduction

In the realm of quantum physics, the study of heavy quarks and their interactions with the surrounding environment is a fascinating and complex field. This chapter, "Effective Field Theory for Heavy Quarks," delves into the intricacies of this subject, providing a comprehensive understanding of the effective field theory and its application in the study of heavy quarks.

The effective field theory, a powerful tool in quantum physics, allows us to simplify the complex interactions between particles and fields. It does this by focusing on the low-energy behavior of a system, effectively ignoring the high-energy details that are not relevant to the system's behavior at lower energies. This is particularly useful when dealing with heavy quarks, which are particles of such high mass that their behavior at high energies is not particularly relevant to their behavior at lower energies.

In this chapter, we will explore the mathematical foundations of the effective field theory, including the equations and principles that govern its operation. We will also discuss the application of this theory to heavy quarks, demonstrating how it can be used to simplify the complex interactions between heavy quarks and other particles and fields.

The effective field theory for heavy quarks is a crucial tool in the study of quantum physics. It allows us to focus on the behavior of heavy quarks at lower energies, simplifying the complex interactions that these particles experience. By understanding this theory, we can gain a deeper understanding of the behavior of heavy quarks and their role in the quantum world.

This chapter aims to provide a clear and comprehensive introduction to the effective field theory for heavy quarks, equipping readers with the knowledge and tools necessary to further explore this fascinating field. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or simply a curious reader, we hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource in your journey through the world of quantum physics.




#### 2.2b Renormalization Schemes

Renormalization is a crucial aspect of quantum field theory, particularly in the context of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). It is a mathematical technique used to handle the divergent integrals that arise in the theory. The basic idea behind renormalization is to redefine the parameters of the theory in such a way that the theory becomes finite.

There are several different renormalization schemes that can be used in QCD. These schemes differ in how they handle the divergent integrals, but they all aim to obtain a well-defined theory. Some of the most commonly used renormalization schemes in QCD include the minimal subtraction scheme (MS), the modified minimal subtraction scheme (MMS), and the naive dimensional regularization scheme (NDR).

The minimal subtraction scheme (MS) is one of the most widely used renormalization schemes in QCD. It is based on the idea of subtracting the divergent part of the integral, and then redefining the parameters of the theory to account for this subtraction. The MS scheme is particularly useful in QCD because it allows us to handle the infrared and ultraviolet divergences that arise in the theory.

The modified minimal subtraction scheme (MMS) is a variant of the MS scheme. It is used in situations where the MS scheme is not applicable, such as in the theory of gravity. The MMS scheme is based on the idea of subtracting the divergent part of the integral, but it also includes additional terms to account for the non-renormalizable interactions in the theory.

The naive dimensional regularization scheme (NDR) is another commonly used renormalization scheme in QCD. It is based on the idea of extending the space-time dimension to a non-integer value, as in the dimensional regularization technique. The NDR scheme is particularly useful in QCD because it allows us to handle the infrared and ultraviolet divergences that arise in the theory.

It is important to note that the choice of renormalization scheme is not without its limitations. For example, the MS scheme cannot be used in the theory of gravity, and the NDR scheme cannot be used in theories that involve non-renormalizable interactions. Furthermore, the choice of renormalization scheme can affect the physical predictions of the theory. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the properties and limitations of each renormalization scheme when applying them in practice.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of effective field theories, which provide a powerful framework for organizing the perturbative expansion of a theory.

#### 2.2c Regularization and Renormalization in QCD

In quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong nuclear force, regularization and renormalization play a crucial role in handling the divergent integrals that arise in the theory. The regularization techniques are used to make the integrals finite, while the renormalization schemes are used to redefine the parameters of the theory to account for the finite parts of the integrals.

The regularization techniques used in QCD include the Pauli-Villars regularization, the dimensional regularization, and the lattice regularization. The Pauli-Villars regularization is based on the idea of introducing additional particles (the Pauli-Villars particles) with large masses to regulate the integrals. The dimensional regularization, as discussed in the previous section, involves extending the space-time dimension to a non-integer value. The lattice regularization, on the other hand, involves discretizing the space-time continuum into a lattice.

The renormalization schemes used in QCD include the minimal subtraction scheme (MS), the modified minimal subtraction scheme (MMS), and the naive dimensional regularization scheme (NDR). These schemes differ in how they handle the divergent integrals, but they all aim to obtain a well-defined theory.

The MS scheme is particularly useful in QCD because it allows us to handle the infrared and ultraviolet divergences that arise in the theory. The MMS scheme, on the other hand, is used in situations where the MS scheme is not applicable, such as in the theory of gravity. The NDR scheme, based on the idea of extending the space-time dimension to a non-integer value, is particularly useful in QCD because it allows us to handle the infrared and ultraviolet divergences that arise in the theory.

It is important to note that the choice of regularization and renormalization techniques can affect the physical predictions of the theory. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the properties and limitations of these techniques when applying them in practice.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of effective field theories, which provide a powerful framework for organizing the perturbative expansion of a theory.

#### 2.3a Power Counting

Power counting is a fundamental concept in effective field theories (EFTs). It is a mathematical technique used to determine the order of a term in the perturbation series. The order of a term is determined by the power of the small parameter, typically the coupling constant, in the term. 

In quantum field theory, the power counting is often done using dimensional analysis. The dimensional analysis is based on the fact that the dimensions of physical quantities are fixed. For example, the dimension of a length is always one, the dimension of a mass is always one over the power of the Planck constant, and the dimension of a time is always one over the power of the Planck constant times the Planck mass.

The power counting in quantum field theory is done by assigning dimensions to the fields and the derivatives. The fields have dimensions of mass to the power of the negative of their spin, and the derivatives have dimensions of mass. The power of the small parameter in a term is then determined by the sum of the dimensions of the fields and the derivatives in the term.

For example, consider a term in the perturbation series that involves a field $\phi$ and a derivative $\partial_\mu \phi$. The dimension of $\phi$ is $1/m$ and the dimension of $\partial_\mu \phi$ is $m$. Therefore, the power of the small parameter in this term is $1/m + m = 0$. This term is therefore of order zero in the perturbation series.

The power counting is a crucial tool in effective field theories. It allows us to systematically organize the perturbation series and to determine the order of the terms. This is particularly important in quantum field theory, where the perturbation series often involves an infinite number of terms.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of effective vertices, which are crucial for understanding the behavior of particles in effective field theories.

#### 2.3b Effective Vertices

Effective vertices are a crucial concept in effective field theories (EFTs). They are the points in space-time where particles interact. The effective vertices are determined by the interactions that are included in the EFT. 

In quantum field theory, the effective vertices are often represented by Feynman diagrams. A Feynman diagram is a graph that represents the interactions between particles. The vertices of the graph represent the effective vertices, and the lines represent the propagation of particles between the vertices.

The effective vertices in an EFT are determined by the terms in the Lagrangian that describe the interactions between the particles. These terms are often written in a Taylor series expansion, with the coefficients of the terms representing the effective vertices.

For example, consider a Lagrangian that describes the interaction between a scalar field $\phi$ and a vector field $A_\mu$:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \phi)^2 - \frac{1}{2} m^2 \phi^2 - \frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} - g \phi F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}
$$

Here, the term $g \phi F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}$ represents the interaction between the scalar field and the vector field. The coefficient $g$ represents the effective vertex.

The effective vertices play a crucial role in the perturbation series of an EFT. The terms in the perturbation series are often written as products of effective vertices. The power of the small parameter in a term is then determined by the sum of the dimensions of the effective vertices in the term.

For example, consider a term in the perturbation series that involves two effective vertices, one with dimension $1/m$ and one with dimension $m$. The power of the small parameter in this term is $1/m + m = 0$. This term is therefore of order zero in the perturbation series.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of effective vertices in more detail, and we will introduce the concept of effective vertex functions.

#### 2.3c Power Counting and Effective Vertices

Power counting and effective vertices are two fundamental concepts in effective field theories (EFTs). They are closely related, as the power counting is often used to determine the order of the terms in the perturbation series, which are represented by the effective vertices.

The power counting in EFTs is done using dimensional analysis, as discussed in the previous section. The power of the small parameter in a term is determined by the sum of the dimensions of the effective vertices in the term. This allows us to systematically organize the perturbation series and to determine the order of the terms.

For example, consider a term in the perturbation series that involves two effective vertices, one with dimension $1/m$ and one with dimension $m$. The power of the small parameter in this term is $1/m + m = 0$. This term is therefore of order zero in the perturbation series.

The effective vertices in an EFT are determined by the terms in the Lagrangian that describe the interactions between the particles. These terms are often written in a Taylor series expansion, with the coefficients of the terms representing the effective vertices.

For example, consider a Lagrangian that describes the interaction between a scalar field $\phi$ and a vector field $A_\mu$:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \phi)^2 - \frac{1}{2} m^2 \phi^2 - \frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} - g \phi F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}
$$

Here, the term $g \phi F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}$ represents the interaction between the scalar field and the vector field. The coefficient $g$ represents the effective vertex.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of effective vertex functions, which are crucial for understanding the behavior of particles in effective field theories.

$$

Here, the term $g \phi F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}$ represents the interaction between the scalar field and the vector field. The coefficient $g$ represents the effective vertex.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of effective vertex functions, which are crucial for understanding the behavior of particles in effective field theories.

#### 2.4b Effective Vertex Functions

Effective vertex functions are a crucial concept in effective field theories (EFTs). They provide a mathematical representation of the interactions between particles in the theory. The effective vertex functions are determined by the terms in the Lagrangian that describe the interactions between the particles. These terms are often written in a Taylor series expansion, with the coefficients of the terms representing the effective vertices.

For example, consider a Lagrangian that describes the interaction between a scalar field $\phi$ and a vector field $A_\mu$:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \phi)^2 - \frac{1}{2} m^2 \phi^2 - \frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} - g \phi F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}
$$

Here, the term $g \phi F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}$ represents the interaction between the scalar field and the vector field. The coefficient $g$ represents the effective vertex.

The effective vertex functions are crucial for understanding the behavior of particles in effective field theories.

## Chapter: Effective Field Theory for Composite Systems

### Introduction

In the realm of quantum physics, the concept of composite systems plays a pivotal role. These systems, often referred to as bound states, are formed when two or more particles interact in such a way that they can no longer be described as individual entities. Instead, they are best understood as a single, composite entity. This chapter, "Effective Field Theory for Composite Systems," delves into the fascinating world of these composite systems, exploring their unique characteristics and behaviors.

The chapter begins by introducing the concept of composite systems, explaining their formation and the principles that govern their behavior. It then moves on to discuss the effective field theory, a powerful tool used to describe these systems. The effective field theory is a simplified version of the more complex quantum field theory, and it is particularly useful for understanding the behavior of composite systems.

The chapter also explores the mathematical foundations of the effective field theory, using the popular Markdown format to present mathematical expressions and equations. For instance, the equation `$y_j(n)$` represents the value of the variable `$y_j(n)$` at a given point in time `$n$`. This format allows for a clear and concise presentation of complex mathematical concepts, making them easier to understand and apply.

Finally, the chapter concludes with a discussion on the applications of the effective field theory for composite systems. This includes its use in various fields of physics, such as condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, and particle physics.

In essence, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the effective field theory for composite systems, equipping readers with the knowledge and tools necessary to explore this fascinating field further. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or simply a curious mind, we hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource in your journey through the world of quantum physics.




#### 2.2c Renormalization Group Equations

The renormalization group (RG) equations are a set of differential equations that describe the evolution of the parameters of a quantum field theory as the scale of observation changes. They are a crucial tool in the study of quantum field theories, particularly in the context of quantum chromodynamics (QCD).

The RG equations are derived from the renormalization group, a mathematical framework that allows us to handle the divergent integrals that arise in quantum field theories. The renormalization group is based on the idea of changing the scale of observation, and then redefining the parameters of the theory to account for this change.

The RG equations are particularly useful in QCD because they allow us to study the behavior of the theory at different scales of observation. This is important because the behavior of the theory can change dramatically as the scale of observation changes. For example, at very high scales, the theory may be dominated by short-distance interactions, while at very low scales, it may be dominated by long-distance interactions.

The RG equations are also crucial in the study of phase transitions in quantum field theories. They allow us to track the evolution of the theory as it approaches a phase transition, and to understand the behavior of the theory on either side of the transition.

The RG equations are typically written in the form:

$$
\frac{d}{d\ln\mu}G(\mu) = \beta(G(\mu))
$$

where $G(\mu)$ is the set of parameters of the theory, $\mu$ is the scale of observation, and $\beta(G(\mu))$ is the beta function, which describes the evolution of the parameters as the scale of observation changes.

The RG equations are a powerful tool in the study of quantum field theories, and they have been used to make many important predictions about the behavior of QCD. However, they are also a complex and subtle topic, and their full implications are still being studied.




#### 2.3a Statement of the Decoupling Theorem

The Decoupling Theorem is a fundamental result in the theory of effective field theories. It provides a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of quantum field theories at different scales of observation.

The theorem can be stated as follows:

Given a quantum field theory described by the action $S$, and a subgroup $G$ of the symmetry group of the theory, then for any $G$-invariant regularization scheme, the effective action $S_{\text{eff}}$ is also $G$-invariant.

This theorem has profound implications for the behavior of quantum field theories. It tells us that the effective action, which describes the behavior of the theory at different scales of observation, is invariant under the symmetries of the theory. This means that the symmetries of the theory are not affected by the process of renormalization, and that the theory remains consistent and predictive at all scales.

The Decoupling Theorem is particularly useful in the context of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong nuclear force. In QCD, the symmetry group is the color symmetry group, which describes the symmetries of the strong force. The Decoupling Theorem tells us that the effective action of QCD is invariant under the color symmetry group, which means that the strong force remains consistent and predictive at all scales of observation.

The Decoupling Theorem also has important implications for the renormalization group equations. These equations describe the evolution of the parameters of a quantum field theory as the scale of observation changes. The Decoupling Theorem tells us that the renormalization group equations are invariant under the symmetries of the theory, which means that the behavior of the theory as the scale of observation changes is also invariant under these symmetries.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of the Decoupling Theorem in more detail, and discuss its applications in the study of quantum field theories.

#### 2.3b Proof of the Decoupling Theorem

The proof of the Decoupling Theorem is a straightforward application of the symmetry properties of the theory. We will prove the theorem for a general quantum field theory, and then specialize to the case of QCD.

Given a quantum field theory described by the action $S$, and a subgroup $G$ of the symmetry group of the theory, we consider a $G$-invariant regularization scheme. This means that the regularization scheme respects the symmetries of the theory.

The effective action $S_{\text{eff}}$ is defined as the action of the theory after renormalization. It is given by the following equation:

$$
S_{\text{eff}} = S + \Delta S
$$

where $\Delta S$ is the counterterm action, which is added to cancel the divergences in the theory.

We now consider the action $S_{\text{eff}}$ under the symmetry group $G$. By the symmetry properties of the theory, we have:

$$
G(S_{\text{eff}}) = G(S + \Delta S) = G(S) + G(\Delta S)
$$

Since $G(S) = S$, and $G(\Delta S) = 0$ (because $\Delta S$ is a counterterm), we have:

$$
G(S_{\text{eff}}) = S
$$

This shows that the effective action $S_{\text{eff}}$ is invariant under the symmetry group $G$. This proves the Decoupling Theorem.

In the case of QCD, the symmetry group is the color symmetry group, which describes the symmetries of the strong force. The Decoupling Theorem tells us that the effective action of QCD is invariant under the color symmetry group, which means that the strong force remains consistent and predictive at all scales of observation.

The Decoupling Theorem also has important implications for the renormalization group equations. These equations describe the evolution of the parameters of a quantum field theory as the scale of observation changes. The Decoupling Theorem tells us that the renormalization group equations are invariant under the symmetries of the theory, which means that the behavior of the theory as the scale of observation changes is also invariant under these symmetries.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of the Decoupling Theorem in more detail, and discuss its applications in the study of quantum field theories.

#### 2.3c Applications of the Decoupling Theorem

The Decoupling Theorem has profound implications for the study of quantum field theories, particularly in the context of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In this section, we will explore some of these applications, focusing on the implications of the theorem for the renormalization group equations and the behavior of the theory as the scale of observation changes.

The Decoupling Theorem tells us that the effective action $S_{\text{eff}}$ is invariant under the symmetry group $G$. This has important implications for the renormalization group equations, which describe the evolution of the parameters of a quantum field theory as the scale of observation changes. The Decoupling Theorem tells us that the renormalization group equations are invariant under the symmetries of the theory, which means that the behavior of the theory as the scale of observation changes is also invariant under these symmetries.

This has important implications for the behavior of QCD at different scales. For example, consider the case of a high-energy collision, where the scale of observation is large. In this case, the theory is dominated by short-distance interactions, and the symmetries of the theory are crucial for predicting the behavior of the theory. The Decoupling Theorem tells us that the effective action $S_{\text{eff}}$ is invariant under the symmetry group $G$, which means that the theory remains consistent and predictive at this scale.

On the other hand, consider the case of a low-energy collision, where the scale of observation is small. In this case, the theory is dominated by long-distance interactions, and the symmetries of the theory may not be as crucial. However, the Decoupling Theorem still applies, and tells us that the effective action $S_{\text{eff}}$ is invariant under the symmetry group $G$. This means that the theory remains consistent and predictive at this scale as well.

In conclusion, the Decoupling Theorem is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of quantum field theories at different scales of observation. It tells us that the effective action $S_{\text{eff}}$ is invariant under the symmetry group $G$, which has important implications for the renormalization group equations and the behavior of the theory as the scale of observation changes. This theorem is particularly important in the context of QCD, where it provides a fundamental understanding of the behavior of the theory at different scales.




#### 2.3b Applications of the Decoupling Theorem

The Decoupling Theorem has a wide range of applications in quantum field theory, particularly in the study of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In this section, we will explore some of these applications, focusing on the decoupling of heavy particles and the implications for the renormalization group equations.

##### Decoupling of Heavy Particles

One of the most important applications of the Decoupling Theorem is in the study of heavy particles in QCD. Heavy particles, such as the top quark, are much heavier than the other particles in the theory, and their effects on the theory are often negligible at low energies. The Decoupling Theorem tells us that we can safely ignore these heavy particles when studying the theory at low energies, as their effects will be decoupled from the theory.

This decoupling is particularly useful in the context of the renormalization group equations. The renormalization group equations describe the evolution of the parameters of a quantum field theory as the scale of observation changes. At high energies, where the effects of heavy particles are significant, the renormalization group equations can be complex and difficult to solve. However, at low energies, where the effects of heavy particles are negligible, the renormalization group equations become much simpler. The Decoupling Theorem tells us that these simplifications are not an artifact of our approximation, but are a fundamental property of the theory.

##### Implications for the Renormalization Group Equations

The Decoupling Theorem also has important implications for the renormalization group equations. The renormalization group equations are invariant under the symmetries of the theory, which means that the behavior of the theory as the scale of observation changes is also invariant under these symmetries. This invariance is a direct consequence of the Decoupling Theorem, and it provides a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of quantum field theories at different scales of observation.

In the next section, we will explore these implications in more detail, and discuss how the Decoupling Theorem can be used to derive the renormalization group equations.

#### 2.3c Decoupling Theorem in Effective Field Theories

The Decoupling Theorem is a fundamental concept in the study of effective field theories (EFTs). It provides a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of quantum field theories at different scales of observation. In this section, we will explore the implications of the Decoupling Theorem in the context of EFTs, focusing on the decoupling of heavy particles and the implications for the renormalization group equations.

##### Decoupling of Heavy Particles in EFTs

In EFTs, heavy particles are often integrated out of the theory, leading to an effective theory that describes the behavior of the lighter particles. The Decoupling Theorem tells us that we can safely ignore these heavy particles when studying the theory at low energies, as their effects will be decoupled from the theory.

This decoupling is particularly useful in the context of the renormalization group equations. The renormalization group equations describe the evolution of the parameters of a quantum field theory as the scale of observation changes. At high energies, where the effects of heavy particles are significant, the renormalization group equations can be complex and difficult to solve. However, at low energies, where the effects of heavy particles are negligible, the renormalization group equations become much simpler. The Decoupling Theorem tells us that these simplifications are not an artifact of our approximation, but are a fundamental property of the theory.

The Decoupling Theorem also has important implications for the renormalization group equations in EFTs. The renormalization group equations are invariant under the symmetries of the theory, which means that the behavior of the theory as the scale of observation changes is also invariant under these symmetries. This invariance is a direct consequence of the Decoupling Theorem, and it provides a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of quantum field theories at different scales of observation.

In the next section, we will explore these implications in more detail, and discuss how the Decoupling Theorem can be used to derive the renormalization group equations in EFTs.




### Subsection: 2.4a MS Bar Scheme

The MS Bar scheme, also known as the Modified Subtraction scheme, is a mass independent scheme used in quantum field theory, particularly in the study of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). It is a variant of the MS scheme, which is a mass independent scheme that is commonly used in the study of quantum electrodynamics (QED).

#### 2.4a MS Bar Scheme

The MS Bar scheme is a mass independent scheme that is particularly useful in the study of QCD. It is based on the MS scheme, but it includes additional terms that account for the effects of heavy particles. These additional terms are necessary because the MS scheme is not able to accurately describe the behavior of the theory at high energies, where the effects of heavy particles are significant.

The MS Bar scheme is defined by the following renormalization conditions:

$$
\begin{align*}
\overline{m}_i(\mu) &= m_i \\
\overline{Z}_i(\mu) &= 1
\end{align*}
$$

where $\overline{m}_i(\mu)$ is the MS Bar mass of particle $i$, $m_i$ is the physical mass of particle $i$, and $\overline{Z}_i(\mu)$ is the MS Bar wave function renormalization constant of particle $i$. These conditions ensure that the MS Bar mass and wave function renormalization constant are equal to the physical mass and wave function renormalization constant, respectively, at the scale $\mu$.

The MS Bar scheme is particularly useful in the study of QCD because it allows us to decouple the effects of heavy particles from the theory at low energies. This decoupling is achieved by including additional terms in the renormalization conditions that account for the effects of heavy particles. These additional terms are necessary because the MS scheme is not able to accurately describe the behavior of the theory at high energies, where the effects of heavy particles are significant.

The MS Bar scheme is also useful in the study of QCD because it provides a systematic way to include the effects of heavy particles in the theory. This is particularly important in the study of QCD, where the effects of heavy particles, such as the top quark, can be significant at high energies. By including these effects in the theory, we can obtain a more accurate description of the behavior of QCD at high energies.

In the next section, we will explore some of the applications of the MS Bar scheme in the study of QCD.




### Subsection: 2.4b On-Shell Scheme

The On-Shell scheme is another mass independent scheme used in quantum field theory, particularly in the study of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). It is a variant of the MS scheme, which is a mass independent scheme that is commonly used in the study of quantum electrodynamics (QED).

$$
\begin{align*}
\overline{m}_i(\mu) &= m_i \\
\overline{Z}_i(\mu) &= 1
\end{align*}
$$

where $\overline{m}_i(\mu)$ is the On-Shell mass of particle $i$, $m_i$ is the physical mass of particle $i$, and $\overline{Z}_i(\mu)$ is the On-Shell wave function renormalization constant of particle $i$. These conditions ensure that the On-Shell mass and wave function renormalization constant are equal to the physical mass and wave function renormalization constant, respectively, at the scale $\mu$.

The On-Shell scheme is particularly useful in the study of QCD because it allows us to decouple the effects of heavy particles from the theory at low energies.

### Subsection: 2.4c Other Mass Independent Schemes

In addition to the On-Shell scheme, there are several other mass independent schemes that are commonly used in quantum field theory, particularly in the study of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). These schemes are all based on the concept of renormalization, which is a mathematical technique used to remove the effects of heavy particles from the theory at low energies.

#### 2.4c Other Mass Independent Schemes

One of the most commonly used mass independent schemes is the Minimal Subtraction (MS) scheme. This scheme is similar to the On-Shell scheme, but it does not include additional terms to account for the effects of heavy particles. Instead, it relies on the renormalization conditions to remove these effects. The MS scheme is particularly useful in the study of QCD because it allows us to decouple the effects of heavy particles from the theory at low energies.

Another popular mass independent scheme is the Dimensional Regularization (DR) scheme. This scheme is based on the concept of dimensional regularization, which is a mathematical technique used to extend the theory to higher dimensions. This allows us to remove the effects of heavy particles from the theory at low energies by considering the theory in a higher dimensional space. The DR scheme is particularly useful in the study of QCD because it allows us to decouple the effects of heavy particles from the theory at low energies.

Other mass independent schemes include the Hidden Local Symmetry (HLS) scheme and the Linear Covariant Gauge (LCG) scheme. These schemes are based on the concept of hidden local symmetry and linear covariance, respectively. These schemes are particularly useful in the study of QCD because they allow us to decouple the effects of heavy particles from the theory at low energies.

In conclusion, there are several mass independent schemes that are commonly used in quantum field theory, particularly in the study of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). These schemes are all based on the concept of renormalization and are particularly useful in decoupling the effects of heavy particles from the theory at low energies. The choice of which scheme to use depends on the specific application and the preferences of the researcher.


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the basics of effective field theories (EFTs) and their applications in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). We have learned that EFTs are powerful tools for studying complex systems, such as QCD, by breaking down the system into simpler, more manageable components. We have also seen how EFTs can be used to systematically expand the theory in terms of small parameters, allowing us to make predictions about the behavior of the system at different scales.

We began by introducing the concept of EFTs and discussing their advantages and limitations. We then delved into the mathematical formalism of EFTs, including the use of field operators, interaction terms, and renormalization. We also explored the concept of symmetry breaking and how it can be incorporated into EFTs. Finally, we discussed the application of EFTs in QCD, including the use of chiral perturbation theory and the Higgs mechanism.

Overall, this chapter has provided a solid foundation for understanding EFTs and their role in QCD. By breaking down complex systems into simpler components, EFTs allow us to make predictions about the behavior of the system at different scales. This is crucial in QCD, where the fundamental theory is non-renormalizable and cannot be used to make predictions at short distances. By using EFTs, we can bridge the gap between the fundamental theory and the observed phenomena, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying physics.

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of matching conditions in effective field theories. In this section, we will delve deeper into the topic and explore the different types of matching conditions that are commonly used in quantum field theory.

#### 2.5a Matching Conditions

Matching conditions are mathematical constraints that are used to relate the parameters of an effective field theory to the underlying theory. These conditions are necessary to ensure that the effective theory accurately describes the behavior of the system at low energies.

One of the most commonly used matching conditions is the On-Shell condition, which we discussed in the previous section. This condition relates the parameters of the effective theory to the physical masses and couplings of the underlying theory.

Another important matching condition is the Renormalization Group (RG) condition. This condition is used to relate the parameters of the effective theory to the parameters of the underlying theory at different energy scales. The RG condition is particularly useful in quantum field theory, as it allows us to study the behavior of the theory at different energy scales.

Other types of matching conditions include the Minimal Subtraction (MS) condition, the Dimensional Regularization (DR) condition, the Hidden Local Symmetry (HLS) condition, and the Linear Covariant Gauge (LCG) condition. These conditions are all based on different mathematical techniques and are used to relate the parameters of the effective theory to the parameters of the underlying theory.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of running and how it relates to matching conditions in effective field theories.

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we discussed the basics of effective field theories (EFTs) and their applications in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). We learned that EFTs are powerful tools for studying complex systems, such as QCD, by breaking down the system into simpler, more manageable components. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic and explore the concept of symmetry in EFTs.

Symmetry plays a crucial role in the study of quantum systems, as it allows us to make predictions about the behavior of the system without having to consider every possible detail. In the context of EFTs, symmetry is used to constrain the form of the EFT Lagrangian, which is the fundamental equation that describes the behavior of the system. By imposing symmetry on the EFT Lagrangian, we can make predictions about the behavior of the system at different energy scales.

In this chapter, we will first discuss the concept of symmetry in general and its importance in quantum systems. We will then explore the different types of symmetry that are commonly used in EFTs, such as gauge symmetry, chiral symmetry, and flavor symmetry. We will also discuss how these symmetries are broken in QCD and how this affects the behavior of the system.

Finally, we will examine the role of symmetry in the construction of EFTs. We will learn how to identify the relevant symmetries of a system and how to use them to construct an EFT Lagrangian. We will also discuss the limitations of symmetry in EFTs and how to handle situations where symmetry is not enough to fully describe the behavior of a system.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of symmetry in effective field theories and its applications in quantum chromodynamics. You will also have the necessary tools to construct your own EFTs and make predictions about the behavior of complex systems. So let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of symmetry in EFTs.

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and its effective field theories. We have seen how these theories provide a powerful framework for understanding the behavior of particles at different energy scales. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the realm of effective field theories by focusing on massive particles.

Massive particles play a crucial role in QCD, particularly in the context of hadrons. Hadrons, which are particles composed of quarks and gluons, are massive particles that are fundamental to the structure of matter. Understanding the behavior of these particles is essential for a comprehensive understanding of QCD.

In this chapter, we will explore the effective field theories for massive particles in QCD. We will begin by discussing the basic concepts and principles of effective field theories, and then move on to more specific topics such as the effective field theory for hadrons. We will also discuss the applications of these theories in various areas of QCD, including the study of particle interactions and the prediction of particle properties.

As we delve into the world of massive particles, we will see how effective field theories provide a powerful tool for understanding the complex dynamics of QCD.

### Subsection: 3.1a Top Quark Mass Effects

The top quark, being the heaviest known fundamental particle, plays a crucial role in the dynamics of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Its mass is a key parameter that influences the behavior of the top quark and its interactions with other particles. In this section, we will explore the effects of the top quark mass on the effective field theories of QCD.

#### 3.1a.1 Top Quark Mass and the Standard Model

The Standard Model of particle physics, which is the current theoretical framework for understanding the fundamental particles and their interactions, predicts the mass of the top quark to be approximately 171 GeV. This prediction is based on the assumption that the top quark is a fundamental particle, with no additional internal structure or composition.

The top quark mass is a free parameter in the Standard Model, meaning it is not directly determined by the theory. Instead, it is determined experimentally, primarily through the study of top quark decays. The current experimental value for the top quark mass is 171.4 GeV, with a precision of about 0.5%.

#### 3.1a.2 Top Quark Mass and Effective Field Theories

The top quark mass has significant effects on the effective field theories of QCD. These theories are used to describe the behavior of particles at different energy scales, and the top quark mass is one of the key parameters that determines the behavior of these theories.

For example, the effective field theory for the top quark, known as the top quark effective theory, is used to describe the behavior of the top quark at high energy scales. This theory is based on the assumption that the top quark is a fundamental particle, with no additional internal structure or composition. The top quark mass is a key parameter in this theory, and changes in the top quark mass can significantly affect the predictions of the theory.

#### 3.1a.3 Top Quark Mass and the Higgs Boson

The top quark mass also plays a crucial role in the prediction of the Higgs boson mass in the Standard Model. The Higgs boson is a particle that is predicted by the Standard Model to mediate the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. The mass of the Higgs boson is directly related to the top quark mass, with a heavier top quark leading to a heavier Higgs boson.

The discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012 provided a direct measurement of its mass, which was found to be consistent with the predictions of the Standard Model. This confirmation of the Standard Model predictions is a significant achievement in particle physics, and it is largely due to the precise measurements of the top quark mass and its effects on the Higgs boson.

#### 3.1a.4 Top Quark Mass and Beyond the Standard Model

While the Standard Model has been remarkably successful in predicting the behavior of particles at the electroweak scale, it is not a complete theory of particle physics. There are many unanswered questions and mysteries in particle physics that the Standard Model cannot explain.

One of these mysteries is the origin of the top quark mass. The top quark mass is a key parameter in the Standard Model, but it is not directly determined by the theory. This has led to the development of various theories beyond the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry and composite Higgs models, which attempt to explain the origin of the top quark mass.

In these theories, the top quark mass is often related to other fundamental parameters of the theory, such as the Higgs boson mass or the scale of new physics. Changes in the top quark mass can therefore have significant effects on these theories, and understanding these effects is crucial for testing and refining these theories.

In conclusion, the top quark mass plays a crucial role in the effective field theories of QCD, the prediction of the Higgs boson mass, and the development of theories beyond the Standard Model. Its precise measurement and understanding are therefore essential for advancing our understanding of particle physics.

Their masses are key parameters that influence the behavior of these particles and their interactions with other particles. In this section, we will explore the effects of the W and Z boson masses on the effective field theories of QCD.

#### 3.1b.1 W and Z Boson Masses and the Standard Model

The Standard Model of particle physics predicts the masses of the W and Z bosons to be approximately 80 GeV and 91 GeV, respectively. These predictions are based on the assumption that the W and Z bosons are fundamental particles, with no additional internal structure or composition.

The masses of the W and Z bosons are free parameters in the Standard Model, meaning they are not directly determined by the theory. Instead, they are determined experimentally, primarily through the study of W and Z boson decays. The current experimental values for the W and Z boson masses are 80.379 ± 12 MeV and 91.1876 ± 0.0021 GeV, respectively.

#### 3.1b.2 W and Z Boson Masses and Effective Field Theories

The masses of the W and Z bosons have significant effects on the effective field theories of QCD. These theories are used to describe the behavior of particles at different energy scales, and the masses of the W and Z bosons are key parameters that determine the behavior of these theories.

The masses of the W and Z bosons also play a crucial role in the dynamics of the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson is responsible for giving mass to the W and Z bosons, and its mass is directly related to the masses of the W and Z bosons. Changes in the masses of the W and Z bosons can therefore have a significant impact on the behavior of the Higgs boson.

In addition, the masses of the W and Z bosons can also affect the stability of the Higgs potential. The Higgs potential is responsible for the mass of the Higgs boson, and it is sensitive to the masses of the W and Z bosons. Changes in the masses of the W and Z bosons can therefore affect the stability of the Higgs potential, and potentially lead to the discovery of new particles or phenomena.

In conclusion, the masses of the W and Z bosons play a crucial role in the dynamics of QCD and the Standard Model. Their effects on the effective field theories of QCD and the Higgs boson are significant and continue to be an active area of research in particle physics.




### Subsection: 3.1c Electroweak Precision Observables

The electroweak precision observables (EWPOs) are a set of experimental measurements that provide crucial tests of the Standard Model of particle physics. These observables are sensitive to the masses of the W and Z bosons, as well as other fundamental particles and interactions. In this section, we will explore the role of EWPOs in testing the Standard Model and their implications for effective field theories of QCD.

#### 3.1c.1 The Role of EWPOs in Testing the Standard Model

The Standard Model of particle physics is the most successful theory in the history of physics, having been tested to an extraordinary degree of precision. However, it is not a complete theory of nature, and there are many fundamental questions that it cannot answer. One of these questions is the origin of the masses of the W and Z bosons.

The masses of the W and Z bosons are key parameters in the Standard Model, and their values are not directly determined by the theory. Instead, they are determined experimentally, primarily through the study of W and Z boson decays. The electroweak precision observables provide a powerful tool for testing the Standard Model predictions of these masses, and for searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model.

#### 3.1c.2 EWPOs and Effective Field Theories

The electroweak precision observables also play a crucial role in the development and testing of effective field theories of QCD. These theories are used to describe the behavior of particles at different energy scales, and the masses of the W and Z bosons are key parameters that determine the behavior of these theories.

For example, the effective field theory for the W and Z bosons, known as the electroweak theory, is used to describe the behavior of these particles at high energy scales. This theory is based on the assumption that the W and Z bosons are fundamental particles, with no additional internal structure or composition. The masses of the W and Z bosons are key parameters in this theory, and changes in these masses can significantly affect the predictions of the theory.

#### 3.1c.3 EWPOs and the Higgs Boson

The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider was a major milestone in particle physics. The Higgs boson is the particle associated with the Higgs field, which is responsible for giving mass to fundamental particles. The mass of the Higgs boson is directly related to the masses of the W and Z bosons, and the discovery of the Higgs boson has provided a new avenue for testing the Standard Model and exploring the nature of particle mass.

The electroweak precision observables provide a powerful tool for studying the Higgs boson and its interactions with other particles. For example, the decay of the Higgs boson into W and Z bosons, known as the Higgs boson's "decay channel", is a key area of study. The rate at which the Higgs boson decays into W and Z bosons is predicted by the Standard Model, and any deviation from this prediction could provide evidence for new physics beyond the Standard Model.

In conclusion, the electroweak precision observables play a crucial role in testing the Standard Model and exploring the nature of particle mass. Their study will continue to be a key area of research in particle physics for years to come.




### Section: 3.2 Matching and Decoupling

In the previous section, we discussed the role of electroweak precision observables in testing the Standard Model and their implications for effective field theories of QCD. In this section, we will delve deeper into the topic of matching and decoupling, which is a crucial aspect of effective field theories.

#### 3.2a Matching Conditions for Massive Particles

Matching conditions are mathematical constraints that are used to ensure the consistency of an effective field theory. They are particularly important when dealing with massive particles, as the behavior of these particles can significantly affect the predictions of the theory.

The matching conditions for massive particles are typically derived from the requirement of continuity. This means that the effective field theory must be able to smoothly transition from the low energy regime, where the massive particles are integrated out, to the high energy regime, where these particles are treated as explicit degrees of freedom.

The matching conditions can be expressed in terms of the masses of the particles, as well as the couplings and other parameters of the theory. For example, in the case of the electroweak theory, the matching conditions can be used to relate the masses of the W and Z bosons to the couplings of the theory.

#### 3.2b Decoupling of Heavy Particles

Decoupling is another important aspect of effective field theories. It refers to the process by which the effects of heavy particles can be removed from the theory, while still preserving the predictions of the theory at lower energy scales.

In the context of the Standard Model, decoupling is used to remove the effects of the top quark and the Higgs boson from the theory. This is achieved by integrating out these particles from the theory, and then using the matching conditions to relate their effects to the remaining parameters of the theory.

The decoupling of heavy particles is a crucial aspect of effective field theories, as it allows us to simplify the theory and make predictions at lower energy scales. However, it is important to note that decoupling is not always possible, and in some cases, the effects of heavy particles can persist even at lower energy scales.

The decoupling of heavy particles in effective field theories is achieved through the use of the decoupling theorems, which provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the decoupling of heavy particles. These theorems are based on the concept of operator product expansion (OPE), which allows us to express the product of two operators in terms of a series of other operators.

The decoupling theorems provide a way to systematically remove the effects of heavy particles from the theory. This is achieved by considering the contributions of these particles to the OPE, and then using the decoupling conditions to relate these contributions to the remaining parameters of the theory.

The decoupling of heavy particles in effective field theories is crucial for several reasons. First, it allows us to simplify the theory by removing the effects of heavy particles, which can significantly complicate the predictions of the theory. Second, it allows us to make predictions at lower energy scales, where the effects of heavy particles are less significant. Finally, it provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for the decoupling of heavy particles, which is essential for the consistency of the theory.

#### 3.2b Decoupling of Massive Particles

Decoupling refers to the process by which the effects of massive particles can be removed from an effective field theory, while still preserving the predictions of the theory at lower energy scales. This is achieved by integrating out the massive particles from the theory, and then using the matching conditions to relate their effects to the remaining parameters of the theory.

#### 3.2c Heavy Particle Effective Field Theories

Heavy particles are particles with masses that are significantly larger than the masses of the other particles in the theory. Examples of heavy particles in the Standard Model include the top quark and the Higgs boson. These particles play a crucial role in the theory, but their effects can be complex and difficult to analyze.

To simplify the analysis, we can use effective field theories that describe the behavior of heavy particles. These theories are derived from the full theory by integrating out the heavy particles and using the matching conditions to relate their effects to the remaining parameters.

One of the most commonly used effective field theories for heavy particles is the Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET). This theory is used to describe the behavior of heavy quarks, such as the top quark, in the Standard Model. It is based on the assumption that the heavy quark is much heavier than the other particles in the theory, and therefore its behavior can be described by a simpler theory.

The HQET is particularly useful for analyzing the behavior of heavy quarks in the Standard Model. It allows us to simplify the theory and focus on the effects of the lighter particles, making it easier to analyze the behavior of the system.

Another important effective field theory for heavy particles is the Higgs Effective Theory (HET). This theory is used to describe the behavior of the Higgs boson in the Standard Model. It is based on the assumption that the Higgs boson is much heavier than the other particles in the theory, and therefore its behavior can be described by a simpler theory.

The HET is particularly useful for analyzing the behavior of the Higgs boson in the Standard Model. It allows us to simplify the theory and focus on the effects of the lighter particles, making it easier to analyze the behavior of the system.

In conclusion, effective field theories for heavy particles are powerful tools that allow us to simplify the analysis of complex systems. By integrating out the heavy particles and using the matching conditions, we can derive effective field theories that describe their behavior and make it easier to analyze the system. These theories are particularly useful in the context of the Standard Model, where the effects of heavy particles can be complex and difficult to analyze.





### Subsection: 3.3a Electroweak Symmetry Breaking

The electroweak symmetry breaking is a fundamental concept in the Standard Model of particle physics. It is responsible for the generation of masses for the W and Z bosons, as well as the fermions in the theory. This symmetry breaking is achieved through the Higgs mechanism, which involves the interaction of the Higgs field with the electroweak gauge fields.

The Higgs mechanism can be understood as a result of the Higgs field acquiring a non-zero vacuum expectation value. This expectation value breaks the electroweak symmetry, leading to the generation of masses for the W and Z bosons. The Higgs field also interacts with the fermions in the theory, leading to the generation of their masses.

The electroweak symmetry breaking can be described by the following Lagrangian:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_K + \mathcal{L}_N + \mathcal{L}_C + \mathcal{L}_H
$$

where $\mathcal{L}_K$ is the kinetic term, $\mathcal{L}_N$ is the neutral current component, $\mathcal{L}_C$ is the charged current component, and $\mathcal{L}_H$ is the Higgs potential. The Higgs potential is given by:

$$
\mathcal{L}_H = \frac{1}{2}\ (\partial^\mu\ H)(\partial_\mu\ H) - \frac{1}{2}\ m_H^2\ H^2 + \frac{\lambda}{4}\ H^4
$$

where $m_H$ is the mass of the Higgs boson, and $\lambda$ is the coupling constant of the Higgs potential. The Higgs potential is responsible for the generation of the Higgs boson mass, and it also plays a crucial role in the electroweak symmetry breaking.

The electroweak symmetry breaking has been experimentally verified through the discovery of the W and Z bosons, as well as the Higgs boson. The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider was a major milestone in particle physics, confirming the predictions of the Standard Model.

These forces are responsible for the interactions between particles, and they are described by the electroweak Hamiltonian. The electroweak Hamiltonian is given by:

$$
\mathcal{H}_{ew} = \mathcal{H}_K + \mathcal{H}_N + \mathcal{H}_C + \mathcal{H}_H
$$

where $\mathcal{H}_K$ is the kinetic term, $\mathcal{H}_N$ is the neutral current component, $\mathcal{H}_C$ is the charged current component, and $\mathcal{H}_H$ is the Higgs potential. The Higgs potential is responsible for the generation of the Higgs boson mass, and it also plays a crucial role in the electroweak symmetry breaking.

$$
\mathcal{H}_{ew} = \mathcal{H}_K + \mathcal{H}_N + \mathcal{H}_C + \mathcal{H}_H
$$

where $\mathcal{H}_K$ is the kinetic term, $\mathcal{H}_N$ is the neutral current component, $\mathcal{H}_C$ is the charged current component, and $\mathcal{H}_H$ is the Higgs potential. The Higgs potential is responsible for the generation of the Higgs boson mass, and it also plays a crucial role in the electroweak symmetry breaking.

### Subsection: 3.4a Flavor Changing Neutral Currents in the SM

Flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) are a class of interactions that change the flavor of a fermion without altering its electric charge. In the Standard Model (SM), these interactions are highly suppressed due to the GIM mechanism, but they can still occur at higher orders in perturbation theory. The study of FCNCs is crucial for understanding the behavior of massive particles in the SM and for testing the predictions of the theory.

#### 3.4a.1 FCNCs in the SM

The SM Lagrangian includes terms that allow for FCNCs, although these terms are highly suppressed by the GIM mechanism. For example, consider a toy model in which an undiscovered boson "S" may couple both to the electron as well as the tau via the term

$$
\mathcal{L} \supset \lambda_{e\tau} \bar{e} \tau S
$$

where $\lambda_{e\tau}$ is the coupling constant. Since the electron and the tau have equal charges, the electric charge of "S" clearly must vanish to respect the conservation of electric charge. A Feynman diagram with "S" as the intermediate particle is able to convert a tau into an electron (plus some neutral decay products of the "S").

The MEG experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute near Zurich will search for a similar process, in which an antimuon decays to a photon and an antielectron (a positron). In the SM, such a process proceeds only by emission and re-absorption of a charged <SubatomicParticle|W boson+>, which changes the <SubatomicParticle|muon+> into a neutrino on emission and then a positron on re-absorption, and finally emits a photon that carries away any difference in energy, spin, and momentum.

#### 3.4a.2 Effective Hamiltonian for FCNCs

The effective Hamiltonian for FCNCs is a crucial component of the study of these interactions. It is a mathematical expression that describes the behavior of massive particles in the presence of FCNCs. The effective Hamiltonian is derived from the SM Lagrangian, and it is used to calculate the rates of various FCNC processes.

The effective Hamiltonian for FCNCs can be written as:

$$
\mathcal{H}_{\text{eff}} = \frac{g^2}{4} \left( W^+_\mu W^{-\mu} + \frac{1}{2} Z_\mu Z^\mu \right)
$$

where $g$ is the coupling constant, $W^\pm$ are the W bosons, and $Z$ is the Z boson. This Hamiltonian describes the interactions between the W and Z bosons and the massive particles in the theory.

The effective Hamiltonian is used to calculate the rates of various FCNC processes, such as the decay of the W boson into a massive particle and a neutrino, and the scattering of massive particles off of each other. These calculations are crucial for testing the predictions of the SM and for understanding the behavior of massive particles in the presence of FCNCs.




### Subsection: 3.4b FCNCs in EFT

In the previous section, we discussed the Standard Model (SM) and its predictions for flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs). However, the SM is not the only theory that can describe the behavior of massive particles. Effective Field Theories (EFTs) provide a powerful framework for studying the behavior of massive particles, including FCNCs.

#### 3.4b.1 Effective Hamiltonian for FCNCs in EFT

The effective Hamiltonian for FCNCs in EFT is derived from the SM Lagrangian, but it is modified to account for the effects of new physics beyond the SM. This is achieved by introducing new operators that describe the interactions of massive particles with the new physics. The effective Hamiltonian is then used to calculate the rates for FCNC processes, such as the decay of a tau into an electron.

The effective Hamiltonian for FCNCs in EFT can be written as:

$$
\mathcal{H}_{eff} = \mathcal{H}_{SM} + \mathcal{H}_{NP}
$$

where $\mathcal{H}_{SM}$ is the SM Hamiltonian and $\mathcal{H}_{NP}$ is the Hamiltonian for new physics. The new physics Hamiltonian is typically written as a series of operators, each of which describes a different type of interaction. For example, the operator $\mathcal{O}_{e\tau}$ describes the interaction of the electron and the tau with the new physics:

$$
\mathcal{H}_{NP} = \frac{1}{\Lambda^2} \bar{e} \tau \mathcal{O}_{e\tau}
$$

where $\Lambda$ is the scale of the new physics, and $\mathcal{O}_{e\tau}$ is a dimension-6 operator.

#### 3.4b.2 FCNCs in EFT

In EFT, FCNCs are typically studied by considering the effects of the new physics operators on the rates for FCNC processes. For example, the decay of a tau into an electron can be studied by considering the effects of the operator $\mathcal{O}_{e\tau}$ on the decay rate. This can be done by calculating the matrix element of the operator between the initial and final states, and then squaring the result to obtain the decay rate.

The effective Hamiltonian for FCNCs in EFT provides a powerful tool for studying the behavior of massive particles. By including the effects of new physics, it allows us to make predictions for FCNC processes that go beyond the predictions of the SM. This is crucial for testing the predictions of the theory and for understanding the behavior of massive particles in the presence of new physics.




#### 3.4c Rare B and K Decays

In the previous section, we discussed the effective Hamiltonian for FCNCs in EFT and how it can be used to study the decay of a tau into an electron. In this section, we will focus on another important FCNC process: the rare decays of B and K mesons.

#### 3.4c.1 Rare Decays of B and K Mesons

The rare decays of B and K mesons are of particular interest because they provide a unique opportunity to study the effects of new physics beyond the SM. These decays are highly suppressed in the SM, and therefore any deviations from the SM predictions can be interpreted as evidence for new physics.

One of the most well-known rare decays of B mesons is the decay of a B meson into a K meson and two neutrinos, denoted as $B \rightarrow K \nu \nu$. This decay is highly suppressed in the SM, and therefore any observation of this decay would be a clear signal of new physics.

Similarly, the rare decays of K mesons, such as the decay of a K meson into a pion and two neutrinos, denoted as $K \rightarrow \pi \nu \nu$, are also highly suppressed in the SM. These decays can provide valuable information about the nature of new physics beyond the SM.

#### 3.4c.2 Effective Hamiltonian for Rare B and K Decays in EFT

The effective Hamiltonian for rare B and K decays in EFT is derived in a similar way as the effective Hamiltonian for FCNCs in general. It is derived from the SM Lagrangian, but it is modified to account for the effects of new physics beyond the SM. This is achieved by introducing new operators that describe the interactions of the B and K mesons with the new physics.

The effective Hamiltonian for rare B and K decays in EFT can be written as:

$$
\mathcal{H}_{eff} = \mathcal{H}_{SM} + \mathcal{H}_{NP}
$$

where $\mathcal{H}_{SM}$ is the SM Hamiltonian and $\mathcal{H}_{NP}$ is the Hamiltonian for new physics. The new physics Hamiltonian is typically written as a series of operators, each of which describes a different type of interaction. For example, the operator $\mathcal{O}_{B \rightarrow K \nu \nu}$ describes the interaction of the B meson and the K meson with the new physics:

$$
\mathcal{H}_{NP} = \frac{1}{\Lambda^2} \bar{B} K \mathcal{O}_{B \rightarrow K \nu \nu}
$$

where $\Lambda$ is the scale of the new physics, and $\mathcal{O}_{B \rightarrow K \nu \nu}$ is a dimension-6 operator.

#### 3.4c.3 FCNCs in EFT

In EFT, FCNCs are typically studied by considering the effects of the new physics operators on the rates for FCNC processes. For example, the decay of a B meson into a K meson and two neutrinos can be studied by considering the effects of the operator $\mathcal{O}_{B \rightarrow K \nu \nu}$ on the decay rate. This can be done by calculating the matrix element of the operator between the initial and final states, and then squaring the result to obtain the decay rate.

Similarly, the decay of a K meson into a pion and two neutrinos can be studied by considering the effects of the operator $\mathcal{O}_{K \rightarrow \pi \nu \nu}$ on the decay rate. This can be done in a similar way as for the decay of a B meson into a K meson and two neutrinos.

In conclusion, the study of rare B and K decays in EFT provides a powerful tool for exploring the effects of new physics beyond the SM. By considering the effects of new physics operators on the rates for these decays, we can gain valuable insights into the nature of new physics and its impact on the behavior of massive particles.





#### 3.5a Effective Field Theory for the Higgs Boson

The Higgs boson, discovered in 2012, is a fundamental particle in the Standard Model of particle physics.

The Higgs boson is described by the following Lagrangian:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \phi) (\partial^\mu \phi^*) - \frac{1}{2} m^2 \phi \phi^* - \frac{\lambda}{4!} (\phi \phi^*)^2
$$

### Introduction

Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) is a powerful tool in the study of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). It is a low-energy effective field theory that describes the behavior of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons. In this chapter, we will delve into the intricacies of ChPT, exploring its fundamental principles, applications, and limitations.

ChPT is particularly useful in the study of QCD due to its ability to capture the dynamics of the theory at low energies, where the effects of the strong interaction are most pronounced. This is achieved by systematically expanding the theory in terms of the small parameter $p/\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$, where $p$ is the typical momentum of the particles involved and $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$ is the QCD scale parameter.

The theory is constructed by considering the symmetries of QCD, particularly the chiral symmetry, which is a fundamental symmetry of the theory. This symmetry is broken by the strong interaction, leading to the generation of the pion, the lightest particle in the theory. ChPT provides a systematic way to study the effects of this symmetry breaking, leading to predictions for the behavior of the theory at low energies.

In this chapter, we will explore the construction of ChPT, starting from the basic principles and gradually building up to more complex calculations. We will also discuss the applications of ChPT in various areas of QCD, including the study of the pion, the nucleon, and the chiral phase transition. We will also touch upon the limitations of the theory, such as its inability to describe high-energy phenomena.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of ChPT and its role in the study of QCD. They should also be able to apply the principles of ChPT to perform calculations in various areas of QCD. This chapter serves as a comprehensive guide to ChPT, providing readers with the necessary tools to explore this fascinating area of research.




### Subsection: 4.1a Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking

Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics and field theory. It is a phenomenon where a system exhibits a symmetry that is not manifest in its ground state. This is often due to the presence of a potential energy barrier that prevents the system from reaching a state of perfect symmetry. In the context of quantum mechanics, this can be seen in the behavior of the wave function, which can exhibit a phase shift that is not accounted for by the symmetry of the system.

In the context of Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT), spontaneous symmetry breaking plays a crucial role. The theory is constructed based on the chiral symmetry of the strong interaction, which is a symmetry of the theory that is broken by the strong interaction. This symmetry breaking leads to the generation of the pion, the lightest particle in the theory.

The chiral symmetry of the strong interaction can be understood in terms of the left and right chiral transformations. These transformations act on the quark fields, transforming them from one chiral representation to another. The chiral symmetry of the theory is then broken by the strong interaction, leading to the generation of the pion.

The pion is a Goldstone boson, a particle that arises due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the chiral symmetry. The Goldstone boson is a key prediction of ChPT, and its existence has been confirmed by numerous experiments. The pion is the lightest Goldstone boson, and its properties can be studied using ChPT.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the construction of ChPT, exploring the principles and techniques used to study the effects of the strong interaction at low energies. We will also discuss the applications of ChPT in various areas of QCD, including the study of the pion, the nucleon, and the chiral phase transition.




### Subsection: 4.1b Chiral Effective Field Theory

Chiral Effective Field Theory (ChEFT) is a powerful tool in the study of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at low energies. It is a low-energy effective field theory that is derived from the underlying theory of QCD. ChEFT is particularly useful in the study of the strong interaction, where it allows us to systematically study the effects of the strong interaction at low energies.

#### 4.1b.1 Construction of ChEFT

The construction of ChEFT begins with the assumption of the chiral symmetry of the strong interaction. This symmetry is broken by the strong interaction, leading to the generation of the pion, the lightest particle in the theory. The chiral symmetry of the theory is then broken by the strong interaction, leading to the generation of the pion.

The chiral symmetry of the theory is broken by the strong interaction, leading to the generation of the pion. This is a key prediction of ChEFT, and its existence has been confirmed by numerous experiments. The pion is a Goldstone boson, a particle that arises due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the chiral symmetry.

The pion is the lightest Goldstone boson, and its properties can be studied using ChEFT. The pion is a key particle in the study of ChEFT, as it is the only particle that is not excluded from the theory. This is due to the fact that the pion is the only particle that is not excluded from the theory.

#### 4.1b.2 Applications of ChEFT

ChEFT has a wide range of applications in the study of QCD. It is particularly useful in the study of the strong interaction, where it allows us to systematically study the effects of the strong interaction at low energies. ChEFT is also used in the study of the pion, the nucleon, and the chiral phase transition.

In the study of the pion, ChEFT is used to study the properties of the pion, including its mass, decay constant, and coupling constants. In the study of the nucleon, ChEFT is used to study the properties of the nucleon, including its mass, decay constant, and coupling constants. In the study of the chiral phase transition, ChEFT is used to study the properties of the chiral phase transition, including its critical temperature and critical density.

#### 4.1b.3 Future Directions

The future of ChEFT looks promising, with many potential applications in the study of QCD. One of the most promising directions is the study of the chiral phase transition, which is a key aspect of the study of QCD. The study of the chiral phase transition using ChEFT could provide valuable insights into the behavior of QCD at low energies.

Another promising direction is the study of the pion, the nucleon, and the chiral phase transition using ChEFT. This could provide valuable insights into the behavior of these particles and phenomena at low energies. The study of these particles and phenomena using ChEFT could also provide valuable insights into the behavior of QCD at low energies.

In conclusion, ChEFT is a powerful tool in the study of QCD at low energies. It allows us to systematically study the effects of the strong interaction at low energies, and has a wide range of applications in the study of QCD. The future of ChEFT looks promising, with many potential applications in the study of QCD.

### Subsection: 4.2a Pion-Pion Scattering

Pion-pion scattering is a fundamental process in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong nuclear force. It is a key process in the study of the strong interaction between particles, and it is of particular interest due to its relevance to the study of the pion, the lightest meson.

#### 4.2a.1 Pion-Pion Scattering in Chiral Perturbation Theory

Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) is a powerful tool for studying pion-pion scattering. It is an effective field theory that describes the low-energy behavior of QCD, and it is particularly well-suited to studying processes involving pions due to the chiral symmetry of QCD.

The leading-order term in the ChPT expansion for pion-pion scattering is given by the tree-level diagrams. These diagrams involve the exchange of a single pion, and they are represented by the Feynman diagrams shown below.

## Chapter: Effective Field Theory of QCD

### Introduction

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the fundamental theory that describes the strong interaction between quarks and gluons, the building blocks of matter. However, the complexity of QCD makes it challenging to study and understand. Effective Field Theory (EFT) is a powerful tool that simplifies the study of QCD by focusing on the low-energy phenomena where the effects of high-energy degrees of freedom can be neglected.

In this chapter, we will delve into the Effective Field Theory of QCD, exploring its principles, applications, and implications. We will begin by introducing the concept of EFT and its role in QCD. We will then discuss the construction of the effective Lagrangian, a key component of EFT, which encapsulates the dynamics of the system at low energies. 

We will also explore the power counting scheme used in EFT, which allows us to systematically organize the terms in the effective Lagrangian according to their importance. This is crucial in managing the complexity of QCD and ensuring the validity of the EFT.

Furthermore, we will discuss the symmetry properties of the effective Lagrangian and how they are used to constrain the form of the theory. This includes the use of chiral symmetry, which is a fundamental symmetry of QCD that plays a crucial role in the low-energy behavior of the theory.

Finally, we will discuss some of the applications of EFT in QCD, including the study of pion dynamics, the behavior of heavy quarks, and the properties of the QCD vacuum. We will also touch upon the challenges and future directions of EFT in QCD.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the Effective Field Theory of QCD and its importance in the study of the strong interaction. You will also be equipped with the necessary tools to apply these concepts to your own research or studies in quantum physics.




#### 4.3a Spontaneous Chiral Symmetry Breaking

Spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is a fundamental concept in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the quantum field theory describing the strong interactions of quarks and gluons. It is responsible for the low-energy behavior of the pion, the lightest particle in the hadron spectrum.

##### 4.3a.1 Chiral Symmetry

Chiral symmetry is a fundamental symmetry of the strong interaction. It is a symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian, which describes the dynamics of the quark and gluon fields. The symmetry is broken at the level of the QCD vacuum, leading to the emergence of the pion as the lightest particle.

The chiral symmetry of QCD is a global symmetry, meaning it acts on the entire field. It is generated by the vector current $V_\mu(x)$, which is defined as:

$$
V_\mu(x) = \bar{\psi}(x) \gamma_\mu \psi(x)
$$

where $\psi(x)$ is the quark field and $\bar{\psi}(x)$ is the antiquark field. The symmetry is broken when the QCD vacuum state is not invariant under the chiral transformations.

##### 4.3a.2 Spontaneous Chiral Symmetry Breaking

Spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking occurs when the QCD vacuum state is not invariant under the chiral transformations. This means that the QCD vacuum state is not a state of definite chirality, but rather a superposition of states of different chiralities. This leads to the emergence of the pion as the lightest particle.

The pion is a pseudo-Goldstone boson, which means it is a particle that arises from the spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry. The pion is light because it is protected by the chiral symmetry of QCD. This is known as the Goldstone theorem.

##### 4.3a.3 Chiral Perturbation Theory

Chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) is a systematic expansion of the low-energy behavior of the pion in terms of the pion mass and the coupling constant of the strong interaction. It is based on the principles of chiral symmetry and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking.

The chiral expansion is organized in powers of the pion mass and the coupling constant, and it provides a systematic way to calculate the properties of the pion at low energies. The leading order term is proportional to the pion mass, and subleading terms provide corrections to this term.

ChPT provides a set of predictions for the properties of the pion at low energies. These predictions are tested against experimental data, and they are in excellent agreement. This provides a strong confirmation of the theory.

#### 4.3b Explicit Chiral Symmetry Breaking

Explicit chiral symmetry breaking is another important concept in quantum chromodynamics. Unlike spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, which occurs at the level of the QCD vacuum, explicit chiral symmetry breaking occurs in the QCD Lagrangian itself.

##### 4.3b.1 Explicit Chiral Symmetry Breaking in the QCD Lagrangian

The QCD Lagrangian is given by:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu - m)\psi
$$

where $\psi$ is the quark field, $D_\mu$ is the covariant derivative, and $m$ is the quark mass. The term $m\psi\bar{\psi}$ explicitly breaks the chiral symmetry of the theory. This is because the chiral symmetry transformation $\psi \rightarrow e^{i\gamma_5\alpha}\psi$ is not implemented by the mass term.

##### 4.3b.2 Explicit Chiral Symmetry Breaking and the Pion

The pion is the lightest particle in the hadron spectrum. Its existence is a direct consequence of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. However, the pion also experiences explicit chiral symmetry breaking due to the quark mass term in the QCD Lagrangian.

The pion mass is given by the Goldstone theorem:

$$
m_\pi^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_q
$$

where $m_q$ is the quark mass. This equation shows that the pion mass is proportional to the quark mass. This is a direct consequence of the explicit chiral symmetry breaking in the QCD Lagrangian.

##### 4.3b.3 Explicit Chiral Symmetry Breaking and Chiral Perturbation Theory

Chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) is a systematic expansion of the low-energy behavior of the pion in terms of the pion mass and the coupling constant of the strong interaction. It is based on the principles of chiral symmetry and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking.

The explicit chiral symmetry breaking in the QCD Lagrangian leads to a modification of the ChPT expansion. The leading order term is no longer proportional to the pion mass, but includes a term proportional to the quark mass. This term provides a correction to the leading order term, and it is crucial for accurately describing the behavior of the pion at low energies.

In conclusion, explicit chiral symmetry breaking is a fundamental concept in quantum chromodynamics. It occurs in the QCD Lagrangian and leads to a modification of the ChPT expansion. Understanding explicit chiral symmetry breaking is crucial for understanding the behavior of the pion at low energies.

##### 4.3c.1 Chiral Symmetry Breaking and the Pion Mass

The pion mass is given by the Goldstone theorem:

$$
m_\pi^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_q
$$

where $m_q$ is the quark mass. This equation shows that the pion mass is proportional to the quark mass. This is a direct consequence of the explicit chiral symmetry breaking in the QCD Lagrangian.

The pion mass is also related to the pion decay constant $f_\pi$, which is a measure of the pion's strength as a source of chiral symmetry breaking. The relationship between the pion mass and the pion decay constant is given by:

$$
m_\pi^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_q = \frac{1}{2}f_\pi^2
$$

This equation shows that the pion mass is inversely proportional to the square of the pion decay constant. This relationship is crucial in understanding the dynamics of the pion in QCD.

##### 4.3c.2 Chiral Symmetry Breaking and the Pion Decay Constant

The pion decay constant $f_\pi$ is a measure of the pion's strength as a source of chiral symmetry breaking. It is defined as the coupling constant of the pion to the axial current, which is a measure of the pion's chiral charge.

The pion decay constant is related to the pion mass and the quark mass by the Goldstone theorem. This relationship is given by:

$$
f_\pi^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_q
$$

This equation shows that the pion decay constant is proportional to the square root of the quark mass. This relationship is crucial in understanding the dynamics of the pion in QCD.

##### 4.3c.3 Chiral Symmetry Breaking and Chiral Perturbation Theory

Chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) is a systematic expansion of the low-energy behavior of the pion in terms of the pion mass and the coupling constant of the strong interaction. It is based on the principles of chiral symmetry and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking.

In conclusion, the pion plays a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of quantum chromodynamics. Its existence is a direct consequence of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in QCD, and it experiences explicit chiral symmetry breaking due to the quark mass term in the QCD Lagrangian.

$$

This equation shows that the pion mass is inversely proportional to the square of the pion decay constant. This relationship is crucial in understanding the dynamics of the pion in QCD.

#### 4.4b Chiral Symmetry Breaking and the Pion Decay Constant

The pion decay constant $f_\pi$ is a measure of the pion's strength as a source of chiral symmetry breaking. It is defined as the coupling constant of the pion to the axial current, which is a measure of the pion's chiral charge.

The pion decay constant is related to the pion mass and the quark mass by the Goldstone theorem. This relationship is given by:

$$

$$

where $m_q$ is the quark mass. This equation shows that the pion mass is proportional to the quark mass. This is a direct consequence of the explicit chiral symmetry breaking in the QCD Lagrangian.

The pion decay constant $f_\pi$ is also related to the pion mass and the quark mass by the Goldstone theorem. This relationship is given by:

$$
f_\pi^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_q
$$

This equation shows that the pion decay constant is inversely proportional to the square of the pion mass. This relationship is crucial in understanding the dynamics of the pion in QCD.

### 4.4c Chiral Symmetry Breaking and Chiral Perturbation Theory

Chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) is a powerful tool for studying the low-energy behavior of the pion in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). It is based on the principles of chiral symmetry and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. The theory is an expansion in powers of the pion mass, and it is used to calculate the properties of the pion at low energies.

The leading term in ChPT is proportional to the pion mass. This term provides a description of the pion at leading order in the chiral expansion. However, the pion also experiences explicit chiral symmetry breaking due to the quark mass term in the QCD Lagrangian. This leads to a modification of the ChPT expansion.

The explicit chiral symmetry breaking in the QCD Lagrangian leads to a correction term in the ChPT expansion. This term is proportional to the quark mass, and it provides a correction to the leading order term. The correction term is crucial for accurately describing the behavior of the pion at low energies.

The explicit chiral symmetry breaking in the QCD Lagrangian also leads to a modification of the Goldstone theorem. The Goldstone theorem states that the pion mass is proportional to the quark mass. However, the correction term in the ChPT expansion leads to a modification of this relationship.

The modified Goldstone theorem is given by:

$$
m_\pi^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_q + \frac{1}{2}f_\pi^2
$$

where $f_\pi$ is the pion decay constant. This equation shows that the pion mass is proportional to the quark mass, plus a term proportional to the square of the pion decay constant. This relationship is crucial in understanding the dynamics of the pion in QCD.

The modified Goldstone theorem also leads to a modification of the relationship between the pion mass and the pion decay constant. The relationship is given by:

$$
f_\pi^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_q + \frac{1}{2}m_\pi^2
$$

This equation shows that the pion decay constant is proportional to the square root of the pion mass, plus a term proportional to the square root of the quark mass. This relationship is crucial in understanding the dynamics of the pion in QCD.

The modified Goldstone theorem and the relationship between the pion mass and the pion decay constant are crucial for accurately describing the behavior of the pion at low energies. They provide a deeper understanding of the dynamics of the pion in QCD, and they are essential for the study of chiral symmetry breaking in QCD.

## Chapter: Chapter 5: Effective Field Theory

### Introduction

In the realm of quantum physics, the concept of effective field theory (EFT) plays a pivotal role. This chapter, "Effective Field Theory," aims to delve into the intricacies of this theory, its applications, and its significance in the broader context of quantum physics.

Effective field theory is a theoretical framework that allows us to describe the behavior of a system at a certain energy scale, by considering the effects of the degrees of freedom at higher energy scales as modifications of the laws of physics at the lower scale. It is a powerful tool that allows us to simplify complex systems and make predictions about their behavior.

In the context of quantum physics, effective field theory is particularly useful. It allows us to describe the behavior of quantum systems in a way that is both mathematically tractable and physically meaningful. This is achieved by focusing on the low-energy behavior of the system, while neglecting the details of the high-energy behavior. This is often justified by the assumption that the high-energy degrees of freedom are not directly observable at the lower energy scale.

This chapter will guide you through the fundamental concepts of effective field theory, including its mathematical formulation and its physical interpretation. We will explore how effective field theory is used in quantum physics, with a particular focus on quantum chromodynamics. We will also discuss the limitations and potential pitfalls of effective field theory, and how these can be navigated.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of effective field theory and its role in quantum physics. You should be able to apply this knowledge to the study of quantum systems, and to understand and interpret the results of effective field theory calculations.

Remember, effective field theory is a powerful tool, but like any tool, it must be used wisely. With a solid understanding of its principles and applications, you will be well-equipped to explore the fascinating world of quantum physics.




#### 4.3b Chiral Condensate and Quark Masses

The chiral condensate is a key concept in chiral perturbation theory. It is a measure of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in the QCD vacuum. The chiral condensate is defined as the expectation value of the quark field in the QCD vacuum:

$$
\langle \bar{\psi}(x) \psi(x) \rangle = \langle \bar{q}(x) q(x) \rangle
$$

where $\bar{\psi}(x)$ and $\psi(x)$ are the antiquark and quark fields, respectively, and $q(x)$ is the quark field. The chiral condensate is a complex quantity, and its absolute value squared gives the density of quark-antiquark pairs in the QCD vacuum.

The chiral condensate plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the pion. It is responsible for the mass of the pion, which is given by the Goldstone theorem:

$$
m_{\pi} = \frac{f_{\pi}}{2} m_{\pi}
$$

where $f_{\pi}$ is the pion decay constant and $m_{\pi}$ is the pion mass. The pion decay constant is related to the chiral condensate by the following equation:

$$
f_{\pi} = \frac{\langle \bar{\psi}(x) \psi(x) \rangle}{\sqrt{2} m_{\pi}}
$$

This equation shows that the pion decay constant is proportional to the chiral condensate. Therefore, the chiral condensate is responsible for the mass of the pion.

The chiral condensate also plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the quark masses. The quark masses are generated by the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. The quark masses are related to the chiral condensate by the following equation:

$$
m_{q} = \frac{\langle \bar{\psi}(x) \psi(x) \rangle}{f_{\pi}}
$$

This equation shows that the quark masses are inversely proportional to the pion decay constant. Therefore, the chiral condensate is responsible for the generation of the quark masses.

In conclusion, the chiral condensate plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the pion and the quark masses. It is a key concept in chiral perturbation theory and provides a deeper understanding of the low-energy behavior of the pion.

#### 4.3c Chiral Symmetry Restoration

Chiral symmetry restoration is a phenomenon that occurs at high temperatures or densities in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). It is the process by which the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, which occurs in the QCD vacuum, is reversed. This process is expected to occur at temperatures above the critical temperature $T_c$ or at densities above the critical density $\rho_c$.

The restoration of chiral symmetry is a key prediction of chiral perturbation theory. It is expected to lead to a significant change in the properties of the pion and the quark masses. In particular, the pion mass is expected to decrease and the quark masses are expected to increase.

The restoration of chiral symmetry can be understood in terms of the chiral condensate. As the temperature or density increases, the chiral condensate decreases, leading to a decrease in the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. This process is expected to continue until the chiral condensate becomes zero, at which point the chiral symmetry is fully restored.

The restoration of chiral symmetry has important implications for the behavior of the pion and the quark masses. As the chiral symmetry is restored, the pion mass is expected to decrease. This is because the pion mass is proportional to the chiral condensate, as shown by the Goldstone theorem:

$$
m_{\pi} = \frac{f_{\pi}}{2} m_{\pi}
$$

As the chiral condensate decreases, the pion mass is expected to decrease. Similarly, the quark masses are expected to increase as the chiral symmetry is restored. This is because the quark masses are inversely proportional to the chiral condensate, as shown by the equation:

$$
m_{q} = \frac{\langle \bar{\psi}(x) \psi(x) \rangle}{f_{\pi}}
$$

As the chiral condensate decreases, the quark masses are expected to increase.

In conclusion, the restoration of chiral symmetry is a key prediction of chiral perturbation theory. It is expected to lead to significant changes in the properties of the pion and the quark masses. Further research is needed to confirm these predictions and to understand the details of the chiral symmetry restoration process.

## Chapter: Effective Field Theory of Heavy Quarks

### Introduction

The study of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong nuclear force, is a complex and fascinating field. One of the most intriguing aspects of QCD is the behavior of heavy quarks, such as charm and bottom quarks. These quarks are significantly heavier than the up and down quarks that make up the majority of matter, and their behavior is governed by a different set of rules than the lighter quarks.

In this chapter, we will delve into the effective field theory of heavy quarks, a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of these particles. This theory is based on the concept of effective field theory, a method of simplifying complex systems by focusing on the most relevant degrees of freedom. In the case of heavy quarks, this means that we can ignore the details of the strong interactions between the heavy quark and the light quarks and gluons that make up the rest of the system.

We will begin by introducing the basic concepts of effective field theory, including the idea of symmetry breaking and the role of the Higgs field. We will then move on to discuss the specifics of the effective field theory of heavy quarks, including the derivation of the effective Lagrangian and the prediction of the heavy quark mass.

Throughout this chapter, we will use the mathematical language of quantum mechanics and field theory, including the use of differential equations and operator notation. For example, we might write the equation of motion for a heavy quark as `$\Delta w = ...$`, where `$\Delta w$` is the change in the quark's position and the dots represent terms that we will derive in the course of the chapter.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the effective field theory of heavy quarks and its applications in quantum chromodynamics. This knowledge will provide a foundation for further exploration of the fascinating world of QCD.




#### 4.3c Chiral Effective Potential

The chiral effective potential is a key concept in chiral perturbation theory. It is a potential energy that describes the interaction between quarks and antiquarks in the QCD vacuum. The chiral effective potential is defined as the sum of the one-gluon-exchange potential and the two-gluon-exchange potential:

$$
V_{\text{eff}}(r) = V_1(r) + V_2(r)
$$

where $V_1(r)$ and $V_2(r)$ are the one-gluon-exchange potential and the two-gluon-exchange potential, respectively. The one-gluon-exchange potential is given by the Coulomb potential:

$$
V_1(r) = \frac{1}{4} \alpha_s \frac{1}{r} e^{-mr}
$$

where $\alpha_s$ is the strong coupling constant and $m$ is the mass of the gluon. The two-gluon-exchange potential is given by the Yukawa potential:

$$
V_2(r) = \frac{1}{4} \alpha_s \frac{1}{r} e^{-mr}
$$

The chiral effective potential plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the pion. It is responsible for the mass of the pion, which is given by the Goldstone theorem:

$$
m_{\pi} = \frac{f_{\pi}}{2} m_{\pi}
$$

where $f_{\pi}$ is the pion decay constant and $m_{\pi}$ is the pion mass. The pion decay constant is related to the chiral effective potential by the following equation:

$$
f_{\pi} = \frac{\langle \bar{\psi}(x) \psi(x) \rangle}{\sqrt{2} m_{\pi}}
$$

This equation shows that the pion decay constant is proportional to the chiral effective potential. Therefore, the chiral effective potential is responsible for the mass of the pion.

The chiral effective potential also plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the quark masses. The quark masses are generated by the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. The quark masses are related to the chiral effective potential by the following equation:

$$
m_{q} = \frac{\langle \bar{\psi}(x) \psi(x) \rangle}{f_{\pi}}
$$

This equation shows that the quark masses are inversely proportional to the pion decay constant. Therefore, the chiral effective potential is responsible for the generation of the quark masses.

In conclusion, the chiral effective potential plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the pion and the quark masses. It is a key concept in chiral perturbation theory and provides a deeper understanding of the low-energy behavior of the pion.

## Chapter: Effective Field Theories of QCD

### Introduction

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the fundamental theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons, the building blocks of matter. However, the complexity of QCD makes it challenging to study and understand. Effective Field Theories (EFTs) provide a powerful tool to simplify the study of QCD, by focusing on specific aspects of the theory and neglecting others. In this chapter, we will delve into the effective field theories of QCD, exploring their principles, applications, and limitations.

Effective field theories are mathematical models that describe the behavior of a system at a certain scale, neglecting details that are not relevant at that scale. In the context of QCD, effective field theories are used to study the behavior of quarks and gluons at different energy scales. This is particularly useful in high-energy physics, where the interactions between quarks and gluons are often too complex to be studied directly.

The chapter will begin by introducing the concept of effective field theories and their role in QCD. We will then explore the different types of effective field theories used in QCD, including the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, the linear sigma model, and the Skyrme model. Each of these models will be discussed in detail, including their assumptions, predictions, and limitations.

We will also discuss the process of deriving effective field theories from the underlying theory, in this case, QCD. This involves integrating out the degrees of freedom that are not relevant at the scale of interest, resulting in a simplified model that captures the essential dynamics of the system.

Finally, we will discuss the applications of effective field theories in QCD, including their use in studying the properties of hadrons, the dynamics of phase transitions, and the behavior of QCD at high temperatures and densities.

In summary, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the effective field theories of QCD, equipping readers with the knowledge and tools to understand and apply these theories in their own research.




#### 4.4a Power Counting in Chiral Perturbation Theory

Power counting is a crucial aspect of chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). It allows us to systematically organize the terms in the Lagrangian and determine which terms are most important at a given energy scale. This is achieved by assigning a power to each term in the Lagrangian, based on the momentum of the fields involved.

The most commonly used power counting scheme in ChPT is the $p$-expansion, where $p$ stands for momentum. In this scheme, the power of a term is determined by the number of derivatives and the number of fields involved. For example, a term with $n$ derivatives and $m$ fields has a power of $p^n m$.

The $p$-expansion is valid in infinite volume, but it is not always valid in finite volume. In particular, it is not valid in the chiral limit, where the quark masses go to zero. In these cases, other power counting schemes, such as the $\epsilon$, $\delta$, and $\epsilon^{\prime}$ expansions, may be more appropriate.

In addition to the power counting scheme, we also need to consider the coupling constants in the Lagrangian. These constants represent the relative strengths of the interactions represented by each term. They are usually unknown and need to be determined by fitting to experimental data or by using underlying theory.

The model Lagrangian of ChPT is constructed by writing down all interactions that are not excluded by the symmetries of the underlying theory. This includes the one-gluon-exchange potential and the two-gluon-exchange potential, which are represented by the chiral effective potential. The chiral effective potential plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the pion and the quark masses.

In the next section, we will discuss the specific terms in the model Lagrangian and their corresponding powers. We will also discuss how these terms contribute to the dynamics of the pion and the quark masses.

#### 4.4b Chiral Power Counting in QCD

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of power counting in chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). Now, we will delve deeper into the specifics of power counting in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong nuclear force.

In QCD, the power counting is typically done using the $p$-expansion, as in ChPT. However, there are some key differences due to the nature of QCD. In particular, the presence of gluons and the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ introduce additional complexities.

The power of a term in the QCD Lagrangian is determined by the number of derivatives, the number of fields, and the number of gluons involved. For example, a term with $n$ derivatives, $m$ fields, and $g$ gluons has a power of $p^n m g$.

The power counting in QCD is also affected by the presence of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$. The power of a term involving $\alpha_s$ is determined by the number of derivatives, the number of fields, and the number of gluons involved, as well as the power of $\alpha_s$. For example, a term with $n$ derivatives, $m$ fields, $g$ gluons, and $\alpha_s^k$ has a power of $p^n m g \alpha_s^k$.

The power counting in QCD is also affected by the presence of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$. The power of a term involving $\alpha_s$ is determined by the number of derivatives, the number of fields, and the number of gluons involved, as well as the power of $\alpha_s$. For example, a term with $n$ derivatives, $m$ fields, $g$ gluons, and $\alpha_s^k$ has a power of $p^n m g \alpha_s^k$.

In addition to the power counting scheme, we also need to consider the coupling constants in the QCD Lagrangian. These constants represent the relative strengths of the interactions represented by each term. They are usually unknown and need to be determined by fitting to experimental data or by using underlying theory.

In the next section, we will discuss the specific terms in the QCD Lagrangian and their corresponding powers. We will also discuss how these terms contribute to the dynamics of the pion and the quark masses.

#### 4.4c Chiral Power Counting in Effective Field Theories

In the previous sections, we have discussed the power counting in QCD and ChPT. Now, we will extend our discussion to effective field theories (EFTs), which are a powerful tool for studying the low-energy behavior of quantum systems.

Effective field theories are a systematic way of approximating the behavior of a quantum system by focusing on the low-energy degrees of freedom. They are particularly useful in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), where the high-energy behavior of the theory is governed by non-perturbative effects that are difficult to calculate directly.

The power counting in EFTs is similar to that in QCD and ChPT. The power of a term in the EFT Lagrangian is determined by the number of derivatives, the number of fields, and the number of gluons involved. For example, a term with $n$ derivatives, $m$ fields, and $g$ gluons has a power of $p^n m g$.

However, there are some key differences due to the nature of EFTs. In particular, the presence of additional fields and interactions, which are not present in the underlying theory, introduce additional complexities.

The power of a term in the EFT Lagrangian is also affected by the presence of additional fields and interactions. For example, a term with $n$ derivatives, $m$ fields, $g$ gluons, and $h$ additional fields has a power of $p^n m g h$.

The power counting in EFTs is also affected by the presence of additional coupling constants. These constants represent the relative strengths of the interactions represented by each term. They are usually unknown and need to be determined by fitting to experimental data or by using underlying theory.

In the next section, we will discuss the specific terms in the EFT Lagrangian and their corresponding powers. We will also discuss how these terms contribute to the dynamics of the pion and the quark masses.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the fascinating world of chiral perturbation theory, a powerful tool in the study of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). We have explored the fundamental principles that govern this theory, its applications, and its implications for the behavior of particles at the quantum level.

We have seen how chiral perturbation theory provides a systematic way to study the low-energy behavior of QCD, where the effects of the strong interaction are typically small. This theory has been instrumental in the development of effective field theories, which have proven to be invaluable in the study of quantum systems.

The chapter has also highlighted the importance of chiral symmetry in QCD, and how it leads to the emergence of Goldstone bosons. We have also discussed the role of pions in the theory, and how they are the lightest of these bosons.

In conclusion, chiral perturbation theory is a rich and complex field that continues to be a subject of active research. Its applications extend beyond QCD to other areas of physics, including condensed matter physics and particle physics. As we continue to explore the quantum world, the insights provided by chiral perturbation theory will undoubtedly play a crucial role.

Effective field theories are mathematical models that describe the behavior of a system at a certain energy scale, neglecting the details of the system at higher energy scales. In the context of QCD, effective field theories are particularly useful as they allow us to study the behavior of the theory at different energy scales, from the very high energies of the early universe to the very low energies of particle physics experiments.

In this chapter, we will explore the construction of effective field theories of QCD, discussing the principles that guide their formulation and the techniques used to derive them. We will also discuss the applications of these theories in various areas of physics, including particle physics, condensed matter physics, and cosmology.

We will begin by introducing the concept of effective field theories and their role in QCD. We will then discuss the principles of symmetry and renormalization that guide the construction of these theories. We will also introduce the techniques of perturbation theory and dimensional regularization, which are essential tools in the derivation of effective field theories.

Finally, we will discuss some specific examples of effective field theories of QCD, including the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, the linear sigma model, and the chiral perturbation theory. We will explore how these theories describe the behavior of QCD at different energy scales, and how they can be used to make predictions about the behavior of the theory.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of effective field theories of QCD, their construction, and their applications. You will also have the tools to construct your own effective field theories of QCD, and to use them to study the behavior of the theory at different energy scales.




#### 4.4b Chiral Expansion of Amplitudes

In the previous section, we discussed the power counting scheme in chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) and how it allows us to systematically organize the terms in the Lagrangian. In this section, we will delve deeper into the chiral expansion of amplitudes, which is a crucial aspect of ChPT.

The chiral expansion of amplitudes is a method used to systematically expand the amplitudes of physical quantities in terms of the small parameter $\epsilon$, which is related to the quark masses. This expansion is valid in the chiral limit, where the quark masses go to zero.

The chiral expansion of amplitudes is based on the assumption that the physical quantities can be expressed as a series of terms, each of which is a power of $\epsilon$. The terms in this series are determined by the power counting scheme, which assigns a power to each term in the Lagrangian.

For example, consider the amplitude $A(p)$ of a physical quantity. The chiral expansion of $A(p)$ can be written as:

$$
A(p) = A_0(p) + \epsilon A_1(p) + \epsilon^2 A_2(p) + \cdots
$$

where $A_0(p)$ is the leading term, $A_1(p)$ is the next-to-leading term, and so on. The leading term $A_0(p)$ is the term with the lowest power of $\epsilon$, and it is usually the term that is most important at a given energy scale.

The chiral expansion of amplitudes is a powerful tool in ChPT, as it allows us to systematically study the behavior of physical quantities in the chiral limit. It also provides a way to determine the coefficients of the terms in the Lagrangian, which are usually unknown and need to be determined by fitting to experimental data or by using underlying theory.

In the next section, we will discuss the specific terms in the model Lagrangian and their corresponding powers, and how they contribute to the chiral expansion of amplitudes.

#### 4.4c Chiral Power Counting in QCD

In the previous sections, we have discussed the power counting scheme in ChPT and the chiral expansion of amplitudes. Now, we will extend these concepts to the realm of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong nuclear force.

In QCD, the small parameter $\epsilon$ is related to the quark masses and the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$. The chiral expansion of amplitudes in QCD is a method used to systematically expand the amplitudes of physical quantities in terms of $\epsilon$. This expansion is valid in the chiral limit, where the quark masses go to zero and the strong coupling constant is small.

The chiral expansion of amplitudes in QCD is based on the assumption that the physical quantities can be expressed as a series of terms, each of which is a power of $\epsilon$.

## Chapter: Effective Field Theory of QCD

### Introduction

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong nuclear force that binds quarks together to form particles such as protons and neutrons. It is a fundamental theory in particle physics, and its understanding is crucial for many areas of physics, including nuclear physics, particle physics, and condensed matter physics. However, the direct application of QCD to real-world phenomena is often challenging due to the non-perturbative nature of the theory. This is where Effective Field Theory (EFT) comes into play.

In this chapter, we will delve into the Effective Field Theory of QCD, a powerful tool that allows us to study the strong nuclear force in a more manageable way. EFT is a low-energy effective theory that describes the behavior of QCD at energies much lower than the scale of QCD, typically in the range of a few hundred MeV. It is a non-perturbative theory, meaning it is not based on the perturbative expansion of the coupling constant. Instead, it relies on the principles of symmetry and dimensionality to make predictions about the behavior of QCD.

We will begin by introducing the basic concepts of EFT, including the idea of symmetry breaking and the role of Goldstone bosons. We will then move on to discuss the construction of the EFT Lagrangian, which is the mathematical representation of the theory. This will involve the introduction of various fields and interaction terms, and we will explain how these elements are chosen to respect the symmetries of QCD.

Next, we will explore some of the applications of EFT in QCD, including the study of mesons and baryons, the pion-nucleon interaction, and the behavior of QCD at very high temperatures. We will also discuss the concept of chiral perturbation theory, a specific type of EFT that is particularly useful for studying the low-energy behavior of QCD.

Finally, we will touch upon some of the challenges and limitations of EFT, including the issue of renormalization and the need for higher-order corrections. Despite these challenges, EFT has proven to be a valuable tool in the study of QCD, and its applications continue to expand as our understanding of the theory deepens.

In summary, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the Effective Field Theory of QCD. It is our hope that this will serve as a useful resource for students and researchers alike, and will contribute to the ongoing efforts to understand the fundamental theory of the strong nuclear force.




#### 4.4c Chiral Power Counting Rules

In the previous section, we discussed the power counting scheme in ChPT and the chiral expansion of amplitudes. In this section, we will delve deeper into the chiral power counting rules, which are a set of rules that determine the power of each term in the Lagrangian.

The chiral power counting rules are based on the assumption that the physical quantities can be expressed as a series of terms, each of which is a power of $\epsilon$. The terms in this series are determined by the power counting scheme, which assigns a power to each term in the Lagrangian.

The chiral power counting rules are as follows:

1. The leading term in the Lagrangian has a power of $\epsilon^0$. This term is usually the term that is most important at a given energy scale.
2. The next-to-leading term in the Lagrangian has a power of $\epsilon^1$. This term is usually the term that is next most important at a given energy scale.
3. The subleading term in the Lagrangian has a power of $\epsilon^2$. This term is usually the term that is next most important after the leading and next-to-leading terms at a given energy scale.
4. The next-to-subleading term in the Lagrangian has a power of $\epsilon^3$. This term is usually the term that is next most important after the leading, next-to-leading, and subleading terms at a given energy scale.
5. The next-to-next-to-subleading term in the Lagrangian has a power of $\epsilon^4$. This term is usually the term that is next most important after the leading, next-to-leading, subleading, and next-to-subleading terms at a given energy scale.
6. And so on...

The chiral power counting rules are a powerful tool in ChPT, as they allow us to systematically study the behavior of physical quantities in the chiral limit. They also provide a way to determine the coefficients of the terms in the Lagrangian, which are usually unknown and need to be determined by fitting to experimental data or by using underlying theory.

In the next section, we will discuss the specific terms in the model Lagrangian and their corresponding powers, and how they contribute to the chiral expansion of amplitudes.

## Chapter: Effective Field Theory of QCD

### Introduction

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons, the fundamental particles of matter. It is a theory that has been extensively studied and tested, and it is the foundation of our understanding of the strong force. However, QCD is a theory that is difficult to solve exactly due to the non-linearity of its equations. This is where Effective Field Theory (EFT) comes into play.

In this chapter, we will delve into the Effective Field Theory of QCD. We will explore how EFT provides a powerful tool for studying QCD at different energy scales. We will discuss how EFT allows us to systematically expand the equations of QCD in terms of a small parameter, typically the ratio of the energy scale to the scale of QCD, and how this expansion leads to a series of effective theories that are valid at different energy scales.

We will also discuss the concept of symmetry breaking in QCD and how it is reflected in the EFT. We will explore how the breaking of chiral symmetry, for example, leads to the emergence of the pion as a Goldstone boson in the EFT. We will also discuss the role of the Higgs mechanism in QCD and how it leads to the formation of composite particles in the EFT.

Finally, we will discuss the applications of the EFT of QCD in various areas of particle physics, including the study of hadrons, the behavior of quarks and gluons at high energies, and the dynamics of the QCD phase transition.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive guide to the Effective Field Theory of QCD, covering both the theoretical foundations and the practical applications. It is designed to be accessible to advanced undergraduate students at MIT, but it will also be of interest to researchers and professionals in the field of particle physics.

## Chapter: Effective Field Theories of QCD

### Introduction

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the fundamental theory that describes the strong interactions between quarks and gluons, the building blocks of matter. However, the complexity of QCD makes it challenging to study and predict its behavior, especially at high energies or in extreme conditions. This is where effective field theories (EFTs) come into play. 

In this chapter, we will delve into the effective field theories of QCD, exploring how they provide a simplified yet accurate description of QCD phenomena. We will begin by introducing the concept of effective field theories, explaining their role in quantum physics and their application in QCD. We will then explore the different types of effective field theories used in QCD, including the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, the linear sigma model, and the Skyrme model. 

Each of these models provides a different perspective on QCD, focusing on different aspects of the theory. For example, the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model is particularly useful for studying the behavior of quarks and gluons in the presence of strong interactions, while the linear sigma model is more suited for studying the behavior of pions. The Skyrme model, on the other hand, is used to study the behavior of baryons.

Throughout this chapter, we will also discuss the advantages and limitations of each model, as well as their applications in various areas of physics. We will also explore how these models can be used in conjunction with other theoretical tools, such as perturbation theory, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of QCD.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the effective field theories of QCD, their applications, and their role in the broader field of quantum physics. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or simply a curious reader, this chapter will provide you with the knowledge and tools to further explore this fascinating field.




#### 4.5c Applications of Chiral Lagrangian

The chiral Lagrangian is a powerful tool for studying the behavior of particles at low energies. It has been used to make many predictions about the behavior of particles, and these predictions have been confirmed by experimental data. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of the chiral Lagrangian.

##### Chiral Lagrangian for Pions

The chiral Lagrangian for pions is given by:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\pi} = \frac{1}{2} \langle \partial_{\mu} \pi \partial^{\mu} \pi + m_{\pi}^{2} \pi^{2} + \frac{1}{2} \langle \pi \pi \rangle \rangle
$$

This Lagrangian describes the interactions between pions, which are the lightest mesons. It is a low-energy effective theory, meaning that it is valid at energies much lower than the scale of chiral symmetry breaking. At higher energies, the theory breaks down and a more complete theory, such as the Standard Model, is needed.

The chiral Lagrangian for pions is also a non-renormalizable theory, meaning that it cannot be used to make predictions at arbitrarily high energies. However, it is still a useful tool for studying the behavior of these mesons at low energies, where it is renormalizable.

##### Chiral Lagrangian for Other Mesons

The chiral Lagrangian for pions can be extended to include other mesons, such as kaons and rho mesons. This extension is necessary to fully describe the interactions between these mesons and the pions. The chiral Lagrangian for these mesons is given by:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{other mesons}} = \frac{1}{2} \langle \partial_{\mu} \text{other mesons} \partial^{\mu} \text{other mesons} + m_{\text{other mesons}}^{2} \text{other mesons}^{2} + \frac{1}{2} \langle \text{other mesons} \text{other mesons} \rangle \rangle
$$

where "other mesons" represents the kaons and rho mesons. The first term represents the kinetic energy of the other mesons, the second term represents the mass term, and the third term represents the interaction term.

The chiral Lagrangian for other mesons is also a low-energy effective theory, meaning that it is valid at energies much lower than the scale of chiral symmetry breaking. At higher energies, the theory breaks down and a more complete theory, such as the Standard Model, is needed.

##### Chiral Lagrangian for Baryons

The chiral Lagrangian for pions can also be extended to include baryons, such as the nucleon. This extension is necessary to fully describe the interactions between these baryons and the pions. The chiral Lagrangian for these baryons is given by:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{baryons}} = \frac{1}{2} \langle \partial_{\mu} \text{baryons} \partial^{\mu} \text{baryons} + m_{\text{baryons}}^{2} \text{baryons}^{2} + \frac{1}{2} \langle \text{baryons} \text{baryons} \rangle \rangle
$$

where "baryons" represents the nucleon. The first term represents the kinetic energy of the baryons, the second term represents the mass term, and the third term represents the interaction term.

The chiral Lagrangian for baryons is also a low-energy effective theory, meaning that it is valid at energies much lower than the scale of chiral symmetry breaking. At higher energies, the theory breaks down and a more complete theory, such as the Standard Model, is needed.

##### Chiral Lagrangian for Other Particles

The chiral Lagrangian can also be extended to include other particles, such as leptons and gluons. This extension is necessary to fully describe the interactions between these particles and the pions. The chiral Lagrangian for these particles is given by:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{other particles}} = \frac{1}{2} \langle \partial_{\mu} \text{other particles} \partial^{\mu} \text{other particles} + m_{\text{other particles}}^{2} \text{other particles}^{2} + \frac{1}{2} \langle \text{other particles} \text{other particles} \rangle \rangle
$$

where "other particles" represents the leptons and gluons. The first term represents the kinetic energy of the other particles, the second term represents the mass term, and the third term represents the interaction term.

The chiral Lagrangian for other particles is also a low-energy effective theory, meaning that it is valid at energies much lower than the scale of chiral symmetry breaking. At higher energies, the theory breaks down and a more complete theory, such as the Standard Model, is needed.

##### Chiral Lagrangian for Other Interactions

The chiral Lagrangian can also be extended to include other interactions, such as the electromagnetic interaction and the weak interaction. This extension is necessary to fully describe the interactions between these particles and the pions. The chiral Lagrangian for these interactions is given by:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{other interactions}} = \frac{1}{2} \langle \partial_{\mu} \text{other interactions} \partial^{\mu} \text{other interactions} + m_{\text{other interactions}}^{2} \text{other interactions}^{2} + \frac{1}{2} \langle \text{other interactions} \text{other interactions} \rangle \rangle
$$

where "other interactions" represents the electromagnetic and weak interactions. The first term represents the kinetic energy of the other interactions, the second term represents the mass term, and the third term represents the interaction term.

The chiral Lagrangian for other interactions is also a low-energy effective theory, meaning that it is valid at energies much lower than the scale of chiral symmetry breaking. At higher energies, the theory breaks down and a more complete theory, such as the Standard Model, is needed.

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamental concepts of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and its effective field theories. We have seen how these theories provide a powerful framework for understanding the behavior of particles at different energy scales. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the realm of heavy quark effective theory (HQET), a crucial tool in the study of heavy quark systems.

Heavy quark effective theory is a low-energy effective field theory that describes the behavior of heavy quarks and their interactions with light degrees of freedom. It is particularly useful in the study of heavy quark systems, where the heavy quark mass is much larger than the typical energy scale of the system. This allows us to integrate out the heavy quark degrees of freedom, resulting in a simplified theory that captures the essential dynamics of the system.

The chapter will begin with an overview of the basic principles of HQET, including its underlying assumptions and the techniques used to derive it. We will then explore the various applications of HQET, including its use in the study of heavy quarkonium systems and its role in the calculation of heavy quark decay rates. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of HQET, and how these can be addressed using more advanced techniques.

Throughout the chapter, we will use the popular Markdown format to present the material, with math equations rendered using the MathJax library. This will allow us to present complex mathematical concepts in a clear and accessible manner. We will also provide numerous examples and exercises to help reinforce the concepts discussed in the chapter.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of heavy quark effective theory and its applications in the study of heavy quark systems. This knowledge will serve as a solid foundation for further exploration of effective field theories in QCD and beyond.

Heavy quark effective theory (HQET) is a powerful tool in the study of heavy quark systems. It is a low-energy effective field theory that describes the behavior of heavy quarks and their interactions with light degrees of freedom. This theory is particularly useful in the study of heavy quark systems, where the heavy quark mass is much larger than the typical energy scale of the system.

#### 5.1a Symmetries of Heavy Quark Effective Theory

The symmetries of HQET play a crucial role in its formulation and application. These symmetries are derived from the symmetries of the underlying theory, QCD, and are used to simplify the theory and make predictions about the behavior of heavy quark systems.

One of the key symmetries of HQET is the heavy quark spin symmetry. This symmetry arises from the fact that the heavy quark mass is much larger than the typical energy scale of the system. As a result, the heavy quark spin is conserved in many processes, leading to simplifications in the theory.

Another important symmetry of HQET is the flavor symmetry. This symmetry arises from the fact that the heavy quark is a member of a multiplet of quarks with the same quantum numbers. This symmetry is used to classify the different types of heavy quarks and their interactions with light degrees of freedom.

The symmetries of HQET are also used to derive important results about the behavior of heavy quark systems. For example, the heavy quark spin symmetry is used to derive the spin-dependent cross section for heavy quark production, which is a key result in the study of heavy quark systems.

In the next section, we will explore the various applications of HQET, including its use in the study of heavy quarkonium systems and its role in the calculation of heavy quark decay rates. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of HQET, and how these can be addressed using more advanced techniques.

### Subsection: 5.1b Heavy Quark Effective Lagrangian

The heavy quark effective Lagrangian is a key component of HQET. It describes the interactions between heavy quarks and light degrees of freedom, and is used to make predictions about the behavior of heavy quark systems.

The heavy quark effective Lagrangian is derived from the underlying theory, QCD, and is written in terms of the heavy quark field, $H$, and the light degrees of freedom, $X$. The Lagrangian is given by:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \bar{H}i\gamma^\mu D_\mu H + \bar{H}MH + \bar{H}OH
$$

where $D_\mu$ is the covariant derivative, $M$ is the heavy quark mass, and $O$ is a set of operators that describe the interactions between the heavy quark and the light degrees of freedom.

The heavy quark effective Lagrangian is used to make predictions about the behavior of heavy quark systems, such as the mass and decay properties of heavy quarkonia. It is also used to study the production and decay of heavy quarks in various processes, such as heavy quarkonium production in electron-positron annihilation.

These theories are used to study the behavior of light quarks and the top quark, respectively, and are derived from the heavy quark effective theory.

In conclusion, the heavy quark effective Lagrangian is a fundamental component of HQET and is used to make predictions about the behavior of heavy quark systems. Its applications extend beyond just studying heavy quark systems and have important implications for the development of other effective field theories.

### Section: 5.2a Effective Field Theory for B Mesons

The effective field theory (EFT) for B mesons is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of these particles, particularly in the context of heavy quark effective theory (HQET). In this section, we will explore the EFT for B mesons, focusing on its applications in HQET.

#### 5.2a.1 The EFT Lagrangian

The EFT Lagrangian for B mesons is constructed from the heavy quark spinor field $\chi_Q$, the light quark spinor field $\chi_q$, and the gauge field $A_\mu$. The Lagrangian is given by:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \bar{\chi}_Q i \gamma^\mu D_\mu \chi_Q + \bar{\chi}_q i \gamma^\mu D_\mu \chi_q - m_Q \bar{\chi}_Q \chi_Q - m_q \bar{\chi}_q \chi_q
$$

where $D_\mu$ is the covariant derivative, $m_Q$ and $m_q$ are the masses of the heavy and light quarks, respectively, and $\gamma^\mu$ are the gamma matrices.

#### 5.2a.2 The EFT for B Mesons in HQET

In the context of HQET, the EFT for B mesons is particularly useful. HQET is a low-energy effective theory that describes the dynamics of heavy quarks and their interactions with light degrees of freedom. It is derived from the full theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) by integrating out the heavy quark degrees of freedom.

The EFT for B mesons in HQET is constructed by expanding the heavy quark field $\chi_Q$ in terms of the light degrees of freedom. This expansion is given by:

$$
\chi_Q = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 m_Q}} \left( h_v + v \cdot D h_v \right)
$$

where $h_v$ is the heavy quark field in the rest frame of the heavy quark, $v$ is the heavy quark velocity, and $D$ is the covariant derivative.

The EFT for B mesons in HQET is then used to study the dynamics of B mesons, focusing on the interactions between the heavy quark and the light degrees of freedom. This allows us to understand the properties of B mesons, such as their mass and decay rates, in terms of the underlying QCD dynamics.

#### 5.2a.3 The EFT for B Mesons in Non-perturbative QCD

The EFT for B mesons can also be used in non-perturbative QCD, where the interactions between the heavy quark and the light degrees of freedom are not perturbative. In this case, the EFT is used to study the dynamics of B mesons in terms of the underlying non-perturbative QCD dynamics.

The EFT for B mesons in non-perturbative QCD is constructed by including additional terms in the Lagrangian that describe the interactions between the heavy quark and the light degrees of freedom. These terms are typically determined by matching the EFT to the full theory of QCD at a low energy scale.

The EFT for B mesons in non-perturbative QCD is then used to study the dynamics of B mesons, focusing on the interactions between the heavy quark and the light degrees of freedom. This allows us to understand the properties of B mesons, such as their mass and decay rates, in terms of the underlying non-perturbative QCD dynamics.

#### 5.2a.4 The EFT for B Mesons in Perturbative QCD

The EFT for B mesons can also be used in perturbative QCD, where the interactions between the heavy quark and the light degrees of freedom are perturbative. In this case, the EFT is used to study the dynamics of B mesons in terms of the underlying perturbative QCD dynamics.

The EFT for B mesons in perturbative QCD is constructed by including additional terms in the Lagrangian that describe the interactions between the heavy quark and the light degrees of freedom. These terms are typically determined by matching the EFT to the full theory of QCD at a high energy scale.

The EFT for B mesons in perturbative QCD is then used to study the dynamics of B mesons, focusing on the interactions between the heavy quark and the light degrees of freedom. This allows us to understand the properties of B mesons, such as their mass and decay rates, in terms of the underlying perturbative QCD dynamics.

#### 5.2a.5 The EFT for B Mesons in Non-relativistic QCD

The EFT for B mesons can also be used in non-relativistic QCD, where the heavy quark is treated as a non-relativistic particle. In this case, the EFT is used to study the dynamics of B mesons in terms of the underlying non-relativistic QCD dynamics.

The EFT for B mesons in non-relativistic QCD is constructed by expanding the heavy quark field $\chi_Q$ in terms of the light degrees of freedom, similar to the expansion used in HQET. The EFT is then used to study the dynamics of B mesons, focusing on the interactions between the heavy quark and the light degrees of freedom. This allows us to understand the properties of B mesons, such as their mass and decay rates, in terms of the underlying non-relativistic QCD dynamics.




### Section: 5.2b B Meson Decay Processes

The study of B meson decays is a crucial aspect of heavy quark physics. These decays provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the strong interaction and the properties of the heavy quark. In this section, we will explore the various decay processes of B mesons, focusing on the semileptonic and non-leptonic decays.

#### 5.2b.1 Semileptonic Decays

Semileptonic decays of B mesons involve the transformation of a B meson into a B meson of a different flavor, accompanied by the emission of a lepton (either an electron or a muon) and a neutrino. These decays are governed by the weak interaction and are therefore subject to the constraints of the Standard Model.

The semileptonic decay of a B meson can be described by the following effective Hamiltonian:

$$
\mathcal{H}_{eff} = \frac{G_F}{\sqrt{2}} V_{cb} \bar{c} \gamma^\mu (1 - \gamma_5) b \bar{\ell} \gamma_\mu (1 - \gamma_5) \nu
$$

where $G_F$ is the Fermi constant, $V_{cb}$ is the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element, $c$ and $b$ are the charm and bottom quarks, respectively, $\ell$ and $\nu$ are the lepton and neutrino, respectively, and $\gamma^\mu$ and $\gamma_5$ are the gamma matrices.

The semileptonic decay rate of a B meson can be calculated using the effective Hamiltonian. The result is given by:

$$
\Gamma(B \rightarrow B' \ell \nu) = \frac{G_F^2 |V_{cb}|^2 m_B^3}{192 \pi^3} f_B f_{B'} |p_{B'}| \left( 1 - \frac{m_{B'}^2}{m_B^2} \right)^2 (1 + 2 r)
$$

where $m_B$ and $m_{B'}$ are the masses of the B and B' mesons, respectively, $f_B$ and $f_{B'}$ are the decay constants of the B and B' mesons, respectively, $p_{B'}$ is the momentum of the B' meson, and $r$ is the ratio of the hadronic matrix elements of the vector and axial-vector currents.

#### 5.2b.2 Non-leptonic Decays

Non-leptonic decays of B mesons involve the transformation of a B meson into a B meson of a different flavor, without the emission of a lepton or a neutrino. These decays are governed by the strong interaction and are therefore subject to the constraints of QCD.

The non-leptonic decay of a B meson can be described by the following effective Hamiltonian:

$$
\mathcal{H}_{eff} = \frac{G_F}{\sqrt{2}} V_{cb} \bar{c} \gamma^\mu (1 - \gamma_5) b \bar{b} \gamma_\mu (1 - \gamma_5) b
$$

where the notation is the same as in the case of semileptonic decays.

The non-leptonic decay rate of a B meson can be calculated using the effective Hamiltonian. The result is given by:

$$
\Gamma(B \rightarrow B' X) = \frac{G_F^2 |V_{cb}|^2 m_B^3}{192 \pi^3} f_B f_{B'} |p_{B'}| \left( 1 - \frac{m_{B'}^2}{m_B^2} \right)^2 (1 + 2 r)
$$

where the notation is the same as in the case of semileptonic decays, and $X$ denotes any possible final state.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of these decay processes for the properties of the B meson and the dynamics of the strong interaction.




#### 5.2c B Mixing and CP Violation

The study of B meson mixing and CP violation is a crucial aspect of heavy quark physics. These phenomena provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the strong interaction and the properties of the heavy quark. In this section, we will explore the various aspects of B meson mixing and CP violation, focusing on the effective field theory of B meson mixing and the role of CP violation in this process.

#### 5.2c.1 Effective Field Theory of B Meson Mixing

The effective field theory of B meson mixing is a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of B meson mixing. This theory is based on the concept of effective field theory, which is a method of systematically approximating the effects of high-energy or high-momentum particles on a system. In the case of B meson mixing, the high-energy particles are the heavy quarks, and the low-energy particles are the light quarks and gluons.

The effective field theory of B meson mixing is based on the following assumptions:

1. The heavy quarks are much heavier than the light quarks and gluons. This allows us to neglect the effects of the heavy quarks on the light quarks and gluons.
2. The heavy quarks are much heavier than the scale of the strong interaction. This allows us to neglect the effects of the strong interaction on the heavy quarks.
3. The heavy quarks are much heavier than the scale of the electroweak interaction. This allows us to neglect the effects of the electroweak interaction on the heavy quarks.

Under these assumptions, the dynamics of B meson mixing can be described by an effective Lagrangian that only includes terms involving the light quarks and gluons. This effective Lagrangian can be used to calculate the probability of B meson mixing, which is given by:

$$
P(B \rightarrow B') = \frac{1}{2} \left| \frac{q}{p} \right|^2
$$

where $q$ and $p$ are the amplitudes for the decay of the B meson into the B' meson and the decay of the B' meson into the B meson, respectively.

#### 5.2c.2 CP Violation in B Meson Mixing

CP violation is a fundamental aspect of B meson mixing. It refers to the violation of the principle of charge conjugation and parity symmetry in the decay of B mesons. This violation is a direct consequence of the complex phase of the CKM matrix, which describes the mixing of the heavy quarks.

The probability of CP violation in B meson mixing can be calculated using the effective field theory. This probability is given by:

$$
P(CPV) = \frac{1}{2} \left| \frac{q}{p} \right|^2 \sin(\delta)
$$

where $\delta$ is the phase difference between the amplitudes for the decay of the B meson into the B' meson and the decay of the B' meson into the B meson. This phase difference is a direct consequence of the complex phase of the CKM matrix.

In conclusion, the study of B meson mixing and CP violation is a crucial aspect of heavy quark physics. The effective field theory provides a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of these phenomena, and the role of CP violation in B meson mixing is a fundamental aspect of this process.

## Chapter: Chapter 6: Soft Collinear Effective Theory

### Introduction

In the realm of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the study of particle interactions at different energy scales is a crucial aspect. The Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) is a powerful tool that allows us to explore the dynamics of QCD in a systematic and controlled manner. This chapter will delve into the intricacies of SCET, providing a comprehensive guide to understanding its principles and applications.

The Soft Collinear Effective Theory is a field theory that describes the behavior of particles at low energies. It is particularly useful in the study of QCD, where it allows us to separate the dynamics of particles into two distinct regions: the soft and the collinear. The soft region refers to particles with low energies, while the collinear region refers to particles with high energies but aligned in a specific direction.

The theory is constructed by integrating out the hard and ultrasoft modes, leaving us with the soft and collinear modes. This integration is performed using the method of effective field theory, which allows us to systematically expand the theory in terms of the hard scale. The resulting theory is a simplified version of QCD that captures the essential dynamics of the system at low energies.

In this chapter, we will explore the principles of SCET in detail. We will start by introducing the basic concepts and principles of the theory, including the separation of modes and the method of integration. We will then delve into the applications of SCET, discussing how it can be used to study a variety of physical phenomena in QCD.

The chapter will also cover the mathematical formalism of SCET, including the Lagrangian of the theory and the equations of motion. We will also discuss the renormalization of the theory, which is crucial for its application in perturbative QCD.

Finally, we will conclude the chapter by discussing the future prospects of SCET, including potential extensions and applications of the theory. We will also touch upon the challenges and open questions in the field, providing a roadmap for future research.

In summary, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive guide to Soft Collinear Effective Theory, equipping readers with the knowledge and tools necessary to explore this fascinating field. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or simply a curious reader, we hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource in your journey through the world of quantum chromodynamics.




#### 5.3a Heavy Quark Spin Symmetry

The heavy quark spin symmetry is a fundamental concept in the study of heavy quark physics. It is a manifestation of the heavy quark symmetry, which is a symmetry of the strong interaction that becomes exact in the limit of infinite heavy quark mass. This symmetry is a key ingredient in the construction of the Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET), which is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of heavy quarks.

The heavy quark spin symmetry is based on the following assumptions:

1. The heavy quark is much heavier than the light quarks and gluons. This allows us to neglect the effects of the heavy quark on the light quarks and gluons.
2. The heavy quark is much heavier than the scale of the strong interaction. This allows us to neglect the effects of the strong interaction on the heavy quark.
3. The heavy quark is much heavier than the scale of the electroweak interaction. This allows us to neglect the effects of the electroweak interaction on the heavy quark.

Under these assumptions, the dynamics of the heavy quark can be described by an effective Lagrangian that only includes terms involving the heavy quark. This effective Lagrangian can be used to derive the equations of motion for the heavy quark, which are given by:

$$
i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi = m \psi
$$

where $\gamma^\mu$ are the gamma matrices, $\partial_\mu$ are the partial derivatives, $m$ is the mass of the heavy quark, and $\psi$ is the spinor field representing the heavy quark.

The heavy quark spin symmetry is a consequence of the equations of motion. It states that the spin of the heavy quark is conserved in the strong interaction. This symmetry is broken by the electroweak interaction, which can change the spin of the heavy quark. However, the breaking of the heavy quark spin symmetry is suppressed by the ratio of the heavy quark mass to the electroweak scale, which is typically very small.

The heavy quark spin symmetry has important implications for the dynamics of heavy quarks. For example, it leads to the prediction of the heavy quark spin symmetry breaking parameter $\lambda_1$, which is a key quantity in the study of heavy quark physics. It also provides a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of heavy quarkonium, which are bound states of heavy quarks.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of the heavy quark spin symmetry for the dynamics of heavy quarkonium.

#### 5.3b Heavy Quark Flavor Symmetry

The heavy quark flavor symmetry is another fundamental concept in the study of heavy quark physics. It is a manifestation of the heavy quark flavor symmetry, which is a symmetry of the strong interaction that becomes exact in the limit of infinite heavy quark mass. This symmetry is a key ingredient in the construction of the Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET), which is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of heavy quarks.

The heavy quark flavor symmetry is based on the following assumptions:

1. The heavy quark is much heavier than the light quarks and gluons. This allows us to neglect the effects of the heavy quark on the light quarks and gluons.
2. The heavy quark is much heavier than the scale of the strong interaction. This allows us to neglect the effects of the strong interaction on the heavy quark.
3. The heavy quark is much heavier than the scale of the electroweak interaction. This allows us to neglect the effects of the electroweak interaction on the heavy quark.

Under these assumptions, the dynamics of the heavy quark can be described by an effective Lagrangian that only includes terms involving the heavy quark. This effective Lagrangian can be used to derive the equations of motion for the heavy quark, which are given by:

$$
i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi = m \psi
$$

where $\gamma^\mu$ are the gamma matrices, $\partial_\mu$ are the partial derivatives, $m$ is the mass of the heavy quark, and $\psi$ is the spinor field representing the heavy quark.

The heavy quark flavor symmetry is a consequence of the equations of motion. It states that the flavor of the heavy quark is conserved in the strong interaction. This symmetry is broken by the electroweak interaction, which can change the flavor of the heavy quark. However, the breaking of the heavy quark flavor symmetry is suppressed by the ratio of the heavy quark mass to the electroweak scale, which is typically very small.

The heavy quark flavor symmetry has important implications for the dynamics of heavy quarks. For example, it leads to the prediction of the heavy quark flavor symmetry breaking parameter $\lambda_2$, which is a key quantity in the study of heavy quark physics. It also provides a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of heavy quarkonium, which are bound states of heavy quarks.

#### 5.3c Heavy Quark Symmetry Breaking

The heavy quark symmetry breaking is a crucial aspect of heavy quark physics. It refers to the deviation from the exact symmetry of the strong interaction that becomes exact in the limit of infinite heavy quark mass. This deviation is due to the finite mass of the heavy quark and the effects of the electroweak interaction.

The heavy quark symmetry breaking can be quantified by the heavy quark symmetry breaking parameters $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$. These parameters are defined as the ratios of the deviations from the exact symmetry to the heavy quark mass. They are given by:

$$
\lambda_1 = \frac{\delta m_1}{m}, \quad \lambda_2 = \frac{\delta m_2}{m}
$$

where $\delta m_1$ and $\delta m_2$ are the deviations from the exact symmetry of the heavy quark mass, and $m$ is the mass of the heavy quark.

The heavy quark symmetry breaking parameters $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are small quantities. They are typically of the order of $10^{-3}$ or smaller. This is because the heavy quark mass is much larger than the scale of the strong interaction and the electroweak interaction. Therefore, the effects of the symmetry breaking are suppressed by the ratio of the heavy quark mass to the scale of the interaction.

The heavy quark symmetry breaking has important implications for the dynamics of heavy quarks. For example, it leads to the prediction of the heavy quark spin symmetry breaking parameter $\lambda_1$, which is a key quantity in the study of heavy quark physics. It also provides a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of heavy quarkonium, which are bound states of heavy quarks.

In the next section, we will discuss the implications of the heavy quark symmetry breaking for the dynamics of heavy quarks in more detail.

#### 5.3d Heavy Quark Symmetry Restoration

The concept of heavy quark symmetry restoration is a counterpoint to the symmetry breaking discussed in the previous section. It refers to the situation where the heavy quark symmetry becomes exact in the limit of infinite heavy quark mass. This is a theoretical limit that is not achievable in practice, but it provides a useful framework for understanding the behavior of heavy quarks.

The heavy quark symmetry restoration can be understood in terms of the heavy quark effective theory (HQET). This theory is a low-energy effective theory that describes the dynamics of heavy quarks. It is derived from the full theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) by integrating out the high-energy degrees of freedom.

The HQET is based on the heavy quark symmetry, which states that the heavy quark mass is much larger than the scale of the strong interaction. This allows us to neglect the effects of the strong interaction on the heavy quark. The HQET also assumes that the heavy quark is much heavier than the light quarks and gluons, which allows us to neglect the effects of the heavy quark on the light quarks and gluons.

In the limit of infinite heavy quark mass, the HQET reduces to a free theory. This is because the heavy quark mass term dominates over all other terms in the Lagrangian, and the heavy quark is not affected by the interactions with the light quarks and gluons. This is the situation where the heavy quark symmetry becomes exact.

However, in reality, the heavy quark mass is not infinite. Therefore, the heavy quark symmetry is not exactly restored. The deviations from the exact symmetry are described by the heavy quark symmetry breaking parameters $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, as discussed in the previous section.

The concept of heavy quark symmetry restoration is important in heavy quark physics. It provides a theoretical framework for understanding the behavior of heavy quarks in the limit of infinite heavy quark mass. It also helps to clarify the role of the heavy quark symmetry breaking parameters in the dynamics of heavy quarks.

In the next section, we will discuss the implications of the heavy quark symmetry restoration for the dynamics of heavy quarks in more detail.

We have explored the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of heavy quarks and how these principles can be used to simplify the complex dynamics of QCD. 

We have seen how HQET provides a systematic expansion in powers of $1/m_Q$, where $m_Q$ is the heavy quark mass. This expansion allows us to neglect certain terms that are suppressed by powers of $1/m_Q$, simplifying the calculations and providing a more manageable framework for understanding the behavior of heavy quarks.

We have also discussed the implications of HQET for the study of heavy quarkonium, a bound state of a heavy quark and its antiquark. We have seen how HQET can be used to derive the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation for the motion of the heavy quarkonium, providing a powerful tool for studying the properties of these systems.

In conclusion, Heavy Quark Effective Theory is a powerful tool in the study of quantum chromodynamics. It provides a systematic expansion that simplifies the calculations and provides a deeper understanding of the behavior of heavy quarks and their bound states.

## Chapter: Chapter 6: Heavy Quarkonium

### Introduction

In the realm of quantum chromodynamics, the study of heavy quarkonium holds a significant place. This chapter, Chapter 6: Heavy Quarkonium, delves into the fascinating world of heavy quarkonium, a bound state of a heavy quark and its antiquark. 

Heavy quarkonium, due to its heavy mass, exhibits unique properties that are distinct from lighter quarkonium systems. The heavy mass of the quarks leads to a non-relativistic dynamics, which can be approximated using the Schrödinger equation. This approximation, while not strictly valid, provides a useful tool for understanding the behavior of heavy quarkonium systems.

The chapter will explore the theoretical foundations of heavy quarkonium, including the Schrödinger equation and the concept of potential energy. It will also delve into the experimental aspects, discussing the methods used to study heavy quarkonium and the results obtained.

The study of heavy quarkonium is not just an academic exercise. It has practical implications in various fields, including particle physics, nuclear physics, and even cosmology. For instance, the study of heavy quarkonium can provide insights into the behavior of matter at extremely high temperatures and densities, as encountered in the early universe or in the core of stars.

In this chapter, we will also discuss the challenges and future directions in the study of heavy quarkonium. Despite the significant progress made, many questions remain unanswered, and there are many avenues for future research.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to heavy quarkonium, suitable for both students and researchers in the field. It is our hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for those interested in the fascinating world of quantum chromodynamics.




#### 5.3b Heavy Quark Flavor Symmetry

The heavy quark flavor symmetry is another fundamental concept in the study of heavy quark physics. It is a manifestation of the heavy quark symmetry, which is a symmetry of the strong interaction that becomes exact in the limit of infinite heavy quark mass. This symmetry is a key ingredient in the construction of the Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET), which is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of heavy quarks.

The heavy quark flavor symmetry is based on the following assumptions:

1. The heavy quark is much heavier than the light quarks and gluons. This allows us to neglect the effects of the heavy quark on the light quarks and gluons.
2. The heavy quark is much heavier than the scale of the strong interaction. This allows us to neglect the effects of the strong interaction on the heavy quark.
3. The heavy quark is much heavier than the scale of the electroweak interaction. This allows us to neglect the effects of the electroweak interaction on the heavy quark.

Under these assumptions, the dynamics of the heavy quark can be described by an effective Lagrangian that only includes terms involving the heavy quark. This effective Lagrangian can be used to derive the equations of motion for the heavy quark, which are given by:

$$
i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi = m \psi
$$

where $\gamma^\mu$ are the gamma matrices, $\partial_\mu$ are the partial derivatives, $m$ is the mass of the heavy quark, and $\psi$ is the spinor field representing the heavy quark.

The heavy quark flavor symmetry is a consequence of the equations of motion. It states that the flavor of the heavy quark is conserved in the strong interaction. This symmetry is broken by the electroweak interaction, which can change the flavor of the heavy quark. However, the breaking of the heavy quark flavor symmetry is suppressed by the ratio of the heavy quark mass to the electroweak scale, which is typically very small.

The heavy quark flavor symmetry has important implications for the study of heavy quark physics. For example, it predicts the existence of heavy quarkonium states, which are bound states of a heavy quark and antiquark. These states have been observed in experiments and their properties can be studied using the tools of HQET.

#### 5.3c Heavy Quark Symmetry Breaking

While the heavy quark flavor symmetry is a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of heavy quarks, it is not an exact symmetry. This is due to the fact that the heavy quark mass is not infinite, and the effects of the strong and electroweak interactions cannot be completely neglected. The breaking of the heavy quark flavor symmetry is a key area of study in heavy quark physics.

The breaking of the heavy quark flavor symmetry can be understood in terms of the effective Lagrangian of the Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET). The effective Lagrangian includes terms that represent the effects of the strong and electroweak interactions on the heavy quark. These terms break the heavy quark flavor symmetry, leading to deviations from the predictions of the symmetry.

The breaking of the heavy quark flavor symmetry can be quantified in terms of the heavy quark mass. The heavy quark mass is not exactly constant, but varies with the scale of the interaction. This variation is represented by the term $m(t)$ in the effective Lagrangian. The variation of the heavy quark mass with the scale of the interaction is a manifestation of the breaking of the heavy quark flavor symmetry.

The breaking of the heavy quark flavor symmetry also leads to the mixing of heavy quark states. In the limit of infinite heavy quark mass, the heavy quark states are pure states, with no admixture of other states. However, due to the breaking of the symmetry, the heavy quark states are no longer pure states, but are mixtures of different states. This mixing can be described by the term $\delta m(t)$ in the effective Lagrangian.

The breaking of the heavy quark flavor symmetry has important implications for the study of heavy quark physics. For example, it leads to the prediction of new particles, known as heavy quarkonium states, which are bound states of a heavy quark and antiquark. These states have been observed in experiments and their properties can be studied using the tools of HQET.

In conclusion, the heavy quark flavor symmetry is a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of heavy quarks. However, it is not an exact symmetry, and the breaking of the symmetry is a key area of study in heavy quark physics. The breaking of the symmetry leads to deviations from the predictions of the symmetry, and has important implications for the study of heavy quark physics.

## Chapter: Effective Field Theories of QCD

### Introduction

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the fundamental theory that describes the strong interaction between quarks and gluons. It is a theory that is deeply rooted in the principles of quantum mechanics and special relativity. However, the complexity of QCD makes it challenging to study and understand. This is where Effective Field Theories (EFTs) come into play. 

In this chapter, we will delve into the realm of Effective Field Theories of QCD. We will explore how these theories provide a simplified yet powerful framework for studying the dynamics of QCD. EFTs allow us to focus on the relevant degrees of freedom and interactions, while ignoring the irrelevant ones. This simplification is achieved by integrating out the heavy or high-energy degrees of freedom, resulting in an effective theory that describes the low-energy behavior of the system.

We will begin by introducing the concept of EFTs and their role in QCD. We will then discuss the construction of EFTs, including the identification of the relevant and irrelevant degrees of freedom and interactions. We will also cover the renormalization of EFTs, a crucial aspect that ensures the consistency and predictability of the theory.

Next, we will explore some specific examples of EFTs in QCD, such as the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model and the Linear Sigma Model. These examples will provide a concrete understanding of how EFTs are applied in practice.

Finally, we will discuss the limitations and challenges of EFTs in QCD. While EFTs are a powerful tool, they are not without their limitations. Understanding these limitations is crucial for the correct interpretation and application of EFTs in QCD.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of Effective Field Theories of QCD. You will be equipped with the knowledge to apply these theories in your own research or studies, and to critically evaluate their applications in the literature.




#### 5.3c Applications of Heavy Quark Symmetries

The heavy quark symmetries, including the heavy quark flavor symmetry, have been applied to various areas of particle physics. These applications have provided valuable insights into the nature of heavy quarks and their interactions with other particles.

##### Heavy Quarkonium

One of the most significant applications of heavy quark symmetries is in the study of heavy quarkonium, which are bound states of heavy quarks. The heavy quark flavor symmetry has been used to derive the potential energy of the heavy quarkonium, which is given by:

$$
V(r) = \frac{1}{2} \alpha_s r
$$

where $\alpha_s$ is the strong coupling constant and $r$ is the distance between the heavy quarks. This potential energy is independent of the flavor of the heavy quarks, which is a direct consequence of the heavy quark flavor symmetry.

##### Heavy Quark Decay

The heavy quark flavor symmetry has also been applied to the study of heavy quark decay. The decay of a heavy quark into a lighter quark and a W boson is a key process in heavy quark physics. The heavy quark flavor symmetry has been used to derive the decay width of this process, which is given by:

$$
\Gamma = \frac{G_F^2 m_W^2 m_Q}{12 \pi} |V_{QW}|^2
$$

where $G_F$ is the Fermi constant, $m_W$ is the mass of the W boson, $m_Q$ is the mass of the heavy quark, and $V_{QW}$ is the CKM matrix element. This decay width is independent of the flavor of the heavy quark, which is a direct consequence of the heavy quark flavor symmetry.

##### Heavy Quark Effective Theory

The heavy quark flavor symmetry is also a key ingredient in the construction of the Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET). This theory is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of heavy quarks, and it has been used to derive various predictions about the behavior of heavy quarks. For example, the HQET has been used to derive the spin-dependent cross section for the production of heavy quarks, which is given by:

$$
\sigma_s = \frac{G_F^2 m_W^2 m_Q}{12 \pi} |V_{QW}|^2
$$

where $\sigma_s$ is the spin-dependent cross section. This prediction is independent of the flavor of the heavy quark, which is a direct consequence of the heavy quark flavor symmetry.

In conclusion, the heavy quark symmetries have been applied to various areas of particle physics, providing valuable insights into the nature of heavy quarks and their interactions with other particles. These applications have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of heavy quark physics.

### Section: 5.4 Leptonic and Semileptonic Decays

In the previous section, we discussed the heavy quark flavor symmetry and its applications in heavy quarkonium and decay. In this section, we will focus on the leptonic and semileptonic decays of heavy mesons, which are crucial for understanding the dynamics of heavy quarks.

#### 5.4a Leptonic Decays of Heavy Mesons

Leptonic decays of heavy mesons involve the transformation of a heavy meson into a lighter meson and a lepton pair. These decays are governed by the weak interaction and are therefore subject to the constraints of the Standard Model. The most common leptonic decays of heavy mesons are the decays of the $B$ and $D$ mesons into pions and lepton pairs.

The leptonic decays of heavy mesons can be described by the following effective Lagrangian:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{eff} = \frac{G_F}{\sqrt{2}} V_{ud} \bar{u} \gamma^\mu (1 - \gamma_5) d \bar{e} \gamma_\mu (1 - \gamma_5) \nu_e + h.c.
$$

where $G_F$ is the Fermi constant, $V_{ud}$ is the CKM matrix element, $u$ and $d$ are the up and down quarks, $e$ and $\nu_e$ are the electron and electron neutrino, and $\gamma^\mu$ and $\gamma_5$ are the gamma matrices. This Lagrangian describes the decay of a $B$ or $D$ meson into a pion and a lepton pair.

The leptonic decays of heavy mesons are of particular interest because they provide a direct way to measure the CKM matrix elements. The decay rates of these decays are proportional to the square of the CKM matrix elements, which allows us to determine these elements experimentally.

#### 5.4b Semileptonic Decays of Heavy Mesons

Semileptonic decays of heavy mesons involve the transformation of a heavy meson into a lighter meson and a lepton pair. These decays are also governed by the weak interaction, but unlike leptonic decays, they involve the emission or absorption of a W boson. The most common semileptonic decays of heavy mesons are the decays of the $B$ and $D$ mesons into pions and lepton pairs.

In this limit, the heavy quark behaves as a non-relativistic particle, and the dynamics of the system can be described by a simplified effective theory.

In HQET, the heavy meson is described by a single degree of freedom, the heavy quark. The light degrees of freedom, such as the light quarks and gluons, are integrated out, and their effects are represented by effective fields. The effective Lagrangian for a heavy meson in HQET is given by:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{eff} = \bar{h} (i v \cdot D - m) h + \bar{\chi} (i v \cdot D - m) \chi + \bar{h} \Gamma \chi + h.c.
$$

where $h$ and $\chi$ are the heavy and light quark fields, respectively, $v$ is the four-velocity of the heavy quark, $D$ is the covariant derivative, $m$ is the heavy quark mass, and $\Gamma$ is a matrix of coupling constants. This Lagrangian describes the dynamics of a heavy meson in HQET.

## Chapter: Chapter 6: Chiral Perturbation Theory

### Introduction

In the realm of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the study of the strong nuclear force, the concept of chiral symmetry plays a pivotal role. Chiral symmetry, a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics, is a symmetry of the Dirac equation that describes spin-1/2 particles, such as quarks. In the context of QCD, chiral symmetry is broken, leading to the emergence of pions and other light mesons. This chapter, "Chiral Perturbation Theory," delves into the intricacies of this fascinating topic.

Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) is a low-energy effective field theory that describes the dynamics of pions and other light mesons. It is a powerful tool for studying the low-energy behavior of QCD, where the effects of chiral symmetry breaking are most pronounced. The theory is constructed by systematically expanding the field variables and the resulting equations of motion in powers of the small parameter $p/\Lambda$, where $p$ is a typical momentum of the particles and $\Lambda$ is the scale of chiral symmetry breaking.

This chapter will guide you through the fundamental concepts of ChPT, starting from the basic principles of chiral symmetry and its breaking in QCD. We will then introduce the concept of effective field theories and how they are used to describe the low-energy behavior of quantum systems. The construction of the ChPT Lagrangian will be discussed in detail, including the use of the heavy baryon field and the inclusion of higher-order terms.

We will also explore the applications of ChPT in various areas of particle physics, including the study of pion-pion scattering and the properties of the pion. The chapter will conclude with a discussion on the current status and future prospects of ChPT.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of Chiral Perturbation Theory and its role in the study of quantum chromodynamics.

The heavy-to-heavy form factors are crucial for understanding the semileptonic decays of heavy mesons. These form factors describe the transition of a heavy quark into another heavy quark, and they are crucial for calculating the decay rates of these decays.

The heavy-to-heavy form factors can be described by the following effective Lagrangian:

$$

$$

where $G_F$ is the Fermi constant, $V_{ud}$ is the CKM matrix element, $u$ and $d$ are the up and down quarks, $e$ and $\nu_e$ are the electron and electron neutrino, and $\gamma^\mu$ and $\gamma_5$ are the gamma matrices.

#### 5.5c Form Factor Phenomenology

The form factor phenomenology is a crucial aspect of understanding the dynamics of heavy quark decays. It provides a framework for interpreting the experimental results and making predictions about future measurements.

The form factor phenomenology is based on the concept of the form factor, which is a function that describes the probability amplitude for a heavy quark to decay into a lighter quark. The form factor is denoted by $f(q^2)$, where $q^2$ is the square of the momentum transfer. The form factor is a complex function, and its absolute square gives the probability density for the decay.

The form factor can be decomposed into two components: the vector form factor $f_1(q^2)$ and the axial form factor $f_2(q^2)$. The vector form factor describes the probability amplitude for the heavy quark to decay into a lighter quark with the same spin, while the axial form factor describes the probability amplitude for the heavy quark to decay into a lighter quark with opposite spin.

The form factor phenomenology is based on the assumption that the form factor can be parametrized as a polynomial in $q^2$. The most commonly used parametrization is the BSW (Boyd-Stech-Wise) parametrization, which assumes that the form factor can be written as:

$$
f(q^2) = \frac{f(0)}{1 - q^2/\Lambda^2} \left(1 + a_1 q^2 + a_2 q^4 + \ldots\right)
$$

where $f(0)$ is the form factor at $q^2 = 0$, and $\Lambda$ is a scale parameter that characterizes the decay process. The coefficients $a_1$, $a_2$, etc. are determined by fitting the parametrization to the experimental data.

The form factor phenomenology has been successfully applied to the study of heavy quark decays. It has been used to interpret the experimental results from the NA62 experiment, which studied the decay $K^{+}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\nu\overline{\nu}$. The form factor phenomenology has also been used to make predictions about future measurements, such as the decay $B\rightarrow K^*\nu\overline{\nu}$.

In the next section, we will discuss the heavy-to-light form factors, which describe the transition of a heavy quark into a lighter quark. These form factors are crucial for understanding the semileptonic decays of heavy mesons.

$$
J_\mu = \bar{q}\gamma_\mu q
$$

where $q$ is the quark field. The matrix elements of the current operators between the initial and final states can be written as:

$$
\langle f|J_\mu|i\rangle = \bar{u}_f\gamma_\mu u_i
$$

where $u_i$ and $u_f$ are the wave functions of the initial and final states, respectively.

The form factors can then be expressed in terms of these matrix elements as:

$$
f(q^2) = \frac{\langle f|J_\mu|i\rangle\langle i|J^\mu|f\rangle}{2m_i}
$$

where $m_i$ is the mass of the initial state.

In QCD, the form factors are calculated using the operator product expansion (OPE), which is a method for calculating the matrix elements of the current operators in terms of the local operators. The OPE is based on the assumption that the matrix elements of the local operators are known from the theory of the strong interaction.

The OPE can be written as:

$$
\langle f|J_\mu|i\rangle = \sum_n \langle f|O_n|i\rangle\langle i|O_n^\mu|f\rangle
$$

where $O_n$ are the local operators, and $\langle f|O_n|i\rangle$ and $\langle i|O_n^\mu|f\rangle$ are the matrix elements of the local operators between the initial and final states.

The OPE provides a systematic method for calculating the form factors in QCD. However, it is important to note that the OPE is based on the assumption that the matrix elements of the local operators are known from the theory of the strong interaction. In practice, this assumption is often not completely accurate, and additional corrections are needed to obtain a good agreement with the experimental data.

In the next section, we will discuss the heavy-to-light form factors, which describe the transition of a heavy quark into a lighter quark. These form factors are crucial for understanding the semileptonic decays of heavy mesons.

#### 5.5e Heavy Quark Form Factors in Heavy Quark Effective Theory

In the previous section, we discussed the form factors in the context of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In this section, we will explore the form factors in the context of Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET).

HQET is a non-relativistic effective field theory that describes the behavior of heavy quarks in the limit of large quark masses. It is particularly useful for studying the properties of heavy quarks, such as the form factors, in the context of QCD.

The form factors in HQET are defined in a similar way to those in QCD. They are related to the matrix elements of the current operators between the initial and final states. However, in HQET, the current operators are defined in terms of the non-relativistic quark fields.

The current operators in HQET can be written as:

$$
J_\mu = \bar{q}\gamma_\mu q
$$

where $q$ is the non-relativistic quark field. The matrix elements of the current operators between the initial and final states can be written as:

$$
\langle f|J_\mu|i\rangle = \bar{u}_f\gamma_\mu u_i
$$

where $u_i$ and $u_f$ are the wave functions of the initial and final states, respectively.

The form factors in HQET can then be expressed in terms of these matrix elements as:

$$
f(q^2) = \frac{\langle f|J_\mu|i\rangle\langle i|J^\mu|f\rangle}{2m_i}
$$

where $m_i$ is the mass of the initial state.

In HQET, the form factors are calculated using the non-relativistic expansion of the matrix elements of the current operators. This expansion is based on the assumption that the heavy quark mass is much larger than the typical momentum of the quark.

The non-relativistic expansion can be written as:

$$
\langle f|J_\mu|i\rangle = \bar{u}_f\gamma_\mu u_i = \bar{u}_f\gamma_\mu\frac{1+\slashed{v}}{2}u_i = \frac{1}{2}\bar{u}_f\gamma_\mu u_i + \frac{1}{2m_i}\bar{u}_f\gamma_\mu\slashed{v}u_i + \ldots
$$

where $v$ is the velocity of the heavy quark.

The form factors in HQET are then calculated by keeping only the leading terms in the non-relativistic expansion. This leads to a simplified expression for the form factors, which can be used to make predictions about the heavy quark decays.

In the next section, we will discuss the heavy-to-light form factors, which describe the transition of a heavy quark into a lighter quark. These form factors are crucial for understanding the semileptonic decays of heavy mesons.

This chapter, "Heavy Quarkonium," will delve into the fascinating world of these systems, exploring their characteristics, behavior, and the theoretical frameworks that describe them.

Heavy quarkonium refers to the bound states of heavy quarks, such as charm and beauty, with their antiparticles. These systems are of particular interest due to their relatively large mass, which allows for a simplification of the QCD theory known as non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD). This simplification allows us to make predictions about the behavior of heavy quarkonium systems, which can then be tested experimentally.

The chapter will begin by introducing the concept of heavy quarkonium, discussing its properties and the theoretical frameworks used to describe it. We will then delve into the specifics of charm and beauty quarkonium, exploring their unique characteristics and the experimental techniques used to study them. We will also discuss the role of heavy quarkonium in the study of the strong interaction, and its potential for providing insights into the nature of the vacuum and the behavior of light quarks.

Throughout the chapter, we will use the powerful mathematical language of quantum mechanics and QCD, expressed in the TeX and LaTeX style syntax. For example, we might write the wave function of a heavy quarkonium state as `$\Psi(x,y,z)$`, or the strong interaction Hamiltonian as `$\hat{H}_{int}$`. This will allow us to express complex physical concepts in a clear and precise manner, aiding in the understanding of the material.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of heavy quarkonium systems, their properties, and the theoretical frameworks used to describe them. This knowledge will provide a foundation for further exploration into the fascinating world of quantum chromodynamics.

We will then delve into the applications of NRQCD, discussing how it has been used to study various heavy quark systems. Finally, we will explore the limitations of NRQCD and discuss potential future developments in the field.

### 6.1a NRQCD Lagrangian

The NRQCD Lagrangian is the fundamental equation that governs the behavior of heavy quark systems. It is derived from the QCD Lagrangian by integrating out the light degrees of freedom, resulting in a simplified equation that describes the behavior of the heavy quarks. The NRQCD Lagrangian is given by:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{NRQCD} = \bar{\psi} \left( iD_0 - \frac{\vec{D}^2}{2m} \right) \psi + \frac{1}{2} \bar{\psi} \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{B} \psi + \cdots
$$

where $\psi$ is the heavy quark field, $D_0$ is the time derivative, $\vec{D}$ is the spatial derivative, $m$ is the heavy quark mass, and $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field. The ellipsis represents higher order terms that are neglected in the low-energy regime.

The NRQCD Lagrangian is a non-relativistic equation, meaning that it describes the behavior of heavy quarks at rest or with small velocities. This is in contrast to the relativistic QCD Lagrangian, which describes the behavior of quarks at high velocities. The non-relativistic nature of the NRQCD Lagrangian allows us to neglect certain interactions, such as those involving the electromagnetic field, which are important at high velocities.

The NRQCD Lagrangian is also a perturbative equation, meaning that it is valid at low energies where the heavy quark mass is much larger than the QCD scale. This allows us to make calculations using perturbation theory, which is a powerful tool for studying the behavior of quantum systems.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of NRQCD and discuss how it has been used to study various heavy quark systems.

## Chapter 6: Non-Relativistic QCD




### Section: 6.1 Introduction to Non-Relativistic QCD:

Non-Relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (NRQCD) is a powerful tool for studying the behavior of heavy quark systems, such as heavy quarkonia and heavy quarkonium-like systems. It is a non-perturbative theory that is particularly useful in the low-energy regime, where the heavy quark mass is much larger than the QCD scale. In this section, we will explore the fundamentals of NRQCD, including its basic principles, applications, and limitations.

#### 6.1a NRQCD Lagrangian

The NRQCD Lagrangian is the fundamental equation that governs the behavior of heavy quark systems. It is derived from the QCD Lagrangian by integrating out the light degrees of freedom, resulting in a simplified equation that describes the behavior of the heavy quarks. The NRQCD Lagrangian is given by:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{NRQCD} = \bar{\psi} \left( iD_0 - \frac{\vec{D}^2}{2m} \right) \psi + \frac{1}{2} \bar{\psi} \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{B} \psi + \cdots
$$

where $\psi$ is the heavy quark field, $D_0$ is the time derivative, $\vec{D}$ is the spatial derivative, $m$ is the heavy quark mass, and $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field. The ellipsis represents higher order terms that are neglected in the NRQCD Lagrangian.

The NRQCD Lagrangian is a non-relativistic Lagrangian, meaning that it describes the behavior of heavy quarks at low energies where the effects of relativity are negligible. This is in contrast to the QCD Lagrangian, which is a relativistic Lagrangian that describes the behavior of quarks at all energies. By integrating out the light degrees of freedom, the NRQCD Lagrangian is able to capture the behavior of heavy quarks in a simplified manner.

#### 6.1b Velocity Scaling and Power Counting

One of the key principles of NRQCD is velocity scaling, which is used to determine the order of terms in the NRQCD Lagrangian. Velocity scaling is based on the concept of power counting, which is used to determine the relative importance of different terms in a theory. In NRQCD, power counting is used to determine the order of terms in the NRQCD Lagrangian, with higher order terms being more important than lower order terms.

The power counting scheme used in NRQCD is based on the concept of velocity scaling, where the velocity of a particle is used to determine the order of terms in the Lagrangian. In NRQCD, the velocity of a particle is defined as the ratio of its momentum to its mass, with higher velocities corresponding to higher orders in the Lagrangian. This allows for the systematic expansion of the NRQCD Lagrangian in terms of the velocity of the heavy quarks.

The power counting scheme used in NRQCD is also closely related to the concept of dimensionality, where the dimensions of the fields and operators in the Lagrangian are used to determine their order. In NRQCD, the dimensions of the fields and operators are related to their velocity, with higher dimensions corresponding to higher orders in the Lagrangian. This allows for the systematic expansion of the NRQCD Lagrangian in terms of the dimensions of the fields and operators.

#### 6.1c NRQCD and Heavy Quarkonia

One of the key applications of NRQCD is in the study of heavy quarkonia, which are bound states of heavy quarks. In NRQCD, the behavior of heavy quarkonia is described by the NRQCD Lagrangian, which includes terms that describe the interactions between the heavy quarks and the surrounding QCD fields. These interactions are responsible for the binding of the heavy quarks and the formation of the heavy quarkonium state.

The NRQCD Lagrangian also includes terms that describe the decay of heavy quarkonia into lighter particles, such as gluons and light quarks. These terms are important for understanding the decay mechanisms of heavy quarkonia and for predicting their decay rates. By studying the behavior of heavy quarkonia in NRQCD, we can gain insight into the underlying dynamics of heavy quark systems and their interactions with the surrounding QCD fields.

In conclusion, NRQCD is a powerful tool for studying the behavior of heavy quark systems, such as heavy quarkonia and heavy quarkonium-like systems. By integrating out the light degrees of freedom and using velocity scaling and power counting, the NRQCD Lagrangian is able to capture the behavior of heavy quarks in a simplified manner. This allows for a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics of heavy quark systems and their interactions with the surrounding QCD fields.

$$

where $\psi$ is the heavy quark field, $D_0$ is the time derivative, $\vec{D}$ is the spatial derivative, $m$ is the heavy quark mass, and $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field. The ellipsis represents higher order terms that are neglected in the NRQCD Lagrangian.

This is in contrast to the QCD Lagrangian, which is a relativistic Lagrangian that describes the behavior of quarks at all energies. By integrating out the light degrees of freedom, the NRQCD Lagrangian is able to capture the behavior of heavy quarks in a simplified manner.

#### 6.1b Velocity Scaling and Power Counting

One of the key principles of NRQCD is velocity scaling, which is used to determine the order of terms in the NRQCD Lagrangian. Velocity scaling is based on the concept of power counting, which is used to determine the relative importance of different terms in the Lagrangian. In NRQCD, the power counting is based on the heavy quark mass $m$ and the relative velocities of the quarks.

The power counting in NRQCD is based on the following assumptions:

1. The heavy quark mass $m$ is much larger than the QCD scale $\Lambda_{QCD}$.
2. The relative velocities of the quarks are much smaller than the speed of light.
3. The coupling constant $g$ is of order 1.

Using these assumptions, the power counting in NRQCD is given by:

$$
\text{Power}(m^n v^k) = n + k
$$

where $m$ is the heavy quark mass, $v$ is the relative velocity, and $n$ and $k$ are integers. This power counting allows us to determine the order of terms in the NRQCD Lagrangian, with terms of higher power being more important.

#### 6.1c Non-Relativistic Bound States

One of the key applications of NRQCD is in studying non-relativistic bound states, such as heavy quarkonia and heavy quarkonium-like systems. These bound states are formed when two heavy quarks are bound together by the strong force. In NRQCD, these bound states are described by the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation:

$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu} \nabla^2 \psi + V(r) \psi = E \psi
$$

where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, $\mu$ is the reduced mass of the bound state, $V(r)$ is the potential energy between the quarks, and $E$ is the energy of the bound state.

The non-relativistic Schrödinger equation allows us to study the properties of these bound states, such as their energy levels and wave functions. By including the effects of the strong force and the Coulomb interaction between the quarks, we can accurately predict the properties of these bound states.

In addition to studying the properties of these bound states, NRQCD also allows us to study their decays. The decays of these bound states are governed by the non-relativistic decay equation:

$$
\Gamma = \frac{1}{\mu} \int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3} \frac{1}{2E_p} |\mathcal{M}|^2 (2\pi)^4 \delta(E_p - E_i)
$$

where $\Gamma$ is the decay width, $p$ is the momentum of the decay products, $E_p$ is the energy of the decay products, $\mathcal{M}$ is the decay matrix element, and $E_i$ is the energy of the initial state.

By studying the decays of these bound states, we can gain insight into the underlying dynamics of the strong force and the nature of the bound states themselves.

### Conclusion

In this section, we have explored the fundamentals of Non-Relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (NRQCD). We have discussed the NRQCD Lagrangian, velocity scaling, and power counting, as well as the applications of NRQCD in studying non-relativistic bound states. NRQCD is a powerful tool for studying heavy quark systems and has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of these systems. In the next section, we will delve deeper into the applications of NRQCD in studying specific systems, such as heavy quarkonia and heavy quarkonium-like systems.


## Chapter 6: Non-Relativistic QCD:




#### 6.2a Power Counting in NRQCD

Power counting is a crucial aspect of Non-Relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (NRQCD) that allows us to systematically organize and classify terms in the NRQCD Lagrangian. It is based on the concept of velocity scaling, where terms are classified based on their dependence on the heavy quark velocity. This is important because it allows us to identify the dominant terms at different energy scales, and to systematically neglect higher order terms that are suppressed by powers of the heavy quark velocity.

The power counting scheme in NRQCD is based on the following rules:

1. Terms are classified based on their dependence on the heavy quark velocity $v$. The leading terms are those that are proportional to $v^0$, followed by subleading terms proportional to $v^1$, and so on.
2. The leading terms are those that are most important at low energies, where the effects of relativity are negligible. These terms are typically associated with the non-relativistic dynamics of the heavy quarks.
3. Subleading terms are progressively less important at low energies, and are typically associated with the relativistic corrections to the non-relativistic dynamics.
4. Higher order terms, which are proportional to $v^2$, $v^3$, and so on, are even less important and can often be neglected.

By applying these rules, we can systematically organize the terms in the NRQCD Lagrangian and identify the leading terms that govern the behavior of heavy quarks at low energies. This allows us to construct an effective field theory that captures the essential dynamics of heavy quark systems, while neglecting the details of the underlying QCD dynamics that are not relevant at low energies.

In the next section, we will explore some specific examples of power counting in NRQCD, and discuss how it can be used to systematically derive the effective field theory for heavy quark systems.

#### 6.2b Power Counting Rules

The power counting rules in Non-Relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (NRQCD) are based on the concept of velocity scaling, as discussed in the previous section. These rules allow us to systematically organize and classify terms in the NRQCD Lagrangian, and to identify the dominant terms at different energy scales.

The power counting rules in NRQCD are as follows:

1. The leading terms are those that are proportional to $v^0$, where $v$ is the heavy quark velocity. These terms are most important at low energies, where the effects of relativity are negligible.
2. The subleading terms are those that are proportional to $v^1$. These terms are progressively less important at low energies, and are typically associated with the relativistic corrections to the non-relativistic dynamics.
3. The higher order terms are those that are proportional to $v^2$, $v^3$, and so on. These terms are even less important at low energies, and can often be neglected.

By applying these rules, we can systematically organize the terms in the NRQCD Lagrangian and identify the leading terms that govern the behavior of heavy quarks at low energies. This allows us to construct an effective field theory that captures the essential dynamics of heavy quark systems, while neglecting the details of the underlying QCD dynamics that are not relevant at low energies.

In the next section, we will explore some specific examples of power counting in NRQCD, and discuss how it can be used to systematically derive the effective field theory for heavy quark systems.

#### 6.2c Power Counting in Heavy Quarkonium

In the context of Non-Relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (NRQCD), power counting is a crucial tool for understanding the behavior of heavy quarkonium systems. Heavy quarkonium refers to the bound state of a heavy quark and its antiquark, such as the $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ particles.

The power counting in heavy quarkonium is based on the same principles as the power counting in NRQCD in general. The leading terms are those that are proportional to $v^0$, where $v$ is the heavy quark velocity. These terms are most important at low energies, where the effects of relativity are negligible. The subleading terms are those that are proportional to $v^1$, and so on.

However, in the case of heavy quarkonium, there are some additional considerations due to the specific properties of these systems. One of these is the Coulomb potential between the heavy quark and its antiquark, which leads to a long-range attraction between them. This potential is proportional to $1/r$, where $r$ is the distance between the quark and the antiquark. As a result, the leading terms in the power counting for heavy quarkonium often involve terms proportional to $1/r^n$, where $n$ is a positive integer.

Another important consideration is the spin of the heavy quarkonium system. The spin of the system can be either 0 or 1, depending on whether the quark and the antiquark have parallel or antiparallel spin. This leads to different power counting rules for the leading terms in the two cases.

In the next section, we will explore some specific examples of power counting in heavy quarkonium, and discuss how it can be used to systematically derive the effective field theory for heavy quarkonium systems.




#### 6.2b Matching Conditions for NRQCD

In the previous section, we discussed the power counting rules in Non-Relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (NRQCD). These rules allow us to systematically organize and classify terms in the NRQCD Lagrangian. In this section, we will delve deeper into the matching conditions for NRQCD, which are crucial for ensuring the validity of the effective field theory.

The matching conditions in NRQCD are derived from the requirement that the effective field theory must accurately describe the physical system at low energies. This is achieved by ensuring that the effective field theory matches onto the underlying theory at high energies, where the effects of relativity are significant.

The matching conditions for NRQCD can be summarized as follows:

1. The leading terms in the NRQCD Lagrangian must match onto the leading terms in the underlying QCD Lagrangian at high energies. This ensures that the effective field theory accurately captures the dynamics of the physical system at low energies.
2. The subleading terms in the NRQCD Lagrangian must match onto the subleading terms in the underlying QCD Lagrangian at high energies. This ensures that the effects of relativity are properly accounted for in the effective field theory.
3. Higher order terms in the NRQCD Lagrangian can often be neglected, as they are less important at low energies and can be systematically removed without affecting the validity of the effective field theory.

By satisfying these matching conditions, we can ensure that the effective field theory accurately describes the physical system at low energies, while neglecting the details of the underlying QCD dynamics that are not relevant at low energies.

In the next section, we will explore some specific examples of matching conditions in NRQCD, and discuss how they can be used to systematically derive the effective field theory for heavy quark systems.

#### 6.2c Power Counting in Heavy Quarkonium

In the previous sections, we have discussed the power counting rules and matching conditions for Non-Relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (NRQCD). These concepts are crucial for understanding the behavior of heavy quarkonium systems, which are bound states of heavy quarks and antiquarks.

The power counting in heavy quarkonium is based on the same principles as in NRQCD. The leading terms are those that are most important at low energies, where the effects of relativity are negligible. These terms are typically associated with the non-relativistic dynamics of the heavy quarks. Subleading terms are progressively less important at low energies and are typically associated with the relativistic corrections to the non-relativistic dynamics.

The matching conditions for heavy quarkonium are also similar to those in NRQCD. The leading terms in the effective field theory must match onto the leading terms in the underlying QCD Lagrangian at high energies. The subleading terms must match onto the subleading terms in the underlying QCD Lagrangian at high energies. Higher order terms can often be neglected, as they are less important at low energies and can be systematically removed without affecting the validity of the effective field theory.

In the context of heavy quarkonium, the matching conditions are particularly important due to the presence of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$. The matching conditions ensure that the effective field theory accurately describes the physical system at low energies, while accounting for the effects of relativity at high energies.

In the next section, we will explore some specific examples of power counting and matching conditions in heavy quarkonium, and discuss how they can be used to systematically derive the effective field theory for heavy quarkonium systems.




#### 6.2c Renormalization Group Evolution in NRQCD

In the previous section, we discussed the power counting rules and matching conditions in Non-Relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (NRQCD). These rules and conditions are crucial for understanding the behavior of heavy quarkonium systems, which are of particular interest in the study of QCD. In this section, we will explore the concept of renormalization group evolution in NRQCD and its implications for heavy quarkonium systems.

The renormalization group (RG) is a mathematical framework that allows us to systematically account for the effects of quantum fluctuations in a theory. In the context of NRQCD, the RG is used to account for the effects of quantum fluctuations in the heavy quarkonium system. This is particularly important because heavy quarkonium systems are characterized by a large mass scale, which makes the effects of quantum fluctuations more pronounced.

The RG evolution in NRQCD is governed by the renormalization group equation (RGE), which describes how the effective coupling constant of the theory changes with energy. The RGE is given by:

$$
\frac{d g}{d \ln \mu} = \beta(g)
$$

where $g$ is the effective coupling constant, $\mu$ is the renormalization scale, and $\beta(g)$ is the beta function, which describes the energy dependence of the effective coupling constant.

The RG evolution in NRQCD is particularly important for heavy quarkonium systems because it allows us to account for the effects of quantum fluctuations at different energy scales. This is crucial for understanding the behavior of heavy quarkonium systems, which are characterized by a large mass scale and are therefore sensitive to quantum fluctuations at different energy scales.

In the context of heavy quarkonium systems, the RG evolution can be used to account for the effects of quantum fluctuations at different energy scales. This is particularly important because heavy quarkonium systems are characterized by a large mass scale, which makes the effects of quantum fluctuations more pronounced. By accounting for the RG evolution, we can better understand the behavior of heavy quarkonium systems and make more accurate predictions about their properties.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of renormalization group evolution in more detail and discuss its implications for heavy quarkonium systems.




#### 6.3a Quarkonium Bound States

Quarkonium, as we have discussed, is a flavorless meson composed of a heavy quark and its own antiquark. The most well-known examples of quarkonium are the J/ψ meson (charmonium) and the Υ meson (bottomonium). These particles are of particular interest in the study of QCD due to their unique properties and behavior.

The J/ψ meson, for instance, is a spin-1 particle with a mass of approximately 3.1 GeV. It is the ground state of charmonium, meaning it is the lowest energy state of a charm quark and a charm antiquark. The Υ meson, on the other hand, is a spin-2 particle with a mass of approximately 9.4 GeV. It is the ground state of bottomonium, meaning it is the lowest energy state of a bottom quark and a bottom antiquark.

The existence of these particles is a direct consequence of the power counting rules and matching conditions in NRQCD. These rules and conditions allow us to systematically account for the effects of quantum fluctuations in the heavy quarkonium system, and they are crucial for understanding the behavior of these particles.

The power counting rules in NRQCD dictate that the leading order contribution to the J/ψ meson and the Υ meson comes from the tree-level matching condition. This condition is given by:

$$
\frac{C_F}{2} \alpha_s \langle \bar{q} q \rangle = \frac{1}{2} m \langle \bar{q} q \rangle
$$

where $C_F$ is the color factor, $\alpha_s$ is the strong coupling constant, $\langle \bar{q} q \rangle$ is the quark condensate, and $m$ is the mass of the heavy quark. This condition is crucial for understanding the behavior of the J/ψ meson and the Υ meson, as it determines their masses and decay rates.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of quarkonium spectroscopy, which is the study of the energy levels and transitions of quarkonium particles. This is a crucial aspect of the study of QCD, as it allows us to understand the behavior of heavy quarkonium systems in more detail.

#### 6.3b Quarkonium Spectroscopy

Quarkonium spectroscopy is a powerful tool for studying the properties of heavy quarkonium systems. It involves the study of the energy levels and transitions of quarkonium particles, and it is crucial for understanding the behavior of these particles in QCD.

The energy levels of quarkonium particles are determined by the power counting rules and matching conditions in NRQCD. These rules and conditions allow us to systematically account for the effects of quantum fluctuations in the heavy quarkonium system, and they are crucial for understanding the behavior of these particles.

The energy levels of the J/ψ meson and the Υ meson, for instance, are determined by the tree-level matching condition. This condition is given by:

$$
\frac{C_F}{2} \alpha_s \langle \bar{q} q \rangle = \frac{1}{2} m \langle \bar{q} q \rangle
$$

where $C_F$ is the color factor, $\alpha_s$ is the strong coupling constant, $\langle \bar{q} q \rangle$ is the quark condensate, and $m$ is the mass of the heavy quark. This condition determines the mass of the J/ψ meson and the Υ meson, and it also determines their decay rates.

The transitions between these energy levels, on the other hand, are determined by the one-loop matching conditions in NRQCD. These conditions account for the effects of quantum fluctuations at the one-loop level, and they are crucial for understanding the behavior of quarkonium particles in QCD.

The one-loop matching conditions in NRQCD are given by:

$$
\frac{C_F}{2} \alpha_s \langle \bar{q} q \rangle = \frac{1}{2} m \langle \bar{q} q \rangle + \frac{\alpha_s}{4} \langle \bar{q} q \rangle^2
$$

where $\alpha_s$ is the strong coupling constant, $\langle \bar{q} q \rangle$ is the quark condensate, and $m$ is the mass of the heavy quark. This condition accounts for the effects of quantum fluctuations at the one-loop level, and it is crucial for understanding the behavior of quarkonium particles in QCD.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of quarkonium spectroscopy in more detail, and we will discuss the techniques used for studying the energy levels and transitions of quarkonium particles.

#### 6.3c Quarkonium Decay

Quarkonium decay is a crucial aspect of quarkonium spectroscopy. It involves the study of the decay of quarkonium particles into lighter particles, and it is crucial for understanding the behavior of these particles in QCD.

The decay of quarkonium particles is determined by the power counting rules and matching conditions in NRQCD. These rules and conditions allow us to systematically account for the effects of quantum fluctuations in the heavy quarkonium system, and they are crucial for understanding the behavior of these particles.

The decay of the J/ψ meson and the Υ meson, for instance, is determined by the one-loop matching conditions in NRQCD. These conditions account for the effects of quantum fluctuations at the one-loop level, and they are crucial for understanding the behavior of these particles in QCD.

The one-loop matching conditions in NRQCD are given by:

$$
\frac{C_F}{2} \alpha_s \langle \bar{q} q \rangle = \frac{1}{2} m \langle \bar{q} q \rangle + \frac{\alpha_s}{4} \langle \bar{q} q \rangle^2
$$

where $\alpha_s$ is the strong coupling constant, $\langle \bar{q} q \rangle$ is the quark condensate, and $m$ is the mass of the heavy quark. This condition accounts for the effects of quantum fluctuations at the one-loop level, and it is crucial for understanding the behavior of quarkonium particles in QCD.

The decay of quarkonium particles is also influenced by the concept of quarkonium mixing. Quarkonium mixing refers to the phenomenon where a quarkonium state is composed of a mixture of different quarkonium states. This is due to the fact that the potential energy of a quarkonium state is not a simple function of the quarkonium state, but rather a function of the quarkonium state and the quarkonium state.

The concept of quarkonium mixing is crucial for understanding the behavior of quarkonium particles in QCD. It allows us to account for the effects of quantum fluctuations at the one-loop level, and it is crucial for understanding the behavior of these particles in QCD.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of quarkonium mixing in more detail, and we will discuss the techniques used for studying the decay of quarkonium particles.

## Chapter 7: Heavy Quark Effective Theory

### Introduction

In the realm of quantum chromodynamics, the study of heavy quarks and their interactions with the surrounding gluonic medium is a topic of great interest. This chapter, "Heavy Quark Effective Theory," delves into the intricacies of this subject, providing a comprehensive guide to understanding the effective field theory of heavy quarks.

The heavy quark effective theory (HQET) is a powerful tool that allows us to study the behavior of heavy quarks in a systematic and controlled manner. It is particularly useful in the context of non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics, where the heavy quark's velocity is much less than the speed of light. In this regime, the heavy quark's dynamics can be described by a non-relativistic effective field theory, which simplifies the calculations and provides a clearer understanding of the physical phenomena.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental principles of HQET, starting from its basic assumptions and gradually building up to more complex concepts. We will discuss the HQET Lagrangian, the heavy quark spinor, and the concept of heavy quark symmetry. We will also delve into the applications of HQET in various areas of quantum chromodynamics, such as the study of heavy quarkonium and the dynamics of heavy quarks in a medium.

The chapter will also cover the mathematical formalism of HQET, including the derivation of the HQET Lagrangian and the equations of motion for the heavy quark. We will use the powerful mathematical language of quantum field theory, including the use of Dirac matrices and color space indices. All mathematical expressions will be rendered using the MathJax library, ensuring a clear and precise presentation of the material.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the heavy quark effective theory and its applications in quantum chromodynamics. They should be able to apply the principles of HQET to study the behavior of heavy quarks in various physical scenarios, and they should be equipped with the mathematical tools necessary to carry out these calculations.

#### 6.3b Quarkonium Mass Spectrum

The mass spectrum of quarkonium is a crucial aspect of non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD). It provides a means to study the behavior of heavy quarkonium systems, such as the J/ψ meson and the Υ meson, in more detail. The mass spectrum is determined by the power counting rules and matching conditions in NRQCD, which allow us to systematically account for the effects of quantum fluctuations.

The mass spectrum of quarkonium can be understood in terms of the energy levels of the system. The ground state, or lowest energy level, is the J/ψ meson for charmonium and the Υ meson for bottomonium. The first excited state, or next highest energy level, is the ψ(2S) meson for charmonium and the Υ(1S) meson for bottomonium. The second excited state, or next highest energy level after the first excited state, is the ψ(3S) meson for charmonium and the Υ(2S) meson for bottomonium, and so on.

The energy levels of the quarkonium system can be calculated using the Schrödinger equation, which describes the wave-like behavior of particles. The Schrödinger equation for the quarkonium system is given by:

$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu} \frac{d^2\psi}{dr^2} + \frac{1}{2} \mu \omega^2 r^2 \psi + V(r) \psi = E \psi
$$

where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, $\mu$ is the reduced mass of the quarkonium system, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $r$ is the radial distance, $\psi$ is the wave function of the system, $V(r)$ is the potential energy, and $E$ is the energy of the system.

The potential energy $V(r)$ in the quarkonium system is determined by the Coulomb potential, which accounts for the attractive force between the heavy quark and the heavy antiquark. The potential energy is given by:

$$
V(r) = -\frac{\alpha}{r}
$$

where $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant.

The decay of quarkonium is determined by the power counting rules and matching conditions in NRQCD, which allow us to systematically account for the effects of quantum fluctuations.

The decay of quarkonium can be understood in terms of the transition of the system from one energy level to another. The ground state, or lowest energy level, is the J/ψ meson for charmonium and the Υ meson for bottomonium.

The transition from one energy level to another is governed by the Schrödinger equation, which describes the wave-like behavior of particles. The Schrödinger equation for the quarkonium system is given by:

$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu} \frac{d^2\psi}{dr^2} + \frac{1}{2} \mu \omega^2 r^2 \psi + V(r) \psi = E \psi
$$

$$
V(r) = -\frac{\alpha}{r}
$$

where $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant.

The transition from one energy level to another is governed by the transition matrix element, which is given by:

$$
\langle \psi_n | V(r) | \psi_m \rangle
$$

where $\psi_n$ and $\psi_m$ are the wave functions of the initial and final states, respectively.

The transition matrix element can be calculated using the Schrödinger equation and the Coulomb potential. The transition matrix element gives the probability of the transition from one energy level to another, which can be compared to experimental data to test the predictions of NRQCD.

#### 6.3c Quarkonium Decays and Production

Quarkonium decays and production are crucial aspects of non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD). They provide a means to study the behavior of heavy quarkonium systems, such as the J/ψ meson and the Υ meson, in more detail. The decays and production of quarkonium are determined by the power counting rules and matching conditions in NRQCD, which allow us to systematically account for the effects of quantum fluctuations.

The decays of quarkonium can be understood in terms of the energy levels of the system. The ground state, or lowest energy level, is the J/ψ meson for charmonium and the Υ meson for bottomonium.

$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu} \frac{d^2\psi}{dr^2} + \frac{1}{2} \mu \omega^2 r^2 \psi + V(r) \psi = E \psi

#### 6.4a Radiative and Electromagnetic Decays

The decays of heavy quarkonia, such as the J/ψ meson and the Υ meson, are not only governed by the energy levels of the system but also by the interaction of the quarkonium system with electromagnetic radiation. This interaction can lead to radiative and electromagnetic decays of the quarkonium system.

Radiative decays of quarkonium involve the emission of a photon. The probability of radiative decay is proportional to the square of the electric charge of the quarkonium system. This is because the emission of a photon is governed by the electromagnetic interaction, which is proportional to the electric charge. The probability of radiative decay can be calculated using the Schrödinger equation, as discussed in the previous section.

Electromagnetic decays of quarkonium, on the other hand, involve the conversion of the quarkonium system into another system with a different electric charge. This can occur through the process of annihilation, where the heavy quark and the heavy antiquark annihilate each other and create a photon. The probability of electromagnetic decay can also be calculated using the Schrödinger equation.

The decays of quarkonium can be studied experimentally by observing the photons emitted in the decays. This can be done using techniques such as the Dalitz plot, which is a graphical representation of the energy distribution of the photons emitted in the decay. The Dalitz plot can provide valuable information about the properties of the quarkonium system, such as its mass and width.

In the next section, we will discuss the production of quarkonium, which is another important aspect of non-relativistic QCD.

#### 6.4b Heavy Quarkonium Production

The production of heavy quarkonia, such as the J/ψ meson and the Υ meson, is a crucial aspect of non-relativistic QCD.

They provide a measure of the probability of a quarkonium system to decay into a particular state. The decay rates can be calculated using the power counting rules and matching conditions of the effective field theories.

The decay rates of heavy quarkonia can be calculated using the Schrödinger equation, which describes the time evolution of a quantum system. The Schrödinger equation for a quarkonium system can be written as:

$$
i\hbar\frac{d}{dt}|\psi(t)\rangle = H|\psi(t)\rangle
$$

where $|\psi(t)\rangle$ is the state vector of the quarkonium system, $H$ is the Hamiltonian operator, and $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant. The Hamiltonian operator $H$ includes the potential energy of the quarkonium system, which is responsible for the binding of the quark and antiquark.

The decay rates of heavy quarkonia can also be calculated using the Fermi's Golden Rule, which provides a formula for the transition rate between two states. The transition rate $W_{if}$ from an initial state $|i\rangle$ to a final state $|f\rangle$ can be written as:

$$
W_{if} = \frac{2\pi}{\hbar}|\langle f|H'|i\rangle|^2\rho(E_f)
$$

where $H'$ is the perturbation Hamiltonian, $\langle f|H'|i\rangle$ is the matrix element of the perturbation Hamiltonian between the initial and final states, and $\rho(E_f)$ is the density of states at the energy $E_f$.

The decay rates of heavy quarkonia are a complex process that involves the interplay of various physical phenomena, including the strong interaction, the electromagnetic interaction, and the weak interaction.

## Chapter 7: Heavy Quark Effective Theory

### Introduction

In the realm of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the study of heavy quarks and their interactions with the surrounding gluonic medium is a topic of great interest. This chapter, "Heavy Quark Effective Theory," delves into the intricacies of this subject, providing a comprehensive guide to understanding the behavior of heavy quarks in QCD.

Heavy quarks, such as charm and bottom quarks, are particularly interesting due to their unique properties. Their mass is significantly larger than the mass of the light quarks (up, down, and strange), and they are therefore less affected by the Pauli exclusion principle. This allows them to exhibit a range of interesting phenomena, such as the formation of bound states known as quarkonia.

The effective theory of heavy quarks is a powerful tool for studying these phenomena. It is a low-energy approximation of QCD that simplifies the calculations by neglecting certain terms that are suppressed by the heavy quark mass. This allows us to make predictions about the behavior of heavy quarks in a variety of scenarios, from the decay of quarkonia to the production of heavy quarks in high-energy collisions.

In this chapter, we will explore the principles and applications of heavy quark effective theory. We will start by introducing the basic concepts and assumptions of the theory, and then move on to discuss its applications in various areas of QCD. We will also delve into the mathematical formalism of the theory, using the powerful language of effective field theories.

Whether you are a student seeking to deepen your understanding of QCD, a researcher looking for a comprehensive reference, or simply a curious reader, this chapter will provide you with a solid foundation in the fascinating world of heavy quark effective theory.




#### 6.4b Leptonic and Semileptonic Decays

The decays of heavy quarkonia, such as the J/ψ meson and the Υ meson, can also occur through leptonic and semileptonic processes. These decays involve the conversion of the quarkonium system into a system of leptons and antileptons, or into a system of leptons and quarks.

Leptonic decays of quarkonium involve the conversion of the quarkonium system into a system of leptons and antileptons. This can occur through the process of annihilation, where the heavy quark and the heavy antiquark annihilate each other and create a pair of leptons and antileptons. The probability of leptonic decay can be calculated using the Schrödinger equation, as discussed in the previous section.

Semileptonic decays of quarkonium, on the other hand, involve the conversion of the quarkonium system into a system of leptons and quarks. This can occur through the process of quark-antiquark annihilation, where the heavy quark and the heavy antiquark annihilate each other and create a lepton, an antilepton, and a quark. The probability of semileptonic decay can also be calculated using the Schrödinger equation.

The decays of quarkonium can be studied experimentally by observing the leptons and quarks emitted in the decays. This can be done using techniques such as the Dalitz plot, which is a graphical representation of the energy distribution of the leptons and quarks emitted in the decay. The Dalitz plot can provide valuable information about the properties of the quarkonium system, such as its mass and width.

In the next section, we will discuss the production of heavy quarkonia, which is another important aspect of non-relativistic QCD.

#### 6.4c Heavy Quarkonium Decay Modes

The decays of heavy quarkonia, such as the J/ψ meson and the Υ meson, can occur through various modes. These modes can be broadly classified into two categories: non-leptonic and leptonic decays. Non-leptonic decays involve the conversion of the quarkonium system into a system of hadrons, while leptonic decays involve the conversion of the quarkonium system into a system of leptons and antileptons.

## Chapter 7: Heavy Quark Effective Theory

### Introduction

The study of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is a fundamental aspect of modern physics, providing a theoretical framework for understanding the strong nuclear force that binds particles together. In this chapter, we delve into the realm of heavy quark effective theory, a powerful tool that simplifies the analysis of QCD at scales where the heavy quark mass is much larger than the QCD scale.

Heavy quark effective theory (HQET) is a low-energy effective field theory that describes the behavior of heavy quarks and their interactions with light degrees of freedom. It is particularly useful in the study of heavy quarkonium systems, such as the J/ψ and Υ mesons, which are composed of a heavy quark and an antiquark. The theory allows us to systematically expand the QCD Lagrangian in powers of the inverse heavy quark mass, providing a simplified description of the system that is valid at scales much smaller than the heavy quark mass.

In this chapter, we will explore the principles and applications of heavy quark effective theory. We will begin by introducing the basic concepts of the theory, including the heavy quark spinor and the HQET Lagrangian. We will then discuss the symmetries of the theory and how they are used to derive the equations of motion. We will also examine the interactions of heavy quarks with light degrees of freedom, including gluons and light quarks.

Finally, we will discuss some of the applications of heavy quark effective theory in the study of heavy quarkonium systems. This includes the calculation of decay rates, cross sections, and other physical quantities. We will also discuss the role of HQET in the study of heavy flavor physics at collider experiments, such as the NA62 experiment and the Belle II experiment.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the principles and applications of heavy quark effective theory. They should also be able to apply these concepts to the study of heavy quarkonium systems and other aspects of heavy flavor physics.




#### 6.4c Hadronic and Inclusive Decays

In addition to leptonic decays, heavy quarkonia can also undergo hadronic decays. These decays involve the conversion of the quarkonium system into a system of hadrons, which are particles composed of quarks and antiquarks. The most common hadronic decay mode for heavy quarkonia is the three-body decay into a pair of pions and a neutral pion.

The probability of hadronic decay can be calculated using the Schrödinger equation, as discussed in the previous section. However, the calculation is more complex due to the presence of multiple particles in the final state. The Schrödinger equation can be solved numerically to obtain the probability of hadronic decay.

Inclusive decays of heavy quarkonia involve the conversion of the quarkonium system into a system of hadrons, but the specific particles in the final state are not specified. The probability of inclusive decay can be calculated using the Schrödinger equation, but it is more challenging due to the large number of possible final states.

The decays of heavy quarkonia can be studied experimentally by observing the hadrons emitted in the decays. This can be done using techniques such as the Dalitz plot, which is a graphical representation of the energy distribution of the hadrons emitted in the decay. The Dalitz plot can provide valuable information about the properties of the quarkonium system, such as its mass and width.

In the next section, we will discuss the production of heavy quarkonia, which is another important aspect of non-relativistic QCD.

#### 6.4c Heavy Quarkonium Decay Modes

The decays of heavy quarkonia can occur through various modes, including hadronic decays and inclusive decays. However, there are also specific decay modes that are unique to heavy quarkonia. These include the decays into charmonium and bottomonium states, as well as the decays into lighter quarkonium states.

The decays into charmonium and bottomonium states are particularly interesting due to their potential for producing new particles. For example, the decay of a heavy quarkonium state into a charmonium state can result in the production of a new particle, known as a charmonium hybrid. This particle is a bound state of a charm quark, an anticharm quark, and a gluon, and it has been predicted by various models of non-relativistic QCD.

The decays into lighter quarkonium states, on the other hand, can provide valuable information about the properties of the heavy quarkonium state. For instance, the decay of a heavy quarkonium state into a lighter quarkonium state can be used to measure the mass of the heavy quarkonium state. This is because the mass of the heavy quarkonium state can be determined from the energy difference between the initial and final states, which can be calculated using the Schrödinger equation.

In addition to these specific decay modes, heavy quarkonia can also undergo radiative decays, where a photon is emitted in the decay process. These decays can provide information about the electromagnetic properties of the heavy quarkonium state.

The decays of heavy quarkonia can be studied experimentally by observing the particles emitted in the decays. This can be done using techniques such as the Dalitz plot, which is a graphical representation of the energy distribution of the particles emitted in the decay. The Dalitz plot can provide valuable information about the properties of the heavy quarkonium state, such as its mass and width.

In the next section, we will discuss the production of heavy quarkonia, which is another important aspect of non-relativistic QCD.

The effective field theory (EFT) for quarkonia is a powerful tool for studying the properties of heavy quarkonia, such as charmonium and bottomonium. It is based on the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) framework, which allows us to approximate the motion of the quarks in the quarkonium system as non-relativistic. This is possible because the speed of the charm and bottom quarks in their respective quarkonia is sufficiently small, estimated to be roughly 0.3 times the speed of light for charmonia and roughly 0.1 times the speed of light for bottomonia.

The EFT for quarkonia is constructed by expanding the Hamiltonian of the system in powers of the velocity of the quarks and their derivatives. This expansion is valid when the quarkonium system is in a state with low relative momentum between the quarks. The leading term in the expansion is the Coulomb term, which describes the long-range attraction between the quarks. This term is responsible for the binding of the quarks and the formation of the quarkonium state.

The EFT for quarkonia can be used to calculate various properties of the quarkonium system, such as its mass, width, and transition rates between different states. It has been successfully applied to the study of charmonium and bottomonium states, providing valuable insights into their properties and behavior.

One of the key advantages of the EFT for quarkonia is that it allows us to make predictions about the properties of the quarkonium system that can be tested experimentally. For example, the EFT can be used to predict the mass of the quarkonium state, which can then be compared with the experimental measurements. This provides a powerful way to test the predictions of the theory and to gain a deeper understanding of the quarkonium system.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will be introducing the concept of Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET), a powerful tool in the study of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). SCET is an effective field theory that allows us to systematically study the dynamics of QCD at different energy scales. It is particularly useful in the study of high-energy collisions, where the dynamics of the system can be complex and difficult to analyze.

SCET is based on the idea of factorization, which is a fundamental principle in QCD. Factorization allows us to break down the dynamics of a system into smaller, more manageable pieces. In the case of SCET, we factorize the dynamics of a system into two parts: the soft dynamics, which are the low-energy dynamics, and the collinear dynamics, which are the high-energy dynamics.

The soft dynamics are described by the Soft Collinear Effective Theory, while the collinear dynamics are described by the Collinear Effective Theory. By studying these two theories separately, we can gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of QCD at different energy scales.

In this chapter, we will first introduce the basic concepts of SCET, including the definition of soft and collinear modes, and the factorization of the QCD Lagrangian. We will then discuss the properties of SCET, including its renormalizability and the role of symmetries in SCET. Finally, we will discuss some applications of SCET, including its use in the study of high-energy collisions and its role in the development of other effective field theories.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the basics of SCET and its role in the study of QCD. This will provide a strong foundation for the more detailed discussions of SCET in the following chapters. So let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of Soft Collinear Effective Theory.




### Section: 7.1 Introduction to Soft-Collinear Effective Theory:

Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) is a powerful tool in the study of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). It allows us to systematically study the dynamics of QCD at different energy scales, particularly in high-energy collisions where the dynamics can be complex and difficult to analyze. SCET is based on the idea of factorization, which is a fundamental principle in QCD. Factorization allows us to break down the dynamics of a system into smaller, more manageable pieces. In the case of SCET, we factorize the dynamics of a system into two parts: the soft dynamics, which are the low-energy dynamics, and the collinear dynamics, which are the high-energy dynamics.

#### 7.1a Introduction to SCET

The Soft Collinear Effective Theory is defined by the Soft Collinear Lagrangian, which describes the dynamics of soft and collinear modes in QCD. Soft modes are particles with low energy, while collinear modes are particles with high energy and nearly collinear momenta. The Soft Collinear Lagrangian is given by:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{SCET}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{soft}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{coll}}
$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{soft}}$ describes the soft dynamics and $\mathcal{L}_{\text{coll}}$ describes the collinear dynamics. The Soft Collinear Lagrangian is derived from the QCD Lagrangian by performing a field redefinition and expanding the resulting expression in terms of the soft and collinear modes.

The Soft Collinear Effective Theory is renormalizable, meaning that it can be used to study the dynamics of QCD at all energy scales. This is achieved by introducing a set of counterterms that absorb the divergences that arise when calculating physical quantities in SCET. These counterterms are determined by imposing symmetry conditions on the theory, such as gauge invariance and chiral symmetry.

One of the key applications of SCET is in the study of high-energy collisions. In these collisions, the dynamics of the system can be complex and difficult to analyze due to the large number of particles and interactions involved. SCET allows us to break down the dynamics of the system into smaller, more manageable pieces, making it easier to study the system and understand its behavior.

In addition to its applications in high-energy collisions, SCET also plays a crucial role in the development of other effective field theories. These include the Collinear Effective Theory, which describes the dynamics of collinear modes in QCD, and the Soft Effective Theory, which describes the dynamics of soft modes in QCD. By studying these theories, we can gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of QCD at different energy scales.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the properties of SCET, including its renormalizability and the role of symmetries in SCET. We will also discuss some specific applications of SCET, including its use in the study of high-energy collisions and its role in the development of other effective field theories. 





### Section: 7.1b SCET Lagrangian

The Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) is defined by the Soft Collinear Lagrangian, which describes the dynamics of soft and collinear modes in QCD. The Lagrangian is given by:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{SCET}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{soft}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{coll}}
$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{soft}}$ describes the soft dynamics and $\mathcal{L}_{\text{coll}}$ describes the collinear dynamics. The Soft Collinear Lagrangian is derived from the QCD Lagrangian by performing a field redefinition and expanding the resulting expression in terms of the soft and collinear modes.

The Soft Collinear Lagrangian is renormalizable, meaning that it can be used to study the dynamics of QCD at all energy scales. This is achieved by introducing a set of counterterms that absorb the divergences that arise when calculating physical quantities in SCET. These counterterms are determined by imposing symmetry conditions on the theory, such as gauge invariance and chiral symmetry.

The Soft Collinear Lagrangian is given by:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{SCET}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{soft}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{coll}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}
$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ describes the interactions between the soft and collinear modes. The interactions are crucial for the dynamics of the system, as they allow for the exchange of energy and momentum between the soft and collinear modes.

The Soft Collinear Lagrangian is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of QCD at different energy scales. It allows us to systematically study the effects of soft and collinear modes on physical quantities, and provides a framework for understanding the behavior of QCD at high energies. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the structure of the Soft Collinear Lagrangian and explore its applications in the study of QCD.





### Introduction to Soft-Collinear Effective Theory:

In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of effective field theories (EFTs) and their role in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). We discussed how EFTs allow us to systematically study the behavior of QCD at different energy scales, and how they provide a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of the theory. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the study of EFTs and introduce a specific type of EFT known as the Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET).

SCET is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of QCD at high energies, where the interactions between particles become strongly coupled. It is based on the idea of factorization, which allows us to separate the dynamics of the system into different energy scales. This is achieved by introducing a new set of fields, known as the soft and collinear fields, which describe the behavior of particles at different energy scales.

The soft fields describe the behavior of particles at low energies, where the interactions between particles are weakly coupled. These fields are defined as the residual fields after integrating out the hard modes of the theory. The collinear fields, on the other hand, describe the behavior of particles at high energies, where the interactions between particles are strongly coupled. These fields are defined as the residual fields after integrating out the soft modes of the theory.

By introducing these new fields, we can systematically study the dynamics of the system at different energy scales. This allows us to understand the behavior of QCD at high energies, where the interactions between particles become strongly coupled and traditional perturbation theory breaks down. SCET provides a powerful framework for studying these dynamics, and has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems in QCD.

In this chapter, we will introduce the basic concepts of SCET, including the soft and collinear fields, and how they are used to study the dynamics of QCD at high energies. We will also discuss the power counting scheme used in SCET, which allows us to systematically organize the contributions of different energy scales in the theory. Finally, we will explore some of the applications of SCET, including its use in studying jet physics and heavy quark production in QCD.

Effective field theory is a theoretical framework that allows us to describe the behavior of a physical system at a certain energy scale, without having to consider the details of the system at higher energy scales. This is achieved by introducing an effective Lagrangian, which encapsulates the relevant physics at the given energy scale. The effectiveness of this approach lies in its ability to systematically incorporate higher-order corrections, making it a versatile tool for studying a wide range of physical phenomena.

So, let's embark on this journey together, exploring the fascinating world of effective field theory in quantum physics.




#### 7.2b Factorization in SCET

In the previous section, we discussed the power counting scheme in SCET, which is crucial for understanding the behavior of the theory at different energy scales. In this section, we will explore the concept of factorization in SCET, which is closely related to the power counting scheme.

Factorization is a mathematical technique used in SCET to simplify the calculation of physical quantities. It involves breaking down a complex quantity into simpler factors, each of which can be calculated separately and then combined to obtain the original quantity. This technique is particularly useful in SCET, where the theory is defined at different energy scales and the interactions between different energy scales can be complex.

The factorization in SCET is based on the following rules:

1. The factorization of a quantity is determined by its mass dimension. For example, the factorization of a soft field is 1/2, while the factorization of a collinear field is 1.
2. The factorization of a quantity is also determined by its energy scale. For example, the factorization of a soft field is 1/2, while the factorization of a collinear field is 1.
3. The factorization of a quantity is also determined by its energy scale. For example, the factorization of a soft field is 1/2, while the factorization of a collinear field is 1.
4. The factorization of a quantity is also determined by its energy scale. For example, the factorization of a soft field is 1/2, while the factorization of a collinear field is 1.

By following these rules, we can determine the factorization of any quantity in SCET. This is crucial for simplifying the calculation of physical quantities in the theory. For example, the factorization of a soft field is 1/2, while the factorization of a collinear field is 1.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of factorization in SCET, such as in the calculation of jet production and decay rates. We will also discuss the implications of factorization in the context of SCET power counting.

#### 7.2c Power Counting and Factorization

In the previous sections, we have discussed the power counting scheme and factorization in SCET. These two concepts are closely related and are crucial for understanding the behavior of the theory at different energy scales. In this section, we will explore the relationship between power counting and factorization in SCET.

The power counting scheme in SCET is based on the concept of dimensional analysis, where the power of a quantity is determined by its mass dimension. This is closely related to factorization, as the factorization of a quantity is also determined by its mass dimension. For example, the factorization of a soft field is 1/2, while the factorization of a collinear field is 1.

The power counting scheme also determines the order of a quantity in the theory. This is important because the interactions between different energy scales in SCET are often of different orders. By using the power counting scheme, we can determine the order of a quantity and then use factorization to simplify the calculation of physical quantities.

The power counting scheme and factorization are also closely related to the concept of renormalization in SCET. Renormalization is a mathematical technique used to remove divergences in the theory. It involves redefining the parameters of the theory to account for the effects of higher order terms. The power counting scheme and factorization play a crucial role in renormalization, as they help us determine the order of the parameters and their effects on the theory.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of power counting and factorization in SCET, such as in the calculation of jet production and decay rates. We will also discuss the implications of these concepts in the context of SCET power counting and renormalization.




#### 7.2c Applications of SCET in QCD Processes

In the previous sections, we have discussed the power counting scheme and factorization in SCET. Now, we will explore some of the applications of SCET in QCD processes.

One of the most important applications of SCET is in the study of jet production and decay rates. As we have seen in the previous section, the factorization of a quantity is crucial for simplifying the calculation of physical quantities. In the case of jet production and decay rates, the factorization of the jet function is particularly important.

The jet function, denoted as $J_n$, is a key quantity in the calculation of jet production and decay rates. It is defined as the probability amplitude for a jet of particles to be produced. The jet function is a complex quantity, and its calculation involves the integration of various fields over the entire space-time. However, by using the factorization rules of SCET, we can simplify the calculation of the jet function.

The factorization of the jet function is determined by its mass dimension and energy scale. The mass dimension of the jet function is 1/2, while its energy scale is determined by the energy of the particles in the jet. By using the factorization rules, we can break down the jet function into simpler factors, each of which can be calculated separately and then combined to obtain the original quantity.

Another important application of SCET is in the study of the decay of a heavy particle into a lighter particle and a jet. This process is known as the heavy-to-light decay, and it is a key process in the study of heavy particles in QCD. The heavy-to-light decay is governed by the effective Hamiltonian, which is a key quantity in SCET.

The effective Hamiltonian, denoted as $H_{\rm eff}$, is a local operator that describes the interaction between the heavy particle and the lighter particle. It is defined as the sum of the tree-level and one-loop contributions, and it is crucial for the calculation of the decay rate of the heavy particle. By using the factorization rules of SCET, we can simplify the calculation of the effective Hamiltonian and obtain the decay rate of the heavy particle.

In conclusion, SCET is a powerful tool for the study of QCD processes. Its applications range from the calculation of jet production and decay rates to the study of heavy-to-light decays. By using the power counting scheme and factorization rules of SCET, we can simplify the calculation of physical quantities and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying physics.

#### 7.3b Factorization Theorems in SCET

In the previous section, we discussed the application of factorization in QCD processes, particularly in the context of jet production and decay rates. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of factorization and explore some of the key factorization theorems that are used in the field of SCET.

The SCET (Soft Collinear Effective Theory) is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of QCD processes at different energy scales. It allows us to factorize the physical quantities into simpler, more manageable parts, making it easier to calculate them. The factorization theorems of SCET are crucial for this process.

One of the key factorization theorems in SCET is the Bruun factorization. This theorem is used to factorize the polynomial $p_{s,m}(z)$ into two polynomials $p_{s+1,\ell}(z)$ and $p_{s+1,2^s-\ell}(z)$ during the transition to the next stage of the recursive algorithm. This factorization is crucial for the efficient implementation of the algorithm.

The Bruun factorization is based on the rules:

$$
p_{s,0}(z) = p(z) \mod \left(z^{2^{n-s}}-1\right)
$$

and

$$
p_{s,m}(z) = p(z)\mod \left(z^{2^{n-s}}-2\cos\left(\tfrac{m}{2^s}\pi\right)z^{2^{n-1-s}}+1\right)
$$

for $m=1,2,\dots,2^s-1$.

By the construction of the factorization of $z^{2^{n-s}}-1$, the polynomials $p_{s,m}(z)$ each encode 2$^{n-s}$ values of the Fourier transform, for $m=0$, the covered indices are $k=0$, 2$^k$, 2$^2$,…, 2$^{n-1}$, for $m>0$ the covered indices are $k=m$, 2$^{s}+m$, 2$^{s}+2m$,…, 2$^{n-1}+m$.

During the transition to the next stage, the polynomial $p_{s,\ell}(z)$ is reduced to the polynomials $p_{s+1,\ell}(z)$ and $p_{s+1,2^s-\ell}(z)$ via polynomial division. If one wants to keep the polynomials in increasing index order, this pattern requires an implementation with two arrays. An implementation in place produces a predictable, but highly unordered sequence of indices, for example for $N=16$ the final order of the $8$ linear remainders is (0, 4, 2, 6, 1, 7, 3, 5).

At the end of the recursion, for $s=n-1$, there remain 2$^{n-1}$ linear polynomials encoding two Fourier coefficients $X_0$ and $X_2$. This factorization is crucial for the efficient calculation of physical quantities in SCET.

In the next section, we will explore some of the applications of these factorization theorems in SCET.

## Chapter: Effective Field Theory

### Introduction

In the realm of quantum physics, the concept of effective field theory (EFT) has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding and predicting the behavior of physical systems. This chapter, "Effective Field Theory," will delve into the intricacies of this theory, its applications, and its significance in the broader context of quantum physics.

Effective field theory is a theoretical framework that allows us to describe the behavior of a physical system at a certain energy scale, without having to consider the details of the system at all energy scales. This is achieved by introducing an effective Lagrangian, a mathematical expression that encapsulates the relevant physics at the energy scale of interest. The effective Lagrangian is typically a function of a set of parameters, which can be determined from experimental data or from a more fundamental theory.

In the context of quantum physics, effective field theory has been instrumental in the study of various physical phenomena, from the behavior of particles in a quantum field to the dynamics of quantum systems.

They allow us to systematically organize and calculate the contributions of different orders in the perturbative expansion of QCD. In this section, we will introduce the concept of resummation in SCET and discuss its importance in the study of QCD processes.

Resummation in SCET is based on the principle of factorization, which we have discussed in the previous sections. The factorization theorems of SCET provide a way to express the contributions of different orders in the perturbative expansion as a product of simpler factors. This allows us to systematically organize and calculate these contributions.

The resummation process begins with the identification of the leading contributions to a physical quantity. These are the contributions that are largest in magnitude and are typically associated with the hard and collinear regions of phase space. The leading contributions are then calculated using the factorization theorems of SCET.

The next step in the resummation process is to calculate the subleading contributions. These are the contributions that are smaller in magnitude than the leading contributions but are still important for the accurate calculation of physical quantities. The subleading contributions are calculated using the factorization theorems of SCET, taking into account the contributions of the leading terms.

The resummation process is then repeated for the next-to-subleading contributions and so on. This process allows us to systematically calculate the contributions of different orders in the perturbative expansion. The final result is a resummed expression for the physical quantity, which is a sum of the contributions of different orders.

The resummation process is crucial for the accurate calculation of physical quantities in QCD.

In the realm of quantum physics, the concept of effective field theory (EFT) has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding and predicting the behavior of complex systems. This chapter will delve into the intricacies of EFT, providing a comprehensive introduction to its principles and applications in the context of quantum physics.

Effective field theory is a theoretical framework that allows us to describe the behavior of a system in terms of a simpler, effective theory. This is achieved by integrating out the degrees of freedom that are not relevant to the system's behavior at a given energy scale. The resulting effective theory is then used to make predictions about the system's behavior at that scale.

In the context of quantum physics, EFT has been instrumental in the study of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong nuclear force. By integrating out the degrees of freedom associated with the strong force, we can derive an effective theory that describes the behavior of particles at high energies. This has been particularly useful in the study of particle physics, where it has allowed us to make predictions about the behavior of particles at the TeV scale.

This chapter will introduce the basic concepts of EFT, including the notion of an effective Lagrangian and the principles of symmetry and renormalization. We will also discuss the application of EFT to various physical systems, including QCD and particle physics. Throughout, we will strive to provide a clear and accessible introduction to these concepts, with a focus on their physical interpretation and implications.

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamental concepts of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and its effective field theories. We have seen how these theories provide a powerful framework for understanding the behavior of particles at different energy scales. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the realm of effective field theories by focusing on the Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET).

SCET is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of QCD at the soft and collinear scales. It is particularly useful in the study of high-energy processes, where the energy of the particles involved is much larger than the mass of the particles. In these processes, the particles are often produced and detected at large angles, making the traditional perturbative calculations in QCD inadequate. SCET provides a way to systematically organize these calculations, taking into account the effects of soft and collinear gluons.

The chapter will begin with an overview of the basic principles of SCET, including the definition of soft and collinear scales, and the role of these scales in the theory. We will then explore the structure of SCET, including the fields and operators that are used to describe the dynamics of the system. We will also discuss the symmetries of SCET, and how they relate to the symmetries of QCD.

Next, we will delve into the applications of SCET, including its use in the study of high-energy processes such as jet production and fragmentation. We will also discuss how SCET can be used to study the behavior of particles at the boundary of the perturbative regime, where non-perturbative effects become important.

Finally, we will conclude the chapter with a discussion on the future prospects of SCET, including its potential applications in other areas of particle physics and its role in the development of new experimental techniques. We hope that this chapter will provide a comprehensive guide to SCET, equipping the reader with the necessary tools to understand and apply this powerful theory in their own research.




### Subsection: 8.1a Introduction to SCET

The Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at the soft and collinear scales. It is particularly useful in the study of high-energy processes, where the energy of the particles involved is much larger than the mass of the particles. In these processes, the particles are often produced and detected at large angles, making the traditional perturbative calculations in QCD inadequate. SCET provides a way to systematically organize these calculations, taking into account the effects of soft and collinear gluons.

#### 8.1a.1 Basic Principles of SCET

The basic principles of SCET are rooted in the concept of energy scales. In QCD, there are two primary scales: the hard scale, which is the scale at which the process is initiated, and the soft scale, which is the scale at which the process is completed. The hard scale is typically much larger than the soft scale, and the dynamics of the system are governed by the interactions between these two scales.

SCET is designed to describe the dynamics of the system at the soft and collinear scales. Collinear particles are those that are produced and detected at large angles, while soft particles are those that are produced and detected at small angles. The interactions between these particles are governed by the SCET Lagrangian, which is a modified version of the QCD Lagrangian that takes into account the effects of soft and collinear gluons.

#### 8.1a.2 Structure of SCET

The structure of SCET is based on the concept of fields and operators. The fields in SCET are defined in terms of the fields in QCD, but they are modified to account for the effects of soft and collinear gluons. The operators in SCET are also modified, and they are used to describe the dynamics of the system at the soft and collinear scales.

The symmetries of SCET are also important, as they relate to the symmetries of QCD. The symmetries of SCET are used to constrain the form of the SCET Lagrangian, and they are also used to derive the equations of motion for the fields and operators in SCET.

#### 8.1a.3 Applications of SCET

SCET has a wide range of applications in the study of high-energy processes in QCD. It is particularly useful in the study of jet production and fragmentation, where the particles are often produced and detected at large angles. SCET can also be used to study the behavior of particles at the boundary of the perturbative regime, where non-perturbative effects become important.

#### 8.1a.4 Future Prospects of SCET

The future prospects of SCET are promising, as it has the potential to be applied to a wide range of problems in QCD. It can be used to study the dynamics of high-energy processes at the soft and collinear scales, and it can also be used to study the behavior of particles at the boundary of the perturbative regime. As our understanding of QCD continues to evolve, SCET will play an increasingly important role in our understanding of the dynamics of the system.

In the previous section, we introduced the basic principles and structure of Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). Now, we will delve into the power counting scheme of SCET, which is a crucial aspect of this theory.

#### 8.1b.1 Power Counting in SCET

Power counting in SCET is a systematic way of organizing the perturbative calculations in the theory. It is based on the concept of energy scales, similar to traditional perturbation theory in QCD. However, in SCET, we also take into account the effects of soft and collinear gluons, which can significantly alter the dynamics of the system.

The power counting scheme in SCET is based on the following assumptions:

1. The hard scale, denoted by $Q$, is much larger than the soft scale, denoted by $\Lambda$.
2. The collinear scale, denoted by $E$, is of the same order as the hard scale.
3. The soft and collinear scales are much larger than the ultraviolet cutoff, denoted by $\Lambda_{\text{UV}}$.

Based on these assumptions, we can define the power counting variables as follows:

$$
\alpha_s = \frac{g^2}{4\pi^2}, \quad \alpha_s' = \frac{g^2}{4\pi^2\Lambda_{\text{UV}}}, \quad \alpha_s'' = \frac{g^2}{4\pi^2\Lambda_{\text{UV}}^2}, \quad \alpha_s''' =

### Subsection: 8.1c SCET Lagrangian

The Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at different energy scales. It is particularly useful in the study of high-energy processes, where the hard scale $Q$ is much larger than the soft scale $\Lambda$. In this section, we will discuss the SCET Lagrangian, which is the fundamental object that encapsulates the dynamics of the theory.

#### 8.1c.1 Structure of the SCET Lagrangian

The SCET Lagrangian is a local Lagrangian that describes the dynamics of the theory at the collinear scale $E$. It is constructed from the QCD Lagrangian by integrating out the soft modes, which are fields with momentum much smaller than the hard scale $Q$. The resulting Lagrangian is a series of local operators, each of which represents a different interaction in the theory.

The SCET Lagrangian can be written as:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{SCET}} = \sum_{i} \mathcal{O}_i
$$

where $\mathcal{O}_i$ are the local operators, and the sum runs over all the operators in the theory. Each operator $\mathcal{O}_i$ represents a different interaction in the theory, and its coefficient is determined by the power counting variables $\alpha_s$, $\alpha_s'$, $\alpha_s''$, etc.

#### 8.1c.2 Operators in the SCET Lagrangian

The operators in the SCET Lagrangian can be broadly classified into two categories: hard operators and soft operators. Hard operators are those that involve only collinear fields, while soft operators involve both collinear and soft fields.

Hard operators are of the form:

$$
\mathcal{O}_{\text{hard}} = \mathcal{O}_{\text{QCD}}
$$

where $\mathcal{O}_{\text{QCD}}$ is a QCD operator. These operators represent the hard interactions in the theory, which are typically of order $\alpha_s^n$ for some $n$.

Soft operators, on the other hand, are of the form:

$$
\mathcal{O}_{\text{soft}} = \mathcal{O}_{\text{QCD}} \cdot \mathcal{O}_{\text{soft}}
$$

where $\mathcal{O}_{\text{QCD}}$ is a QCD operator and $\mathcal{O}_{\text{soft}}$ is a soft operator. These operators represent the soft interactions in the theory, which are typically of order $\alpha_s^n \Lambda^m$ for some $n$ and $m$.

#### 8.1c.3 Power Counting in the SCET Lagrangian

The power counting in the SCET Lagrangian is based on the same assumptions as the power counting in the theory as a whole. The hard scale $Q$ is much larger than the soft scale $\Lambda$, and the collinear scale $E$ is of the same order as the hard scale. This allows us to systematically organize the perturbative calculations in the theory.

The power counting variables $\alpha_s$, $\alpha_s'$, $\alpha_s''$, etc. are used to keep track of the contributions from different operators in the Lagrangian. The leading contributions come from the hard operators, which are of order $\alpha_s^n$ for some $n$. The next-to-leading contributions come from the soft operators, which are of order $\alpha_s^n \Lambda^m$ for some $n$ and $m$.

In the next section, we will discuss the applications of the SCET Lagrangian in the study of high-energy processes.




### Subsection: 8.2a SCET Field Content

The Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at different energy scales. It is particularly useful in the study of high-energy processes, where the hard scale $Q$ is much larger than the soft scale $\Lambda$. In this section, we will discuss the field content of SCET, which is the set of fields that appear in the SCET Lagrangian.

#### 8.2a.1 Collinear Fields

Collinear fields are the fundamental fields of SCET. They are defined as fields that are collinear with the hard scale $Q$. This means that they have momentum components that are much larger than the soft scale $\Lambda$. The collinear fields are represented by the operators $\mathcal{O}_{\text{hard}}$ in the SCET Lagrangian.

The collinear fields are responsible for the hard interactions in the theory. These interactions are typically of order $\alpha_s^n$ for some $n$, and they are represented by the hard operators $\mathcal{O}_{\text{hard}}$ in the SCET Lagrangian.

#### 8.2a.2 Soft Fields

Soft fields are the complement of the collinear fields. They are defined as fields that are not collinear with the hard scale $Q$. This means that they have momentum components that are much smaller than the hard scale $Q$. The soft fields are represented by the operators $\mathcal{O}_{\text{soft}}$ in the SCET Lagrangian.

The soft fields are responsible for the soft interactions in the theory. These interactions are typically of order $\alpha_s^n$ for some $n$, and they are represented by the soft operators $\mathcal{O}_{\text{soft}}$ in the SCET Lagrangian.

#### 8.2a.3 Interactions between Collinear and Soft Fields

The interactions between collinear and soft fields are represented by the operators $\mathcal{O}_{\text{soft}} \cdot \mathcal{O}_{\text{hard}}$ in the SCET Lagrangian. These interactions are responsible for the soft-collinear dynamics in the theory.

The interactions between collinear and soft fields are crucial for the correct description of the dynamics of QCD at different energy scales. They allow us to study the effects of soft interactions on the collinear dynamics, and vice versa. This is particularly important in high-energy processes, where the hard scale $Q$ is much larger than the soft scale $\Lambda$.

In the next section, we will discuss the power counting rules of SCET, which provide a systematic way to organize the interactions in the theory.




### Subsection: 8.2b SCET Gauge Symmetry

The Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at different energy scales. It is particularly useful in the study of high-energy processes, where the hard scale $Q$ is much larger than the soft scale $\Lambda$. In this section, we will discuss the gauge symmetry of SCET, which is a crucial aspect of the theory.

#### 8.2b.1 Gauge Symmetry in SCET

The gauge symmetry in SCET is a direct extension of the gauge symmetry in QCD. In QCD, the gauge symmetry is implemented by the group of color symmetries $\text{SU}(N)$, which acts on the color indices of the fields. In SCET, this symmetry is extended to act on the spinor indices of the fields as well.

The gauge symmetry in SCET is implemented by the transformation of the fields under a gauge transformation $U:\mathbb{R}^{1,3} \rightarrow \text{SU}(N)$. The spinor fields transform as

$$
\psi(x) \mapsto U(x)\psi(x)
$$

and

$$
\bar\psi(x) \mapsto \bar\psi(x)U^\dagger(x).
$$

The matrix-valued gauge field $A_\mu$ or $\text{SU}(N)$ connection transforms as

$$
A_\mu(x) \mapsto U(x)A_\mu(x)U(x)^{-1} + \frac{1}{g}(\partial_\mu U(x))U(x)^{-1}.
$$

#### 8.2b.2 Gauge Invariance in SCET

The gauge symmetry in SCET leads to the concept of gauge invariance. A quantity is said to be gauge invariant if it does not change under a gauge transformation. In SCET, the gauge invariance is crucial for ensuring the consistency of the theory.

The gauge invariance in SCET is implemented by the Ward identities, which are equations that relate the correlation functions of the fields. These identities are derived from the gauge symmetry and they ensure that the theory is consistent.

#### 8.2b.3 Gauge Fixing in SCET

Despite the power of the gauge symmetry, it is often necessary to fix the gauge in order to make the theory more tractable. This is done by choosing a gauge condition, which is a constraint on the gauge fields. The most common gauge condition in SCET is the Feynman gauge, where the gauge condition is $\partial_\mu A^\mu = 0$.

The gauge fixing in SCET is done by adding a gauge fixing term to the Lagrangian. This term breaks the gauge symmetry explicitly, but it allows for the calculation of physical quantities. The gauge fixing term is typically of the form

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{gf}} = -\frac{1}{2\alpha}(\partial_\mu A^\mu)^2,
$$

where $\alpha$ is a parameter that can be adjusted to control the strength of the gauge fixing.

In conclusion, the gauge symmetry and gauge invariance are crucial aspects of the Soft-Collinear Effective Theory. They ensure the consistency of the theory and allow for the calculation of physical quantities. The gauge fixing, while necessary, breaks the gauge symmetry explicitly.




### Subsection: 8.2c SCET Soft and Collinear Modes

In the previous sections, we have discussed the gauge symmetry and gauge invariance in Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). In this section, we will delve into the concept of soft and collinear modes, which are crucial for understanding the dynamics of SCET.

#### 8.2c.1 Soft Modes in SCET

Soft modes in SCET are the modes of the fields that have a wavelength much larger than the hard scale $Q$. These modes are typically associated with the soft gluons in QCD. The soft modes are crucial for understanding the dynamics of SCET, as they are responsible for the soft radiation that is emitted in high-energy processes.

The soft modes in SCET are described by the soft fields, which are the fields that are associated with the soft modes. The soft fields are defined as the fields that have a wavelength much larger than the hard scale $Q$. They are denoted by the subscript $s$ and are defined as

$$
A^s_\mu(x) = A_\mu(x) - \frac{1}{Q} \partial_\mu A_0(x),
$$

where $A_\mu(x)$ is the full field and $A_0(x)$ is the zeroth component of the field.

#### 8.2c.2 Collinear Modes in SCET

Collinear modes in SCET are the modes of the fields that have a wavelength much smaller than the hard scale $Q$. These modes are typically associated with the hard gluons in QCD. The collinear modes are crucial for understanding the dynamics of SCET, as they are responsible for the hard radiation that is emitted in high-energy processes.

The collinear modes in SCET are described by the collinear fields, which are the fields that are associated with the collinear modes. The collinear fields are defined as the fields that have a wavelength much smaller than the hard scale $Q$. They are denoted by the subscript $c$ and are defined as

$$
A^c_\mu(x) = A_\mu(x) - \frac{1}{Q} \partial_\mu A_0(x),
$$

where $A_\mu(x)$ is the full field and $A_0(x)$ is the zeroth component of the field.

#### 8.2c.3 Soft and Collinear Modes in SCET

The soft and collinear modes in SCET are crucial for understanding the dynamics of the theory. The soft modes are responsible for the soft radiation, while the collinear modes are responsible for the hard radiation. The interaction between the soft and collinear modes is crucial for understanding the dynamics of high-energy processes in QCD.

In the next section, we will discuss the SCET Lagrangian, which is the fundamental equation of motion for the fields in SCET. The SCET Lagrangian is crucial for understanding the dynamics of SCET and it is derived from the QCD Lagrangian by integrating out the hard modes.




### Subsection: 8.3a Gauge Symmetry in SCET

In the previous sections, we have discussed the concept of soft and collinear modes in Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). In this section, we will explore the role of gauge symmetry in SCET.

#### 8.3a.1 Gauge Symmetry in SCET

Gauge symmetry plays a crucial role in SCET, just as it does in QCD. The gauge symmetry in SCET is a symmetry of the theory under local transformations of the fields. This symmetry is crucial for ensuring the consistency of the theory and for predicting the behavior of the system under different transformations.

The gauge symmetry in SCET is implemented by requiring that the fields transform under gauge transformations in a specific way. For instance, the soft fields $A^s_\mu(x)$ and the collinear fields $A^c_\mu(x)$ transform under gauge transformations as

$$
A^s_\mu(x) \mapsto U(x)A^s_\mu(x)U(x)^{-1} + \frac{1}{Q} \partial_\mu A_0(x),
$$

and

$$
A^c_\mu(x) \mapsto U(x)A^c_\mu(x)U(x)^{-1} + \frac{1}{Q} \partial_\mu A_0(x),
$$

respectively, where $U(x)$ is the gauge transformation.

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of effective field theories (EFTs) and their applications in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). We have seen how EFTs provide a powerful tool for studying the behavior of QCD particles at different energy scales, allowing us to make predictions about their properties and interactions. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of EFTs and QCD, focusing on advanced topics that build upon the concepts introduced in the earlier chapters.

We will begin by discussing the concept of renormalization, which is a crucial aspect of EFTs. Renormalization allows us to remove divergences in calculations, making them more tractable and providing a way to calculate physical quantities. We will explore the different methods of renormalization, including dimensional regularization and the use of counterterms.

Next, we will delve into the topic of non-perturbative effects in QCD. While perturbation theory is a powerful tool for studying QCD at high energies, it fails to capture the behavior of particles at lower energies. We will discuss the concept of non-perturbative effects and how they can be incorporated into EFTs.

We will also explore the concept of symmetry breaking in QCD. Symmetry breaking occurs when the symmetry of a system is broken, leading to the emergence of new particles or interactions. We will discuss how symmetry breaking can be incorporated into EFTs and its implications for QCD.

Finally, we will touch upon the topic of lattice QCD, which is a numerical method for studying QCD. Lattice QCD allows us to calculate physical quantities non-perturbatively, making it a valuable tool for studying QCD at low energies. We will discuss the basics of lattice QCD and its applications in QCD.

## Chapter: Effective Field Theories of QCD: A Comprehensive Guide

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of effective field theories (EFTs) and their applications in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). We have seen how EFTs provide a powerful tool for studying the behavior of QCD systems at different energy scales, allowing us to make predictions and test theoretical models. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of effective field theories and explore some advanced concepts that are essential for understanding the complex dynamics of QCD.

We will begin by discussing the concept of renormalization, which is a crucial aspect of EFTs. Renormalization is the process of removing divergent terms from calculations, allowing us to make predictions that are independent of the cutoff used in the theory. We will explore the different methods of renormalization, including dimensional regularization and the renormalization group, and how they are used in EFTs.

Next, we will delve into the topic of symmetry breaking, which is a fundamental concept in QCD. Symmetry breaking occurs when a symmetry of the underlying theory is broken at the level of the equations of motion, leading to the emergence of new particles and interactions. We will discuss the different types of symmetry breaking, including chiral symmetry breaking and spontaneous symmetry breaking, and how they are related to the behavior of QCD systems.

Finally, we will explore the concept of non-perturbative effects in EFTs. Non-perturbative effects are contributions to the theory that cannot be calculated using perturbation theory, and they are essential for understanding the behavior of QCD systems at low energies. We will discuss the different methods for incorporating non-perturbative effects into EFTs, including lattice simulations and functional methods.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a deeper understanding of the advanced concepts of effective field theories and their applications in QCD. This knowledge will be crucial for further exploration of the fascinating world of QCD and its underlying dynamics. So let us dive in and explore the advanced concepts of effective field theories in QCD.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into additional topics in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), building upon the foundational knowledge established in the previous chapters. QCD is the theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons, which is the fundamental theory of the strong nuclear force. It is one of the four fundamental forces in nature, along with electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, and gravity.

The study of QCD is crucial for understanding the behavior of matter at the subatomic level. It is the theory that describes the behavior of particles at the smallest scales, where quantum mechanics becomes significant. QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, which means that it is a theory of particles that interact with each other through the exchange of force-carrying particles, known as gluons.

In this chapter, we will explore some of the more advanced topics in QCD, including the concept of effective field theories. Effective field theories (EFTs) are mathematical tools used to describe the behavior of physical systems at different scales. They are particularly useful in QCD, where the theory is non-renormalizable, meaning that it cannot be made mathematically consistent without introducing additional terms that are not predicted by the theory.

We will also discuss the concept of asymptotic freedom, which is a key feature of QCD. Asymptotic freedom refers to the property of QCD that the strength of the interaction between quarks and gluons decreases at high energies. This property is crucial for understanding the behavior of particles at high energies, such as in particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider.

Finally, we will touch upon the concept of confinement, which is another key feature of QCD. Confinement refers to the property of QCD that quarks and gluons are confined within particles, and cannot exist as free particles. This property is crucial for understanding the behavior of matter at the subatomic level, and is one of the key predictions of QCD.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these topics, providing a comprehensive guide to understanding the advanced concepts in QCD. We will also provide examples and applications to help illustrate these concepts. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a deeper understanding of the key concepts in QCD, and will be equipped with the knowledge to further explore this fascinating field.




### Subsection: 10.1a Introduction to QCD Phase Diagram

The QCD phase diagram is a fundamental concept in the study of quantum chromodynamics. It provides a visual representation of the different phases of matter that can exist at different temperatures and densities. The phase diagram is crucial for understanding the behavior of matter at the subatomic level, and it is one of the key tools for studying the properties of quarks and gluons.

The QCD phase diagram is typically represented as a plot of temperature versus baryon density. The baryon density is a measure of the number of baryons (such as protons and neutrons) per unit volume. The phase diagram is divided into different regions, each representing a different phase of matter.

At low temperatures and high densities, the phase diagram is in the hadronic phase. In this phase, matter is composed of hadrons, which are particles made of quarks and gluons. The hadronic phase is the phase that we observe in everyday life, and it is the phase that is described by the standard model of particle physics.

At high temperatures and low densities, the phase diagram is in the quark-gluon plasma phase. In this phase, matter is composed of quarks and gluons, which are the fundamental particles of the strong interaction. The quark-gluon plasma phase is a state of matter that is predicted by QCD, but it has not yet been observed in the laboratory.

The transition between the hadronic phase and the quark-gluon plasma phase is known as the QCD phase transition. This transition is a first-order phase transition, meaning that it is a sudden and discontinuous transition. The QCD phase transition is one of the key predictions of QCD, and it is one of the main topics of study in the field of QCD.

The QCD phase diagram is a powerful tool for studying the properties of matter at the subatomic level. It provides a visual representation of the different phases of matter, and it allows us to understand the behavior of matter at different temperatures and densities. The QCD phase diagram is a crucial concept for understanding the fundamental theory of the strong interaction, and it is one of the key topics of study in the field of QCD.

## Chapter 10: Additional Topics in QCD:




### Subsection: 10.1b Quark-Gluon Plasma

The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is a state of matter that is predicted by quantum chromodynamics (QCD) to exist at extremely high temperatures and densities. In this state, the quarks and gluons are no longer confined within hadrons, and the plasma behaves as a nearly ideal fluid. The QGP is a key component of the QCD phase diagram, and its study is a major focus of research in high-energy nuclear physics.

#### 10.1b.1 Production of Quark-Gluon Plasma

The QGP can be produced in the laboratory by colliding heavy atomic nuclei at relativistic energies. This is achieved by accelerating the nuclei to ultrarelativistic speeds and directing them towards each other. The collision results in a "fireball" of hot, dense matter that expands under its own pressure. The expansion of the fireball is accompanied by a decrease in temperature, and the QGP eventually transitions back into the hadronic phase.

The production of QGP can be studied through various experimental techniques, including the measurement of particle spectra, correlations, and flow. These measurements provide valuable information about the properties of the QGP, such as its temperature, density, and viscosity.

#### 10.1b.2 Diagnostic Tools for Quark-Gluon Plasma

The QGP can be diagnosed through a variety of experimental techniques. One of the most important classes of observations is the measurement of the hot QCD matter created at RHIC. This includes the measurement of particle spectra, correlations, and flow.

Particle spectra provide information about the energy distribution of particles produced in the collision. In the QGP, the particle spectra are expected to be different from those in the hadronic phase. For example, in the QGP, the spectra of pions and kaons are expected to be similar, while in the hadronic phase, the spectra of these particles are expected to be different.

Correlations refer to the spatial and temporal correlations between particles produced in the collision. In the QGP, these correlations are expected to be different from those in the hadronic phase. For example, in the QGP, the correlations between particles produced at different times are expected to be stronger than in the hadronic phase.

Flow refers to the collective motion of particles produced in the collision. In the QGP, this flow is expected to be different from that in the hadronic phase. For example, in the QGP, the flow of particles is expected to be more isotropic, while in the hadronic phase, the flow is expected to be more anisotropic.

#### 10.1b.3 Current Results from Quark-Gluon Plasma Studies

The study of QGP at RHIC has provided important results about the properties of this state of matter. These include the measurement of the temperature and density of the QGP, as well as the determination of its viscosity. The QGP has also been found to exhibit a phenomenon known as jet quenching, which is a manifestation of the strong interaction between the QGP and the particles produced in the collision.

In addition to these results, ongoing research at RHIC is focused on studying the QGP under different conditions, such as at different collision energies and with different types of nuclei. This research aims to provide a more detailed understanding of the properties of the QGP and its behavior in different environments.
