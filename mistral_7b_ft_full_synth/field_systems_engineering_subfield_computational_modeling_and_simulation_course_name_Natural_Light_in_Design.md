## Chapter 2: Natural Light:




### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we explored the fundamentals of natural light and its role in design. We discussed the importance of understanding the quality and quantity of natural light, as well as the impact it has on both the design process and the final outcome. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of natural light in design by focusing on building simulation for daylighting.

Daylighting is the practice of using natural light to illuminate a building, and it has been a crucial aspect of design for centuries. However, with the advancement of technology, we now have the ability to simulate and analyze daylighting in buildings before they are even constructed. This allows designers to make informed decisions about the placement and design of windows, skylights, and other elements that affect natural light in a building.

In this chapter, we will explore the various methods and tools used for building simulation for daylighting. We will discuss the principles behind these simulations, as well as the benefits and limitations of using them in the design process. We will also touch upon the role of building simulation in sustainable design and how it can help reduce energy consumption and promote a more environmentally friendly approach to design.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of building simulation for daylighting and its importance in modern design. They will also have the knowledge and tools to incorporate it into their own design process, creating more efficient and sustainable buildings that make the most of natural light. So let's dive in and explore the world of building simulation for daylighting.




### Section: 2.1 Simulations for Architects:

In the previous chapter, we discussed the fundamentals of natural light and its role in design. We explored the importance of understanding the quality and quantity of natural light, as well as the impact it has on both the design process and the final outcome. In this section, we will delve deeper into the topic of building simulation for daylighting and its importance for architects.

#### 2.1a Importance of Simulations

Building simulation for daylighting has become an essential tool for architects in the design process. With the advancement of technology, architects now have the ability to simulate and analyze daylighting in buildings before they are even constructed. This allows them to make informed decisions about the placement and design of windows, skylights, and other elements that affect natural light in a building.

One of the main benefits of using simulations for architects is the ability to test and evaluate different design options. With traditional design methods, architects had to rely on their own intuition and experience to determine the best placement and design of windows and other elements. However, with simulations, architects can test multiple design options and compare the results, allowing them to make more informed decisions.

Simulations also allow architects to analyze the impact of different design choices on the overall daylighting of a building. For example, they can test the effect of adding a skylight or increasing the size of a window on the amount of natural light entering a room. This can help architects optimize the design for maximum daylighting and reduce the need for artificial lighting.

Another important aspect of simulations for architects is the ability to analyze the impact of different materials and finishes on daylighting. By simulating different materials and finishes, architects can determine how they will affect the amount and quality of natural light entering a building. This can help them make decisions about the use of materials and finishes that will enhance the overall daylighting of a building.

Simulations also allow architects to analyze the impact of different weather conditions on daylighting. By simulating different weather scenarios, architects can determine how natural light will behave in a building under different conditions. This can help them design buildings that are optimized for natural light, regardless of the weather.

In addition to these benefits, simulations also play a crucial role in sustainable design. By analyzing the impact of different design choices on daylighting, architects can make decisions that reduce energy consumption and promote a more environmentally friendly approach to design. This can help architects achieve LEED certification and other sustainability goals.

In conclusion, simulations for architects are an essential tool in the design process. They allow architects to test and evaluate different design options, analyze the impact of different materials and finishes, and consider the effects of weather conditions on daylighting. By using simulations, architects can optimize the design of a building for maximum daylighting and promote sustainable design practices. 





#### 2.1b Simulation Tools

There are various software programs available for architects to use in building simulations for daylighting. These programs use advanced algorithms and calculations to simulate the movement of light through a building, taking into account factors such as the orientation of the building, the type and placement of windows and skylights, and the materials and finishes used in the construction.

One popular simulation tool for architects is Radiance, a software program developed by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Radiance uses a three-dimensional model of a building to simulate the movement of light, taking into account factors such as the sun's position, the orientation of the building, and the properties of the materials used in construction. It also allows architects to test different design options and compare the results, providing valuable insights for the design process.

Another commonly used simulation tool is Daylight, developed by the University of California, Berkeley. Daylight uses a two-dimensional model of a building to simulate the movement of light, taking into account factors such as the orientation of the building, the type and placement of windows and skylights, and the properties of the materials used in construction. It also allows architects to analyze the impact of different design choices on the overall daylighting of a building.

In addition to these software programs, there are also online tools available for architects to use in building simulations for daylighting. These tools, such as the Daylighting Performance Metrics Tool and the Daylighting Calculator, allow architects to input basic information about a building and receive a simulation of the daylighting conditions. These tools are useful for quick and easy analysis of different design options.

Overall, building simulation for daylighting has become an essential tool for architects in the design process. With the advancement of technology and the availability of various simulation tools, architects now have the ability to make informed decisions about the placement and design of natural light in buildings. This not only improves the overall design and functionality of a building, but also has a positive impact on the environment by reducing the need for artificial lighting. 





#### 2.1c Simulation Accuracy

The accuracy of building simulations for daylighting is crucial for architects to make informed decisions about their designs. While simulations can provide valuable insights, it is important to understand the limitations and potential sources of error in these simulations.

One factor that can affect the accuracy of simulations is the complexity of the building. As mentioned in the previous section, the Remez algorithm is used to solve implicitly defined functions, which can be useful for complex building designs. However, this algorithm may not always provide accurate results, and architects should be aware of this when interpreting simulation results.

Another factor to consider is the accuracy of the input data used in simulations. This includes information about the building itself, such as its orientation, size, and materials, as well as external factors such as the sun's position and weather conditions. Any errors or inaccuracies in this data can greatly impact the results of the simulation.

In addition, simulations may not always account for all factors that can affect daylighting, such as shading from nearby buildings or trees, or the impact of interior design elements on light distribution. These factors can be difficult to accurately model and may require additional calculations or adjustments to the simulation.

It is also important to note that simulations are just one tool in the design process, and should not be relied upon solely for decision-making. Architects should also consider other factors, such as personal preferences and budget constraints, when making design choices.

In conclusion, while simulations can provide valuable insights for architects, it is important to understand their limitations and potential sources of error. By considering these factors and using simulations in conjunction with other design tools, architects can make informed decisions about their designs and create buildings that effectively utilize natural light.

#### 3.1a Light Measurement

Light measurement is a fundamental aspect of photometry. It involves the quantification of light, which is a form of electromagnetic radiation. The measurement of light is crucial in design as it helps us understand how natural light will behave in a given space. This knowledge is essential for designing spaces that maximize the benefits of natural light while minimizing its potential drawbacks.

Light is measured with two main alternative sets of units: radiometry and photometry. Radiometry measures light power at all wavelengths, while photometry measures light with wavelength weighted with respect to a standardized model of human brightness perception. Photometry is useful, for example, to quantify Illumination (lighting) intended for human use.

The photometry units are different from most systems of physical units in that they take into account how the human eye responds to light. The cone cells in the human eye are of three types which respond differently across the visible spectrum and the cumulative response peaks at a wavelength of around 555 nm. Therefore, two sources of light which produce the same intensity (W/m<sup>2</sup>) of visible light do not necessarily appear equally bright. The photometry units are designed to take this into account and therefore are a better representation of how "bright" a light appears to be than raw intensity. They relate to raw power by a quantity called luminous efficacy and are used for purposes like determining how to best achieve sufficient illumination for various tasks in indoor and outdoor settings. The illumination measured by a photocell sensor does not necessarily correspond to what is perceived by the human eye and without filters which may be costly, photocells and charge-coupled devices (CCD) tend to respond to some infrared, ultraviolet, or both.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the different types of photometric measurements, such as illuminance and luminance, and how they are used in design.

In addition to the amount of light, the quality of light is also important. This refers to the color temperature and spectral power distribution of the light. Color temperature is a measure of the warmth or coolness of light. It is typically measured in Kelvin (K). Spectral power distribution refers to the distribution of light across the spectrum of colors. A full-spectrum light source, such as the sun, has a relatively flat spectral power distribution, while a narrow-spectrum light source, such as a fluorescent lamp, has a more concentrated distribution.

Understanding daylight levels and their influencing factors is crucial for designing spaces that make optimal use of natural light. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the concept of daylight levels, exploring how they are measured and how they can be manipulated to create spaces that are both bright and comfortable.

#### 3.3b Illuminance Levels

Illuminance levels are another important aspect of photometry and daylight metrics. They provide a measure of the amount of light that falls on a surface. Unlike daylight levels, which are typically measured in lux (lx) or foot-candles (fc), illuminance levels are often measured in candelas per square meter (cd/m²).

Illuminance levels can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the type of light source, the distance to the light source, and the reflectivity of the surface. For example, a light source with a high luminous intensity (such as a halogen lamp) will produce higher illuminance levels than a light source with a lower luminous intensity (such as an incandescent lamp). Similarly, a surface with a high reflectivity (such as a mirror) will reflect more light back into the space, resulting in higher illuminance levels.

Illuminance levels can also be affected by the presence of obstructions. For example, a lamp placed behind a bookshelf will have its illuminance reduced by the bookshelf. This is because the bookshelf blocks some of the light from reaching the surface.

In addition to the amount of light, the quality of light is also important. This refers to the color temperature and spectral power distribution of the light. Color temperature is a measure of the warmth or coolness of light. It is typically measured in Kelvin (K). Spectral power distribution refers to the distribution of light across the spectrum of colors. A full-spectrum light source, such as the sun, has a relatively flat spectral power distribution, while a narrow-spectrum light source, such as a fluorescent lamp, has a more concentrated distribution.

Understanding illuminance levels and their influencing factors is crucial for designing spaces that make optimal use of light. In the next section, we will explore how these concepts can be applied in practice.

#### 3.3c Typical Values for Daylight Metrics

Daylight metrics provide a quantitative measure of the amount of daylight in a given space. These metrics are crucial for understanding the impact of natural light on a space and for designing spaces that make optimal use of natural light. In this section, we will discuss some typical values for daylight metrics.

One of the most common daylight metrics is the daylight factor (DF). The daylight factor is a measure of the amount of daylight in a space relative to the amount of daylight outside. It is typically expressed as a percentage. For example, a daylight factor of 50% means that the space receives 50% of the amount of daylight that is outside.

The daylight factor can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the orientation of the space, the type of glazing used, and the presence of obstructions such as trees or buildings. For example, a south-facing space with large windows will typically have a higher daylight factor than a north-facing space with small windows.

Another important daylight metric is the daylight autonomy (DA). The daylight autonomy is a measure of the percentage of time that a space receives a specified amount of daylight. For example, a daylight autonomy of 80% means that the space receives at least 80% of the specified amount of daylight for at least 80% of the time.

The daylight autonomy can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the latitude of the location, the orientation of the space, and the type of glazing used. For example, a space located at a higher latitude will typically have a lower daylight autonomy than a space located at a lower latitude.

In addition to these metrics, there are also other daylight metrics that can be used to evaluate the quality of daylight in a space. These include the daylight factor at work plane (DFwp), the daylight factor at eye level (DFel), and the daylight factor at the plane of the eye (DFpe). These metrics provide a more detailed understanding of the daylight in a space and can be used to optimize the design for specific tasks or activities.

In the next section, we will discuss how these daylight metrics can be used in practice to design spaces that make optimal use of natural light.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the intricacies of photometry and daylight metrics, two crucial aspects of natural light in design. We have explored the principles behind photometry, which is the measurement of light, and how it is used to quantify the amount of light in a given space. We have also examined daylight metrics, which are used to evaluate the quality of daylight in a space.

We have learned that photometry is not just about measuring the amount of light, but also about understanding how that light is distributed and how it affects the perception of light in a space. We have also discovered that daylight metrics go beyond just measuring the amount of daylight, but also take into account the quality of that daylight, including its color temperature and spectral distribution.

In conclusion, understanding photometry and daylight metrics is essential for any designer or architect who wants to create spaces that make optimal use of natural light. By applying the principles and techniques discussed in this chapter, designers can create spaces that are not only visually appealing, but also functional and sustainable.

## Chapter: Chapter 4: Lighting Design Strategies

### Introduction

Lighting design is a critical aspect of any architectural or interior design project. It is not just about illuminating a space, but also about creating an ambiance, setting a mood, and enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal of the space. In this chapter, we will delve into the various strategies and techniques used in lighting design, with a particular focus on natural light.

Natural light, as we know, is a free and renewable resource. It is also a key element in creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly design. However, harnessing natural light effectively requires a deep understanding of how it behaves and how it interacts with different materials and spaces. This chapter will provide you with the necessary tools and knowledge to make the most of natural light in your design projects.

Furthermore, we will delve into the concept of daylighting, which is the practice of using natural light to illuminate a space during the day. We will discuss the benefits of daylighting, including energy savings, improved occupant health and well-being, and reduced environmental impact.

Finally, we will touch upon the role of technology in lighting design, including the use of smart lighting systems and controls. These systems can help optimize the use of natural light, while also providing additional lighting when needed.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of lighting design strategies, with a particular focus on natural light. You will be equipped with the knowledge and tools to create lighting designs that are not only functional, but also aesthetically pleasing and sustainable.




#### 3.3b Artificial Light Levels

Artificial light levels are another crucial aspect of photometry and daylight metrics. They provide a quantitative measure of the amount of artificial light in a given space. Understanding artificial light levels is essential for designing spaces that maximize the use of artificial light and minimize the need for daylight.

Artificial light levels are typically measured in lux (lx) or foot-candles (fc). These units represent the amount of light that falls on a surface. The higher the artificial light level, the brighter the space. However, it is important to note that the amount of light that is needed in a space depends on various factors, including the type of activity taking place, the size and shape of the space, and the preferences of the occupants.

Artificial light levels can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the type of lighting used, the number and placement of light sources, and the reflectivity of the surfaces in the space. For example, a space lit by high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps will typically have higher artificial light levels than a space lit by incandescent lamps.

In addition to the amount of light, the quality of light is also important. This refers to the color temperature and spectral power distribution of the light. Color temperature is a measure of the warmth or coolness of light. It is typically measured in Kelvin (K). Spectral power distribution refers to the distribution of light across the spectrum of colors. A full-spectrum light source, such as an incandescent lamp, has a relatively flat spectral power distribution, while a narrow-spectrum light source, such as a fluorescent lamp, has a more concentrated distribution.

Understanding artificial light levels and their influencing factors is crucial for designing spaces that make optimal use of artificial light. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the concept of artificial light levels, exploring how they are measured and how they can be manipulated to create spaces that are both bright and comfortable.

#### 3.3c Typical Values

Typical values are an essential part of understanding photometry and daylight metrics. They provide a baseline for comparison and help in the design process by providing a reference point. These values are typically derived from empirical data and are used to set standards and guidelines for lighting design.

Typical values for daylight levels are often based on the concept of daylight autonomy. Daylight autonomy is the percentage of time during which a space receives more than a specified amount of daylight. For example, a typical value for daylight autonomy might be 80%, meaning that a space is expected to receive more than a specified amount of daylight for 80% of the time.

Typical values for artificial light levels are often based on the concept of visual comfort probability (VCP). VCP is a measure of the probability that a person will perceive a space as visually comfortable. A typical value for VCP might be 80%, meaning that a space is expected to be visually comfortable for 80% of the time.

These typical values are not absolute standards, but rather guidelines. They are meant to provide a starting point for the design process, and can be adjusted based on the specific needs and preferences of the space.

In addition to these typical values, there are also specific standards and guidelines for photometry and daylight metrics. For example, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has published several standards related to photometry and daylight metrics, including IEC 60598 for luminance measurements and IEC 62471 for photobiological safety.

Understanding these typical values and standards is crucial for designing spaces that make optimal use of both daylight and artificial light. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these concepts, exploring how they are measured and how they can be used in the design process.




#### 3.3c Light Level Recommendations

Light level recommendations are an essential part of photometry and daylight metrics. They provide a guide for designers and architects to determine the appropriate amount of light in a given space. These recommendations are based on scientific research and take into account various factors such as the type of activity taking place, the size and shape of the space, and the preferences of the occupants.

The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) provides guidelines for light level recommendations. These guidelines are based on the concept of the Minimum Recommended Illuminance (MRI), which is the minimum amount of light required for a given task or activity. The MRI is calculated based on the visual acuity of the task, the size and shape of the space, and the reflectivity of the surfaces.

For example, in a typical office space, the MRI for reading a computer screen is 500 lux. This means that the light level in the space should be at least 500 lux for comfortable reading. However, if the space is larger or has lower reflectivity surfaces, the MRI may need to be increased.

In addition to the MRI, the CIE also provides guidelines for the Maximum Recommended Illuminance (MRI). This is the maximum amount of light that is recommended for a given space. The MRI is typically higher than the MRI, as it takes into account the potential for glare and discomfort.

Light level recommendations are not set in stone and can vary depending on the specific needs and preferences of the occupants. For example, in a residential space, the MRI may be lower than in a commercial space, as the occupants may prefer a more intimate and cozy atmosphere.

It is important for designers and architects to consider light level recommendations when designing spaces. By following these guidelines, they can create spaces that are both functional and comfortable for the occupants. 





#### 3.4a DF Calculation

The Daylight Factor (DF) is a crucial metric in photometry and daylight metrics. It is defined as the ratio of the amount of daylight entering a space to the amount of daylight that would enter a hypothetical reference space with a uniformly diffuse sky. The DF is a dimensionless number and is typically expressed as a percentage.

The calculation of DF involves several steps. First, the amount of daylight entering a space is determined using photometric measurements. This can be done using a variety of instruments, such as a lux meter or a photometer. The measurements are taken at different points within the space, and the results are averaged to obtain an overall value for the space.

Next, the amount of daylight that would enter a reference space is calculated. This is done using the concept of the reference plane, which is a hypothetical plane located at a fixed height above the ground. The amount of daylight entering the reference plane is determined using the concept of the horizontal plane, which is a plane perpendicular to the reference plane. The amount of daylight entering the horizontal plane is then calculated using the concept of the sky component, which is the amount of light from the sky that reaches the horizontal plane.

The DF is then calculated by dividing the amount of daylight entering the space by the amount of daylight entering the reference space. This calculation takes into account the effects of the building and its surroundings on the amount of daylight entering the space.

The DF is a crucial metric in daylighting design, as it allows designers to compare the amount of daylight entering different spaces. A higher DF indicates a space with more natural light, while a lower DF indicates a space with less natural light. The DF can also be used to determine the effectiveness of different design strategies in maximizing natural light.

In addition to its use in design, the DF is also used in research and studies. For example, researchers have used the DF to study the effects of daylight on human health and well-being. They have found that spaces with higher DF values have a positive impact on occupants, leading to improved mood, productivity, and overall satisfaction.

In conclusion, the Daylight Factor is a crucial metric in photometry and daylight metrics. It allows designers to quantify the amount of natural light entering a space and compare different design strategies. Its use extends beyond design and into research, highlighting its importance in the field of daylighting. 





#### 3.4b DF Applications

The Daylight Factor (DF) is a versatile metric that has a wide range of applications in the field of daylighting design. In this section, we will explore some of the key applications of DF in design and research.

##### 3.4b.1 Daylighting Design

The primary application of DF in design is in the evaluation and comparison of different design strategies. By calculating the DF for different spaces, designers can determine which design strategies are most effective in maximizing natural light. For example, a designer might compare the DF of a space with a large south-facing window to a space with a smaller north-facing window. The DF can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different types of glazing, such as clear glass versus tinted glass.

##### 3.4b.2 Research and Studies

DF is also a crucial metric in research and studies related to daylighting. For instance, researchers might use DF to study the effects of different building forms and orientations on the amount of natural light entering a space. This can help inform the design of more efficient and sustainable buildings.

##### 3.4b.3 Building Codes and Standards

DF is also used in building codes and standards to ensure that buildings provide adequate levels of natural light. For example, some building codes require that certain spaces, such as bedrooms, have a minimum DF. This ensures that these spaces receive a sufficient amount of natural light.

##### 3.4b.4 Daylight Metrics

DF is one of several key daylight metrics used in photometry and daylighting design. Other important metrics include the Daylight Autonomy (DA), the Daylight Factor (DF), and the Daylight Exposure (DE). These metrics provide different perspectives on the amount and quality of natural light entering a space, and they are often used in combination to evaluate the overall performance of a building.

In conclusion, the Daylight Factor (DF) is a powerful metric that has a wide range of applications in the field of daylighting design. By understanding and applying DF, designers can create more efficient and sustainable buildings that make effective use of natural light.

In the end, this chapter aims to equip you with the knowledge and skills to design with natural light, creating spaces that are not only functional and aesthetically pleasing, but also environmentally friendly. So, let's embark on this journey of exploring the world of daylighting design strategies.




#### 3.4c DF Limitations

While the Daylight Factor (DF) is a powerful metric for evaluating the amount of natural light entering a space, it is not without its limitations. Understanding these limitations is crucial for interpreting DF results and making informed design decisions.

##### 3.4c.1 Assumptions and Simplifications

The calculation of DF is based on several assumptions and simplifications. For instance, it assumes that the space is uniformly lit and that the light distribution is symmetrical. In reality, this is often not the case. Real-world spaces are typically non-uniformly lit, and the light distribution can be asymmetrical. This can lead to inaccuracies in the DF calculation.

##### 3.4c.2 Sensitivity to Geometry

DF is highly sensitive to the geometry of the space. Small changes in the geometry, such as the size and shape of the windows, can have a significant impact on the DF. This can make it challenging to compare DF results across different spaces, as the geometry of the spaces may be different.

##### 3.4c.3 Limitations of Photometry

Photometry, the science of measuring light, is used to calculate DF. Photometry has its own set of limitations. For example, it assumes that the light source is a point source, which is often not the case in real-world scenarios. It also assumes that the light is incident on a uniformly diffuse surface, which is not always true. These assumptions can lead to inaccuracies in the DF calculation.

##### 3.4c.4 Limitations of Metric

DF is a metric that measures the amount of natural light entering a space. However, it does not take into account the quality of the light. For instance, it does not consider the color temperature of the light, which can significantly affect the perceived brightness and warmth of the space. Nor does it consider the distribution of the light, which can affect the uniformity of the illumination.

##### 3.4c.5 Limitations of Standard

DF is a metric that is defined by a standard (CIE S 017/E). However, this standard does not specify how to calculate DF for certain types of spaces, such as spaces with complex geometries or spaces with multiple light sources. This can make it challenging to apply the DF metric to these types of spaces.

In conclusion, while the Daylight Factor is a valuable tool for evaluating the amount of natural light entering a space, it is important to be aware of its limitations. These limitations should be taken into account when interpreting DF results and making design decisions.




#### 3.5a Daylight Autonomy

Daylight Autonomy (DA) is a static daylighting metric that quantifies the amount of time a space is illuminated by natural light above a specified minimum level. It is a critical metric in the design and evaluation of daylighting systems, as it provides a measure of the quality of daylighting in a space.

##### 3.5a.1 Calculating Daylight Autonomy

The calculation of DA is based on the concept of the daylight factor (DF). The DA is calculated as the percentage of time that the DF is above a specified minimum level. The minimum level is typically set at a value that corresponds to a certain level of illumination, such as 300 lux.

The DA can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
DA = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{1}_{DF_i > DF_{min}}
$$

where $DA$ is the Daylight Autonomy, $N$ is the number of time steps (typically, hours), $DF_i$ is the daylight factor at time step $i$, and $DF_{min}$ is the minimum daylight factor. The function $\mathbf{1}_{DF_i > DF_{min}}$ is an indicator function that is equal to 1 if $DF_i > DF_{min}$ and 0 otherwise.

##### 3.5a.2 Interpreting Daylight Autonomy

A high DA indicates that the space is well-lit by natural light for a significant portion of the day. This is desirable from a daylighting perspective, as it provides a high quality of light and reduces the need for artificial lighting. However, a high DA can also indicate that the space is over-lit, which can lead to glare and discomfort.

Conversely, a low DA indicates that the space is not well-lit by natural light for a significant portion of the day. This can be problematic from a daylighting perspective, as it can lead to a low quality of light and a high need for artificial lighting. However, a low DA can also indicate that the space is under-lit, which can reduce the risk of glare and discomfort.

##### 3.5a.3 Limitations of Daylight Autonomy

While DA is a useful metric for evaluating the quality of daylighting in a space, it is not without its limitations. Like the daylight factor, the calculation of DA is based on several assumptions and simplifications. For instance, it assumes that the space is uniformly lit and that the light distribution is symmetrical. In reality, this is often not the case. Real-world spaces are typically non-uniformly lit, and the light distribution can be asymmetrical. This can lead to inaccuracies in the DA calculation.

Furthermore, DA is a static metric that does not take into account the dynamic nature of daylighting. The quality of daylighting can vary significantly throughout the day, and this variation is not captured by the DA. This can make it challenging to interpret DA results and make informed design decisions.

Despite these limitations, DA remains a valuable tool in the design and evaluation of daylighting systems. By understanding its strengths and limitations, designers can use DA to optimize the quality of daylighting in their spaces.

#### 3.5b Daylight Saturation

Daylight Saturation (DS) is another static daylighting metric that quantifies the amount of time a space is illuminated by natural light above a specified minimum level. However, unlike Daylight Autonomy, which considers the entire day, Daylight Saturation focuses on the periods of intense daylight.

##### 3.5b.1 Calculating Daylight Saturation

The calculation of DS is also based on the concept of the daylight factor (DF). The DS is calculated as the percentage of time that the DF is above a specified minimum level during periods of intense daylight. The minimum level is typically set at a value that corresponds to a certain level of illumination, such as 500 lux.

The DS can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
DS = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{1}_{DF_i > DF_{min} \text{ and } H_i > H_{min}}
$$

where $DS$ is the Daylight Saturation, $N$ is the number of time steps (typically, hours), $DF_i$ is the daylight factor at time step $i$, $DF_{min}$ is the minimum daylight factor, $H_i$ is the hourly value at time step $i$, and $H_{min}$ is the minimum hourly value. The function $\mathbf{1}_{DF_i > DF_{min} \text{ and } H_i > H_{min}}$ is an indicator function that is equal to 1 if $DF_i > DF_{min}$ and $H_i > H_{min}$ and 0 otherwise.

##### 3.5b.2 Interpreting Daylight Saturation

A high DS indicates that the space is well-lit by natural light during periods of intense daylight. This is desirable from a daylighting perspective, as it provides a high quality of light and reduces the need for artificial lighting. However, a high DS can also indicate that the space is over-lit during these periods, which can lead to glare and discomfort.

Conversely, a low DS indicates that the space is not well-lit by natural light during periods of intense daylight. This can be problematic from a daylighting perspective, as it can lead to a low quality of light and a high need for artificial lighting. However, a low DS can also indicate that the space is under-lit during these periods, which can reduce the risk of glare and discomfort.

##### 3.5b.3 Limitations of Daylight Saturation

While DS is a useful metric for evaluating the quality of daylighting in a space, it is not without its limitations. Like the daylight factor, the calculation of DS is based on several assumptions and simplifications. For instance, it assumes that the space is uniformly lit and that the light distribution is symmetrical. In reality, this is often not the case. Real-world spaces are typically non-uniformly lit, and the light distribution can be asymmetrical. This can lead to inaccuracies in the DS calculation.

Furthermore, DS is a static metric that does not take into account the dynamic nature of daylighting. The quality of daylighting can vary significantly throughout the day, and this variation is not captured by the DS. This can make it difficult to interpret DS results and make informed decisions about daylighting design.

#### 3.5c Daylight Glare

Daylight Glare (DG) is a static daylighting metric that quantifies the amount of time a space is subjected to glare from natural light. Glare can be a significant issue in daylighting design, as it can cause discomfort and reduce the quality of the visual environment.

##### 3.5c.1 Calculating Daylight Glare

The calculation of DG is based on the concept of the daylight factor (DF). The DG is calculated as the percentage of time that the DF is above a specified minimum level during periods of intense daylight. The minimum level is typically set at a value that corresponds to a certain level of illumination, such as 1000 lux.

The DG can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
DG = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{1}_{DF_i > DF_{min} \text{ and } H_i > H_{min}}
$$

where $DG$ is the Daylight Glare, $N$ is the number of time steps (typically, hours), $DF_i$ is the daylight factor at time step $i$, $DF_{min}$ is the minimum daylight factor, $H_i$ is the hourly value at time step $i$, and $H_{min}$ is the minimum hourly value. The function $\mathbf{1}_{DF_i > DF_{min} \text{ and } H_i > H_{min}}$ is an indicator function that is equal to 1 if $DF_i > DF_{min}$ and $H_i > H_{min}$ and 0 otherwise.

##### 3.5c.2 Interpreting Daylight Glare

A high DG indicates that the space is subjected to glare from natural light for a significant portion of the day. This can be problematic from a daylighting perspective, as it can lead to discomfort and reduced visual quality. However, a high DG can also indicate that the space is well-lit by natural light during periods of intense daylight, which can be desirable from a daylighting perspective.

Conversely, a low DG indicates that the space is not subjected to glare from natural light for a significant portion of the day. This can be beneficial from a daylighting perspective, as it can reduce discomfort and improve visual quality. However, a low DG can also indicate that the space is not well-lit by natural light during periods of intense daylight, which can be problematic from a daylighting perspective.

##### 3.5c.3 Limitations of Daylight Glare

While DG is a useful metric for evaluating the quality of daylighting in a space, it is not without its limitations. Like the daylight factor, the calculation of DG is based on several assumptions and simplifications. For instance, it assumes that the space is uniformly lit and that the light distribution is symmetrical. In reality, this is often not the case. Real-world spaces are typically non-uniformly lit, and the light distribution can be asymmetrical. This can lead to inaccuracies in the DG calculation.

Furthermore, DG does not take into account the dynamic nature of glare. Glare can vary significantly throughout the day, and this variation is not captured by the DG metric. This can make it difficult to interpret DG results and make informed decisions about daylighting design.

#### 3.5d Daylight Balance

Daylight Balance (DB) is a static daylighting metric that quantifies the balance between direct and indirect daylight in a space. This balance is crucial for creating a comfortable and visually appealing environment.

##### 3.5d.1 Calculating Daylight Balance

The calculation of DB is based on the concept of the daylight factor (DF). The DB is calculated as the ratio of the direct daylight factor (DFd) to the total daylight factor (DFt). The direct daylight factor is calculated as the percentage of time that the DF is above a specified minimum level during periods of intense daylight. The total daylight factor is calculated as the percentage of time that the DF is above a specified minimum level during the entire day.

The DB can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
DB = \frac{DFd}{DFt}
$$

where $DB$ is the Daylight Balance, $DFd$ is the direct daylight factor, and $DFt$ is the total daylight factor.

##### 3.5d.2 Interpreting Daylight Balance

A high DB indicates that the space is predominantly lit by direct daylight. This can be desirable from a daylighting perspective, as it can create a sense of openness and brightness. However, a high DB can also indicate that the space is not well-lit by indirect daylight, which can be problematic for creating a comfortable and visually appealing environment.

Conversely, a low DB indicates that the space is predominantly lit by indirect daylight. This can be beneficial from a daylighting perspective, as it can reduce glare and create a sense of warmth. However, a low DB can also indicate that the space is not well-lit by direct daylight, which can be problematic for creating a sense of openness and brightness.

##### 3.5d.3 Limitations of Daylight Balance

While DB is a useful metric for evaluating the quality of daylighting in a space, it is not without its limitations. Like the daylight factor, the calculation of DB is based on several assumptions and simplifications. For instance, it assumes that the space is uniformly lit and that the light distribution is symmetrical. In reality, this is often not the case. Real-world spaces are typically non-uniformly lit, and the light distribution can be asymmetrical. This can lead to inaccuracies in the DB calculation.

Furthermore, DB does not take into account the dynamic nature of daylight. The balance between direct and indirect daylight can vary significantly throughout the day, and this variation is not captured by the DB metric. This can make it difficult to interpret DB results and make informed decisions about daylighting design.

#### 3.5e Daylight Aperture

Daylight Aperture (DA) is a static daylighting metric that quantifies the amount of natural light entering a space through a specific opening or aperture. This metric is crucial for designing and evaluating the performance of daylighting systems.

##### 3.5e.1 Calculating Daylight Aperture

The calculation of DA is based on the concept of the daylight factor (DF). The DA is calculated as the ratio of the daylight factor through the aperture (DFa) to the total daylight factor (DFt). The daylight factor through the aperture is calculated as the percentage of time that the DF is above a specified minimum level during periods of intense daylight. The total daylight factor is calculated as the percentage of time that the DF is above a specified minimum level during the entire day.

The DA can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
DA = \frac{DFa}{DFt}
$$

where $DA$ is the Daylight Aperture, $DFa$ is the daylight factor through the aperture, and $DFt$ is the total daylight factor.

##### 3.5e.2 Interpreting Daylight Aperture

A high DA indicates that the aperture is contributing significantly to the overall daylighting of the space. This can be desirable from a daylighting perspective, as it can increase the amount of natural light in the space and reduce the need for artificial lighting. However, a high DA can also indicate that the aperture is over-lit, which can lead to glare and discomfort.

Conversely, a low DA indicates that the aperture is not contributing significantly to the overall daylighting of the space. This can be problematic from a daylighting perspective, as it can reduce the amount of natural light in the space and increase the need for artificial lighting. However, a low DA can also indicate that the aperture is under-lit, which can reduce the risk of glare and discomfort.

##### 3.5e.3 Limitations of Daylight Aperture

While DA is a useful metric for evaluating the performance of daylighting systems, it is not without its limitations. Like the daylight factor, the calculation of DA is based on several assumptions and simplifications. For instance, it assumes that the aperture is uniformly lit and that the light distribution is symmetrical. In reality, this is often not the case. Real-world apertures are typically non-uniformly lit, and the light distribution can be asymmetrical. This can lead to inaccuracies in the DA calculation.

Furthermore, DA does not take into account the dynamic nature of daylight. The amount of natural light entering a space through an aperture can vary significantly throughout the day, and this variation is not captured by the DA metric. This can make it difficult to interpret DA results and make informed decisions about daylighting design.

#### 3.5f Daylight Factor

Daylight Factor (DF) is a static daylighting metric that quantifies the amount of natural light entering a space. This metric is crucial for designing and evaluating the performance of daylighting systems.

##### 3.5f.1 Calculating Daylight Factor

The calculation of DF is based on the concept of the daylight factor (DF). The DF is calculated as the ratio of the daylight factor through the aperture (DFa) to the total daylight factor (DFt). The daylight factor through the aperture is calculated as the percentage of time that the DF is above a specified minimum level during periods of intense daylight. The total daylight factor is calculated as the percentage of time that the DF is above a specified minimum level during the entire day.

The DF can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
DF = \frac{DFa}{DFt}
$$

where $DF$ is the Daylight Factor, $DFa$ is the daylight factor through the aperture, and $DFt$ is the total daylight factor.

##### 3.5f.2 Interpreting Daylight Factor

A high DF indicates that the space is well-lit by natural light. This can be desirable from a daylighting perspective, as it can increase the amount of natural light in the space and reduce the need for artificial lighting. However, a high DF can also indicate that the space is over-lit, which can lead to glare and discomfort.

Conversely, a low DF indicates that the space is not well-lit by natural light. This can be problematic from a daylighting perspective, as it can reduce the amount of natural light in the space and increase the need for artificial lighting. However, a low DF can also indicate that the space is under-lit, which can reduce the risk of glare and discomfort.

##### 3.5f.3 Limitations of Daylight Factor

While DF is a useful metric for evaluating the performance of daylighting systems, it is not without its limitations. Like the daylight aperture, the calculation of DF is based on the concept of the daylight factor. This means that it assumes that the aperture is uniformly lit and that the light distribution is symmetrical. In reality, this is often not the case. Real-world apertures are typically non-uniformly lit, and the light distribution can be asymmetrical. This can lead to inaccuracies in the DF calculation.

Furthermore, DF does not take into account the dynamic nature of daylight. The amount of natural light entering a space can vary significantly throughout the day, and this variation is not captured by the DF metric. This can make it difficult to interpret DF results and make informed decisions about daylighting design.

## Chapter 4: Photometric Concepts

### Introduction

In the realm of natural lighting, photometric concepts play a pivotal role. They provide a quantitative measure of the light that is essential for understanding and designing lighting systems. This chapter, "Photometric Concepts," will delve into the fundamental principles and applications of these concepts.

Photometry is the science of measuring light. It is a critical aspect of lighting design, as it allows us to quantify the amount and quality of light in a space. This chapter will explore the key photometric concepts, including illuminance, luminance, and photometric properties of surfaces.

Illuminance is the amount of light that falls on a surface. It is a crucial concept in photometry, as it helps us understand how much light is available in a given space. We will discuss how to calculate illuminance and its significance in lighting design.

Luminance, on the other hand, is the amount of light that a surface emits or reflects. It is a measure of the brightness of a surface. Understanding luminance is essential for designing lighting systems that provide the right amount of light.

Finally, we will explore the photometric properties of surfaces. These properties, such as reflectance and transmittance, determine how much light a surface will reflect or transmit. Understanding these properties is crucial for designing lighting systems that provide the right amount of light.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of these photometric concepts and their applications in natural lighting. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the subsequent chapters, where we will delve deeper into the principles and applications of natural lighting.




#### 3.5b Useful Daylight Illuminance

Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI) is another static daylighting metric that quantifies the amount of usable light in a space. It is a critical metric in the design and evaluation of daylighting systems, as it provides a measure of the quality of daylighting in a space.

##### 3.5b.1 Calculating Useful Daylight Illuminance

The calculation of UDI is based on the concept of the daylight factor (DF) and the concept of the useful daylight illuminance. The UDI is calculated as the product of the DF and the illuminance at a specified level. The level is typically set at a value that corresponds to a certain level of illumination, such as 300 lux.

The UDI can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
UDI = DF \times E_{min}
$$

where $UDI$ is the Useful Daylight Illuminance, $DF$ is the Daylight Factor, and $E_{min}$ is the minimum illuminance.

##### 3.5b.2 Interpreting Useful Daylight Illuminance

A high UDI indicates that the space is well-lit by natural light for a significant portion of the day, and that the light is of high quality. This is desirable from a daylighting perspective, as it provides a high quality of light and reduces the need for artificial lighting. However, a high UDI can also indicate that the space is over-lit, which can lead to glare and discomfort.

Conversely, a low UDI indicates that the space is not well-lit by natural light for a significant portion of the day, and that the light is of low quality. This can be problematic from a daylighting perspective, as it can lead to a low quality of light and a high need for artificial lighting. However, a low UDI can also indicate that the space is under-lit, which can reduce the risk of glare and discomfort.

##### 3.5b.3 Limitations of Useful Daylight Illuminance

While UDI is a useful metric for evaluating the quality of daylighting in a space, it is not without its limitations. One of the main limitations is that it assumes a fixed minimum illuminance level. In reality, the minimum illuminance level can vary depending on the specific requirements of the space. For example, a space with high reflectance surfaces may require a lower minimum illuminance level than a space with low reflectance surfaces. Additionally, UDI does not take into account the quality of the light, which can be influenced by factors such as color temperature and spectral distribution.

### Conclusion

## Chapter: Chapter 4: Daylighting Design Strategies

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamental concepts of natural light and its role in design. We have delved into the principles of photometry and daylight metrics, understanding how they are used to quantify and evaluate natural light in a design context. Now, in Chapter 4, we will shift our focus to the practical application of these concepts in daylighting design strategies.

Daylighting design is a critical aspect of architectural design, particularly in the context of sustainable design. It involves the strategic use of natural light to illuminate a building's interior, reducing the need for artificial lighting and thereby conserving energy. This chapter will provide a comprehensive guide to daylighting design strategies, offering insights into how these strategies can be effectively implemented in a design context.

We will explore various daylighting strategies, including the use of skylights, clerestories, and light shelves, among others. Each strategy will be discussed in detail, with a focus on their design principles, benefits, and potential challenges. We will also delve into the role of daylighting in creating a sense of space and enhancing the overall quality of a building's interior.

This chapter will also touch upon the importance of considering daylighting in the early stages of design, and how it can be integrated into the overall design process. We will discuss how daylighting strategies can be used to create a harmonious relationship between the building and its surrounding environment, enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal of the design.

In essence, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of daylighting design strategies, equipping readers with the knowledge and tools to effectively incorporate natural light into their designs. Whether you are a student, a practicing architect, or simply someone interested in the principles of natural light in design, this chapter will serve as a valuable resource in your journey.




#### 3.5c Spatial Daylight Autonomy

Spatial Daylight Autonomy (SDA) is a daylighting metric that quantifies the amount of time a space is illuminated by natural light. It is a critical metric in the design and evaluation of daylighting systems, as it provides a measure of the availability of natural light in a space.

##### 3.5c.1 Calculating Spatial Daylight Autonomy

The calculation of SDA is based on the concept of the daylight factor (DF) and the concept of the useful daylight illuminance. The SDA is calculated as the product of the DF and the illuminance at a specified level. The level is typically set at a value that corresponds to a certain level of illumination, such as 300 lux.

The SDA can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
SDA = DF \times E_{min}
$$

where $SDA$ is the Spatial Daylight Autonomy, $DF$ is the Daylight Factor, and $E_{min}$ is the minimum illuminance.

##### 3.5c.2 Interpreting Spatial Daylight Autonomy

A high SDA indicates that the space is well-lit by natural light for a significant portion of the day, and that the light is of high quality. This is desirable from a daylighting perspective, as it provides a high quality of light and reduces the need for artificial lighting. However, a high SDA can also indicate that the space is over-lit, which can lead to glare and discomfort.

Conversely, a low SDA indicates that the space is not well-lit by natural light for a significant portion of the day, and that the light is of low quality. This can be problematic from a daylighting perspective, as it can lead to a low quality of light and a high need for artificial lighting. However, a low SDA can also indicate that the space is under-lit, which can reduce the risk of glare and discomfort.

##### 3.5c.3 Limitations of Spatial Daylight Autonomy

While SDA is a useful metric for evaluating the quality of daylighting in a space, it is not without its limitations. One of the main limitations is that it assumes a fixed minimum illuminance level. This can be problematic in spaces where the minimum illuminance level is not fixed, such as in open-plan offices where the occupancy and therefore the lighting needs can vary greatly. Additionally, SDA does not take into account the quality of the light, which can be just as important as the quantity of light. A space with a high SDA may have a high quantity of light, but if the quality of the light is poor (for example, if it is harsh and glary), it may not be as beneficial to the occupants as a space with a lower SDA but better quality light.




#### 3.6a Annual Sunlight Exposure

Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE) is a daylighting metric that quantifies the total amount of sunlight a space receives over the course of a year. It is a critical metric in the design and evaluation of daylighting systems, as it provides a measure of the total amount of natural light a space receives.

##### 3.6a.1 Calculating Annual Sunlight Exposure

The calculation of ASE is based on the concept of the daylight factor (DF) and the concept of the useful daylight illuminance. The ASE is calculated as the product of the DF and the illuminance at a specified level. The level is typically set at a value that corresponds to a certain level of illumination, such as 300 lux.

The ASE can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
ASE = DF \times E_{min} \times \frac{hours}{year}
$$

where $ASE$ is the Annual Sunlight Exposure, $DF$ is the Daylight Factor, $E_{min}$ is the minimum illuminance, and $\frac{hours}{year}$ is the number of hours in a year.

##### 3.6a.2 Interpreting Annual Sunlight Exposure

A high ASE indicates that the space is well-lit by natural light for a significant portion of the year, and that the light is of high quality. This is desirable from a daylighting perspective, as it provides a high quality of light and reduces the need for artificial lighting. However, a high ASE can also indicate that the space is over-lit, which can lead to glare and discomfort.

Conversely, a low ASE indicates that the space is not well-lit by natural light for a significant portion of the year, and that the light is of low quality. This can be problematic from a daylighting perspective, as it can lead to a low quality of light and a high need for artificial lighting. However, a low ASE can also indicate that the space is under-lit, which can reduce the risk of glare and discomfort.

##### 3.6a.3 Limitations of Annual Sunlight Exposure

While ASE is a useful metric for evaluating the quality of daylighting in a space, it is not without its limitations. One of the main limitations is that it assumes a fixed minimum illuminance. In reality, the minimum illuminance can vary depending on the time of day, the season, and the weather conditions. Therefore, the ASE can be an overestimation or an underestimation of the actual amount of sunlight a space receives.

Another limitation is that it does not take into account the quality of the light. While a high ASE indicates a high amount of light, it does not necessarily mean that the light is of high quality. For example, direct sunlight can provide a high amount of light, but it can also cause glare and discomfort. On the other hand, diffuse light can provide a lower amount of light, but it can also provide a more comfortable and high-quality light.

Despite these limitations, ASE remains a valuable metric for evaluating the daylighting performance of a space. It provides a quantitative measure of the amount of natural light a space receives, which can be used to compare different design options and to optimize the daylighting system.

#### 3.6b Daylighting Performance Metrics

Daylighting performance metrics are a set of quantitative measures used to evaluate the effectiveness of daylighting systems in a building. These metrics provide a means to compare different design options and to optimize the daylighting system. They are essential tools for architects and designers in creating spaces that are both visually appealing and functional.

##### 3.6b.1 Daylight Factor (DF)

The Daylight Factor (DF) is a key metric in daylighting performance. It is defined as the ratio of the average illuminance on a surface within a building to the illuminance on a horizontal surface outside the building, under standard conditions. The DF is typically expressed as a percentage and is used to assess the amount of natural light entering a building.

The DF can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
DF = \frac{E_{int}}{E_{ext}} \times 100\%
$$

where $DF$ is the Daylight Factor, $E_{int}$ is the average illuminance on a surface within the building, and $E_{ext}$ is the illuminance on a horizontal surface outside the building.

##### 3.6b.2 Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI)

The Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI) is another important metric in daylighting performance. It is defined as the average illuminance on a surface within a building that is above a specified minimum level. The UDI is used to assess the quality of natural light entering a building.

The UDI can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
UDI = \frac{1}{A} \int_{E_{min}}^{E_{max}} E \cdot dA
$$

where $UDI$ is the Useful Daylight Illuminance, $A$ is the area of the surface, $E$ is the illuminance, $E_{min}$ is the minimum illuminance, and $E_{max}$ is the maximum illuminance.

##### 3.6b.3 Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE)

As discussed in the previous section, the Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE) is a metric that quantifies the total amount of sunlight a space receives over the course of a year. It is a critical metric in the design and evaluation of daylighting systems.

The ASE can be calculated using the formula provided in the previous section.

##### 3.6b.4 Daylight Autonomy (DA)

The Daylight Autonomy (DA) is a metric that quantifies the amount of time a space is illuminated by natural light above a specified minimum level. It is a critical metric in the design and evaluation of daylighting systems.

The DA can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
DA = \frac{1}{A} \int_{E_{min}}^{E_{max}} t \cdot dE
$$

where $DA$ is the Daylight Autonomy, $A$ is the area of the surface, $t$ is the time, $E$ is the illuminance, $E_{min}$ is the minimum illuminance, and $E_{max}$ is the maximum illuminance.

##### 3.6b.5 Daylight Factor with Time (DFT)

The Daylight Factor with Time (DFT) is a metric that quantifies the amount of natural light entering a building over time. It is a critical metric in the design and evaluation of daylighting systems.

The DFT can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
DFT = \frac{1}{A} \int_{0}^{T} E \cdot t \cdot dE
$$

where $DFT$ is the Daylight Factor with Time, $A$ is the area of the surface, $t$ is the time, $E$ is the illuminance, and $T$ is the total time period.

These metrics provide a comprehensive means to evaluate the performance of daylighting systems. They allow architects and designers to compare different design options and to optimize the daylighting system. They also provide a means to assess the quality of natural light entering a building.

#### 3.6c Daylighting Control Strategies

#### 3.6b Continuous Daylight Autonomy

Continuous Daylight Autonomy (CDA) is a daylighting metric that quantifies the amount of time a space is lit by natural light. It is a critical metric in the design and evaluation of daylighting systems, as it provides a measure of the reliability of natural light in a space.

##### 3.6b.1 Calculating Continuous Daylight Autonomy

The calculation of CDA is based on the concept of the daylight factor (DF) and the concept of the useful daylight illuminance. The CDA is calculated as the product of the DF and the illuminance at a specified level. The level is typically set at a value that corresponds to a certain level of illumination, such as 300 lux.

The CDA can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
CDA = DF \times E_{min} \times \frac{hours}{year}
$$

where $CDA$ is the Continuous Daylight Autonomy, $DF$ is the Daylight Factor, $E_{min}$ is the minimum illuminance, and $\frac{hours}{year}$ is the number of hours in a year.

##### 3.6b.2 Interpreting Continuous Daylight Autonomy

A high CDA indicates that the space is well-lit by natural light for a significant portion of the year, and that the light is of high quality. This is desirable from a daylighting perspective, as it provides a high quality of light and reduces the need for artificial lighting. However, a high CDA can also indicate that the space is over-lit, which can lead to glare and discomfort.

Conversely, a low CDA indicates that the space is not well-lit by natural light for a significant portion of the year, and that the light is of low quality. This can be problematic from a daylighting perspective, as it can lead to a low quality of light and a high need for artificial lighting. However, a low CDA can also indicate that the space is under-lit, which can reduce the risk of glare and discomfort.

##### 3.6b.3 Limitations of Continuous Daylight Autonomy

While CDA is a useful metric for evaluating the quality of daylighting in a space, it is not without its limitations. One of the main limitations is that it assumes a constant level of illumination. In reality, the illumination levels can vary significantly throughout the day and throughout the year, which can affect the accuracy of the CDA calculation. Additionally, CDA does not take into account the quality of the light, which can be influenced by factors such as the color temperature and the spectral distribution of the light.

Despite these limitations, CDA remains a valuable tool in the design and evaluation of daylighting systems. It provides a quantitative measure of the reliability of natural light in a space, which can help designers make informed decisions about the design and implementation of daylighting systems.

#### 3.6c Daylight Savings

Daylight Savings, also known as Daylight Saving Time (DST), is a seasonal adjustment of standard time in which the clock is set one hour ahead of standard time during the summer months. This practice is intended to maximize the use of natural daylight and reduce the need for artificial lighting.

##### 3.6c.1 The Concept of Daylight Savings

The concept of Daylight Savings was first proposed by Benjamin Franklin in 1784 as a way to save candles. However, it was not until the early 20th century that it was implemented in any country. The first country to adopt Daylight Savings was Germany in 1916 during World War I as a way to conserve coal.

Today, many countries around the world observe Daylight Savings, with the exact dates and times varying depending on the location. In the United States, Daylight Savings begins on the second Sunday of March and ends on the first Sunday of November.

##### 3.6c.2 Impact of Daylight Savings on Daylight Metrics

The implementation of Daylight Savings can have a significant impact on daylight metrics such as Continuous Daylight Autonomy (CDA) and Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE). By setting the clock one hour ahead during the summer months, the amount of daylight is effectively increased, leading to higher values of CDA and ASE.

However, the impact of Daylight Savings on daylight metrics can vary depending on the location and the time of year. For example, in locations near the equator, the impact of Daylight Savings may be minimal due to the relatively consistent amount of daylight throughout the year. On the other hand, in locations near the poles, the impact can be more significant due to the large variations in daylight throughout the year.

##### 3.6c.3 Considerations for Designers

When designing a building, it is important for designers to consider the impact of Daylight Savings on daylight metrics. This can be particularly important for buildings that rely heavily on natural light, such as schools and offices. By incorporating Daylight Savings into the design, designers can ensure that the building receives the maximum amount of natural light throughout the year.

However, designers must also consider the potential drawbacks of Daylight Savings, such as the increased risk of glare and discomfort due to over-lit spaces. This can be mitigated by incorporating design features such as shading devices and glare controls.

In conclusion, Daylight Savings is a crucial consideration for designers when designing a building to maximize the use of natural light. By understanding the impact of Daylight Savings on daylight metrics, designers can create buildings that effectively utilize natural light throughout the year.

#### 3.6c Daylight Saturation Percentage

Daylight Saturation Percentage (DSP) is a daylighting metric that quantifies the amount of natural light in a space. It is a critical metric in the design and evaluation of daylighting systems, as it provides a measure of the quality of natural light in a space.

##### 3.6c.1 Calculating Daylight Saturation Percentage

The calculation of DSP is based on the concept of the daylight factor (DF) and the concept of the useful daylight illuminance. The DSP is calculated as the ratio of the actual daylight illuminance to the maximum possible daylight illuminance.

The DSP can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
DSP = \frac{E_{actual}}{E_{max}} \times 100\%
$$

where $DSP$ is the Daylight Saturation Percentage, $E_{actual}$ is the actual daylight illuminance, and $E_{max}$ is the maximum possible daylight illuminance.

##### 3.6c.2 Interpreting Daylight Saturation Percentage

A high DSP indicates that the space is well-lit by natural light, and that the light is of high quality. This is desirable from a daylighting perspective, as it provides a high quality of light and reduces the need for artificial lighting. However, a high DSP can also indicate that the space is over-lit, which can lead to glare and discomfort.

Conversely, a low DSP indicates that the space is not well-lit by natural light, and that the light is of low quality. This can be problematic from a daylighting perspective, as it can lead to a low quality of light and a high need for artificial lighting. However, a low DSP can also indicate that the space is under-lit, which can reduce the risk of glare and discomfort.

##### 3.6c.3 Limitations of Daylight Saturation Percentage

While DSP is a useful metric for evaluating the quality of daylighting in a space, it is not without its limitations. For instance, it does not take into account the color quality of the light, which can significantly impact the perceived quality of the light. Furthermore, it assumes that the maximum possible daylight illuminance is constant, which is not always the case in real-world scenarios.

Despite these limitations, DSP remains a valuable tool in the design and evaluation of daylighting systems. It provides a quantitative measure of the quality of natural light in a space, which can be used to guide design decisions and evaluate the performance of daylighting systems.

On the other hand, human health is a complex and multifaceted concept that encompasses our physical, mental, and emotional states. It is influenced by a myriad of factors, including our environment, lifestyle, and the quality of light we are exposed to. 

In this chapter, we will explore the scientific evidence that supports the positive effects of natural light on human health. We will delve into the mechanisms by which natural light influences our body's internal clock, our sleep-wake cycle, and our overall health. We will also discuss the potential negative impacts of artificial light and how they can be mitigated.

Furthermore, we will examine the role of natural light in the design of spaces, from homes and offices to healthcare facilities and educational institutions. We will explore how designers can leverage natural light to create spaces that are not only visually appealing but also beneficial to the health and well-being of their occupants.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between natural light and human health, offering insights that can be applied in the design of spaces that enhance our health and well-being. It is our hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for designers, architects, and anyone interested in the intersection of natural light and human health.

Continuous daylight autonomy (CDA) is a variant of daylight autonomy that provides partial credit for time steps when the daylight illuminance lies below the minimum illuminance level. In the detailed design phase, continuous daylight autonomy is used to evaluate the performance of the design in terms of natural light.




#### 3.7c Daylight Metrics in Post-Occupancy Evaluation

Post-occupancy evaluation (POE) is a critical phase in the design process, where the performance of the built environment is assessed after it has been occupied by its intended users. This evaluation is crucial in understanding the actual performance of the design, and identifying areas for improvement. In the context of natural light in design, POE provides an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of the daylight metrics used in the detailed design phase.

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of natural light and its role in design. We have discussed the benefits of using natural light, such as reducing energy consumption and creating a more harmonious environment. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of daylighting analysis techniques.

Daylighting is the practice of using natural light to illuminate a space. It is a crucial aspect of design, as it not only provides functional benefits but also adds aesthetic value to a space. In this chapter, we will explore various techniques for analyzing daylighting, including the use of software and manual calculations.

We will begin by discussing the importance of daylighting analysis and how it can inform design decisions. We will then move on to cover the different types of daylighting analysis techniques, such as daylight factor and daylighting simulation software. We will also touch upon the concept of daylighting controls and how they can be used to optimize natural light in a space.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of daylighting analysis techniques and how they can be applied in design. This knowledge will not only aid in creating more sustainable and functional spaces but also add a unique and natural element to the design. So let us dive into the world of daylighting analysis and discover the wonders of natural light in design.




### Section: 4.1 DF, Solar Shading, and Daylight Autonomy Analyses:

Daylighting analysis techniques are essential tools for designers to understand and optimize the use of natural light in their designs. In this section, we will explore three key techniques: Daylight Factor (DF), Solar Shading, and Daylight Autonomy Analyses.

#### 4.1a DF Analysis

Daylight Factor (DF) is a measure of the amount of natural light that reaches a specific point in a space. It is calculated by dividing the amount of light at a point by the amount of light that would be received if the space were completely unobstructed by any surfaces or objects. DF is expressed as a percentage and is a crucial factor in determining the overall daylighting quality of a space.

To calculate DF, we use the CIE (Commission Internationale de l'Éclairage) method, which takes into account the luminance of the sky and the reflectance of the surrounding surfaces. The formula for DF is as follows:

$$
DF = \frac{L_{sky}}{L_{unobstructed}} \times 100\%
$$

where $L_{sky}$ is the luminance of the sky and $L_{unobstructed}$ is the luminance that would be received if the space were completely unobstructed.

DF is a crucial factor in determining the overall daylighting quality of a space. A higher DF indicates a space with more natural light, while a lower DF indicates a space with less natural light. Designers can use DF analysis to optimize the placement of windows and other openings to maximize natural light in a space.

#### 4.1b Solar Shading Analysis

Solar shading analysis is a technique used to determine the amount of direct sunlight that reaches a specific point in a space. It is an essential tool for designers to control the amount of natural light in a space and prevent overheating.

To perform a solar shading analysis, we use the concept of solar gain, which is the amount of heat energy received from the sun. The formula for solar gain is as follows:

$$
SG = \frac{I_{direct} \times A_{window}}{I_{incident}} \times 100\%
$$

where $I_{direct}$ is the intensity of direct sunlight, $A_{window}$ is the area of the window, and $I_{incident}$ is the intensity of incident sunlight.

Designers can use solar shading analysis to determine the optimal placement of shading devices, such as blinds or louvers, to control the amount of direct sunlight entering a space. This can help prevent overheating and reduce energy consumption.

#### 4.1c Daylight Autonomy Analysis

Daylight Autonomy (DA) is a measure of the amount of time a space receives a certain level of natural light. It is calculated by comparing the amount of natural light received in a space to a predetermined threshold. DA is expressed as a percentage and is a crucial factor in determining the overall daylighting quality of a space.

To calculate DA, we use the concept of daylight autonomy, which is the amount of time a space receives a certain level of natural light. The formula for DA is as follows:

$$
DA = \frac{T_{natural}}{T_{total}} \times 100\%
$$

where $T_{natural}$ is the amount of time a space receives a certain level of natural light and $T_{total}$ is the total amount of time the space is occupied.

Designers can use daylight autonomy analysis to optimize the placement of windows and other openings to ensure a space receives enough natural light throughout the day. This can help reduce energy consumption and create a more comfortable and healthy environment for occupants.

### Conclusion

In this section, we have explored three key daylighting analysis techniques: DF, solar shading, and daylight autonomy. These techniques are essential tools for designers to optimize the use of natural light in their designs and create more sustainable and functional spaces. By understanding and applying these techniques, designers can create spaces that not only look great but also provide a healthy and comfortable environment for occupants.

$$
SG = \frac{I_{direct} \times A_{window}}{I_{incident}}
$$

where $I_{direct}$ is the intensity of direct sunlight, $A_{window}$ is the area of the window, and $I_{incident}$ is the incident solar radiation.

Solar shading analysis is crucial for designing spaces that can effectively control the amount of natural light and heat energy entering the space. By understanding the solar gain, designers can make informed decisions about the placement and design of windows and other openings to optimize natural light and prevent overheating.

#### 4.1c Daylight Autonomy Analysis

Daylight autonomy analysis is a technique used to determine the amount of time a space receives sufficient natural light. It is an essential tool for designers to ensure that a space receives enough natural light throughout the day.

To perform a daylight autonomy analysis, we use the concept of daylight autonomy, which is the percentage of time a space receives a specified amount of natural light. The formula for daylight autonomy is as follows:

$$
DA = \frac{T_{daylight}}{T_{total}} \times 100\%
$$

where $T_{daylight}$ is the total time a space receives a specified amount of natural light, and $T_{total}$ is the total time the space is occupied.

Daylight autonomy analysis is crucial for designing spaces that receive enough natural light throughout the day. By understanding the daylight autonomy, designers can make informed decisions about the placement and design of windows and other openings to ensure that a space receives enough natural light.

### Subsection: 4.1d Case Studies in Daylighting Analysis

To further illustrate the importance and application of daylighting analysis techniques, let's look at some case studies.

#### Case Study 1: The Sargent Wood Products Building

The Sargent Wood Products Building is a commercial building located in the United States. The building has a large open office space with a high ceiling and a south-facing wall with windows. The building also has a skylight in the center of the roof.

Using DF analysis, designers determined that the building had a DF of 50% in the office space. This meant that the office space received half the amount of natural light that it would receive if it were completely unobstructed. To improve the DF, designers added additional windows on the east and west walls, increasing the DF to 70%.

Using solar shading analysis, designers determined that the building had a solar gain of 10% in the office space. This meant that the office space received 10% of the incident solar radiation. To reduce the solar gain, designers added exterior shading devices on the south-facing wall, reducing the solar gain to 5%.

Using daylight autonomy analysis, designers determined that the office space had a daylight autonomy of 80%. This meant that the office space received natural light for 80% of the time it was occupied. To improve the daylight autonomy, designers added additional windows on the east and west walls, increasing the daylight autonomy to 90%.

#### Case Study 2: The Green D.4 Building

The Green D.4 Building is a residential building located in Europe. The building has a south-facing facade with large windows and a north-facing facade with smaller windows. The building also has a skylight in the center of the roof.

Using DF analysis, designers determined that the building had a DF of 60% in the living room. This meant that the living room received 60% of the natural light that it would receive if it were completely unobstructed. To improve the DF, designers added additional windows on the north-facing wall, increasing the DF to 70%.

Using solar shading analysis, designers determined that the building had a solar gain of 15% in the living room. This meant that the living room received 15% of the incident solar radiation. To reduce the solar gain, designers added exterior shading devices on the south-facing wall, reducing the solar gain to 10%.

Using daylight autonomy analysis, designers determined that the living room had a daylight autonomy of 90%. This meant that the living room received natural light for 90% of the time it was occupied. To improve the daylight autonomy, designers added additional windows on the north-facing wall, increasing the daylight autonomy to 95%.

### Conclusion

In this section, we explored three key daylighting analysis techniques: DF analysis, solar shading analysis, and daylight autonomy analysis. These techniques are essential tools for designers to understand and optimize the use of natural light in their designs. By using these techniques, designers can create spaces that receive enough natural light throughout the day, while also controlling the amount of heat energy entering the space.

$$

where $L_{sky}$ is the luminance of the sky and $L_{unobstructed}$ is the luminance that would be received if the space were completely unobstructed.

DF is a crucial factor in determining the overall daylighting quality of a space. A higher DF indicates a space with more natural light, while a lower DF indicates a space with less natural light. Designers can use DF analysis to optimize the placement of windows and other openings to maximize natural light in a space.

#### 4.1b Solar Shading Analysis

Solar shading analysis is a technique used to determine the amount of direct sunlight that reaches a specific point in a space. It is an essential tool for designers to control the amount of natural light in a space and prevent overheating.

To perform a solar shading analysis, we use the concept of solar gain, which is the amount of heat energy received from the sun. The formula for solar gain is as follows:

$$
SG = \frac{I_{direct} \times A_{window}}{I_{incident}}
$$

where $I_{direct}$ is the intensity of direct sunlight, $A_{window}$ is the area of the window, and $I_{incident}$ is the intensity of incident sunlight.

Designers can use this formula to determine the amount of solar gain in a space and adjust the design accordingly. For example, if a space has a high solar gain, designers can incorporate shading devices or adjust the orientation of the building to reduce the amount of direct sunlight entering the space.

#### 4.1c Daylight Autonomy Analysis

Daylight autonomy analysis is a technique used to determine the amount of time a space receives natural light. It is an essential tool for designers to ensure that a space receives enough natural light throughout the day.

To perform a daylight autonomy analysis, we use the concept of daylight autonomy, which is the percentage of time a space receives natural light. The formula for daylight autonomy is as follows:

$$
DA = \frac{T_{daylight}}{T_{total}} \times 100\%
$$

where $T_{daylight}$ is the amount of time a space receives natural light and $T_{total}$ is the total amount of time in a day.

Designers can use this formula to determine the amount of daylight autonomy in a space and adjust the design accordingly. For example, if a space has a low daylight autonomy, designers can incorporate more windows or adjust the orientation of the building to increase the amount of natural light entering the space.

### Subsection: 4.1c Daylight Autonomy Analysis

Daylight autonomy analysis is a crucial tool for designers to ensure that a space receives enough natural light throughout the day. It is especially important for spaces that are occupied during the day, such as offices and classrooms, where natural light can have a significant impact on the occupants' well-being and productivity.

To perform a daylight autonomy analysis, designers must consider the location and orientation of the building, as well as the type and placement of windows and other openings. They must also take into account the surrounding landscape and any obstructions that may block natural light from entering the space.

In addition to the formula for daylight autonomy, designers can also use software programs to perform daylight autonomy analyses. These programs use advanced algorithms and simulations to accurately predict the amount of natural light in a space over the course of a day.

In conclusion, daylight autonomy analysis is a crucial technique for designers to optimize the use of natural light in their designs. By considering the amount of daylight autonomy in a space, designers can create more sustainable and healthy environments for occupants.

In addition to the techniques discussed in the previous section, there are also various calculation methods that can be used to analyze daylighting in a space. These methods involve mathematical calculations and simulations to determine the amount and quality of natural light in a space.

#### 4.2a Radiosity Method

The radiosity method is a calculation technique used to simulate the way in which light is reflected and absorbed by surfaces in a space. It takes into account the reflectance and transmittance of surfaces, as well as the direction and intensity of light sources.

The radiosity method is based on the concept of radiosity, which is the amount of light energy that is reflected or transmitted by a surface. The formula for radiosity is as follows:

$$
R = \frac{L_{surface}}{L_{incident}} \times 100\%
$$

where $L_{surface}$ is the luminance of the surface and $L_{incident}$ is the luminance of the incident light.

The radiosity method is particularly useful for analyzing the impact of different surface materials and light sources on the overall daylighting quality of a space. By adjusting the reflectance and transmittance of surfaces and the intensity and direction of light sources, designers can simulate different scenarios and optimize the daylighting in a space.

#### 4.2b Ray Tracing Method

The ray tracing method is another calculation technique used to analyze daylighting in a space. It involves tracing the path of light rays from a light source to a specific point in a space. By tracking the direction and intensity of these rays, designers can determine the amount and quality of natural light in a space.

The ray tracing method is particularly useful for analyzing the impact of different light sources and obstructions on the overall daylighting quality of a space. By adjusting the position and intensity of light sources and the placement of obstructions, designers can simulate different scenarios and optimize the daylighting in a space.

#### 4.2c Hybrid Methods

In addition to the radiosity and ray tracing methods, there are also hybrid methods that combine both techniques. These methods offer a more comprehensive analysis of daylighting in a space, taking into account both the reflected and transmitted light from surfaces.

One example of a hybrid method is the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) method. This method combines the radiosity and ray tracing techniques to accurately simulate the reflection and transmission of light from surfaces. By using the BRDF, designers can analyze the impact of different surface materials and light sources on the overall daylighting quality of a space.

Another hybrid method is the photon mapping technique. This method involves tracing the path of photons from a light source to a specific point in a space. By tracking the direction and intensity of these photons, designers can determine the amount and quality of natural light in a space. The photon mapping technique is particularly useful for analyzing the impact of complex geometries and multiple light sources on the overall daylighting quality of a space.

In conclusion, there are various calculation methods that can be used to analyze daylighting in a space. Each method offers a unique perspective and can be used to optimize the natural light in a design. By understanding and utilizing these methods, designers can create spaces that maximize the use of natural light and create a more sustainable and healthy environment for occupants.

So let's dive in and explore the world of advanced daylighting design.


## Chapter 5: Advanced Daylighting Techniques:




### Subsection: 4.3b Exercise 2: Solar Shading Analysis

In this exercise, you will use the Solar Shading Analysis tool to analyze the impact of solar shading on the daylighting quality of a space. This tool uses the concept of solar shading coefficient (SC) to determine the amount of natural light blocked by shading elements.

To begin, open the Solar Shading Analysis tool and input the dimensions of the space, as well as the location and type of shading elements. The tool will then calculate the SC for the space, taking into account the orientation and size of the shading elements.

Next, adjust the orientation and size of the shading elements to see how it affects the SC. Experiment with different scenarios to optimize the daylighting quality of the space while still providing adequate shading.

### Subsection: 4.4a Dynamic Simulations

Dynamic simulations are a powerful tool in the analysis of daylighting. They allow us to model and simulate the movement of light in a space over time, taking into account factors such as the position of the sun, the orientation of the space, and the presence of obstructions. This section will explore the principles and techniques of dynamic simulations, and how they can be used to optimize the daylighting quality of a space.

#### 4.4a.1 Principles of Dynamic Simulations

Dynamic simulations are based on the principles of ray tracing, a technique that traces the path of light rays from a light source to a point of interest. In the context of daylighting, this means tracing the path of sunlight from the sun to a point within a space.

The first step in a dynamic simulation is to define the geometry of the space, including the position of the sun, the orientation of the space, and any obstructions that may block the path of light. This is typically done using a 3D modeling software.

Next, the simulation calculates the position of the sun at different points in time, taking into account the time of day, the date, and the location of the space. This is done using mathematical models that describe the movement of the sun across the sky.

The simulation then traces the path of light rays from the sun to points within the space. This is done by calculating the intersection of the light rays with the surfaces of the space. If a light ray intersects with a surface, it is considered to be "caught" by that surface.

Finally, the simulation calculates the amount of light that is caught by each surface. This is done by considering the angle between the normal vector of the surface and the direction of the light ray. If the angle is small, more light is caught by the surface. If the angle is large, less light is caught.

#### 4.4a.2 Techniques of Dynamic Simulations

There are several techniques that can be used to perform dynamic simulations. One common technique is the use of ray tracing algorithms, which trace the path of light rays from a light source to a point of interest. Another technique is the use of radiosity algorithms, which calculate the amount of light that is reflected and emitted by surfaces within a space.

Another important technique is the use of daylighting metrics, which are quantitative measures of the quality of daylighting in a space. These metrics can be used to evaluate the results of a dynamic simulation, and to compare different design options.

#### 4.4a.3 Applications of Dynamic Simulations

Dynamic simulations have a wide range of applications in the field of daylighting. They can be used to optimize the design of a space to maximize the amount of natural light, to evaluate the impact of different design decisions on the quality of daylighting, and to predict the effects of changes in the environment, such as the movement of the sun or the addition of new obstructions.

In the next section, we will explore some specific examples of how dynamic simulations can be used in the analysis of daylighting.




### Subsection: 4.4b Climate-Based Simulations

Climate-based simulations are another powerful tool in the analysis of daylighting. They allow us to model and simulate the effects of climate on the amount and quality of daylight in a space. This section will explore the principles and techniques of climate-based simulations, and how they can be used to optimize the daylighting quality of a space.

#### 4.4b.1 Principles of Climate-Based Simulations

Climate-based simulations are based on the principles of climate modeling, a technique that simulates the interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice. In the context of daylighting, this means simulating the effects of weather conditions, such as cloud cover and precipitation, on the amount and quality of daylight in a space.

The first step in a climate-based simulation is to define the climate of the location where the space is situated. This is typically done using climate data, such as average daily sunshine hours, average cloud cover, and average precipitation.

Next, the simulation calculates the amount of sunlight that reaches the space at different points in time, taking into account the weather conditions. This is done using mathematical models that describe the scattering and absorption of sunlight by the atmosphere, and the reflection and transmission of sunlight by clouds and precipitation.

The simulation then calculates the amount of light that is caught by each surface in the space. This is done by considering the amount of sunlight that reaches each surface, and the amount of light that is blocked by obstructions.

Finally, the simulation calculates the quality of daylight in the space. This is done by considering the amount of light that is caught by each surface, and the color temperature of the light. The color temperature is a measure of the warmth or coolness of the light, and it is calculated using mathematical models that describe the spectral distribution of sunlight.

#### 4.4b.2 Techniques of Climate-Based Simulations

There are several techniques that can be used to perform climate-based simulations. These include:

- **Radiative Transfer Models (RTMs):** These models simulate the transfer of radiation through the atmosphere, taking into account the scattering and absorption of sunlight by atmospheric particles.

- **General Circulation Models (GCMs):** These models simulate the global circulation of the atmosphere, including the movement of air masses and the formation of clouds.

- **Regional Climate Models (RCMs):** These models simulate the climate of a specific region, taking into account the local topography and land use.

- **Weather Systems Models (WSMs):** These models simulate specific weather systems, such as hurricanes or thunderstorms.

Each of these techniques has its own strengths and limitations, and they are often used in combination to perform a comprehensive climate-based simulation.

High-performance simulations are a powerful tool in the analysis of daylighting. They allow us to model and simulate the effects of various design parameters on the amount and quality of daylight in a space. This section will explore the principles and techniques of high-performance simulations, and how they can be used to optimize the daylighting quality of a space.

#### 4.4c.1 Principles of High-Performance Simulations

High-performance simulations are based on the principles of computational modeling, a technique that uses computer algorithms to simulate the behavior of complex systems. In the context of daylighting, this means simulating the effects of various design parameters, such as the orientation of the space, the size and shape of the windows, and the materials used for the walls and ceiling, on the amount and quality of daylight in a space.

The first step in a high-performance simulation is to define the design parameters of the space. This is typically done using a computer model, such as SketchUp or Revit, which allows the designer to create a 3D representation of the space.

Next, the simulation calculates the amount of sunlight that reaches the space at different points in time, taking into account the orientation of the space, the size and shape of the windows, and the materials used for the walls and ceiling. This is done using mathematical models that describe the scattering and absorption of sunlight by the atmosphere, and the reflection and transmission of sunlight by the materials.

The simulation then calculates the amount of light that is caught by each surface in the space. This is done by considering the amount of sunlight that reaches each surface, and the amount of light that is blocked by obstructions.

Finally, the simulation calculates the quality of daylight in the space. This is done by considering the amount of light that is caught by each surface, and the color temperature of the light. The color temperature is a measure of the warmth or coolness of the light, and it is calculated using mathematical models that describe the spectral distribution of sunlight.

#### 4.4c.2 High-Performance Simulation Techniques

There are several techniques that can be used in high-performance simulations, each with its own advantages and limitations. Some of the most commonly used techniques include:

- **Monte Carlo simulations**: These simulations use random sampling to estimate the amount of light that reaches a surface in a space. They are particularly useful for complex spaces with multiple surfaces and obstructions.

- **Radiance simulations**: These simulations use a combination of ray tracing and Monte Carlo techniques to estimate the amount of light that reaches a surface in a space. They are particularly useful for spaces with complex geometries and multiple light sources.

- **Daylighting analysis software**: There are several commercial software packages available for daylighting analysis, such as DIVA for Rhino and Radiance, and Daylight for Revit. These software packages use a combination of mathematical models and algorithms to perform high-performance simulations.

In the next section, we will explore some examples of high-performance simulations and how they can be used to optimize the daylighting quality of a space.

The simulation also showed that the quality of daylight in the building is good, with a color temperature of approximately 5500 K. However, the quality of daylight in the bedrooms is lower, due to the presence of obstructions and the orientation of the windows.

#### 4.5a.3 Design Recommendations

Based on the daylighting analysis, the following design recommendations were made:

1. The windows on the upper floor should be replaced with larger, more energy-efficient windows. This will increase the amount of daylight in the bedrooms, and improve the quality of daylight.

2. The roof overhangs should be extended to provide more shade in the summer. This will reduce the amount of direct sunlight in the living room and the kitchen, but will improve the quality of daylight by reducing glare.

3. The sunroom should be renovated to provide more usable space. This will increase the amount of daylight in the living room, and improve the quality of daylight by reducing glare.

#### 4.5b.3 Solutions for Improving Daylighting

Based on the results of the daylighting analysis, several solutions were proposed to improve the daylighting quality in the building. These included the addition of more skylights on the roof, the removal of the roof overhangs, and the installation of light shelves on the windows. These solutions would help to increase the amount of daylight entering the building, and improve the quality of daylight in the office spaces.

In addition, the use of daylighting control systems, such as automated shades and dimmers, could also be considered to optimize the use of daylight in the building. These systems could be programmed to adjust the shades and dimmers based on the time of day and the amount of ambient light, helping to balance the need for daylight and energy efficiency.

Overall, the daylighting analysis and proposed solutions demonstrate the importance of considering daylighting in the design of commercial buildings.

The building has a flat roof, and the walls are made of concrete. The windows are double-paned, and the roof overhangs are approximately 1 meter deep. The building has undergone several modifications over the years, including the addition of a skylight on the roof, and the replacement of the original windows with larger, more energy-efficient windows.

#### 4.5c.1 Overview of the Building

The building is located in a busy public area, with high levels of ambient light throughout the day. The lobby and public spaces on the ground floor receive a significant amount of daylight, due to their location on the south side of the building and the presence of the skylight. The offices and meeting rooms on the upper floor, however, receive less daylight, due to their orientation and the presence of the roof overhangs.

#### 4.5c.2 Daylighting Analysis

The daylighting analysis was conducted using the principles and techniques discussed in the previous sections. The design parameters of the building were modeled in SketchUp, and the simulation was run using the Radiance software.

The simulation results showed that the building receives a sufficient amount of daylight throughout the day, with the exception of the offices and meeting rooms on the upper floor. The lobby and public spaces on the ground floor receive a significant amount of daylight, due to their location on the south side of the building and the presence of the skylight. The offices and meeting rooms, however, receive less daylight, due to their orientation and the presence of the roof overhangs.

#### 4.5c.3 Energy Performance

The energy performance of the building was also analyzed using the principles and techniques discussed in the previous sections. The building's energy use was modeled using the DOE-2.1E software, and the simulation was run using the Radiance software.

The simulation results showed that the building has a relatively low energy use, due to its efficient design and the use of energy-efficient materials. The building's energy use can be further reduced by optimizing the building's orientation and the placement of the windows. This can be achieved by adjusting the building's orientation to maximize the amount of daylight received, and by adding more windows on the north side of the building to balance the amount of daylight received on both sides.

#### 4.5c.4 Conclusion

The public building case study demonstrates the importance of considering both daylighting and energy performance in the design of public buildings. By optimizing the building's design and orientation, and by using energy-efficient materials, the building can receive sufficient daylight while minimizing its energy use. This not only benefits the building's occupants, but also contributes to the building's sustainability and environmental impact.

The format uses a Face-vertex polygon mesh layout. Each top-level <tag|object|o> element specifies a unique <code|id>. The <tag|object|o> element can also optionally specify a material. The entire mesh geometry is contained in a single <tag|mesh|o> element. The mesh is defined using one <tag|vertices|o> element and one or more <tag|volume|o> elements. The required <tag|vertices|o> element lists all vertices that are used in this object. Each vertex is implicitly assigned a number in the order in which it was declared, starting at zero. The required child element <tag|coordinates|o> gives the position of the point in 3D space using the <tag|x|o>, <tag|y|o> and <tag|z|o> elements.
After the vertex information, at least one <tag|volume|o> element must be included. Each volume encapsulates a closed volume of the object, Multiple volumes can be specified in a single object. Volumes may share vertices at interfaces but may not have any overlapping volume.
Within each volume, the child element <tag|triangle|o> is used to define triangles that tessellate the surface of the volume. Each <tag|triangle|o> element will list three vertices from the set of indices of the previously defined vertices given in the <tag|vertices|o> element. The indices of the three vertices of the triangles are specified using the <tag|v1|o>, <tag|v2|o> and <tag|v3|o> elements. The order of the vertices must be according to the right-hand rule, such that vertices are listed in counter-clockwise order as viewed from the outside. Each triangle is implicitly assigned a number in the order in which it was declared, starting at zero.
The <tag|material|o> element is used to specify the material properties for a given object. This element is optional and can be included in the <tag|object|o> element or in the <tag|mesh|o> element. The <tag|material|o> element can contain various child elements to define the material properties, including <tag|ambient|o>, <tag|diffuse|o>, <tag|specular|o>, and <tag|transparency|o>. These elements can be used to specify the color, shininess, and transparency of the material.

## Chapter: Chapter 6: Natural Light in Urban Design

### Introduction

The urban landscape is a complex and dynamic environment, where the interaction of natural light with the built environment plays a crucial role in shaping the quality of life for its inhabitants. This chapter, "Natural Light in Urban Design," delves into the intricate relationship between natural light and urban design, exploring how the former can be harnessed to enhance the latter.

Natural light, the primary source of illumination for most urban spaces, is not just a means to an end. It is a vital element that can significantly influence the character and functionality of urban spaces. From the design of public plazas to the layout of residential buildings, the strategic use of natural light can create vibrant and livable spaces, fostering a sense of connection to the natural world.

However, the effective use of natural light in urban design is not without its challenges. The urban context, characterized by dense built-ups and complex geometries, often presents obstacles to the free flow of natural light.

#### 5.4a Daylight Harvesting

Daylight harvesting is a technique used in building design to maximize the use of natural light while minimizing the need for artificial lighting. This technique is particularly useful in spaces with access to conventional or clerestory windows, skylights, light tube groups, glass block walls, and other passive daylighting sources from sunlight. The goal of daylight harvesting is to create a balance between natural and artificial light, providing occupants with a comfortable and healthy environment while reducing energy consumption.

#### 5.4a.1 Energy Savings from Daylight Harvesting

Several studies have recorded the energy savings due to daylight harvesting. Energy savings for electric lighting in the range of 20-60% are common. These savings are very dependent on the type of space the light harvesting control system is deployed in, and its usage. Clearly, savings can only accrue in spaces with substantial daylight where electric lighting would have been otherwise used.

The adoption of daylight harvesting technologies has been hampered by high costs and imperfect performance of the technologies. However, studies have shown that by using daylight harvesting technologies, owners can see an average annual energy savings of 24%. One method of predicting energy savings is to use commercially available software programs, such as TRACE 700 or (freeware) DOE-2, which considers thermal loads.

#### 5.4a.2 Payback and Drivers for Adoption

There is an incremental cost to daylight harvesting systems. Dividing this cost by the expected energy savings gives the payback period, which is typically several years. However, the long-term benefits of reduced energy consumption and improved occupant comfort make daylight harvesting a worthwhile investment.

The primary driver for the adoption of daylight harvesting is the potential for significant energy savings. However, other factors such as occupant comfort, building aesthetics, and environmental sustainability also play a role. Daylight harvesting can contribute to a building's LEED certification, for example, by reducing energy consumption and promoting occupant well-being.

#### 5.4a.3 Integrating Daylight Harvesting with Artificial Lighting

Integrating daylight harvesting with artificial lighting is a complex task that requires careful design and implementation. The goal is to create a seamless transition between natural and artificial light, providing occupants with a consistent and comfortable environment.

The integration process involves several steps:

1. **Designing the Daylighting System:** This involves determining the type of daylighting system to be used, its placement, and its control strategy. The system should be designed to maximize the use of natural light while minimizing glare and overheating.

2. **Integrating with Artificial Lighting:** The daylighting system should be integrated with the building's artificial lighting system. This can be achieved through the use of dimmable lighting, which can be controlled by the daylighting system to adjust the amount of artificial light in response to changes in natural light levels.

3. **Testing and Commissioning:** The daylighting system should be tested and commissioned to ensure that it is functioning as intended. This involves checking the system's performance under various conditions and making any necessary adjustments.

4. **Maintenance and Monitoring:** The daylighting system should be regularly maintained and monitored to ensure its continued performance. This can be achieved through the use of sensors and control systems that monitor the system's operation and alert staff to any issues.

In conclusion, integrating daylight harvesting with artificial lighting is a complex but rewarding task. By carefully designing and implementing a daylighting system, building owners can achieve significant energy savings while providing occupants with a comfortable and healthy environment.

#### 5.4b Lighting Control Strategies

Lighting control strategies are essential for the successful integration of daylight harvesting and artificial lighting. These strategies are designed to optimize the use of both natural and artificial light, providing occupants with a comfortable and healthy environment while minimizing energy consumption.

##### 5.4b.1 Occupancy Sensors

Occupancy sensors are a common type of lighting control strategy. These sensors detect the presence of occupants in a space and adjust the lighting accordingly. When the space is unoccupied, the sensors can dim or switch off the artificial lighting, relying instead on natural light. This strategy can be particularly effective in spaces with large windows or skylights, where natural light is abundant.

##### 5.4b.2 Daylight Sensors

Daylight sensors, also known as photocells, are another common type of lighting control strategy. These sensors measure the amount of natural light in a space and adjust the artificial lighting accordingly. When there is sufficient natural light, the sensors can dim or switch off the artificial lighting. This strategy can be particularly effective in spaces with smaller windows or in spaces where natural light is not always available, such as in basements or interior spaces.

##### 5.4b.3 Dimmable Lighting

Dimmable lighting is a type of artificial lighting that can be adjusted in intensity. This allows for a seamless transition between natural and artificial light. When natural light is abundant, the dimmable lighting can be set to a lower intensity. When natural light is scarce, the dimmable lighting can be set to a higher intensity. This strategy can be particularly effective in spaces with large windows or skylights, where natural light is abundant, but where additional lighting is needed for tasks or for ambiance.

##### 5.4b.4 Programmable Lighting Control Systems

Programmable lighting control systems are a type of lighting control strategy that allows for more complex and sophisticated control of lighting. These systems can be programmed to respond to a variety of conditions, including the presence of occupants, the amount of natural light, and the time of day. They can also be integrated with other building systems, such as HVAC and security systems, for a more holistic approach to building management.

In conclusion, lighting control strategies are a crucial component of integrating daylight harvesting with artificial lighting. These strategies allow for the optimal use of both natural and artificial light, providing occupants with a comfortable and healthy environment while minimizing energy consumption.

## Chapter: Chapter 6: Natural Light and Energy Performance

### Introduction

In this chapter, we delve into the intricate relationship between natural light and energy performance in building design. The exploration of this relationship is crucial in the realm of natural light in design, as it provides a comprehensive understanding of how natural light can be harnessed to optimize energy performance in buildings.

Natural light, as we know, is a free and renewable resource. It is a fundamental element in the design of buildings, not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its potential to reduce energy consumption. The use of natural light in buildings can significantly reduce the need for artificial lighting, thereby saving energy and reducing the environmental impact of buildings.

However, the use of natural light in buildings is not without its challenges. The amount and quality of natural light that enters a building depend on a variety of factors, including the building's orientation, the design of its windows and facades, and the local climate. These factors can significantly influence the energy performance of a building, as they affect the building's heating, cooling, and lighting needs.

In this chapter, we will explore these factors in detail, providing a comprehensive understanding of how they influence the energy performance of buildings. We will also discuss strategies for optimizing the use of natural light in buildings, with the aim of enhancing their energy performance.

This chapter will not only provide a theoretical understanding of the relationship between natural light and energy performance but will also offer practical guidance on how to apply this knowledge in building design.

#### 5.4c Light Pipes and Fiber Optics

Light pipes and fiber optics are two innovative technologies that have revolutionized the way natural light is integrated into building design. These technologies allow for the transmission of light over long distances, making them ideal for use in large-scale buildings and structures.

#### 5.4c.1 Principles of Light Pipes and Fiber Optics

Light pipes and fiber optics work on the principle of total internal reflection. This is a phenomenon where light is confined within a medium by continuous reflection from the boundary surfaces. In light pipes, light is transmitted through a series of mirrored surfaces, while in fiber optics, it is transmitted through a highly reflective core surrounded by a cladding layer.

Light pipes are typically used to transmit daylight from a source, such as a skylight or a window, to a distant location within a building. They can be designed to transmit light over long distances with minimal loss of light intensity. Fiber optics, on the other hand, are used to transmit light signals over long distances with minimal loss of signal strength.

#### 5.4c.2 Design of Light Pipes and Fiber Optics

The design of light pipes and fiber optics is crucial to their effectiveness. They should be designed to maximize the amount of light they transmit, while minimizing the amount of light they lose. This can be achieved by using materials with high reflectivity, such as mirrors or highly reflective coatings, and by designing the pipes or fibers with a small diameter to minimize light loss due to scattering.

Light pipes can be designed as straight pipes or as curved tubes. Straight pipes are simpler to design and install, but they may not be suitable for all building layouts. Curved tubes, on the other hand, can be designed to follow the contours of a building, making them more versatile.

Fiber optics can be designed as single-mode fibers or multi-mode fibers. Single-mode fibers have a small core diameter and are used for transmitting light signals over long distances with minimal loss. Multi-mode fibers have a larger core diameter and are used for transmitting larger amounts of light over shorter distances.

#### 5.4c.3 Benefits of Light Pipes and Fiber Optics

Light pipes and fiber optics offer several benefits in building design. They can significantly reduce the need for artificial lighting, leading to energy savings. They can also create a more natural and comfortable environment for building occupants by providing a consistent and uniform distribution of light.

In addition, light pipes and fiber optics can be used to bring natural light into areas that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to light with traditional methods. This can be particularly beneficial in deep interior spaces or in buildings with complex layouts.

Finally, light pipes and fiber optics can be used to create dramatic architectural features, adding visual interest and aesthetic appeal to a building's design.




#### 5.5a Passive Solar Design

Passive solar design is a strategy that utilizes the sun's energy for heating and lighting a building. It is a sustainable design approach that can significantly reduce the energy consumption of a building, making it more environmentally friendly and cost-effective.

#### 5.5a.1 Principles of Passive Solar Design

Passive solar design is based on the principles of orientation, thermal mass, and shading. The orientation of a building refers to its position in relation to the sun's path. In the northern hemisphere, buildings should be oriented with the long axis facing south to maximize exposure to sunlight. This allows for more natural light to enter the building, reducing the need for artificial lighting.

Thermal mass is another important principle of passive solar design. It refers to the ability of a material to absorb and store heat. Materials with high thermal mass, such as concrete and masonry, can be used to absorb heat during the day and release it at night, providing a steady source of heat for the building.

Shading is also crucial in passive solar design. It involves using overhangs, louvers, and other design elements to control the amount of sunlight entering a building. This can help prevent overheating in the summer while still allowing for natural light to enter the building.

#### 5.5a.2 Design Strategies for Passive Solar Design

There are several design strategies that can be used to implement passive solar design in a building. These include:

- Direct gain: This strategy involves using south-facing windows to admit sunlight directly into the building. The sunlight is absorbed by thermal mass materials, which then release the heat at night.

- Indirect gain: In this strategy, sunlight is redirected into the building using mirrors or light pipes. This allows for more control over the amount of sunlight entering the building.

- Trombe wall: A Trombe wall is a type of passive solar heating system that uses a south-facing wall with a layer of air or vacuum between two layers of glass. The sun heats the air or vacuum, which then heats the wall. The wall can then release this heat at night.

- Solar chimney: A solar chimney is a vertical tube that admits sunlight and heats the air inside. This heated air rises and can be used to provide ventilation and heating for the building.

#### 5.5a.3 Efficiency and Economics of Passive Solar Design

The efficiency and economics of passive solar design depend on several factors, including the climate, the design of the building, and the materials used. In favorable climates, such as the southwest United States, highly optimized systems can exceed 75% passive solar fraction (PSF). However, in less favorable climates, the PSF may be lower.

The economics of passive solar design can be significant. RETScreen International has reported a potential reduction in heating costs of 20–50% with passive solar design. Other sources report even higher potential reductions.

#### 5.5a.4 Key Passive Solar Building Configurations

There are three main passive solar building configurations: direct gain, indirect gain, and hybrid systems. Each of these configurations has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on the specific design requirements and constraints of the building.

#### 5.5a.5 Future Developments in Passive Solar Design

As technology advances and our understanding of passive solar design improves, we can expect to see further developments in this field. These may include the use of new materials and technologies, as well as the development of new design strategies and configurations.

In conclusion, passive solar design is a powerful tool for reducing the energy consumption of buildings. By understanding the principles and strategies of passive solar design, architects and designers can create buildings that are more sustainable, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective.

#### 5.5b Daylighting and Energy Efficiency

Daylighting, the practice of using natural light to illuminate a building, is a key component of sustainable design. It not only reduces the need for artificial lighting, but also has significant implications for energy efficiency. 

#### 5.5b.1 Energy Efficiency of Daylighting

The energy efficiency of daylighting is a function of several factors, including the type of lighting system, the quality of the daylight, and the control of the lighting system. 

Traditional lighting systems, such as incandescent and fluorescent lamps, are typically less efficient than daylighting. Incandescent lamps, for example, convert only about 10% of their electrical energy into light, with the rest being lost as heat. Fluorescent lamps are more efficient, converting about 20% of their electrical energy into light, but they still pale in comparison to daylighting.

Daylighting, on the other hand, can be highly efficient. The efficiency of daylighting is typically measured in terms of the daylight factor, which is the ratio of the amount of light on a surface to the amount of light on a horizontal surface outside. A daylight factor of 1.0 means that the surface receives as much light as it would outside. 

#### 5.5b.2 Control of Daylighting Systems

The control of daylighting systems is crucial for their energy efficiency. Automated systems, such as blinds and shades, can be used to control the amount of light entering a building. These systems can be programmed to respond to changes in the amount of sunlight, the occupancy of the building, and other factors.

#### 5.5b.3 Energy Efficiency of Passive Solar Design

Passive solar design, as discussed in the previous section, can also contribute significantly to energy efficiency. By orienting a building to maximize exposure to sunlight, using thermal mass to store heat, and controlling the amount of sunlight entering the building with shading devices, passive solar design can reduce the need for heating and cooling, and therefore the overall energy consumption of a building.

#### 5.5b.4 Energy Efficiency of Lighting Control Systems

Lighting control systems, such as occupancy sensors and dimmers, can also contribute to energy efficiency. These systems can be used to ensure that lights are only turned on when needed, and that they are dimmed when possible. This can significantly reduce the energy consumption of a building, particularly in areas where lighting is often left on unnecessarily, such as corridors and stairwells.

#### 5.5b.5 Energy Efficiency of Lighting Systems

The efficiency of lighting systems can be further improved by using more efficient lighting technologies. LED lighting, for example, is significantly more efficient than traditional incandescent and fluorescent lighting. LED lighting can produce the same amount of light with only a fraction of the electrical energy, making it a highly energy-efficient option.

In conclusion, daylighting and energy efficiency are closely intertwined. By using natural light, controlling lighting systems, and implementing efficient lighting technologies, buildings can significantly reduce their energy consumption, contributing to a more sustainable future.

#### 8.5c.1 IoT and Natural Light

IoT devices, such as smart sensors and lighting controls, can be integrated with building management systems to provide more precise and efficient control of natural light. For example, IoT sensors can detect changes in weather conditions, such as cloud cover, and adjust the building's lighting levels accordingly. This can help optimize the use of natural light and reduce the need for artificial lighting.

#### 8.5c.2 IoT and Daylighting

Daylighting is the practice of using natural light to illuminate a building's interior. IoT devices can play a crucial role in this process by automatically adjusting the building's shading systems based on the position of the sun. This can help reduce glare and heat gain, while maximizing the use of natural light.

#### 8.5c.3 IoT and Smart Glass

Smart glass, as mentioned in the previous section, can be used to adjust indoor lighting based on changes in outdoor brightness. IoT devices can be integrated with smart glass systems to provide more precise and efficient control. For example, IoT sensors can detect changes in occupancy and adjust the smart glass accordingly.

#### 8.5c.4 IoT and Solar Lighting

IoT devices can also be integrated with solar lighting systems to provide more efficient and reliable lighting. For example, IoT sensors can detect changes in weather conditions and adjust the solar lighting system accordingly. This can help optimize the use of solar energy and reduce the need for backup lighting sources.

### Subsection: 8.6a Urban Daylighting Challenges

As we continue to develop and expand our cities, the challenge of incorporating natural light into urban environments becomes increasingly complex. The urban landscape is characterized by a high density of buildings, which can block out natural light and create dark, uninviting spaces. This is especially true in the case of underground structures, such as subway stations and parking garages, which are often devoid of natural light.

#### 8.6a.1 Blocking of Natural Light

The high density of buildings in urban environments can significantly block out natural light. This is particularly problematic for underground structures, where natural light is already scarce. The blocking of natural light not only reduces the amount of daylight available, but it also affects the quality of light. Direct sunlight is rich in blue light, which is essential for regulating our circadian rhythms. Blocking this light can have a detrimental effect on our health and well-being.

#### 8.6a.2 Energy Consumption

The blocking of natural light also has implications for energy consumption. As mentioned in the previous section, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation Headquarters was able to reduce its energy consumption from artificial lighting by 30% through the strategic placement of windows and the use of high transmittance daylighting. However, in urban environments, where buildings are often closer together and natural light is more scarce, achieving similar results can be challenging. This is especially true for underground structures, where the use of artificial lighting is often necessary.

#### 8.6a.3 Visual Comfort

The blocking of natural light can also affect visual comfort. As mentioned in the previous section, interior blinds are often used to improve visual comfort in buildings with large windows. However, in urban environments, where buildings are often closer together, the use of blinds may not be as effective. This is because the blinds can only block direct sunlight, and indirect light can still cause glare and discomfort.

#### 8.6a.4 Storm Water Management

The high density of buildings in urban environments can also pose challenges for storm water management. As mentioned in the previous section, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation Headquarters was able to reduce its storm water runoff through the use of a rainwater harvesting system. However, in urban environments, where buildings are often closer together, the implementation of similar systems can be challenging. This is because the increased surface area of buildings can lead to higher volumes of storm water runoff, making it more difficult to manage.

In conclusion, incorporating natural light into urban environments presents a unique set of challenges. As we continue to develop and expand our cities, it is crucial that we find innovative solutions to these challenges in order to create more sustainable and livable urban spaces.




### Subsection: 8.6b Urban Daylighting Strategies

As we continue to face the challenges of incorporating natural light into urban environments, it is important to explore and implement effective daylighting strategies. These strategies not only address the issues of blocked natural light, energy consumption, and visual comfort, but also contribute to the overall sustainability and livability of our cities.

#### 8.6b.1 Skylights and Tubular Daylighting Devices

One effective strategy for introducing natural light into underground structures is the use of skylights and tubular daylighting devices. Skylights, as the name suggests, are windows set into the ceiling of a structure. They allow natural light to enter from above, providing a sense of openness and brightness. Tubular daylighting devices, on the other hand, are tubes that are installed on the roof of a structure and extend down to the interior. These tubes are designed to capture and transmit natural light, providing a more diffuse and even distribution of light. Both skylights and tubular daylighting devices can be used to great effect in underground structures, bringing natural light into spaces that would otherwise be dark and uninviting.

#### 8.6b.2 Passive Daylighting Systems

Another strategy for incorporating natural light into urban environments is the use of passive daylighting systems. These systems are designed to passively capture and distribute natural light, reducing the need for artificial lighting and associated energy consumption. One example of a passive daylighting system is the use of light shelves. Light shelves are horizontal surfaces that are placed above windows. They are designed to reflect and diffuse natural light, providing a more even distribution of light and reducing glare. Another example is the use of light pipes, which are tubes that are installed on the exterior of a structure and extend into the interior. These pipes are designed to capture and transmit natural light, providing a more diffuse and even distribution of light.

#### 8.6b.3 Active Daylighting Systems

In addition to passive daylighting systems, active daylighting systems can also be used to effectively incorporate natural light into urban environments. These systems use technology to actively control and distribute natural light. One example is the use of automated shading systems, which are designed to adjust the amount of natural light entering a space based on the time of day and weather conditions. Another example is the use of daylighting control systems, which use sensors to automatically adjust the amount of artificial lighting in a space based on the amount of natural light available.

#### 8.6b.4 Integration with Building Design

Regardless of the specific daylighting strategy used, it is important to consider the integration of these systems with the overall design of a building. This includes the placement of windows, the use of light-colored materials to reflect natural light, and the consideration of the impact of natural light on the interior design of a space. By integrating daylighting strategies with building design, we can create more sustainable and livable urban environments.




### Subsection: 8.6c Urban Daylighting Case Studies

In this section, we will explore some real-world examples of how natural light design has been successfully implemented in urban environments. These case studies will provide valuable insights into the practical application of the strategies discussed in the previous section.

#### 8.6c.1 David and Lucile Packard Foundation Headquarters

The David and Lucile Packard Foundation Headquarters, located in Los Altos, California, is a prime example of how natural light design can be integrated into a commercial building. The building's design incorporates passive systems for heating, cooling, and lighting, which are all influenced by the availability of natural light.

The building's orientation and layout are designed to maximize the accessibility of sunlight. Two 40-foot wide offices are placed apart to create a central zone for sunlight to enter from multiple facades. This not only increases the daylight autonomy but also reduces the energy consumption from artificial lighting by 30%. The high transmittance of daylight in the winter (shading will block the direct sunlight in the summer) also increases the heat gain, potentially reducing the demand for heating. Interior blinds are user-controlled to improve visual comfort, and they automatically rise in the evening. The artificial light will dim or brighten up according to the change of daylighting.

The building is also equipped with indoor sensors that send direct reminders to occupants to open the windows when natural ventilation mode is on. This not only improves the indoor air quality but also reduces the energy consumption from mechanical ventilation.

#### 8.6c.2 Solar Augmented Geothermal Energy

The Solar Augmented Geothermal Energy (SAGE) project, currently being developed by the University of California - Wong, is another example of how natural light design can be integrated into urban environments. The project aims to develop a system that uses solar energy to augment geothermal energy, providing a reliable and sustainable source of energy for urban areas.

The SAGE system is designed to capture and store solar energy during the day, which is then used to augment the geothermal energy at night. This system not only reduces the reliance on traditional energy sources but also provides a more efficient and sustainable solution for urban environments.

#### 8.6c.3 Reflective Surfaces (Climate Engineering)

The concept of using reflective surfaces to reduce the urban heat island effect is another example of how natural light design can be integrated into urban environments. This strategy, known as climate engineering, involves the use of reflective surfaces to reflect sunlight back into the atmosphere, reducing the amount of heat absorbed by the urban environment.

The U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system provides standards for choosing products in designing buildings, but does not certify products. This system also encourages the use of reflective surfaces in building design, as it can help reduce the urban heat island effect and improve the overall energy efficiency of the building.

In conclusion, these case studies demonstrate the diverse ways in which natural light design can be integrated into urban environments. From passive systems for heating, cooling, and lighting, to innovative energy systems and reflective surfaces, these examples provide valuable insights into the practical application of natural light design in urban environments.

#### 9.1a.1 Orientation and Layout

The orientation and layout of a building play a crucial role in maximizing natural light. In hot climates, it is essential to consider the path of the sun and how it will affect the building throughout the day. By strategically placing windows and openings, designers can control the amount of natural light entering a space and reduce the need for artificial lighting.

For example, in a hot climate, it may be beneficial to orient the building towards the north or east, where the sun's path is lower in the sky. This can help reduce the amount of direct sunlight entering the building, while still allowing for ample natural light. Additionally, incorporating shading devices, such as overhangs or louvers, can further control the amount of natural light entering a space.

#### 9.1a.2 Material Selection

The materials used in a building's construction can also have a significant impact on natural light. In hot climates, it is essential to consider the thermal properties of materials, as well as their ability to transmit light. For example, using light-colored materials can help reflect natural light, while also reducing the amount of heat absorbed by the building.

Additionally, incorporating materials with high thermal mass, such as concrete or brick, can help regulate the temperature of a space by absorbing and releasing heat. This can be particularly beneficial in hot climates, where temperatures can vary greatly throughout the day.

#### 9.1a.3 Passive Design Techniques

Passive design techniques are strategies that can be used to reduce the need for active cooling or heating systems in a building. In hot climates, these techniques can be particularly useful for maximizing natural light while also reducing energy consumption.

One such technique is the use of evaporative cooling, where water is evaporated to cool the air. This can be achieved through the use of water features or by incorporating evaporative cooling systems into the building's design. Another technique is the use of natural ventilation, where windows and openings are strategically placed to create cross-ventilation and reduce the need for air conditioning.

#### 9.1a.4 Daylighting Systems

In addition to these strategies, designers can also incorporate daylighting systems to further enhance the use of natural light in hot climates. These systems can include skylights, tubular daylighting devices, and light shelves, which can help distribute natural light throughout a space.

Skylights, for example, can be used to bring natural light into the center of a building, while also reducing the amount of direct sunlight entering the space. Tubular daylighting devices, on the other hand, can be used to bring natural light into smaller spaces, such as bathrooms or closets. Light shelves can help reflect natural light into deeper parts of a space, providing additional illumination.

#### 9.1a.5 Energy Modeling and Analysis

To ensure the effectiveness of these design strategies, it is essential to incorporate energy modeling and analysis into the design process. This can help designers understand the impact of their design decisions on energy consumption and make necessary adjustments to optimize natural light and reduce energy usage.

In conclusion, designing for daylighting in hot climates requires a comprehensive approach that considers orientation, layout, material selection, passive design techniques, and the use of daylighting systems. By incorporating these strategies, designers can create comfortable and functional spaces that take advantage of the unique characteristics of hot climates.
