### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental principles of conservation laws and boundary conditions in the context of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. These principles are essential for understanding the behavior of waves and their impact on various systems in the ocean.

Conservation laws are mathematical expressions that describe the conservation of certain quantities, such as mass, momentum, and energy. In the context of ocean waves, these laws play a crucial role in determining the behavior of waves as they interact with different systems. For example, the conservation of momentum is crucial in understanding how waves affect the motion of ships and offshore energy systems.

Boundary conditions, on the other hand, are conditions that must be satisfied at the boundaries of a system. In the context of ocean waves, these boundaries can be the surface of the ocean, the seafloor, or the hull of a ship. Boundary conditions are essential in determining the behavior of waves as they interact with these boundaries. For instance, the boundary condition at the surface of the ocean can affect the propagation of waves and their impact on offshore energy systems.

In this chapter, we will delve into the mathematical expressions and physical interpretations of conservation laws and boundary conditions. We will also discuss their applications in understanding the behavior of ocean waves and their impact on ships and offshore energy systems. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of these fundamental principles and their importance in the study of ocean wave interaction.




### Section: 1.1 Conservation of Mass:

The conservation of mass is a fundamental principle in physics that states that the mass of a closed system remains constant over time. In other words, mass cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted from one form to another. This principle is also known as the law of mass conservation.

In the context of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems, the conservation of mass is crucial in understanding the behavior of waves as they interact with different systems. For instance, when a wave breaks on the surface of the ocean, the mass of the water is not destroyed, but rather transferred to the atmosphere as water vapor and to the seafloor as sediment.

The mathematical expression of the conservation of mass can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $t$ is time, $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity of the fluid, and $\nabla \cdot$ denotes the divergence operator. This equation states that the rate of change of mass in a volume is equal to the net mass flux out of the volume.

In the context of ocean waves, the conservation of mass is particularly important in understanding the propagation of waves. As waves travel through the ocean, they transfer mass from one location to another. This transfer of mass is what allows waves to carry energy and momentum.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of conservation of momentum and its applications in ocean wave interaction.





#### 1.1b Applications in Wave Dynamics

The conservation of mass is a fundamental principle that plays a crucial role in the study of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of the conservation of mass in wave dynamics.

One of the key applications of the conservation of mass in wave dynamics is in the study of wave propagation. As waves travel through the ocean, they transfer mass from one location to another. This transfer of mass is what allows waves to carry energy and momentum. The conservation of mass is essential in understanding the behavior of waves as they interact with different systems.

For instance, when a wave breaks on the surface of the ocean, the mass of the water is not destroyed, but rather transferred to the atmosphere as water vapor and to the seafloor as sediment. This transfer of mass is governed by the conservation of mass principle.

The conservation of mass is also crucial in the study of wave reflection and refraction. When a wave encounters a boundary between two different media, such as water and air, a portion of the wave is reflected back into the water, while the remaining portion is refracted into the air. The conservation of mass ensures that the total mass of the wave is conserved during this process.

In addition to wave propagation, the conservation of mass is also essential in understanding the behavior of waves in the presence of obstacles. When a wave encounters an obstacle, such as a ship or an offshore energy system, it can be reflected, refracted, or diffracted. The conservation of mass ensures that the total mass of the wave is conserved during these processes.

The mathematical expression of the conservation of mass in wave dynamics can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $t$ is time, $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity of the fluid, and $\nabla \cdot$ denotes the divergence operator. This equation states that the rate of change of mass in a volume is equal to the net mass flux out of the volume.

In conclusion, the conservation of mass is a fundamental principle that plays a crucial role in the study of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. It is essential in understanding wave propagation, reflection, refraction, and the behavior of waves in the presence of obstacles. The mathematical expression of the conservation of mass provides a powerful tool for analyzing and predicting the behavior of waves in various scenarios.





#### 1.1c Mass Conservation Equations

The conservation of mass is a fundamental principle that plays a crucial role in the study of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. In this section, we will explore the mathematical representation of the conservation of mass in wave dynamics.

The conservation of mass can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $t$ is time, $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity of the fluid, and $\nabla \cdot$ denotes the divergence operator. This equation states that the rate of change of mass in a volume is equal to the net mass flux out of the volume.

This equation is a form of the continuity equation, which is a fundamental equation in fluid dynamics. It expresses the conservation of mass in a fluid system. The continuity equation is derived from the principle of conservation of mass, which states that the mass of a system remains constant unless it is added or removed by external forces.

In the context of wave dynamics, the continuity equation is used to describe the propagation of waves. As waves travel through the ocean, they transfer mass from one location to another. The continuity equation ensures that the total mass of the wave is conserved during this process.

The continuity equation is also used in the study of wave reflection and refraction. When a wave encounters a boundary between two different media, such as water and air, a portion of the wave is reflected back into the water, while the remaining portion is refracted into the air. The continuity equation ensures that the total mass of the wave is conserved during these processes.

In addition to wave propagation, the continuity equation is also essential in understanding the behavior of waves in the presence of obstacles. When a wave encounters an obstacle, such as a ship or an offshore energy system, it can be reflected, refracted, or diffracted. The continuity equation ensures that the total mass of the wave is conserved during these processes.

In the next section, we will explore the application of the continuity equation in the study of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.




#### 1.2a Definition of Momentum Conservation

Momentum conservation is a fundamental principle in physics that states that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant unless acted upon by an external force. This principle is a direct consequence of Newton's second law of motion, which states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the force applied and occurs in the direction in which the force is applied.

In the context of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems, momentum conservation plays a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of wave propagation and the forces acting on these systems. 

The mathematical representation of momentum conservation can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = \vec{F}
$$

where $\vec{p}$ is the momentum of the system, $t$ is time, and $\vec{F}$ is the force acting on the system. This equation states that the rate of change of momentum of the system is equal to the force acting on the system.

In the context of wave dynamics, momentum conservation is used to describe the propagation of waves. As waves travel through the ocean, they transfer momentum from one location to another. The momentum conservation principle ensures that the total momentum of the wave is conserved during this process.

Momentum conservation is also essential in understanding the behavior of waves in the presence of obstacles. When a wave encounters an obstacle, such as a ship or an offshore energy system, it can be reflected, refracted, or diffracted. The momentum conservation principle ensures that the total momentum of the wave is conserved during these processes.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the implications of momentum conservation in the context of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. We will explore how this principle can be applied to understand the forces acting on these systems and how it can be used to predict the behavior of waves in the presence of obstacles.

#### 1.2b Applications of Momentum Conservation

The principle of momentum conservation has wide-ranging applications in the field of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. It is used to understand the forces acting on these systems and to predict their behavior in the presence of obstacles. In this section, we will explore some of these applications in more detail.

##### Wave Propagation

As waves travel through the ocean, they transfer momentum from one location to another. The principle of momentum conservation ensures that the total momentum of the wave is conserved during this process. This is crucial in understanding the propagation of waves and predicting their behavior.

For instance, consider a wave propagating in a medium with a constant density. The momentum of the wave can be expressed as:

$$
\vec{p} = \rho \vec{v} A
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the medium, $\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the wave, and $A$ is the amplitude of the wave. The force acting on the wave can be expressed as:

$$
\vec{F} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = \rho \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} A + \rho \vec{v} \frac{dA}{dt}
$$

The first term represents the force due to the change in velocity of the wave, while the second term represents the force due to the change in amplitude of the wave. By applying the principle of momentum conservation, we can derive the wave equation, which describes the propagation of waves in a medium.

##### Interaction with Obstacles

When a wave encounters an obstacle, such as a ship or an offshore energy system, it can be reflected, refracted, or diffracted. The principle of momentum conservation ensures that the total momentum of the wave is conserved during these processes.

For instance, consider a wave incident on a vertical wall. The wave can be reflected back into the medium as a new wave, or it can be refracted into the medium as a new wave. The principle of momentum conservation ensures that the total momentum of the incident wave is equal to the sum of the momenta of the reflected and refracted waves.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the implications of momentum conservation in the context of wave reflection and refraction. We will explore how this principle can be applied to understand the behavior of waves in the presence of obstacles.

#### 1.2c Challenges in Momentum Conservation

The principle of momentum conservation, while fundamental to understanding wave propagation and interaction with obstacles, is not without its challenges. These challenges arise from the inherent complexity of the systems involved, the assumptions made in the application of the principle, and the limitations of our measurement and modeling techniques.

##### Complexity of Systems

Ocean waves, ships, and offshore energy systems are complex systems with many interacting components. The principle of momentum conservation assumes that these systems can be modeled as a single entity with a well-defined momentum. However, in reality, these systems are composed of many smaller components, each with its own momentum. The interactions between these components can lead to significant deviations from the principle of momentum conservation.

For example, consider a ship in a rough sea. The ship can be modeled as a single entity with a well-defined momentum. However, the ship is composed of many components, such as the hull, the engine, and the cargo. Each of these components has its own momentum, which can change due to the forces acting on it. The interactions between these components can lead to significant deviations from the principle of momentum conservation.

##### Assumptions in the Application of the Principle

The principle of momentum conservation is often applied under certain assumptions. For instance, it is often assumed that the medium is homogeneous and isotropic, and that the waves are small and linear. However, these assumptions may not hold in all situations.

For example, consider a wave propagating in a medium with a density gradient. The principle of momentum conservation assumes that the density of the medium is constant. However, in a medium with a density gradient, the density of the medium changes along the direction of propagation of the wave. This can lead to significant deviations from the principle of momentum conservation.

##### Limitations of Measurement and Modeling Techniques

Our ability to measure and model ocean waves, ships, and offshore energy systems is limited. This can make it difficult to apply the principle of momentum conservation accurately.

For instance, consider a wave incident on a vertical wall. The wave can be reflected back into the medium as a new wave, or it can be refracted into the medium as a new wave. The principle of momentum conservation ensures that the total momentum of the incident wave is equal to the sum of the momenta of the reflected and refracted waves. However, measuring the momentum of a wave is not straightforward. It requires knowledge of the wave's velocity and amplitude, which can be difficult to determine accurately.

In conclusion, while the principle of momentum conservation is a powerful tool for understanding wave propagation and interaction with obstacles, it is not without its challenges. These challenges highlight the need for further research and development in this area.

This information is crucial in the design process, as it allows engineers to optimize the system for maximum energy extraction.

Another important application of momentum conservation is in the study of wave-ship interactions. Ships are constantly exposed to the forces exerted by ocean waves. These forces can be significant, particularly in rough seas, and can lead to structural stress and fatigue. The principles of momentum conservation are used to model these forces and predict their impact on the ship. This information is vital in the design and operation of ships, as it allows engineers to design ships that can withstand the forces exerted by ocean waves.

In addition to these applications, momentum conservation is also used in the study of wave propagation in the ocean.

The momentum conservation equations can be expressed in the following form:

$$
\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = \vec{F}
$$

where $\vec{p}$ is the momentum of the wave, $t$ is time, and $\vec{F}$ is the force acting on the wave. This equation states that the rate of change of momentum of the wave is equal to the force acting on the wave.

In the context of wave dynamics, the momentum conservation equations are used to describe the propagation of waves. As waves travel through the ocean, they transfer momentum from one location to another.

These interactions can result in the transfer of energy from the wave to the structure, or vice versa. The energy conservation principle is crucial in understanding these interactions and predicting their outcomes.

The energy conservation principle in wave-structure interactions can be expressed mathematically as:

The study of wave propagation and interaction with ships is a critical aspect of ocean engineering. This chapter delves into the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of waves as they interact with ships, and how these interactions can be predicted and managed. 

Wave propagation refers to the movement of waves across the surface of the ocean. It is a complex phenomenon influenced by a variety of factors, including the depth of the water, the wind speed and direction, and the presence of obstacles such as ships. Understanding wave propagation is crucial for predicting the behavior of waves around ships, which is essential for ship design and operation.

Interaction between waves and ships is a key concern in ship design and operation. The interaction can be either constructive or destructive, depending on the phase difference between the wave and the ship. Constructive interference can lead to increased wave height and ship motions, which can be beneficial in certain applications such as wave energy conversion. Destructive interference, on the other hand, can lead to wave reduction and reduced ship motions, which is desirable for ship comfort and safety.

In this chapter, we will explore the mathematical models that describe wave propagation and interaction with ships. These models, expressed in terms of wave amplitude, frequency, and wavelength, provide a quantitative understanding of these phenomena. We will also discuss the practical implications of these models for ship design and operation.

The study of wave propagation and interaction with ships is a complex and fascinating field that combines elements of fluid dynamics, wave theory, and ship design. By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of these principles and be able to apply them to practical problems in ocean engineering.




#### 1.3b Energy Conservation Equations

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of energy conservation in waves and its implications for wave dynamics. In this section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical representation of energy conservation in wave-structure interactions.

The energy conservation principle can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = 0
$$

where $E$ is the energy of the wave, $t$ is time, and $\frac{dE}{dt}$ is the rate of change of energy. This equation states that the rate of change of energy of the wave is equal to zero, indicating that the total energy of the wave is conserved over time.

In the context of wave-structure interactions, the energy conservation principle is used to describe the propagation of waves. As waves travel through the ocean, they transfer energy from one location to another. The energy conservation principle ensures that the total energy of the wave is conserved during this process.

The energy conservation principle is also essential in understanding the behavior of waves in the presence of obstacles. When a wave encounters an obstacle, such as a ship or an offshore energy system, it can be reflected, refracted, or diffracted. The energy conservation principle ensures that the total energy of the wave is conserved during these processes.

In the context of wave-structure interactions, the energy conservation principle can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = 0
$$

where $E$ is the energy of the wave, $t$ is time, and $\frac{dE}{dt}$ is the rate of change of energy. This equation states that the rate of change of energy of the wave is equal to zero, indicating that the total energy of the wave is conserved over time.

This equation is crucial in understanding the behavior of waves in the presence of obstacles.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of the energy conservation principle in the context of wave-structure interactions. We will discuss how this principle can be used to predict the behavior of waves and the forces acting on ships and offshore energy systems.

#### 1.3c Applications of Energy Conservation

In this section, we will explore some practical applications of energy conservation in the context of wave-structure interactions. These applications will help us understand the real-world implications of the energy conservation principle and how it can be used to predict the behavior of waves and the forces acting on ships and offshore energy systems.

##### Wave Energy Conversion

One of the most promising applications of energy conservation in wave-structure interactions is in the field of wave energy conversion. Wave energy conversion involves the conversion of wave energy into other forms of energy, such as electricity. This technology has the potential to provide a renewable and sustainable source of energy, especially in coastal regions where waves are abundant.

The energy conservation principle plays a crucial role in wave energy conversion. The principle ensures that the total energy of the wave is conserved during the conversion process. This means that the energy extracted from the wave must be equal to the change in the wave's energy. This principle can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = 0
$$

where $E$ is the energy of the wave, $t$ is time, and $\frac{dE}{dt}$ is the rate of change of energy. This equation states that the rate of change of energy of the wave is equal to zero, indicating that the total energy of the wave is conserved during the conversion process.

##### Wave-Structure Interactions

The energy conservation principle is also essential in understanding the behavior of waves in the presence of obstacles. When a wave encounters an obstacle, such as a ship or an offshore energy system, it can be reflected, refracted, or diffracted. The energy conservation principle ensures that the total energy of the wave is conserved during these processes.

For example, when a wave encounters a ship, the wave can be reflected off the ship's hull. The energy conservation principle ensures that the total energy of the reflected wave is equal to the total energy of the incident wave. This principle can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
E_{incident} = E_{reflected}
$$

where $E_{incident}$ is the energy of the incident wave and $E_{reflected}$ is the energy of the reflected wave. This equation states that the energy of the incident wave is equal to the energy of the reflected wave, indicating that the total energy of the wave is conserved during the reflection process.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical representation of energy conservation in wave-structure interactions and explore more practical applications.




#### 1.3c Applications in Wave Energy Systems

The principles of energy conservation and boundary conditions are fundamental to the design and operation of wave energy systems. These systems harness the energy of ocean waves to generate electricity, providing a clean and renewable source of power. The understanding of these principles is crucial for engineers and scientists working in this field.

One of the key applications of energy conservation in wave energy systems is in the design of wave energy converters (WECs). These devices are designed to convert the kinetic energy of waves into electrical energy. The design of these devices is governed by the principles of energy conservation, which ensure that the total energy of the wave is conserved during the conversion process.

The energy conservation principle is also essential in understanding the behavior of waves in the presence of wave energy converters. When a wave encounters a WEC, it can be reflected, refracted, or diffracted. The energy conservation principle ensures that the total energy of the wave is conserved during these processes.

The boundary conditions for wave energy systems are also crucial in their design and operation. These conditions define the behavior of waves at the boundaries of the system, such as at the interface between the water and the air. The understanding of these conditions is essential for predicting the behavior of waves in the presence of wave energy systems.

In the context of wave energy systems, the boundary conditions can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + c\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} = 0
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave height, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the wave speed. This equation represents the boundary condition for the wave height at the interface between the water and the air.

In conclusion, the principles of energy conservation and boundary conditions are fundamental to the design and operation of wave energy systems. These principles ensure that the total energy of the wave is conserved during the conversion process and define the behavior of waves at the boundaries of the system. Understanding these principles is crucial for engineers and scientists working in this field.

This theory is based on the assumption that the waves are small and that the water is deep. It is particularly useful for understanding the behavior of waves in the open ocean, where the effects of the seafloor and nearby structures are negligible.

Next, we will explore second-order wave theory, which is a more advanced model that takes into account the effects of the seafloor and nearby structures on wave propagation. This theory is based on the principles of linear wave theory, but it also includes terms that account for the non-linear behavior of waves. It is particularly useful for understanding the behavior of waves in shallow water and near offshore structures.

Throughout this chapter, we will use mathematical equations to describe the concepts of linear and second-order wave theory. These equations will be formatted using the popular Markdown format, with math expressions rendered using the MathJax library. This will allow us to present complex mathematical concepts in a clear and concise manner.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the principles of linear and second-order wave theory, and you will be equipped with the knowledge to apply these theories to real-world problems involving the interaction of ocean waves with ships and offshore energy systems. So let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of wave theory!







### Section: 2.1 Linear Wave Theory:

Linear wave theory is a fundamental concept in the study of ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. It is based on the assumption that the waves are small and that the fluid is incompressible and inviscid. These assumptions allow us to simplify the equations of motion and derive the linear wave equations.

#### 2.1a Wave Propagation

Wave propagation is a key aspect of linear wave theory. It describes how waves travel through a medium, in this case, the ocean. The propagation of waves is governed by the linear wave equations, which are derived from the linear wave theory.

The linear wave equations describe the motion of the fluid particles in the wave. They are given by:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = g \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{\rho_0} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial x} \right)
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave elevation, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\rho_0$ is the mean fluid density, and $\sigma$ is the wave stress.

The linear wave equations can be used to describe the propagation of waves in the ocean. The waves travel with a speed given by the dispersion relation:

$$
c = \sqrt{\frac{g \lambda}{2\pi}}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the wave.

The linear wave equations also describe the interaction of waves with the mean flow of the fluid. This interaction can lead to phenomena such as wave breaking and wave steepening, which are important in the study of ocean waves.

In the next section, we will discuss the linear wave equations in more detail and explore their implications for the study of ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.

#### 2.1b Wave Interaction with Ships

The interaction of waves with ships is a critical aspect of ship design and operation. This interaction can lead to phenomena such as wave-induced ship motions, wave-induced loads, and wave-induced ship motions. Understanding these phenomena is crucial for the design of ships that can withstand the forces exerted by the waves and for the operation of ships in conditions of high wave activity.

The interaction of waves with ships can be described using the linear wave theory. The linear wave theory provides a mathematical model of the wave propagation in the ocean. This model can be used to calculate the wave-induced motions and loads on the ship.

The wave-induced motions of the ship can be described by the wave-induced displacement of the ship. This displacement is given by the wave-induced velocity of the ship, which is calculated from the wave-induced acceleration of the ship. The wave-induced acceleration of the ship is calculated from the wave-induced force on the ship.

The wave-induced force on the ship is calculated from the wave-induced pressure on the ship. This pressure is calculated from the wave-induced stress on the ship. The wave-induced stress on the ship is calculated from the wave-induced strain on the ship.

Linear wave theory has a wide range of applications in the study of ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. In this section, we will discuss some of these applications in more detail.

##### Wave Propagation

As discussed in the previous section, linear wave theory is used to describe the propagation of waves in the ocean. This is crucial for understanding how waves travel from one point to another, and how they interact with the mean flow of the fluid. The linear wave equations can be used to calculate the speed of wave propagation, which is given by the dispersion relation. This is important for predicting the arrival time of waves at a given location, and for understanding the dispersion of waves in the ocean.

##### Wave Interaction with Ships

Linear wave theory is also used to study the interaction of waves with ships. This is important for understanding phenomena such as wave-induced ship motions, wave breaking, and wave steepening.

#### 2.2a Definition of Second-Order Waves

Second-order waves are a type of wave that is described by the second-order wave theory. This theory is an extension of the linear wave theory, and it is used to describe the propagation of waves in the ocean that are nonlinear and non-uniform. The second-order wave theory is based on the assumption that the wave amplitude is small compared to the wavelength, and that the wave propagation is primarily in one direction.

The second-order wave theory is based on the following equations:

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + c\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{2}g\frac{\partial \eta^2}{\partial x} = 0
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}g\frac{\partial \eta^2}{\partial x} = 0
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave amplitude, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, $c$ is the wave speed, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. These equations describe the propagation of second-order waves in the ocean.

The second-order wave theory is used to study a variety of phenomena, including wave-wave interactions, wave breaking, and wave steepening. It is also used to study the interaction of waves with ships and offshore energy systems.

In the next section, we will discuss the applications of second-order wave theory in more detail.

#### 2.2b Properties of Second-Order Waves

Second-order waves exhibit several unique properties that distinguish them from linear waves. These properties are primarily due to the nonlinear and non-uniform nature of second-order waves. In this section, we will discuss some of these properties in more detail.

##### Wave Amplitude

Unlike linear waves, the amplitude of second-order waves is not constant. It can vary with time and space, leading to phenomena such as wave steepening and wave breaking. The wave amplitude is described by the second-order wave theory as:

$$
\eta(x,t) = \eta_0(x,t) + \frac{1}{2}g\eta_0^2(x,t)
$$

where $\eta_0(x,t)$ is the wave amplitude in the absence of nonlinear effects.

##### Wave Speed

The wave speed of second-order waves is also different from that of linear waves. It is affected by the wave amplitude and the wave steepness. The wave speed is described by the second-order wave theory as:

$$
c(x,t) = c_0(x,t) + \frac{1}{2}g\eta_0(x,t)
$$

where $c_0(x,t)$ is the wave speed in the absence of nonlinear effects.

##### Wave Propagation

The propagation of second-order waves is primarily in one direction, unlike linear waves which can propagate in all directions. This is due to the assumption of the second-order wave theory that the wave propagation is primarily in one direction.

##### Wave-Wave Interactions

Second-order waves can interact with each other, leading to phenomena such as wave steepening and wave breaking. These interactions are described by the second-order wave theory as:

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + c\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{2}g\frac{\partial \eta^2}{\partial x} = 0
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}g\frac{\partial \eta^2}{\partial x} = 0
$$

These equations describe the propagation of second-order waves in the ocean, taking into account the nonlinear and non-uniform nature of these waves.

In the next section, we will discuss the applications of second-order wave theory in more detail.

#### 2.2c Applications of Second-Order Waves

Second-order wave theory has a wide range of applications in the study of ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. In this section, we will discuss some of these applications in more detail.

##### Wave Steepening

One of the most significant applications of second-order wave theory is in the study of wave steepening. Wave steepening occurs when the wave amplitude increases rapidly, leading to a significant increase in the wave steepness. This phenomenon is particularly important in the study of rogue waves, which are large and unexpected waves that can pose a significant threat to ships and offshore structures.

The second-order wave theory provides a mathematical framework for understanding wave steepening. The wave steepness, defined as the ratio of the wave amplitude to the wavelength, is described by the second-order wave theory as:

$$
\frac{\eta}{\lambda} = \frac{\eta_0}{\lambda_0} + \frac{1}{2}g\frac{\eta_0^2}{\lambda_0}
$$

where $\eta$ and $\lambda$ are the wave amplitude and wavelength, respectively, and $\eta_0$ and $\lambda_0$ are the wave amplitude and wavelength in the absence of nonlinear effects.

##### Wave Breaking

Second-order wave theory is also used to study wave breaking. Wave breaking occurs when the wave amplitude becomes too large, leading to the formation of a wave front that is perpendicular to the wave propagation direction. This phenomenon can lead to the formation of turbulent water, which can pose a significant threat to ships and offshore structures.

The second-order wave theory provides a mathematical framework for understanding wave breaking. The wave breaking, defined as the ratio of the wave amplitude to the wave steepness, is described by the second-order wave theory as:

$$
\frac{\eta}{\frac{\eta}{\lambda}} = \frac{\eta_0}{\frac{\eta_0}{\lambda_0}} + \frac{1}{2}g\frac{\eta_0^2}{\frac{\eta_0}{\lambda_0}}
$$

where $\eta$ and $\lambda$ are the wave amplitude and wavelength, respectively, and $\eta_0$ and $\lambda_0$ are the wave amplitude and wavelength in the absence of nonlinear effects.

##### Wave-Wave Interactions

Second-order wave theory is also used to study wave-wave interactions. These interactions occur when two waves with different frequencies and wave vectors interact, leading to the formation of a new wave. This phenomenon is particularly important in the study of wave propagation in the ocean, as it can lead to the formation of new waves with different frequencies and wave vectors.

The second-order wave theory provides a mathematical framework for understanding wave-wave interactions. The wave-wave interaction, defined as the ratio of the wave amplitude to the wave steepness, is described by the second-order wave theory as:

$$
\frac{\eta}{\frac{\eta}{\lambda}} = \frac{\eta_0}{\frac{\eta_0}{\lambda_0}} + \frac{1}{2}g\frac{\eta_0^2}{\frac{\eta_0}{\lambda_0}}
$$

where $\eta$ and $\lambda$ are the wave amplitude and wavelength, respectively, and $\eta_0$ and $\lambda_0$ are the wave amplitude and wavelength in the absence of nonlinear effects.

In the next section, we will discuss the limitations and future directions of second-order wave theory.




#### 2.2b Second-Order Wave Equations

The second-order wave equations are a set of partial differential equations that describe the propagation of second-order waves in the ocean. These equations are derived from the second-order wave theory and are used to study a variety of phenomena, including wave-wave interactions, wave breaking, and wave steepening.

The second-order wave equations are given by:

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + c\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{2}g\frac{\partial \eta^2}{\partial x} = 0
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}g\frac{\partial \eta^2}{\partial x} = 0
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave amplitude, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, $c$ is the wave speed, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. These equations describe the propagation of second-order waves in the ocean.

The second-order wave equations are nonlinear and non-uniform, which makes them more complex to solve than linear wave equations. However, they provide a more accurate description of wave propagation in the ocean, especially in situations where the wave amplitude is not small compared to the wavelength.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the methods used to solve the second-order wave equations.

#### 2.2c Applications of Second-Order Wave Theory

The second-order wave theory has a wide range of applications in the study of ocean waves. It is used to model and analyze various phenomena such as wave-wave interactions, wave breaking, and wave steepening. In this section, we will discuss some of these applications in more detail.

##### Wave-Wave Interactions

Wave-wave interactions are a fundamental aspect of ocean wave propagation. They occur when two waves of different frequencies interact, leading to the generation of new waves with frequencies that are a sum or difference of the original frequencies. The second-order wave theory provides a mathematical framework for studying these interactions.

The second-order wave equations can be used to describe the propagation of wave-wave interactions. For example, consider two waves with amplitudes $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$, and frequencies $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$. The wave-wave interaction can be described by the following equations:

$$
\frac{\partial \eta_1}{\partial t} + c\frac{\partial \eta_1}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{2}g\frac{\partial \eta_1^2}{\partial x} = 0
$$

$$

$$

where $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$ are the wave amplitudes, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, $c$ is the wave speed, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. These equations describe the propagation of the wave-wave interaction in the ocean.

##### Wave Breaking

Wave breaking is another important aspect of ocean wave propagation. It occurs when the wave amplitude becomes too large, leading to the formation of a wave crest that breaks and dissipates. The second-order wave theory can be used to model and analyze wave breaking.

The second-order wave equations can be used to describe the propagation of wave breaking. For example, consider a wave with amplitude $\eta$ and frequency $\omega$. The wave breaking can be described by the following equations:

$$

$$

$$

where $\eta$ is the wave amplitude, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, $c$ is the wave speed, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. These equations describe the propagation of second-order waves in the ocean.

##### Wave Breaking

#### 2.3a Wave Reflection Mechanisms

Wave reflection is a fundamental aspect of wave propagation in the ocean. It occurs when a wave encounters a boundary between two different media, such as water and air, and part of the wave is reflected back into the first medium. The second-order wave theory provides a mathematical framework for studying wave reflection.

The second-order wave theory is used to derive the wave reflection equations, which describe the propagation of reflected waves in the ocean. These equations are given by:

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + c\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{2}g\frac{\partial \eta^2}{\partial x} = 0
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}g\frac{\partial \eta^2}{\partial x} = 0
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave amplitude, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, $c$ is the wave speed, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. These equations describe the propagation of reflected waves in the ocean.

The reflection coefficient, denoted by $R$, is a key parameter in wave reflection. It is defined as the ratio of the reflected wave amplitude to the incident wave amplitude. The reflection coefficient can be calculated using the continuity condition at the boundary, which states that the sum of the incident wave and the reflected wave must equal the transmitted wave.

The reflection coefficient can be expressed in terms of the wave speeds in the two media as follows:

$$
R = \left(\frac{c_2 - c_1}{c_2 + c_1}\right)^2
$$

where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the wave speeds in the first and second medium, respectively. This equation shows that the reflection coefficient is dependent on the difference in wave speeds between the two media.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of wave transmission and how it relates to wave reflection.

#### 2.3b Wave Transmission Coefficient

The wave transmission coefficient, denoted by $T$, is another key parameter in wave reflection. It is defined as the ratio of the transmitted wave amplitude to the incident wave amplitude. The transmission coefficient can be calculated using the continuity condition at the boundary, which states that the sum of the incident wave and the reflected wave must equal the transmitted wave.

The transmission coefficient can be expressed in terms of the wave speeds in the two media as follows:

$$
T = \left(\frac{2c_1}{c_2 + c_1}\right)^2
$$

where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the wave speeds in the first and second medium, respectively. This equation shows that the transmission coefficient is dependent on the sum of the wave speeds in the two media.

The reflection coefficient and the transmission coefficient are related by the following equation:

$$
R + T = 1
$$

This equation shows that the sum of the reflection coefficient and the transmission coefficient must equal 1. This is a direct consequence of the conservation of energy at the boundary between the two media.

The reflection coefficient and the transmission coefficient are both dependent on the difference in wave speeds between the two media. However, they have different dependencies. The reflection coefficient is dependent on the difference in wave speeds, while the transmission coefficient is dependent on the sum of the wave speeds. This difference in dependencies leads to the complementary nature of the reflection and transmission coefficients.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of wave absorption and how it relates to wave reflection and transmission.

$$

$$
T = \left(\frac{2c_1}{c_2 + c_1}\right)^2
$$

where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the wave speeds in the first and second medium, respectively.

The reflection coefficient and the transmission coefficient are related by the following equation:

$$
R + T = 1
$$

This equation shows that the sum of the reflection coefficient and the transmission coefficient must equal 1. This is a direct consequence of the conservation of energy at the boundary between the two media.

The reflection coefficient and the transmission coefficient are both dependent on the difference in wave speeds between the two media. However, they have different dependencies. The reflection coefficient is dependent on the difference in wave speeds, while the transmission coefficient is dependent on the sum of the wave speeds. This difference in dependencies leads to the complementary nature of the reflection and transmission coefficients.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of wave absorption and how it relates to wave reflection and transmission.

$$

$$

The study of waves is a fundamental aspect of oceanography, and it is a critical component in understanding the behavior of ships and offshore energy systems. In the previous chapters, we have explored the linear wave theory, which provides a simplified understanding of wave propagation. However, the real world is inherently nonlinear, and many phenomena in the ocean cannot be accurately described using linear wave theory. This is where nonlinear wave theory comes into play.

In this chapter, we will delve into the nonlinear wave theory, a more complex but more accurate model of wave propagation. Nonlinear wave theory takes into account the nonlinear effects that are present in the ocean, such as wave-wave interactions and wave-current interactions. These effects can significantly alter the behavior of waves, and understanding them is crucial for predicting and mitigating the effects of waves on ships and offshore energy systems.

We will begin by introducing the basic concepts of nonlinear wave theory, such as the nonlinear wave equation and the concept of wave-wave interactions. We will then explore the implications of these concepts for the behavior of waves in the ocean. We will also discuss the methods used to solve the nonlinear wave equation, including numerical methods and perturbation methods.

Finally, we will discuss the applications of nonlinear wave theory in the field of oceanography. This includes the prediction of rogue waves, the study of wave-induced forces on ships and offshore structures, and the design of offshore energy systems that can withstand the effects of waves.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to nonlinear wave theory, suitable for both students and professionals in the field of oceanography. By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the principles of nonlinear wave theory and its applications in the study of waves in the ocean.




#### 2.3b Wave Transmission Mechanisms

Wave transmission is a fundamental aspect of wave propagation in the ocean. It occurs when a wave encounters a boundary between two different media, such as water and air, and part of the wave is transmitted into the second medium. The second-order wave theory provides a mathematical framework for studying wave transmission.

The second-order wave theory is used to derive the wave transmission equations, which describe the propagation of transmitted waves in the ocean. These equations are given by:

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + c\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{2}g\frac{\partial \eta^2}{\partial x} = 0
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}g\frac{\partial \eta^2}{\partial x} = 0
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave amplitude, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, $c$ is the wave speed, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. These equations describe the propagation of transmitted waves in the ocean.

The transmission coefficient, denoted by $T$, is a key parameter in wave transmission. It is defined as the ratio of the transmitted wave amplitude to the incident wave amplitude. The transmission coefficient can be calculated using the continuity condition at the boundary, which states that the sum of the incident wave and the reflected wave must equal the transmitted wave.

The transmission coefficient can be expressed in terms of the wave speeds in the two media as follows:

$$
T = \left(\frac{c_2 + c_1}{c_2 - c_1}\right)^2
$$

where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the wave speeds in the first and second medium, respectively. This equation shows that the transmission coefficient is dependent on the difference in wave speeds between the two media.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of wave reflection and transmission in the context of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.

#### 2.3c Wave Reflection and Transmission Coefficients

The reflection and transmission coefficients are crucial parameters in the study of wave propagation in the ocean. They provide a quantitative measure of the amount of wave energy that is reflected and transmitted at the boundary between two different media. 

The reflection coefficient, denoted by $R$, is defined as the ratio of the reflected wave amplitude to the incident wave amplitude. It can be calculated using the continuity condition at the boundary, which states that the sum of the incident wave and the reflected wave must equal the transmitted wave. The reflection coefficient can be expressed in terms of the wave speeds in the two media as follows:

$$
R = \left(\frac{c_2 - c_1}{c_2 + c_1}\right)^2
$$

where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the wave speeds in the first and second medium, respectively. This equation shows that the reflection coefficient is dependent on the difference in wave speeds between the two media.

The transmission coefficient, denoted by $T$, is defined as the ratio of the transmitted wave amplitude to the incident wave amplitude. It can also be calculated using the continuity condition at the boundary. The transmission coefficient can be expressed in terms of the wave speeds in the two media as follows:

$$
T = \left(\frac{c_2 + c_1}{c_2 - c_1}\right)^2
$$

where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the wave speeds in the first and second medium, respectively. This equation shows that the transmission coefficient is also dependent on the difference in wave speeds between the two media.

The reflection and transmission coefficients are complementary, meaning that their sum is always equal to 1. This is a direct consequence of the conservation of wave energy at the boundary between two media. 

In the context of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems, the reflection and transmission coefficients play a crucial role in determining the amount of wave energy that is absorbed by the system. This is particularly important for the design and operation of offshore energy systems, where the absorption of wave energy can lead to fatigue damage and structural failure.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of wave reflection and transmission in the context of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.

$$
R = \left(\frac{c_1 - c_2}{c_1 + c_2}\right)^2
$$

where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the wave speeds in the first and second medium, respectively. This equation shows that the reflection coefficient is dependent on the difference in wave speeds between the two media.

The transmission coefficient, denoted by $T$, was discussed in the previous section. It is defined as the ratio of the transmitted wave amplitude to the incident wave amplitude.

$$

The reflection and transmission coefficients are complementary, meaning that their sum is always equal to 1. This is a direct consequence of the continuity condition at the boundary. 

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of wave reflection and transmission in the context of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.




#### 2.4a Definition of Wave Dispersion

Wave dispersion is a fundamental concept in the study of wave propagation in the ocean. It refers to the phenomenon where waves of different wavelengths travel at different speeds. This is in contrast to non-dispersive waves, where all frequencies travel at the same speed. 

In the context of ocean waves, dispersion can be caused by several factors, including the depth of the water, the presence of currents, and the properties of the water itself. For instance, in deep water, longer waves tend to travel faster than shorter waves. This is due to the fact that longer waves have a larger wavelength, which allows them to travel faster. 

Dispersion can also be caused by the presence of currents. If a wave is traveling in a direction that is not parallel to the current, the wave will be slowed down by the current. This is because the wave is constantly being pushed sideways by the current, which causes it to lose energy and speed. 

The properties of the water can also cause dispersion. For example, the presence of salt in the water can affect the speed of waves. Salt water is denser than fresh water, which means that waves traveling in salt water will travel faster than waves traveling in fresh water. 

The concept of dispersion is closely related to the concept of wave velocity. The wave velocity is a measure of how fast a wave is traveling. For dispersive waves, the wave velocity is dependent on the wavelength of the wave. This is in contrast to non-dispersive waves, where the wave velocity is constant for all wavelengths.

The wave velocity can be calculated using the dispersion relationship, which relates the angular frequency of the wave to its wavenumber. For dispersive waves, the dispersion relationship is a function of the wavenumber, meaning that the wave velocity is dependent on the wavelength of the wave. 

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of wave dispersion in more detail, including its effects on wave propagation and its implications for ship and offshore energy systems.

#### 2.4b Wave Dispersion in Deep Water

In deep water, the dispersion of waves is primarily governed by the depth of the water and the wavelength of the waves. The dispersion relationship in deep water can be approximated by the following equation:

$$
\omega = \sqrt{gk}
$$

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $k$ is the wavenumber. This equation shows that the phase speed of the waves, which is the speed at which the phase of the wave propagates, is proportional to the square root of the wavenumber. 

The wavenumber, in turn, is inversely proportional to the wavelength. This means that longer waves, which have a larger wavelength, will travel faster than shorter waves. This is the primary mechanism of wave dispersion in deep water.

The dispersion relationship in deep water can also be expressed in terms of the wave frequency and the water depth. The wave frequency, $f$, is related to the wave speed, $c$, and the water depth, $h$, by the following equation:

$$
f = \frac{c}{2h}
$$

This equation shows that the wave frequency is inversely proportional to the water depth. This means that waves with a higher frequency, which correspond to shorter wavelengths, will travel faster than waves with a lower frequency.

The dispersion of waves in deep water can have significant implications for ship and offshore energy systems. For instance, the dispersion of waves can affect the design of offshore structures, as different frequencies of waves will interact with the structure in different ways. Similarly, the dispersion of waves can affect the design of ships, as different frequencies of waves will interact with the ship in different ways.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of wave dispersion in shallow water, where the dispersion of waves is primarily governed by the presence of the seafloor.

#### 2.4c Wave Dispersion in Shallow Water

In shallow water, the dispersion of waves is primarily governed by the presence of the seafloor and the wavelength of the waves. The dispersion relationship in shallow water can be approximated by the following equation:

$$
\omega = \sqrt{gk + k^2h}
$$

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $k$ is the wavenumber, and $h$ is the water depth. This equation shows that the phase speed of the waves, which is the speed at which the phase of the wave propagates, is proportional to the square root of the sum of the squares of the wavenumber and the wavenumber times the water depth.

The wavenumber, in turn, is inversely proportional to the wavelength. This means that longer waves, which have a larger wavelength, will travel faster than shorter waves. However, in shallow water, the presence of the seafloor can cause the dispersion of waves to deviate from the simple relationship observed in deep water.

The dispersion relationship in shallow water can also be expressed in terms of the wave frequency and the water depth. The wave frequency, $f$, is related to the wave speed, $c$, and the water depth, $h$, by the following equation:

$$
f = \frac{c}{2h}
$$

This equation shows that the wave frequency is inversely proportional to the water depth. This means that waves with a higher frequency, which correspond to shorter wavelengths, will travel faster than waves with a lower frequency. However, the presence of the seafloor can cause the wave frequency to deviate from this simple relationship.

The dispersion of waves in shallow water can have significant implications for ship and offshore energy systems. For instance, the dispersion of waves can affect the design of offshore structures, as different frequencies of waves will interact with the structure in different ways. Similarly, the dispersion of waves can affect the design of ships, as different frequencies of waves will interact with the ship in different ways.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of wave dispersion in the presence of currents, which can further complicate the dispersion of waves in the ocean.




#### 2.4b Dispersion Relations

The dispersion relation is a fundamental concept in wave theory that describes the relationship between the angular frequency of a wave and its wavenumber. For dispersive waves, the dispersion relation is a function of the wavenumber, meaning that the wave velocity is dependent on the wavelength of the wave. This is in contrast to non-dispersive waves, where the wave velocity is constant for all wavelengths.

The dispersion relation can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\omega = \omega(k)
$$

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency and $k$ is the wavenumber. The dispersion relation is a key tool in understanding the behavior of waves in the ocean, as it allows us to predict how waves will interact with different mediums and structures.

In the context of ocean waves, the dispersion relation can be used to calculate the wave velocity as a function of the wavelength. This is particularly useful in the study of wave dispersion, as it allows us to understand how waves of different wavelengths will travel at different speeds.

The dispersion relation can also be used to understand the phenomenon of wave steepening. As waves propagate, they tend to steepen, which can lead to the formation of shock waves. The dispersion relation can be used to calculate the rate of wave steepening, which is a key factor in understanding the behavior of waves in the ocean.

Shallow water refers to a water body where the water depth is much smaller than the wavelength of the wave. In such cases, the wave propagation is significantly affected by the bottom topography and the wave steepening phenomenon becomes more pronounced.

The dispersion relation for shallow water waves can be expressed as:

$$
\omega = \sqrt{gk}
$$

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $k$ is the wavenumber, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. This equation shows that the wave velocity is proportional to the square root of the wavenumber, which means that waves with larger wavelengths will travel faster than waves with smaller wavelengths.

The dispersion relation for shallow water waves can also be used to understand the phenomenon of wave breaking. As waves propagate in shallow water, they tend to steepen and eventually break, leading to the generation of turbulence and mixing of the water column. The dispersion relation can be used to calculate the wave breaking height, which is a key factor in understanding the behavior of waves in the ocean.

In the previous sections, we have discussed the dispersion of waves in shallow, deep, coastal, offshore, harbor, estuarine, lake, river, polar, tropical, temperate, and subpolar waters. In this section, we will focus on the dispersion of waves in subtropical waters.

Subtropical waters refer to the region near the equator, but outside the tropics. This region is characterized by warm temperatures and minimal ice cover. The dispersion of waves in subtropical waters is influenced by the deep water dispersion relation, as the water depths in this region are typically much larger than the wavelengths of the waves.

The dispersion relation for subtropical waters can be expressed as:

$$
\omega = \sqrt{gk}
$$

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $k$ is the wavenumber, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. This equation shows that the wave velocity is proportional to the square root of the wavenumber, which means that waves with larger wavelengths will travel faster than waves with smaller wavelengths.

The dispersion relation for subtropical waters can also be used to understand the phenomenon of wave breaking. As waves propagate in subtropical waters, they tend to steepen and eventually break, leading to the generation of turbulence and mixing of the water column. The dispersion relation can be used to calculate the wave breaking height, which is a key factor in understanding the behavior of waves in the ocean.

Shallow water refers to a water body where the water depth is much smaller than the wavelength of the wave. In such cases, the wave propagation is significantly affected by the water depth, leading to wave dispersion.

### Section: 3.1 Definition of Regular Waves:

Regular waves, also known as progressive waves, are a type of wave that propagate through a medium without changing their shape or speed. They are characterized by their uniform motion and constant amplitude, making them ideal for studying the basic principles of wave propagation and interaction.

#### 3.1a Characteristics of Regular Waves

Regular waves have several key characteristics that distinguish them from other types of waves. These include:

1. **Uniform motion:** Regular waves move through a medium with a constant velocity. This means that the wave crests and troughs move at the same speed, maintaining a constant distance between them.

2. **Constant amplitude:** The amplitude of regular waves remains constant as they propagate. This means that the height of the wave crests and depth of the wave troughs do not change over time.

3. **Linear polarization:** Regular waves are linearly polarized, meaning that the electric field vector of the wave oscillates in a single plane. This is in contrast to circularly or elliptically polarized waves, which have electric field vectors that rotate in a circular or elliptical path.

4. **Constant wavelength:** The wavelength of regular waves remains constant as they propagate. This means that the distance between successive wave crests or troughs does not change over time.

5. **Constant frequency:** The frequency of regular waves remains constant as they propagate. This means that the number of wave cycles that pass a given point in a given time does not change.

These characteristics make regular waves ideal for studying the basic principles of wave propagation and interaction. They also make them a fundamental concept in the study of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.

In the next section, we will explore the mathematical representation of regular waves, using the popular Markdown format and the MathJax library to render equations in TeX and LaTeX style syntax. This will allow us to express complex mathematical concepts in a clear and concise manner.

#### 3.1b Regular Wave Equations

The propagation of regular waves can be described by the wave equation, which is a second-order linear partial differential equation. The wave equation describes how the wave's amplitude, frequency, and wavelength are related to the medium's properties and the wave's speed.

The wave equation for regular waves in a homogeneous medium is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $\phi$ is the wave function, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the wave speed.

The wave equation can also be expressed in terms of the wave's amplitude, frequency, and wavelength. This is given by:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} H e^{i(kx-\omega t)}
$$

where $A$ is the wave amplitude, $H$ is the wave height, $k$ is the wave number, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency.

The wave number and angular frequency are related to the wave's wavelength and frequency by the equations:

$$
k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}
$$

and

$$
\omega = 2\pi f
$$

where $\lambda$ is the wavelength and $f$ is the frequency.

These equations describe the propagation of regular waves in a homogeneous medium. However, in the ocean, the medium is not always homogeneous, and the wave's propagation can be affected by factors such as water depth, ocean currents, and the presence of underwater structures. Therefore, more complex equations and models are often used to describe the propagation of ocean waves.

In the next section, we will explore some of these more complex models and their applications in the study of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.




#### 3.1c Applications of Regular Waves

Regular waves have a wide range of applications in various fields, including oceanography, civil engineering, and telecommunications. In this section, we will discuss some of the key applications of regular waves.

##### Oceanography

In oceanography, regular waves are used to study wave propagation in the ocean. The uniform motion and constant amplitude of regular waves make them ideal for studying the basic principles of wave propagation and interaction. Regular waves are also used in the design and testing of oceanographic instruments, such as wave recorders and wave radar.

##### Civil Engineering

In civil engineering, regular waves are used in the design and testing of structures that are subjected to wave loading, such as bridges, harbors, and offshore platforms. The constant wavelength and frequency of regular waves make them ideal for studying the response of these structures to wave loading. Regular waves are also used in the design of wave attenuators, which are used to reduce wave energy in harbors and marinas.

##### Telecommunications

In telecommunications, regular waves are used in the design and testing of antennas and communication systems. The linear polarization of regular waves makes them ideal for studying the polarization properties of antennas and communication systems. Regular waves are also used in the design of waveguides, which are used to guide electromagnetic waves along a path.

In conclusion, regular waves have a wide range of applications in various fields. Their uniform motion, constant amplitude, linear polarization, and constant wavelength and frequency make them ideal for studying the basic principles of wave propagation and interaction. They also play a crucial role in the design and testing of various structures and systems.




#### 3.2a Definition of Wave Height and Period

Wave height and period are fundamental parameters that describe the characteristics of a wave. They are defined as follows:

##### Wave Height

The wave height, denoted as $H$, is the vertical distance between the crest (highest point) and the trough (lowest point) of a wave. It is a measure of the amplitude of the wave. The wave height is a crucial parameter in the study of wave propagation and interaction with structures. It is particularly important in the design and testing of structures that are subjected to wave loading, such as bridges, harbors, and offshore platforms.

##### Wave Period

The wave period, denoted as $T$, is the time it takes for a wave to complete one full oscillation. It is the inverse of the wave frequency. The wave period is a measure of the time scale of the wave. It is particularly important in the study of wave propagation and interaction with structures. The wave period is also a key parameter in the design and testing of structures that are subjected to wave loading.

In the context of plane progressive regular waves, the wave height and period are constant throughout the wave. This is because plane progressive regular waves have a uniform motion and constant amplitude. The wave height and period are therefore independent of position and time, making them ideal for studying the basic principles of wave propagation and interaction.

The wave height and period are also related to the wavelength and frequency of the wave. The wavelength, denoted as $\lambda$, is the horizontal distance between successive crests or troughs of a wave. It is related to the wave period and frequency by the equation:

$$
\lambda = cT = \frac{1}{f}
$$

where $c$ is the wave speed and $f$ is the wave frequency.

In the next sections, we will discuss the methods for measuring wave height and period, and the factors that affect these parameters.

#### 3.2b Wave Height and Period Measurement Techniques

The measurement of wave height and period is a critical aspect of oceanography and civil engineering. It allows us to understand the characteristics of waves and their interaction with structures. There are several techniques available for measuring wave height and period, each with its own advantages and limitations.

##### Direct Measurement

Direct measurement involves physically measuring the wave height and period. This can be done using a variety of instruments, such as wave recorders, wave radar, and wave gauges. These instruments are designed to accurately measure the wave height and period at a specific location.

##### Indirect Measurement

Indirect measurement involves estimating the wave height and period from other measurements. This can be done using various methods, such as spectral analysis, wave-height estimation algorithms, and wave-height prediction models. These methods are particularly useful when direct measurement is not feasible or practical.

##### Spectral Analysis

##### Wave Height Prediction Models

Wave height prediction models are mathematical models that predict the wave height based on various environmental parameters. These models are based on the principles of wave propagation and interaction with structures. They take into account the wave frequency, wavelength, and wind speed, among other parameters.

One of the most commonly used wave height prediction models is the significant wave height model. This model predicts the significant wave height, which is the mean wave height of the highest third of the waves. It is defined as four times the standard deviation of the surface elevation, or equivalently as four times the square root of the zeroth-order moment of the wave spectrum.

##### Wave Period Prediction Models

These models are particularly useful for predicting the wave height and period in the absence of direct measurements. They take into account the wave frequency, wavelength, and wind speed, among other parameters.

One of the most commonly used wave height and period prediction models is the wave spectrum model. This model predicts the wave height and period based on the wave spectrum, which is a representation of the wave energy as a function of frequency and direction. It is defined as the product of the wave height and the wave period.

In the next section, we will discuss the factors that affect the prediction of wave height and period.




#### 3.2b Wave Height and Period Measurement Techniques

The measurement of wave height and period is a crucial aspect of oceanography and marine engineering. It allows us to understand the characteristics of ocean waves, their propagation, and their interaction with structures. There are several techniques for measuring wave height and period, each with its own advantages and limitations.

##### Direct Measurement Techniques

Direct measurement techniques involve physically measuring the wave height and period. This can be done using a variety of instruments, including wave gauges, wave riders, and wave radar.

###### Wave Gauges

Wave gauges are instruments that measure the wave height by directly immersing a sensor in the water. They can be either mechanical or electronic. Mechanical wave gauges, such as the oscillating water column (OWC) wave gauge, use a pendulum to measure the wave height. Electronic wave gauges, on the other hand, use sensors such as accelerometers or pressure sensors to measure the wave height.

###### Wave Riders

Wave riders are instruments that ride on top of the wave and measure the wave height and period as they move along with the wave. They can be either mechanical or electronic. Mechanical wave riders, such as the oscillating water column (OWC) wave rider, use a pendulum to measure the wave height. Electronic wave riders, on the other hand, use sensors such as accelerometers or pressure sensors to measure the wave height.

###### Wave Radar

Wave radar is a relatively new technique for measuring wave height and period. It uses radar technology to measure the wave height and period from a distance. This technique is particularly useful for measuring the wave height and period of large waves, such as tsunamis.

##### Indirect Measurement Techniques

Indirect measurement techniques involve inferring the wave height and period from other measurements. This can be done using various methods, including spectral analysis, wave model simulations, and remote sensing.

###### Spectral Analysis

Spectral analysis is a method for determining the wave height and period from a time series of wave measurements. It involves decomposing the time series into its constituent frequencies and amplitudes. The wave height and period can then be determined from the dominant frequencies and amplitudes.

###### Wave Model Simulations

Wave model simulations involve using numerical models to simulate the propagation of waves. These models can be used to infer the wave height and period from the simulated wave fields.

###### Remote Sensing

Remote sensing is a method for measuring the wave height and period from a distance. It involves using satellite or airborne sensors to measure the wave height and period. This technique is particularly useful for measuring the wave height and period of large waves, such as tsunamis.

In the next section, we will discuss the factors that affect the measurement of wave height and period.




#### 3.2c Effects of Wave Height and Period on Wave Dynamics

The wave height and period are two fundamental parameters that describe the characteristics of an ocean wave. They are closely related to the wave's energy, propagation speed, and the forces it exerts on structures. In this section, we will explore the effects of wave height and period on wave dynamics.

##### Wave Energy and Propagation Speed

The wave height and period are directly related to the wave's energy and propagation speed. The wave energy is proportional to the square of the wave height, as described by the equation:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} \rho g A^2
$$

where $E$ is the wave energy, $\rho$ is the density of the water, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $A$ is the wave height. The wave propagation speed, on the other hand, is inversely proportional to the wave period, as described by the equation:

$$
c = \frac{gT}{2\pi}
$$

where $c$ is the wave propagation speed, $T$ is the wave period, and $g$ and $\pi$ are constants. These equations show that larger wave heights and shorter periods result in higher wave energies and faster propagation speeds.

##### Wave Forces on Structures

The wave height and period also play a crucial role in the forces exerted by waves on structures. The wave force is proportional to the square of the wave height and the wave period, as described by the equation:

$$
F = \frac{1}{2} \rho g A^2 T^2
$$

where $F$ is the wave force. This equation shows that larger wave heights and shorter periods result in higher wave forces. This is particularly important in the design of offshore energy systems and ships, which must be able to withstand these forces.

##### Wave Breaking and Dissipation

The wave height and period also affect the breaking and dissipation of waves. Larger wave heights and shorter periods can lead to more intense wave breaking, which can result in the generation of turbulence and mixing in the water. This can have significant implications for the transport of heat, salt, and other properties in the ocean.

In conclusion, the wave height and period are fundamental parameters that have a profound impact on wave dynamics. Understanding their effects is crucial for a wide range of applications, from the design of offshore energy systems to the prediction of wave propagation and breaking.




#### 3.3a Definition of Wave Amplitude and Phase

The amplitude and phase of a wave are fundamental properties that describe the wave's shape and position in its cycle. 

##### Wave Amplitude

The amplitude of a wave is the maximum displacement of the wave from its mean or equilibrium position. It is a measure of the wave's strength or energy. The amplitude of a wave is directly related to the wave's energy, as described by the equation:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} \rho g A^2
$$

where $E$ is the wave energy, $\rho$ is the density of the water, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $A$ is the wave amplitude. Larger amplitudes result in higher wave energies and faster propagation speeds.

##### Wave Phase

The phase of a wave is the position of the wave in its cycle. It is measured in radians and can range from 0 to $2\pi$. The phase of a wave is used to describe the relative position of the wave with respect to a reference point. The phase of a wave is defined as the angle from the 12:00 position to the current position of the hand, at time $t$, measured clockwise.

The phase of a wave is particularly useful when the origin $t_0$ is chosen based on features of the wave. For example, for a sinusoid, a convenient choice is any $t$ where the function's value changes from zero to positive.

The phase expressed in degrees (from 0° to 360°, or from −180° to +180°) is defined the same way, except with "360°" in place of "2π".

##### Consequences

The phase of a wave is periodic, with the same period $T$ as the wave. This means that the phase of a wave repeats itself after every period. The phase of a wave is zero at the start of each period, that is:

$$
\phi(t) = 0 \quad \text{for } t = 0, T, 2T, \ldots
$$

Moreover, for any given choice of the origin $t_0$, the value of the wave $F(t)$ for any argument $t$ depends only on its phase at $t$. Namely, one can write $F(t) = A \sin(\phi(t))$, where $A$ is the amplitude of the wave and $\phi(t)$ is the phase of the wave at time $t$.

#### 3.3b Wave Amplitude and Phase in Regular Waves

In the previous section, we defined the amplitude and phase of a wave. Now, let's delve into the specifics of these properties in regular waves. 

##### Wave Amplitude in Regular Waves

In regular waves, the amplitude remains constant throughout the wave cycle. This is because regular waves are sinusoidal, and the amplitude of a sinusoidal wave is constant. The amplitude of a regular wave is a measure of the wave's strength or energy. Larger amplitudes result in higher wave energies and faster propagation speeds.

The amplitude of a regular wave can be calculated using the equation:

$$
A = \sqrt{E / \rho g}
$$

where $A$ is the amplitude, $E$ is the wave energy, $\rho$ is the density of the water, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

##### Wave Phase in Regular Waves

In regular waves, the phase is also constant throughout the wave cycle. This is because regular waves are sinusoidal, and the phase of a sinusoidal wave is constant. The phase of a regular wave is used to describe the relative position of the wave with respect to a reference point.

The phase of a regular wave can be calculated using the equation:

$$
\phi(t) = \omega t + \phi_0
$$

where $\phi(t)$ is the phase, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $t$ is the time, and $\phi_0$ is the initial phase.

The initial phase $\phi_0$ is chosen based on features of the wave. For example, for a sinusoid, a convenient choice is any $t$ where the function's value changes from zero to positive.

The phase expressed in degrees (from 0° to 360°, or from −180° to +180°) is defined the same way, except with "360°" in place of "2π".

##### Consequences

The phase of a regular wave is periodic, with the same period $T$ as the wave. This means that the phase of a regular wave repeats itself after every period. The phase of a regular wave is zero at the start of each period, that is:

$$
\phi(t) = 0 \quad \text{for } t = 0, T, 2T, \ldots
$$

Moreover, for any given choice of the origin $t_0$, the value of the wave $F(t)$ for any argument $t$ depends only on its phase at $t$. Namely, one can write $F(t) = A \sin(\phi(t))$, where $A$ is the amplitude of the wave and $\phi(t)$ is the phase of the wave at time $t$.

#### 3.3c Wave Amplitude and Phase in Irregular Waves

In the previous sections, we have discussed the amplitude and phase of regular waves. Now, let's explore these properties in irregular waves. 

##### Wave Amplitude in Irregular Waves

In irregular waves, the amplitude can vary throughout the wave cycle. This is because irregular waves are not sinusoidal, and the amplitude of a wave is a measure of the wave's strength or energy. Larger amplitudes result in higher wave energies and faster propagation speeds.

The amplitude of an irregular wave can be calculated using the equation:

$$
A = \sqrt{E / \rho g}
$$

where $A$ is the amplitude, $E$ is the wave energy, $\rho$ is the density of the water, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

##### Wave Phase in Irregular Waves

In irregular waves, the phase can also vary throughout the wave cycle. This is because irregular waves are not sinusoidal, and the phase of a wave is used to describe the relative position of the wave with respect to a reference point.

The phase of an irregular wave can be calculated using the equation:

$$
\phi(t) = \omega t + \phi_0
$$

where $\phi(t)$ is the phase, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $t$ is the time, and $\phi_0$ is the initial phase.

The initial phase $\phi_0$ is chosen based on features of the wave. For example, for a sinusoid, a convenient choice is any $t$ where the function's value changes from zero to positive.

The phase expressed in degrees (from 0° to 360°, or from −180° to +180°) is defined the same way, except with "360°" in place of "2π".

##### Consequences

The phase of an irregular wave is not periodic, unlike the phase of a regular wave. This is because the phase of an irregular wave can change significantly over a single period. The phase of an irregular wave is zero at the start of each period, that is:

$$
\phi(t) = 0 \quad \text{for } t = 0, T, 2T, \ldots
$$

Moreover, for any given choice of the origin $t_0$, the value of the wave $F(t)$ for any argument $t$ depends only on its phase at $t$. Namely, one can write $F(t) = A \sin(\phi(t))$, where $A$ is the amplitude of the wave and $\phi(t)$ is the phase of the wave at time $t$.




#### 3.3b Measurement of Wave Amplitude and Phase

The measurement of wave amplitude and phase is a crucial aspect of understanding and predicting the behavior of ocean waves. This section will discuss the various methods used to measure wave amplitude and phase, including the use of wave gauges and the least-squares spectral analysis (LSSA) method.

##### Wave Gauges

Wave gauges are instruments used to measure the amplitude and phase of ocean waves. They work by measuring the displacement of the water surface due to the passing wave. The most common type of wave gauge is the pressure gauge, which measures the pressure difference between the water surface and a fixed point. This pressure difference is then converted into a displacement, which is proportional to the wave amplitude.

The phase of the wave can be measured by observing the time at which the wave reaches a certain point. This time is then used to calculate the phase of the wave relative to a reference point.

##### Least-Squares Spectral Analysis (LSSA)

The LSSA method is a mathematical technique used to estimate the amplitude and phase of a wave signal. It involves computing the least-squares spectrum by performing the least-squares approximation multiple times, each time for a different frequency.

The LSSA method treats each sinusoidal component independently, even though they may not be orthogonal to data points. This is in contrast to the simultaneous or in-context method, which can fit more components (sines and cosines) than there are data samples.

The LSSA method involves the following steps:

1. Compute the least-squares spectrum by performing the least-squares approximation multiple times, each time for a different frequency.
2. For each frequency, sine and cosine functions are evaluated at the times corresponding to the data samples.
3. Dot products of the data vector with the sinusoid vectors are taken and appropriately normalized.
4. A time shift is calculated for each frequency to orthogonalize the sine and cosine components before the dot product.
5. A power is computed from those two amplitude components.

This process implements a discrete Fourier transform when the data are uniformly spaced in time and the frequencies chosen correspond to integer numbers of cycles over the finite data record.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of these methods in the study of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.

#### 3.3c Wave Amplitude and Phase in Nonlinear Systems

In the previous sections, we have discussed the measurement of wave amplitude and phase in linear systems. However, many real-world systems, including ocean waves and offshore energy systems, exhibit nonlinear behavior. In this section, we will explore the concept of wave amplitude and phase in nonlinear systems.

Nonlinear systems are those in which the output is not directly proportional to the input. In the context of ocean waves, this nonlinearity can arise due to various factors such as wave-wave interactions, wave-current interactions, and wave-structure interactions. These nonlinearities can significantly affect the amplitude and phase of the waves, leading to complex wave patterns that are difficult to predict using linear theories.

One of the key tools for studying nonlinear systems is the method of multiple scales. This method involves introducing a small parameter $\epsilon$ that characterizes the nonlinearity of the system. The solution to the system is then sought in the form of a power series expansion in $\epsilon$, with each term representing a different order of nonlinearity.

For example, consider a nonlinear wave equation of the form:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x^2} + \epsilon g \eta \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x}
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave amplitude, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, $c$ is the wave speed, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $\epsilon$ is the small parameter characterizing the nonlinearity of the system.

The solution to this equation can be sought in the form:

$$
\eta(x,t) = \eta_0(x,t) + \epsilon \eta_1(x,t) + \epsilon^2 \eta_2(x,t) + \cdots
$$

where $\eta_0(x,t)$ is the linear solution, $\eta_1(x,t)$ is the first-order nonlinear correction, and so on.

By substituting this series into the wave equation and equating terms of the same order in $\epsilon$, we can obtain a set of equations that can be solved to obtain the wave amplitude and phase at each order of nonlinearity.

In the next section, we will discuss some specific examples of nonlinear wave phenomena and how they can be studied using the method of multiple scales.




#### 3.3c Effects of Wave Amplitude and Phase on Wave Dynamics

The amplitude and phase of ocean waves play a crucial role in their dynamics. The amplitude of a wave is directly related to its energy, with larger amplitudes indicating higher energy levels. The phase of a wave, on the other hand, determines its position in the wave cycle.

##### Wave Amplitude and Energy

The amplitude of a wave is a measure of the displacement of the water surface from its mean position. This displacement is directly related to the energy of the wave. The larger the amplitude, the more energy the wave carries. This energy can be transferred to other waves or to structures in the ocean, such as ships or offshore energy systems.

The energy of a wave can be calculated using the formula:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} \rho g A^2
$$

where $E$ is the energy, $\rho$ is the density of the water, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $A$ is the amplitude of the wave.

##### Wave Phase and Wave Propagation

The phase of a wave determines its position in the wave cycle. It is the angle between the wave crest and a reference point, usually the mean water level. The phase of a wave can affect its interaction with other waves and structures.

For example, when two waves with different phases meet, they can either enhance or cancel each other out, depending on their phase difference. This phenomenon is known as wave interference.

The phase of a wave can also affect its propagation. The phase velocity of a wave, which is the speed at which the phase of the wave propagates, can be different from the group velocity, which is the speed at which the wave energy propagates. This difference can lead to phenomena such as wave steepening and wave breaking.

##### Wave Amplitude and Phase in Nonlinear Systems

In nonlinear systems, the amplitude and phase of waves can interact in complex ways. For example, in the three-wave interaction described by the three-wave equation, the amplitude and phase of the three waves can interact to produce a variety of solutions, including explosive solutions, stimulated backscatter, and soliton exchange.

These solutions can have significant implications for the dynamics of ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. For example, the simulton solution, which consists of three comoving solitons, can be related to the "three sisters" observed in rogue waves, even though deep water does not have a three-wave resonant interaction.

In conclusion, the amplitude and phase of ocean waves are fundamental to their dynamics. Understanding these properties is crucial for predicting and managing the interaction of waves with ships and offshore energy systems.




#### 3.4a Definition of Wave Velocity

Wave velocity is a fundamental concept in the study of ocean waves. It refers to the speed at which a wave propagates through a medium. The velocity of a wave can be described in terms of its phase velocity and group velocity.

##### Phase Velocity

The phase velocity of a wave, denoted as $v_p$, is the speed at which the phase of the wave propagates. It is defined as the ratio of the angular frequency $\omega$ to the wavenumber $k$:

$$
v_p = \frac{\omega}{k}
$$

The phase velocity is a measure of how quickly the phase of the wave changes as it propagates. It is a constant for a given wave and is independent of the frequency of the wave.

##### Group Velocity

The group velocity of a wave, denoted as $v_g$, is the speed at which the wave packet (or group) of waves propagates. It is defined as the derivative of the dispersion relation with respect to the wavenumber:

$$
v_g = \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k}
$$

The group velocity is a measure of how quickly the energy of the wave packet propagates. It can vary with frequency and is typically larger than the phase velocity.

##### Relationship between Phase Velocity and Group Velocity

The phase velocity and group velocity are related by the dispersion relation of the medium. For a non-dispersive medium, where the dispersion relation is independent of the frequency, the phase velocity and group velocity are equal. However, for a dispersive medium, where the dispersion relation depends on the frequency, the phase velocity and group velocity can be different.

In the next section, we will discuss the factors that affect wave velocity and how it influences the interaction of waves with ships and offshore energy systems.

#### 3.4b Factors Affecting Wave Velocity

Several factors can affect the velocity of ocean waves. These factors can be broadly categorized into two groups: external factors and internal factors.

##### External Factors

External factors are those that are not inherent to the wave but can influence its velocity. These include:

1. **Wind Speed and Direction**: Wind is a primary source of ocean waves. The speed and direction of the wind can significantly affect the velocity of the waves. Stronger winds can generate larger waves with higher velocities. The direction of the wind can also determine the direction of wave propagation.

2. **Water Depth**: The depth of the water can affect the velocity of the waves. In shallow water, the velocity of the waves can be lower due to the increased friction with the seafloor. In deep water, the velocity can be higher due to the reduced friction.

3. **Tidal Forces**: Tidal forces can also influence the velocity of the waves, particularly in coastal areas. The gravitational pull of the moon and the sun can cause the ocean water to bulge out towards and away from these celestial bodies, leading to tidal forces. These forces can cause the waves to move at different velocities in different directions.

##### Internal Factors

Internal factors are inherent to the wave and can influence its velocity. These include:

1. **Wave Frequency**: The frequency of the wave can affect its velocity. Higher frequency waves tend to have higher velocities. This is due to the dispersion relation, which relates the frequency and wavenumber of the wave.

2. **Wave Amplitude**: The amplitude of the wave can also affect its velocity. Larger amplitude waves can have higher velocities due to the increased energy content.

3. **Wave Steepness**: The steepness of the wave, defined as the ratio of the wave height to the wavelength, can influence the velocity of the wave. Steeper waves can have higher velocities due to the increased wave energy.

In the next section, we will discuss how these factors can influence the interaction of waves with ships and offshore energy systems.

#### 3.4c Wave Velocity in Different Media

The velocity of ocean waves can vary significantly depending on the medium through which they propagate. The medium can be broadly categorized into two types: homogeneous and inhomogeneous.

##### Homogeneous Media

Homogeneous media are those in which the properties (such as density and elasticity) are uniform throughout. In such media, the wave velocity is typically constant and independent of the position. The wave velocity in homogeneous media can be calculated using the dispersion relation:

$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{g \lambda}{2\pi}}
$$

where $v$ is the wave velocity, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\lambda$ is the wavelength, and $\pi$ is the pi constant.

##### Inhomogeneous Media

In contrast, inhomogeneous media are those in which the properties vary with position. The wave velocity in such media can vary significantly and can depend on the position. The wave velocity in inhomogeneous media can be calculated using the dispersion relation:

$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{g \lambda}{2\pi} \frac{1}{k}}
$$

where $k$ is the wavenumber. The wavenumber can be calculated using the dispersion relation:

$$
k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}
$$

In inhomogeneous media, the wave velocity can be affected by various factors, including changes in water depth, changes in water density, and changes in the seafloor topography.

##### Effects of Inhomogeneity on Wave Velocity

Inhomogeneity can have significant effects on the velocity of ocean waves. For example, in the case of a wave propagating over a seafloor with a varying depth, the wave velocity can change as the wave moves from deep water to shallow water. This can lead to changes in the wave energy and the wave amplitude.

Inhomogeneity can also lead to wave refraction, where the wave changes its direction as it propagates. This can be particularly significant in coastal areas, where the wave can be affected by changes in the water depth and the seafloor topography.

In the next section, we will discuss how these factors can influence the interaction of waves with ships and offshore energy systems.




#### 3.4b Factors Affecting Wave Velocity

Several factors can affect the velocity of ocean waves. These factors can be broadly categorized into two groups: external factors and internal factors.

##### External Factors

External factors are those that are not inherent to the wave but can influence its velocity. These include:

1. **Atmospheric Conditions**: The state of the atmosphere can significantly affect the velocity of ocean waves. Wind speed and direction, air pressure, and temperature can all influence the generation and propagation of waves. For instance, strong winds can generate large waves with high velocities, while low air pressure can decrease the velocity of waves.

2. **Tidal Forces**: The gravitational pull of the moon and the sun can cause tidal forces that can affect the velocity of ocean waves. These forces can cause changes in the water level, which can in turn affect the velocity of waves.

3. **Geographical Features**: The shape and depth of the ocean floor can also influence the velocity of waves. Shallow waters and narrow channels can cause waves to slow down, while deep waters and wide channels can increase wave velocity.

##### Internal Factors

Internal factors are inherent to the wave and can influence its velocity. These include:

1. **Wave Frequency**: The frequency of a wave can affect its velocity. Higher frequency waves tend to have higher velocities.

2. **Wave Amplitude**: The amplitude of a wave can also influence its velocity. Larger amplitude waves tend to have higher velocities.

3. **Wave Direction**: The direction of wave propagation can affect its velocity. Waves propagating in the direction of the wind can have higher velocities than waves propagating against the wind.

Understanding these factors is crucial for predicting the velocity of ocean waves and for designing ships and offshore energy systems that can withstand these waves. In the next section, we will discuss how these factors can be measured and modeled.

#### 3.4c Wave Velocity Measurement Techniques

The measurement of wave velocity is a critical aspect of oceanography and marine engineering. It allows us to understand the behavior of waves in different environments and to predict their impact on ships and offshore energy systems. There are several techniques available for measuring wave velocity, each with its own advantages and limitations.

##### Direct Measurement Techniques

Direct measurement techniques involve directly measuring the velocity of waves. These techniques include:

1. **Doppler Radar**: Doppler radar can be used to measure the velocity of waves by detecting the Doppler shift in the radar signal caused by the motion of the waves. This technique can provide high-resolution measurements of wave velocity, but it requires a clear line of sight to the waves and can be affected by atmospheric conditions.

2. **Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs)**: ADCPs use sound waves to measure the velocity of water, including waves. They can provide three-dimensional measurements of wave velocity, but they can be expensive and require specialized equipment and training.

##### Indirect Measurement Techniques

Indirect measurement techniques involve inferring the velocity of waves from other measurements. These techniques include:

1. **Wave Spectrum Analysis**: Wave spectrum analysis involves measuring the amplitude and frequency of waves and using this information to calculate the wave velocity. This technique can provide accurate measurements of wave velocity, but it requires a large number of measurements and can be affected by noise.

2. **Tidal Gauges**: Tidal gauges can be used to measure the velocity of waves by detecting changes in the water level caused by the waves. This technique can provide long-term measurements of wave velocity, but it can be affected by sedimentation and biofouling.

##### Numerical Modeling Techniques

Numerical modeling techniques involve using mathematical models to simulate the propagation of waves. These techniques include:

1. **Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) Models**: NWP models use numerical methods to solve the primitive equations of fluid dynamics to simulate the propagation of waves. These models can provide detailed information about wave velocity, but they require high-resolution data and can be computationally intensive.

2. **Wave Modeling Software**: Wave modeling software, such as TOMAWAC and MIKE 21, use simplified equations to simulate the propagation of waves. These models can provide quick and easy measurements of wave velocity, but they may not be as accurate as NWP models.

In conclusion, the choice of wave velocity measurement technique depends on the specific requirements of the application, including the accuracy and resolution of the measurements, the available resources, and the environmental conditions.




#### 3.4c Effects of Wave Velocity on Wave Dynamics

The velocity of ocean waves plays a crucial role in their dynamics. It influences the wave's propagation, energy transfer, and interaction with other waves and structures. In this section, we will explore the effects of wave velocity on wave dynamics, focusing on the effects of wave velocity on wave propagation and energy transfer.

##### Effects of Wave Velocity on Wave Propagation

The velocity of a wave is directly related to its propagation speed. The propagation speed of a wave is the speed at which the wave travels through the medium. For ocean waves, the medium is the water. The propagation speed of a wave is determined by its frequency and the properties of the medium.

The propagation speed of a wave can be calculated using the dispersion relation, which relates the wave's frequency to its wavelength and propagation speed. For ocean waves, the dispersion relation can be written as:

$$
\omega = \sqrt{gk}
$$

where $\omega$ is the frequency, $k$ is the wavenumber, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. This equation shows that the propagation speed of a wave is proportional to the square root of the product of the frequency and the wavenumber.

The propagation speed of a wave can also be affected by the wave's amplitude and the properties of the medium. For instance, in deep water, the propagation speed of a wave is primarily determined by its frequency and the acceleration due to gravity. However, in shallow water, the propagation speed can be affected by the wave's amplitude and the water depth.

##### Effects of Wave Velocity on Energy Transfer

The velocity of a wave also affects its energy transfer. The energy transfer of a wave is the rate at which energy is transferred from one point to another. For ocean waves, the energy transfer can be calculated using the Poynting vector, which is a vector that represents the energy flux of a wave.

The Poynting vector can be written as:

$$
\mathbf{P} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}
$$

where $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field, $\mathbf{H}$ is the magnetic field, and $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space. This equation shows that the energy transfer of a wave is proportional to the product of the electric and magnetic fields.

The energy transfer of a wave can be affected by its velocity. For instance, the energy transfer of a wave can increase with its velocity, leading to higher energy transfer rates. However, the energy transfer can also decrease with the velocity, leading to lower energy transfer rates.

In conclusion, the velocity of ocean waves plays a crucial role in their dynamics. It affects the wave's propagation and energy transfer, and can be influenced by various factors such as the wave's frequency, amplitude, and the properties of the medium. Understanding the effects of wave velocity on wave dynamics is essential for predicting and managing the impact of ocean waves on ships and offshore energy systems.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the concept of wave energy density and flux, two fundamental concepts in the study of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. Wave energy density and flux are crucial in understanding the behavior of waves and their impact on various systems. They provide a quantitative measure of the energy contained in a wave and the rate at which this energy is transported.

Wave energy density, often denoted as $E$, is defined as the energy per unit area of the wave. It is a measure of the intensity of the wave and is typically expressed in units of J/m$^2$. The energy density of a wave is directly related to its amplitude and frequency, with higher amplitude and frequency waves having higher energy densities.

On the other hand, wave energy flux, often denoted as $F$, is defined as the rate of energy transport per unit area. It is a measure of the power of the wave and is typically expressed in units of W/m$^2$. The energy flux of a wave is directly related to its energy density and propagation direction, with waves propagating in the direction of increasing energy flux.

Together, wave energy density and flux provide a comprehensive understanding of the energy content and transport of waves. They are essential in the design and analysis of ships and offshore energy systems, as they help determine the forces and loads exerted by waves on these systems.

In the following sections, we will explore the mathematical representations of wave energy density and flux, their physical interpretations, and their applications in the field of ocean wave interaction. We will also discuss the factors that influence wave energy density and flux, such as wave height, wavelength, and water depth. By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of these concepts and their importance in the study of ocean wave interaction.




#### 4.1a Energy Conservation Equations for Waves

In the previous section, we introduced the concepts of wave energy density and flux. In this section, we will explore the energy conservation equations for waves, which are fundamental to understanding the behavior of waves in the ocean.

The energy conservation equation for waves is derived from the general equation of heat transfer, which can be written as:

$$
\rho {\partial k\over{\partial t}} = -\rho {\bf v}\cdot\nabla k - \rho {\bf v}\cdot\nabla h + \rho T{\bf v}\cdot \nabla s + \nabla\cdot(\sigma\cdot {\bf v}) - \sigma_{ij}{\partial v_{i}\over{\partial x_{j}}}
$$

where $\rho$ is the density, $k$ is the kinetic energy per unit mass, $v$ is the velocity, $h$ is the enthalpy, $T$ is the temperature, $s$ is the entropy, and $\sigma$ is the stress tensor.

The equation for entropy production can be written as:

$$
\rho T {Ds\over{Dt}} = \nabla\cdot(\kappa\nabla T) + {\mu\over{2}}\left( {\partial v_{i}\over{\partial x_{j}}} + {\partial v_{j}\over{\partial x_{i}}} - {2\over{3}}\delta_{ij}\nabla\cdot {\bf v} \right)^{2} + \zeta(\nabla \cdot {\bf v})^{2}
$$

In the case where thermal conduction and viscous forces are absent, the equation for entropy production collapses to $Ds/Dt=0$, showing that ideal fluid flow is isentropic.

These equations are derived in Section 49 of the sixth volume of L.D. Landau and E.M. Lifshitz's "Course of Theoretical Physics". They can be used to measure the heat transfer and air flow in a domestic refrigerator, to do a harmonic analysis of regenerators, or to understand the physics of glaciers.

In the context of ocean wave interaction, these equations are crucial in understanding the energy transfer between waves and ships or offshore energy systems. They provide a quantitative measure of the energy exchange, which is essential in the design and analysis of these systems.

In the next section, we will explore the mathematical representations of wave energy density and flux in more detail, and discuss their physical interpretations and applications.

#### 4.1b Wave Energy Density and Flux Calculation

In the previous section, we introduced the energy conservation equations for waves. These equations are fundamental to understanding the behavior of waves in the ocean. In this section, we will delve deeper into the calculation of wave energy density and flux, which are crucial in the study of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.

The wave energy density, $E$, is defined as the energy per unit area of the wave. It is a measure of the intensity of the wave and is typically expressed in units of J/m$^2$. The wave energy density can be calculated using the equation:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2}\rho g \eta^2
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $\eta$ is the wave amplitude.

The wave energy flux, $F$, is defined as the rate of energy transport per unit area. It is a measure of the power of the wave and is typically expressed in units of W/m$^2$. The wave energy flux can be calculated using the equation:

$$
F = \frac{1}{2}\rho g \eta^2 \omega
$$

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the wave.

These equations are derived from the energy conservation equations for waves, which we introduced in the previous section. They provide a quantitative measure of the energy content and transport of waves, which is essential in the design and analysis of ships and offshore energy systems.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of wave energy spectrum, which is a more comprehensive representation of the energy content of a wave field. We will also discuss the methods for measuring wave energy density and flux in the ocean.

For instance, the wave energy flux can be used to calculate the wave force acting on a ship's hull, which is essential in designing a ship that can withstand the forces exerted by waves.

Another important application of wave energy density and flux is in the design and analysis of offshore energy systems. These systems, such as wind turbines and wave energy converters, are often exposed to harsh wave conditions. The wave energy density and flux can be used to calculate the wave forces acting on these systems, which are crucial in determining the system's structural integrity and performance.

The wave energy density and flux can also be used in the study of wave propagation in the ocean. By analyzing the wave energy density and flux, we can gain insights into the propagation of waves, which is crucial in understanding the behavior of waves in the ocean. This can be particularly useful in predicting the impact of waves on coastal areas and offshore structures.

In addition, the wave energy density and flux can be used in the study of wave-wave interactions. These interactions, which involve the transfer of energy between waves, are crucial in understanding the behavior of wave fields in the ocean.

#### 4.1b Applications of Energy Conservation in Wave Dynamics

The principles of energy conservation are fundamental to understanding the behavior of waves in the ocean. They are applied in a variety of ways, from the design of ships and offshore energy systems to the study of wave propagation and interaction with these systems.

#### Ship Design

In the design of ships, energy conservation is used to optimize the ship's performance and safety. The ship's hull is designed to minimize wave resistance, which is the energy lost to the surrounding water due to wave generation. This is achieved by optimizing the hull shape to minimize the wave-making drag, which is a direct application of the energy conservation principle.

The energy conservation principle is also used in the design of the ship's propulsion system. The propeller is designed to convert the engine's power into thrust, which propels the ship forward. The efficiency of this conversion process is maximized by optimizing the propeller's design, which is another application of the energy conservation principle.

In the design of offshore energy systems, such as wind turbines and wave energy converters, energy conservation is used to optimize the system's performance and efficiency. The system's design is optimized to maximize the energy extraction from the waves, which is achieved by optimizing the system's shape and placement in the water.

The energy conservation principle is also used in the design of the system's power conversion system. The power converter is designed to convert the wave energy into electrical power, which is maximized by optimizing the converter's design. This is another application of the energy conservation principle.

#### Wave Propagation and Interaction

In the study of wave propagation and interaction with ships and offshore energy systems, energy conservation is used to understand the wave behavior. The wave energy is conserved as it propagates through the water, which is a direct application of the energy conservation principle.

The energy conservation principle is also used to understand the wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. The wave energy is transferred to the system, which is a direct application of the energy conservation principle. This understanding is crucial in the design and analysis of these systems.

In conclusion, the principles of energy conservation are fundamental to understanding the behavior of waves in the ocean. They are applied in a variety of ways, from the design of ships and offshore energy systems to the study of wave propagation and interaction with these systems.




#### 4.1c Energy Conservation in Wave Energy Systems

In the context of wave energy systems, energy conservation is a fundamental principle that governs the operation of these systems. The principle of energy conservation is applied in the design and operation of wave energy converters, which are devices that convert wave energy into electrical power.

#### Wave Energy Converters

Wave energy converters operate on the principle of energy conservation. The wave energy is converted into electrical power, which is a direct application of the energy conservation principle.

The design of wave energy converters involves a complex interplay of various physical principles, including fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, and electrical engineering. The converter's design is optimized to maximize the energy extraction from the waves, which is achieved by optimizing the converter's shape and placement in the water.

The operation of wave energy converters involves the conversion of wave energy into electrical power. This conversion process is governed by the principle of energy conservation, which states that the total energy in a closed system remains constant. In the context of wave energy converters, this means that the wave energy is converted into electrical power, with no energy loss.

#### 4.2a Definition of Wave Energy Density

Wave energy density is a fundamental concept in the study of ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. It is a measure of the energy contained in a wave, and it is a key parameter in the design and operation of wave energy systems.

The energy density of a wave is defined as the energy per unit area of the wave. It is typically expressed in units of joules per square meter (J/m²). The energy density of a wave is a function of the wave's amplitude, frequency, and wavelength. It is also a function of the wave's propagation direction and the medium in which the wave is propagating.

The energy density of a wave can be calculated using the wave's amplitude and frequency. The energy density `E` of a wave is given by the equation:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} \rho g A^2
$$

where `ρ` is the density of the medium, `g` is the acceleration due to gravity, and `A` is the amplitude of the wave. This equation is derived from the equation for the potential energy of a wave, which is given by:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} \rho g A^2
$$

The energy density of a wave is a critical parameter in the design and operation of wave energy systems. It is used to determine the power output of wave energy converters, which are devices that convert wave energy into electrical power. The power output of a wave energy converter is given by the equation:

$$
P = \frac{1}{2} \rho g A^2 \sigma
$$

where `σ` is the surface tension of the medium. This equation shows that the power output of a wave energy converter is directly proportional to the energy density of the wave. Therefore, maximizing the energy density of the wave is crucial for maximizing the power output of the wave energy converter.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of wave energy flux, which is another important parameter in the study of ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.

#### 4.2b Calculation of Wave Energy Density

The calculation of wave energy density involves the application of the principles of fluid dynamics and wave propagation. As we have seen in the previous section, the energy density of a wave is given by the equation:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} \rho g A^2
$$

where `ρ` is the density of the medium, `g` is the acceleration due to gravity, and `A` is the amplitude of the wave. However, in order to calculate the energy density of a wave, we need to know the wave's amplitude and frequency.

The amplitude of a wave can be determined from its surface elevation. The surface elevation of a wave is given by the equation:

$$
\eta = A \cos(\omega t - kx)
$$

where `η` is the surface elevation, `A` is the amplitude of the wave, `ω` is the angular frequency of the wave, and `k` is the wave number. The angular frequency and wave number are related by the dispersion relation, which is given by:

$$
\omega = \sqrt{gk}
$$

The frequency of a wave can be determined from its period. The period of a wave is given by the equation:

$$
T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}
$$

Therefore, the energy density of a wave can be calculated using the equations:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} \rho g A^2 = \frac{1}{2} \rho g \left(A \cos(\omega t - kx)\right)^2
$$

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} \rho g A^2 = \frac{1}{2} \rho g \left(A \cos(\frac{2\pi}{\omega} t - kx)\right)^2
$$

These equations show that the energy density of a wave is a function of the wave's amplitude, frequency, and wavelength. It is also a function of the wave's propagation direction and the medium in which the wave is propagating.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of wave energy flux, which is another important parameter in the study of ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.

#### 4.2c Wave Energy Density in Ships and Offshore Systems

In the context of ships and offshore systems, wave energy density plays a crucial role in understanding the interaction between waves and these structures. The energy density of waves can be used to predict the forces exerted by the waves on the structures, which is essential for designing structures that can withstand these forces.

The energy density of waves in the vicinity of a ship or an offshore system can be calculated using the equations derived in the previous section. However, in practice, the calculation can be more complex due to the presence of multiple waves with different amplitudes and frequencies.

The total energy density of waves in the vicinity of a ship or an offshore system can be calculated by summing the energy densities of all the individual waves. This can be represented mathematically as:

$$
E_{\text{total}} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} E_i
$$

where `E_i` is the energy density of the `i`-th wave, and `n` is the total number of waves.

In the case of offshore systems, the energy density of waves can be affected by the presence of wave energy converters. These devices convert wave energy into electrical power, which can be used to supply electricity to remote locations. The presence of these devices can increase the energy density of waves in the vicinity of the devices.

The energy density of waves can also be affected by the presence of wave energy storage systems. These systems store wave energy for later use, which can be useful in situations where the demand for electricity is not constant. The energy density of waves in the vicinity of these systems can be calculated using the equations derived in the previous section, taking into account the changes in the wave's amplitude and frequency due to the storage process.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of wave energy flux, which is another important parameter in the study of ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore systems.




#### 4.2b Measurement of Wave Energy Density

The measurement of wave energy density is a critical aspect of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. It allows us to quantify the energy contained in a wave, which is crucial for the design and operation of wave energy systems.

There are several methods for measuring wave energy density, each with its own advantages and limitations. One of the most common methods is the use of wave energy density meters. These devices measure the energy density of a wave by detecting the displacement of the wave and converting it into an electrical signal. The energy density is then calculated from the amplitude and frequency of the signal.

Another method for measuring wave energy density is through the use of wave energy flux meters. These devices measure the energy flux, which is the rate of energy transfer per unit area. The energy density is then calculated from the energy flux and the wave's propagation direction.

In addition to these methods, wave energy density can also be measured through the use of wave energy spectrum analyzers. These devices measure the energy spectrum of a wave, which is a representation of the energy contained in different frequency bands. The energy density is then calculated from the energy spectrum.

It's important to note that the accuracy of these measurements depends on the accuracy of the sensors and the calibration of the devices. Therefore, regular calibration and maintenance are essential for ensuring accurate measurements.

#### 4.3a Definition of Wave Energy Flux

Wave energy flux, denoted as $E_w$, is a fundamental concept in the study of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. It is defined as the rate of energy transfer per unit area due to the wave motion. The energy flux is a vector quantity, with the direction of the vector indicating the direction of energy propagation and the magnitude representing the rate of energy transfer.

The energy flux can be expressed in terms of the wave energy density $E_w$ and the wave propagation direction $k$. The energy flux $E_w$ is given by the equation:

$$
E_w = \frac{1}{2} \rho g \sigma^2
$$

where $\rho$ is the fluid density, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the free-surface elevation. The potential energy $E_p$ is given by the equation:

$$
E_p = \frac{1}{2} \rho g \sigma^2
$$

For irregular waves, the required wave height is the root-mean-square wave height $H_{rms} \approx \sqrt{8} \sigma$, with $\sigma$ the standard deviation of the free-surface elevation. The potential energy is $E_p = \frac{1}{2} \rho g \sigma^2$ and $E_w \approx \rho g \sigma^2$.

The distribution of the undertow velocity over the water depth is a topic of ongoing research. However, it is known that the undertow velocity is influenced by the wave energy flux. The undertow velocity $\bar{u}$ is given by the equation:

$$
\bar{u} = \frac{1}{2} \rho g \sigma^2
$$

where $\rho$ is the fluid density, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the free-surface elevation. The positive flow direction of $\bar{u}$ is in the wave propagation direction.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of wave energy flux and its implications for ship design and offshore energy systems.

#### 4.3b Measurement of Wave Energy Flux

The measurement of wave energy flux is a critical aspect of understanding and predicting the behavior of ocean waves. It involves the use of various instruments and techniques, including wave radar, microwave rangefinders, and marine navigation radars.

##### Wave Radar

Wave radar, a type of radar technology, is used to measure waves and water level, including tides. The Miros SM-094, for instance, is a wave radar designed for this purpose. It is used as an air gap (bridge clearance) sensor in NOAA's PORTS system. The WaveRadar REX, on the other hand, is a derivative of a Rosemount tank radar.

The operation of wave radar involves the use of a microwave beam that is directed into the water column. The reflected signal is then analyzed to determine the wave height and direction. This information can be used to calculate the wave energy flux.

##### Microwave Rangefinders

Microwave rangefinders, operating in the vertical mode at GHz frequencies, are another tool for measuring wave energy flux. These instruments are not as affected by fog and water spray as laser rangefinders. They use a continuous wave frequency modulated (CWFM) or pulsed radar waveform to provide range resolution.

The linear size of the footprint of a microwave rangefinder is directly proportional to range, while the area of the footprint is proportional to the square of range. This allows for the calculation of the wave energy flux.

##### Marine Navigation Radars

Marine navigation radars, operating in low grazing angle mode, provide sea clutter images that contain a pattern resembling a sea wave pattern. By digitizing the radar video signal and processing it with a digital computer, sea surface parameters can be calculated. These parameters can then be used to calculate the wave energy flux.

In conclusion, the measurement of wave energy flux is a complex process that involves the use of various instruments and techniques. These measurements are crucial for understanding and predicting the behavior of ocean waves, and are essential for the design and operation of ships and offshore energy systems.

#### 4.3c Effects of Wave Energy Flux on Wave Dynamics

The wave energy flux plays a crucial role in the dynamics of ocean waves. It is the rate at which wave energy is transferred across a given area. The effects of wave energy flux on wave dynamics are multifaceted and complex, involving interactions with the ocean floor, the atmosphere, and other waves.

##### Interaction with the Ocean Floor

The interaction of waves with the ocean floor is a key factor in wave dynamics. When waves break on the ocean floor, they transfer energy to the floor, which can cause changes in the wave's direction and intensity. This interaction is particularly important in shallow water, where the wave's wavelength is comparable to or smaller than the water depth.

The wave energy flux can be used to calculate the rate of energy transfer to the ocean floor. This can be done using the wave energy density, which is the amount of wave energy per unit area. The wave energy flux is then given by the product of the wave energy density and the wave's propagation speed.

##### Interaction with the Atmosphere

The interaction of waves with the atmosphere is another important aspect of wave dynamics. This interaction can lead to the generation of new waves, the transfer of energy between different waves, and the dissipation of wave energy.

The wave energy flux can be used to calculate the rate of energy transfer to the atmosphere. This can be done using the wave energy density and the wave's propagation speed, similar to the calculation for the ocean floor.

##### Interaction with Other Waves

Waves can also interact with each other, leading to phenomena such as wave interference and wave breaking. These interactions can be influenced by the wave energy flux.

The wave energy flux can be used to calculate the rate of energy transfer between waves. This can be done using the wave energy density and the wave's propagation speed, similar to the calculations for the ocean floor and the atmosphere.

In conclusion, the wave energy flux plays a crucial role in the dynamics of ocean waves. It is involved in the interaction of waves with the ocean floor, the atmosphere, and other waves. Understanding the effects of wave energy flux on wave dynamics is essential for predicting and managing the behavior of ocean waves.

# Cauchy momentum equation

## Differential derivation

Let us start with the generalized momentum conservation principle which can be written as follows: "The change in system momentum is proportional to the resulting force acting on this system". It is expressed by the formula:

<math display="block">\vec p(t+\Delta t) - \vec p(t) = \Delta t \vec\bar F</math>

where <math>\vec p(t)</math> is momentum in time `t`, <math>\vec\bar F</math> is force averaged over <math>\Delta t</math>. After dividing by <math>\Delta t</math> and passing to the limit <math>\Delta t \to 0</math> we get (derivative):

<math display="block">\frac{d\vec p}{dt} = \vec F</math>

Let us analyse each side of the equation above.

### Right side

We split the forces into body forces <math>\vec F_m</math> and surface forces <math>\vec F_p</math>

<math display="block">\vec F=\vec F_p + \vec F_m</math>

Surface forces act on walls of the cubic fluid element. For each wall, the "X" component of these forces was marked in the figure with a cubic element (in the form of a product of stress and surface area e.g. <math>-\sigma_{xx} \, dy \, dz</math> with units <math display="inline">\mathrm{Pa\cdot m\cdot m = \frac{N}{m^2} \cdot m^2 = N}</math>).

Adding forces (their "X" components) acting on each of the cube walls, we get:

<math display="block">F_p^x =
\left(\sigma_{xx}+\frac{\partial\sigma_{xx}}{\partial x}dx\right)dy\,dz
-\sigma_{xx}dy\,dz
+\left(\sigma_{yx}+\frac{\partial\sigma_{yx}}{\partial y}dy\right)dx\,dz
-\sigma_{yx}dx\,dz
+\left(\sigma_{zx}+\frac{\partial\sigma_{zx}}{\partial z}dz\right)dx\,dy
-\sigma_{zx}dx\,dy
</math>

After ordering <math>F_p^x</math> and performing similar reasoning for components <math>F_p^y, F_p^z</math> (they have not been shown in the figure, but these would be vectors parallel to the Y and Z axes, respectively) we get:

F_p^x &= \frac{\partial\sigma_{xx}}{\partial x}\,dx\,dy\,dz
+ \frac{\partial\sigma_{yx}}{\partial y}\,dy\,dx\,dz
+ \frac{\partial\sigma_{zx}}{\partial z}\,dz\,dx\,dy
\\[0.8em]
F_p^y &= \frac{\partial\sigma_{xy}}{\partial x}\,dx\,dy\,dz
+ \frac{\partial\sigma_{yy}}{\partial y}\,dy\,dx\,dz
+ \frac{\partial\sigma_{zy}}{\partial z}\,dz\,dx\,dy
\\[0.8em]
F_p^z &= \frac{\partial\sigma_{xz}}{\partial x}\,dx\,dy\,dz
+ \frac{\partial\sigma_{yz}}{\partial y}\,dy\,dx\,dz
+ \frac{\partial\sigma_{zz}}{\partial z}\,dz\,dx\,dy
</math>

The left side of the equation is the change in momentum, which can be expressed as:

<math display="block">\frac{d\vec p}{dt} = \vec F</math>

This equation represents the principle of momentum conservation for waves. It states that the change in momentum of a system is equal to the resultant force acting on the system. This principle is fundamental to understanding the interaction of waves with ships and offshore energy systems.

#### 5.2a Definition of Wave Momentum Density

Wave momentum density is a fundamental concept in the study of ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. It is defined as the rate of change of momentum of a fluid element as it moves through a control volume. In the context of ocean waves, the momentum density is a measure of the force exerted by the wave on a structure.

The momentum density of a wave is a vector quantity, with components in the x, y, and z directions. The x and y components represent the horizontal momentum density, while the z component represents the vertical momentum density. The horizontal momentum density is further divided into two components: the mean momentum density and the oscillatory momentum density.

The mean momentum density, denoted as $M_{m}$, is the average momentum density over a wave cycle. It is a measure of the average force exerted by the wave on a structure. The oscillatory momentum density, denoted as $M_{o}$, is the variation in momentum density over a wave cycle. It is a measure of the fluctuating force exerted by the wave on a structure.

The total momentum density, $M$, is the sum of the mean and oscillatory momentum densities. It is a measure of the total force exerted by the wave on a structure. The total momentum density can be expressed as:

$$
M = M_{m} + M_{o}
$$

The momentum density is a crucial concept in the study of wave-structure interaction. It provides a quantitative measure of the forces exerted by waves on a structure, which is essential for the design and analysis of ships and offshore energy systems. By understanding the momentum density, engineers and researchers can predict the forces exerted by waves on a structure and design structures that can withstand these forces.

## Chapter: Wave Momentum Dissipation

### Introduction

The study of wave momentum dissipation is a critical aspect of understanding the interaction of waves with ships and offshore energy systems. This chapter will delve into the fundamental principles and mechanisms that govern the dissipation of wave momentum. 

Wave momentum dissipation refers to the process by which the momentum of a wave is converted into other forms of energy, such as heat or turbulence, as the wave propagates through a medium. This process is crucial in the context of ocean engineering, as it influences the design and operation of ships and offshore energy systems. 

The chapter will explore the mathematical models that describe wave momentum dissipation, including the wave momentum dissipation function and the wave momentum dissipation rate. These models will be presented in a clear and accessible manner, using the popular Markdown format and the MathJax library for rendering mathematical expressions. 

The chapter will also discuss the practical implications of wave momentum dissipation, including its effects on wave propagation and its role in the design of ships and offshore energy systems. Real-world examples and case studies will be used to illustrate these concepts, providing a comprehensive understanding of wave momentum dissipation in the context of ocean engineering.

#### 5.2b Measurement of Wave Momentum Density

The measurement of wave momentum density is a critical aspect of understanding wave-structure interaction. It involves the use of various instruments and techniques to measure the momentum density of waves. One such instrument is the Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) buoy system.

The DART buoy system is made up of three parts: a bottom pressure recorder (BPR), a moored surface buoy, and a data transmission link between the two. The BPR, anchored to the bottom of the sea floor, measures the pressure of the surrounding sea water. The moored surface buoy, connected to the BPR via an acoustic transmission link, sends this data to the surface by radio. The data is then transmitted to satellites and ground stations for further processing.

The data sent from the BPR to the surface buoy consists of the temperature and pressure of the surrounding sea water. This data is used to calculate the height of the waves surrounding the buoy. The temperature of the surrounding sea water is important because it affects the water's density, thus the pressure, and therefore the sea temperature is required to accurately measure the height of the ocean swells.

The DART buoy system provides a high-resolution measurement of the pressure of the surrounding sea water, which can be used to calculate the momentum density of the waves. The system is designed to retrieve and release data every 15 seconds to get an average reading of the current weather conditions. This allows for a very stable, long lived, very high resolution pressure sensor, which is a critical enabling technology for the DART system.

The DART buoy system is an example of a sophisticated instrument used to measure wave momentum density. Other techniques, such as wave tank experiments and numerical simulations, can also be used to measure wave momentum density. These techniques allow for a more detailed analysis of the wave momentum density, including its components in the x, y, and z directions, and its variation over a wave cycle.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the calculation of wave momentum density, including the factors that influence it and how it can be calculated from the data collected by the DART buoy system and other instruments.

#### 5.2c Wave Momentum Density in Ships and Offshore Energy Systems

The wave momentum density plays a crucial role in the design and operation of ships and offshore energy systems. It is a key factor in determining the forces exerted by waves on these systems, which can significantly impact their performance and safety.

In the context of ships, the wave momentum density is particularly important in the design of hulls and propulsion systems. The hull of a ship is designed to withstand the forces exerted by waves, and the wave momentum density is a key factor in determining these forces. Similarly, the propulsion system of a ship must be able to overcome the wave momentum density to move the ship through the water.

In offshore energy systems, the wave momentum density is a critical factor in the design of foundations and mooring systems. The foundations of these systems must be able to withstand the forces exerted by waves, and the wave momentum density is a key factor in determining these forces. Similarly, the mooring systems of these systems must be able to withstand the forces exerted by waves, and the wave momentum density is a key factor in determining these forces.

The wave momentum density can be calculated from the data collected by the DART buoy system and other instruments. This allows for a detailed analysis of the wave momentum density, including its components in the x, y, and z directions, and its variation over a wave cycle. This information can then be used to design and optimize ships and offshore energy systems for maximum performance and safety.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the calculation of wave momentum density, including the factors that influence it and how it can be calculated from the data collected by the DART buoy system and other instruments.




#### 5.2c Effects of Wave Momentum Density on Wave Dynamics

The wave momentum density plays a crucial role in the dynamics of ocean waves. It is a measure of the momentum of the wave per unit area, and it is a key factor in determining the wave's propagation and interaction with structures. In this section, we will explore the effects of wave momentum density on wave dynamics.

#### 5.2c.1 Wave Propagation

The wave momentum density is directly related to the wave's propagation. As a wave propagates, it carries a certain amount of momentum with it. This momentum is represented by the wave momentum density. The higher the wave momentum density, the more momentum the wave carries, and the faster it can propagate.

The wave momentum density is also related to the wave's energy. The wave's energy is proportional to the square of its momentum density. This relationship is known as the wave energy density relationship. It is given by the equation:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} \rho g \left( \frac{H}{2} \right)^2
$$

where $E$ is the wave energy density, $\rho$ is the density of the water, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $H$ is the wave height.

#### 5.2c.2 Wave Interaction with Structures

The wave momentum density also plays a crucial role in the interaction of waves with structures. When a wave interacts with a structure, it can cause the structure to move. This movement is a result of the wave's momentum being transferred to the structure. The amount of momentum transferred is determined by the wave momentum density.

The wave momentum density is also related to the wave's force on a structure. The wave's force on a structure is proportional to the wave momentum density. This relationship is known as the wave force relationship. It is given by the equation:

$$
F = \rho g \frac{H}{2} \frac{dA}{dx}
$$

where $F$ is the wave force, $\rho$ is the density of the water, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $H$ is the wave height, $dA/dx$ is the change in wave area with respect to distance.

#### 5.2c.3 Wave Breaking

The wave momentum density can also affect the breaking of waves. When a wave breaks, it loses its momentum and energy. The amount of momentum and energy lost is determined by the wave momentum density. The higher the wave momentum density, the more momentum and energy the wave can lose before breaking.

In conclusion, the wave momentum density plays a crucial role in the dynamics of ocean waves. It affects the wave's propagation, interaction with structures, and breaking. Understanding the effects of wave momentum density on wave dynamics is essential for predicting and mitigating the impact of waves on structures and the environment.




#### 5.3a Definition of Wave Momentum Flux

The wave momentum flux is a fundamental concept in the study of ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. It is defined as the rate of change of wave momentum with respect to the wave's direction of propagation. In other words, it is the force exerted by the wave on a unit area perpendicular to its direction of propagation.

The wave momentum flux, denoted as $F$, is given by the equation:

$$
F = \rho g \frac{H}{2} \frac{dA}{dx}
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the water, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $H$ is the wave height, $dA/dx$ is the change in wave area with respect to the wave's direction of propagation.

The wave momentum flux is a vector quantity, with both magnitude and direction. Its magnitude represents the force exerted by the wave, while its direction is perpendicular to the wave's direction of propagation.

The wave momentum flux plays a crucial role in the dynamics of ocean waves. It is responsible for the wave's propagation, as it is the force that drives the wave forward. It also plays a key role in the wave's interaction with structures, as it is the force that causes the structure to move when it interacts with the wave.

In the next sections, we will explore the effects of wave momentum flux on wave dynamics and its role in wave interaction with structures in more detail.

#### 5.3b Calculation of Wave Momentum Flux

The calculation of wave momentum flux involves the use of the wave momentum flux equation, which is given by:

$$
F = \rho g \frac{H}{2} \frac{dA}{dx}
$$

This equation can be used to calculate the wave momentum flux for a given wave, provided that the wave's density, height, and change in area with respect to its direction of propagation are known.

The density of the water, $\rho$, can be measured directly using a density meter. Alternatively, it can be calculated using the equation of state for seawater, which relates the density of seawater to its salinity, temperature, and pressure.

The wave height, $H$, can be measured directly using a wave height sensor. Alternatively, it can be calculated from the wave's spectral density, which is the power spectrum of the wave's amplitude.

The change in wave area with respect to its direction of propagation, $dA/dx$, can be calculated from the wave's spectral density. This involves integrating the spectral density over the wave's direction of propagation.

Once the wave momentum flux, $F$, has been calculated, it can be used to determine the wave's force on a structure. This is done by multiplying the wave momentum flux by the area of the structure perpendicular to the wave's direction of propagation.

In the next section, we will explore the effects of wave momentum flux on wave dynamics and its role in wave interaction with structures in more detail.

#### 5.3c Wave Momentum Flux in Wave Interaction

The wave momentum flux plays a crucial role in the interaction between waves and structures. As we have seen in the previous section, the wave momentum flux, $F$, is given by:

$$
F = \rho g \frac{H}{2} \frac{dA}{dx}
$$

This equation can be used to calculate the wave's force on a structure, which is given by the product of the wave momentum flux and the area of the structure perpendicular to the wave's direction of propagation.

The wave momentum flux is responsible for the transfer of momentum from the wave to the structure. This transfer of momentum can cause the structure to move, which can have significant implications for the design and operation of offshore energy systems.

For example, in the case of a wave hitting a ship, the wave momentum flux can cause the ship to move. This movement can be calculated using the equation of motion for a ship in waves, which is given by:

$$
F = m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}
$$

where $F$ is the wave momentum flux, $m$ is the mass of the ship, and $\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$ is the acceleration of the ship.

By combining these equations, we can determine the acceleration of the ship due to the wave momentum flux. This can be used to calculate the ship's displacement, which is the distance the ship moves due to the wave.

In the next section, we will explore the effects of wave momentum flux on wave dynamics and its role in wave interaction with structures in more detail.




#### 5.3b Measurement of Wave Momentum Flux

The measurement of wave momentum flux is a crucial aspect of studying ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. It involves the use of various instruments and techniques to measure the wave's density, height, and change in area with respect to its direction of propagation.

One of the most commonly used instruments for measuring wave momentum flux is the scatterometer. A scatterometer, such as the QuikSCAT, emits pulses of low-power microwave radiation and measures the power reflected back to its receiving antenna from the wind-roughened sea surface. The backscatter measurements are obtained at fixed incidence angles of 46° and 54°, providing up to four views of each region of the surface at different incidence angles.

The QuikSCAT measurements are processed to yield a spatial resolution of about 25 km. A higher spatial resolution of 12.5 km is also achieved through special processing, but with significantly more measurement noise. An even higher spatial resolution of 5 km is produced, but only for limited regions and special cases.

The σ<sub>0</sub> observations from the QuikSCAT are calibrated to the wind speed and direction of the wind at a reference height of 10 meters above the sea surface. This calibration allows for the calculation of the wave momentum flux using the wave momentum flux equation:

$$
F = \rho g \frac{H}{2} \frac{dA}{dx}
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the water, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $H$ is the wave height, and $dA/dx$ is the change in wave area with respect to its direction of propagation.

In addition to scatterometers, other instruments such as wave radar and wave buoys can also be used to measure wave momentum flux. These instruments use different principles and techniques, but all of them rely on the measurement of the wave's density, height, and change in area with respect to its direction of propagation.

In the next section, we will discuss the effects of wave momentum flux on wave dynamics and its role in wave interaction with structures.

#### 5.3c Wave Momentum Flux in Ships and Offshore Energy Systems

The wave momentum flux plays a significant role in the design and operation of ships and offshore energy systems. It is a key factor in determining the forces exerted by waves on these systems, which can lead to structural failure if not properly accounted for.

In the context of ships, the wave momentum flux can be used to calculate the wave-induced forces on the ship's hull. These forces can be used to design the ship's hull to withstand the wave loads, and to predict the ship's motion in waves. The wave momentum flux can also be used to calculate the wave-induced loads on offshore energy systems, such as wind turbines and wave energy converters.

The wave momentum flux can be calculated using the wave momentum flux equation:

$$
F = \rho g \frac{H}{2} \frac{dA}{dx}
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the water, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $H$ is the wave height, and $dA/dx$ is the change in wave area with respect to its direction of propagation.

The wave momentum flux can be measured using various instruments, such as scatterometers, wave radar, and wave buoys. These instruments provide the necessary data to calculate the wave momentum flux, and can be used to validate numerical models of wave-structure interaction.

In the next section, we will discuss the effects of wave momentum flux on the design and operation of ships and offshore energy systems.




#### 5.3c Effects of Wave Momentum Flux on Wave Dynamics

The wave momentum flux plays a crucial role in the dynamics of ocean waves. It is a measure of the momentum transfer between the wave and the surrounding fluid, and it is directly related to the wave's energy and propagation characteristics.

The wave momentum flux can be expressed as:

$$
F = \rho g \frac{H}{2} \frac{dA}{dx}
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the water, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $H$ is the wave height, and $dA/dx$ is the change in wave area with respect to its direction of propagation.

The wave momentum flux has several important effects on wave dynamics. These include:

1. **Wave Propagation:** The wave momentum flux is directly related to the wave's propagation characteristics. A higher wave momentum flux indicates a stronger wave, which can propagate faster and over longer distances.

2. **Wave Energy Transfer:** The wave momentum flux is also related to the wave's energy transfer. A higher wave momentum flux indicates a greater energy transfer, which can lead to more significant wave-induced forces on ships and offshore energy systems.

3. **Wave Breaking:** The wave momentum flux can also affect wave breaking. A higher wave momentum flux can lead to more intense wave breaking, which can have significant implications for the wave's energy and propagation characteristics.

4. **Wave Interaction with Ships and Offshore Energy Systems:** The wave momentum flux plays a crucial role in the interaction between waves and ships or offshore energy systems. A higher wave momentum flux can lead to more significant wave-induced forces, which can affect the structural integrity of these systems.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical models that describe the wave momentum flux and its effects on wave dynamics.

#### 6.1a Different Types of Wavemakers

Wavemakers can be broadly classified into two types: point wavemakers and distributed wavemakers. Point wavemakers, such as the Taylor wavemaker and the Michell's theory wavemaker, are devices that generate waves from a single point. On the other hand, distributed wavemakers, such as the Taylor's theory wavemaker and the Michell's theory wavemaker, generate waves from a distributed area.

##### Point Wavemakers

Point wavemakers are devices that generate waves from a single point. They are typically used in wave testing and wave energy conversion applications. The Taylor wavemaker and the Michell's theory wavemaker are two common types of point wavemakers.

The Taylor wavemaker, named after the British physicist Geoffrey Ingram Taylor, is a type of point wavemaker that generates waves by oscillating a flat plate at its center. The wavemaker is designed to oscillate at a frequency that is twice the natural frequency of the water layer. This results in the generation of standing waves, which can be used for various applications such as wave testing and wave energy conversion.

The Michell's theory wavemaker, on the other hand, is a type of point wavemaker that generates waves by oscillating a cylindrical rod at its center. The wavemaker is designed to oscillate at a frequency that is twice the natural frequency of the water layer. This results in the generation of standing waves, similar to the Taylor wavemaker.

##### Distributed Wavemakers

Distributed wavemakers, unlike point wavemakers, generate waves from a distributed area. They are typically used in wave testing and wave energy conversion applications. The Taylor's theory wavemaker and the Michell's theory wavemaker are two common types of distributed wavemakers.

The Taylor's theory wavemaker, named after the British physicist Geoffrey Ingram Taylor, is a type of distributed wavemaker that generates waves by oscillating a flat plate at its center. The wavemaker is designed to oscillate at a frequency that is twice the natural frequency of the water layer. This results in the generation of standing waves, which can be used for various applications such as wave testing and wave energy conversion.

The Michell's theory wavemaker, on the other hand, is a type of distributed wavemaker that generates waves by oscillating a cylindrical rod at its center. The wavemaker is designed to oscillate at a frequency that is twice the natural frequency of the water layer. This results in the generation of standing waves, similar to the Taylor's theory wavemaker.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical models that describe the behavior of these wavemakers, including the equations of motion and the boundary conditions that govern their operation.




#### 6.1b Applications of Different Wavemakers

Wavemakers, due to their unique characteristics, find applications in a variety of fields. In this section, we will explore some of the key applications of different types of wavemakers.

##### Point Wavemakers

Point wavemakers, due to their ability to generate waves from a single point, find applications in wave testing and wave energy conversion. The Taylor wavemaker, for instance, is widely used in wave testing due to its ability to generate standing waves. This is particularly useful in studying the effects of waves on structures such as ships and offshore energy systems.

The Michell's theory wavemaker, on the other hand, is used in wave energy conversion. Its ability to generate waves from a single point makes it ideal for use in devices that convert wave energy into other forms of energy, such as electricity.

##### Distributed Wavemakers

Distributed wavemakers, due to their ability to generate waves from a distributed area, also find applications in wave testing and wave energy conversion. The Taylor's theory wavemaker, for instance, is used in wave testing due to its ability to generate standing waves. This is particularly useful in studying the effects of waves on structures such as ships and offshore energy systems.

The Michell's theory wavemaker, on the other hand, is used in wave energy conversion. Its ability to generate waves from a distributed area makes it ideal for use in devices that convert wave energy into other forms of energy, such as electricity.

In addition to these applications, wavemakers also find use in other fields such as sound and music computing. For instance, the Sound Blaster AWE32, a popular sound card, uses wavemakers to generate sound. The wavemakers in this case are used to convert digital signals into analog signals, which are then amplified and played through speakers.

In conclusion, wavemakers, due to their unique characteristics, find applications in a variety of fields. From wave testing and wave energy conversion to sound and music computing, wavemakers play a crucial role in many areas of study.

#### 6.1c Wavemaker Design and Analysis

The design and analysis of wavemakers is a critical aspect of understanding and predicting wave behavior. This section will delve into the principles and techniques used in the design and analysis of wavemakers.

##### Wavemaker Design

The design of a wavemaker is largely determined by its intended application. For instance, the design of a wavemaker for wave testing may differ significantly from that of a wavemaker for wave energy conversion. 

In general, the design of a wavemaker involves determining its size, shape, and the frequency at which it should oscillate. The size and shape of the wavemaker are typically determined by the specific requirements of the application, while the oscillation frequency is determined by the natural frequency of the water layer.

For point wavemakers, the design process often involves determining the size and shape of the oscillating element (e.g., a flat plate or a cylindrical rod). The oscillation frequency, on the other hand, is typically determined by the natural frequency of the water layer.

For distributed wavemakers, the design process often involves determining the size and shape of the oscillating area. The oscillation frequency, on the other hand, is typically determined by the natural frequency of the water layer.

##### Wavemaker Analysis

The analysis of a wavemaker involves studying its performance under various conditions. This typically involves studying the wavemaker's ability to generate waves of a specific frequency and amplitude.

For point wavemakers, the analysis often involves studying the wavemaker's ability to generate standing waves. This is typically done by studying the wavemaker's response to different oscillation frequencies.

For distributed wavemakers, the analysis often involves studying the wavemaker's ability to generate traveling waves. This is typically done by studying the wavemaker's response to different oscillation frequencies and wave directions.

In addition to studying the wavemaker's ability to generate waves, the analysis also involves studying the wavemaker's ability to maintain its performance under various conditions. This is typically done by studying the wavemaker's response to changes in the water layer's properties (e.g., density and viscosity) and the wavemaker's environment (e.g., wind and current).

In conclusion, the design and analysis of wavemakers is a critical aspect of understanding and predicting wave behavior. By understanding the principles and techniques used in the design and analysis of wavemakers, we can design more effective wavemakers and predict wave behavior more accurately.




#### 6.1c Selection Criteria for Wavemakers

The selection of a wavemaker is a critical step in the design and testing of ships and offshore energy systems. The choice of wavemaker can significantly impact the accuracy and reliability of the results obtained. Therefore, it is essential to understand the key criteria that guide the selection of wavemakers.

##### Wavemaker Type

The first criterion in the selection of a wavemaker is the type of wavemaker. As discussed in the previous sections, there are two main types of wavemakers: point wavemakers and distributed wavemakers. The choice between these two types depends on the specific requirements of the application. Point wavemakers, due to their ability to generate waves from a single point, are often used in wave testing and wave energy conversion. On the other hand, distributed wavemakers, due to their ability to generate waves from a distributed area, are used in wave testing and wave energy conversion.

##### Wavemaker Size and Power

The size and power of the wavemaker are also important criteria in its selection. The size of the wavemaker is determined by the size of the structure being tested or the size of the energy system. The power of the wavemaker, on the other hand, is determined by the required wave amplitude and the frequency of the waves. The power of the wavemaker can be calculated using the formula:

$$
P = \frac{1}{2} \rho g A \omega^2
$$

where $P$ is the power, $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $A$ is the area of the wavemaker, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the waves.

##### Wavemaker Control System

The control system of the wavemaker is another important criterion in its selection. The control system determines how the wavemaker is controlled and how it responds to changes in the system being tested. The control system can be manual, where the wavemaker is controlled manually by an operator, or automatic, where the wavemaker is controlled by a computer system. The choice between these two options depends on the complexity of the system being tested and the level of control required.

##### Wavemaker Cost

Finally, the cost of the wavemaker is a significant criterion in its selection. The cost of a wavemaker can vary significantly depending on the type of wavemaker, its size, and its control system. Therefore, it is essential to consider the cost of the wavemaker in the overall budget of the project.

In conclusion, the selection of a wavemaker is a complex process that requires careful consideration of various criteria. By understanding these criteria and their implications, engineers can make informed decisions about the selection of wavemakers for their specific applications.




#### 6.2a Definition of Linear Wavemaker Theory

Linear wavemaker theory is a mathematical model used to describe the generation of waves by a wavemaker. This theory is based on the principles of linear wave propagation and assumes that the waves are small and that the wavemaker is much larger than the wavelength of the waves. 

The theory is based on the assumption that the wavemaker is a point source of waves. This means that the wavemaker is assumed to be a small point in space from which waves radiate out in all directions. This assumption is often valid for small wavemakers, but it may not be valid for larger wavemakers where the size of the wavemaker becomes comparable to the wavelength of the waves.

The linear wavemaker theory is based on the linear wave equation, which describes the propagation of small waves in a fluid. The wave equation is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave elevation, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the wave speed.

The wavemaker is represented by a force term $F(x)$ in the wave equation. This force term is responsible for generating the waves. The force term is often assumed to be a delta function, which represents a point source of waves. The delta function is given by:

$$
F(x) = \delta(x)
$$

where $\delta(x)$ is the Dirac delta function.

The linear wavemaker theory is a powerful tool for understanding the generation of waves by a wavemaker. However, it is important to note that this theory is based on several assumptions, and it may not be valid for all types of wavemakers and all types of waves. Therefore, it is important to understand the limitations of this theory when applying it to real-world problems.

#### 6.2b Assumptions of Linear Wavemaker Theory

The linear wavemaker theory, while powerful, is based on several assumptions that limit its applicability. These assumptions are necessary to simplify the mathematical model and make it tractable, but they also mean that the theory may not accurately describe the behavior of all types of wavemakers and waves.

1. **Point Source Assumption**: As mentioned earlier, the linear wavemaker theory assumes that the wavemaker is a point source of waves. This assumption is valid for small wavemakers, but it may not be valid for larger wavemakers where the size of the wavemaker becomes comparable to the wavelength of the waves. This assumption is often violated in practical applications, where wavemakers can be large and complex structures.

2. **Small Wave Assumption**: The theory assumes that the waves are small. This means that the wave amplitude is much smaller than the wavelength of the waves. This assumption is necessary to linearize the wave equation and make it tractable. However, it may not be valid for large waves or for waves with large amplitudes.

3. **Linear Wave Propagation Assumption**: The theory is based on the linear wave equation, which assumes that the waves are small and that the wavemaker is much larger than the wavelength of the waves. This assumption breaks down when the waves become large or when the wavemaker becomes comparable to the wavelength of the waves.

4. **Delta Function Force Term Assumption**: The force term $F(x)$ in the wave equation is often assumed to be a delta function, which represents a point source of waves. This assumption is necessary to simplify the mathematical model, but it may not accurately describe the behavior of real-world wavemakers.

Despite these assumptions, the linear wavemaker theory is a valuable tool for understanding the generation of waves by a wavemaker. It provides a mathematical framework for analyzing the behavior of wavemakers and for predicting the propagation of waves. However, it is important to understand the limitations of this theory and to use it appropriately.

#### 6.2c Applications of Linear Wavemaker Theory

The linear wavemaker theory, despite its limitations, has found wide applications in the field of ocean engineering. Its simplicity and tractability make it a valuable tool for understanding and predicting the behavior of waves and wavemakers. Here are some of the key applications of linear wavemaker theory:

1. **Wave Generation Studies**: The linear wavemaker theory is extensively used in studies related to wave generation. It provides a mathematical framework for understanding how waves are generated by a wavemaker. This is crucial in the design and testing of wavemakers for various applications, such as wave energy conversion and wave testing of ships and offshore energy systems.

2. **Wave Propagation Studies**: The theory is also used in studies related to wave propagation. It helps in understanding how waves propagate from a wavemaker into the surrounding fluid. This is important in predicting the behavior of waves in the ocean and in designing structures that can withstand wave forces.

3. **Wave Interaction Studies**: The linear wavemaker theory is used in studies related to wave interaction. It helps in understanding how waves interact with a wavemaker and how this interaction affects the propagation of waves. This is crucial in the design of wave energy conversion systems and in the study of wave-structure interaction in offshore energy systems.

4. **Numerical Modeling**: The theory is used in numerical modeling of wave propagation. It provides a mathematical model that can be discretized and solved numerically. This is important in the development of numerical models for wave propagation and wave-structure interaction.

Despite its limitations, the linear wavemaker theory remains a fundamental tool in the field of ocean engineering. Its simplicity and tractability make it a valuable tool for understanding and predicting the behavior of waves and wavemakers. However, it is important to understand the limitations of this theory and to use it appropriately.




#### 6.2b Linear Wavemaker Equations

The linear wavemaker theory is based on the linear wave equation, which describes the propagation of small waves in a fluid. The wave equation is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave elevation, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the wave speed.

The wavemaker is represented by a force term $F(x)$ in the wave equation. This force term is responsible for generating the waves. The force term is often assumed to be a delta function, which represents a point source of waves. The delta function is given by:

$$
F(x) = \delta(x)
$$

where $\delta(x)$ is the Dirac delta function.

The linear wavemaker equations are derived from the wave equation by incorporating the force term $F(x)$. The resulting equations are:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x^2} + F(x)
$$

These equations describe the propagation of waves in a fluid with a wavemaker present. The wavemaker generates waves that propagate away from the source, and the wave equation describes how these waves evolve over time.

The linear wavemaker equations are a powerful tool for understanding the generation of waves by a wavemaker. However, they are based on several assumptions, including the assumption that the waves are small and that the wavemaker is much larger than the wavelength of the waves. These assumptions may not be valid for all types of wavemakers and all types of waves, and therefore the linear wavemaker equations may not be applicable in all situations.

#### 6.2c Applications of Linear Wavemaker Theory

The linear wavemaker theory has a wide range of applications in the field of ocean engineering. It is used to study the generation of waves by various types of wavemakers, including prismatic pulse compressors and other devices. The theory is also used to design and optimize these wavemakers for specific applications.

One of the key applications of linear wavemaker theory is in the design of prismatic pulse compressors. These devices are used to generate short, high-intensity pulses of light, which are essential in many areas of science and technology, including laser micromachining and medical treatments. The linear wavemaker theory provides a mathematical framework for understanding the generation of these pulses and for optimizing the design of the prismatic pulse compressor.

The linear wavemaker theory is also used in the study of wave propagation in the ocean. The theory is used to understand how waves are generated by various types of wavemakers and how these waves propagate away from the source. This is crucial for many areas of ocean engineering, including the design of offshore structures and the prediction of wave-induced loads on these structures.

The linear wavemaker theory is based on the linear wave equation, which describes the propagation of small waves in a fluid. The wave equation is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x^2} + F(x)
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave elevation, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the wave speed. The wavemaker is represented by a force term $F(x)$ in the wave equation. This force term is responsible for generating the waves. The force term is often assumed to be a delta function, which represents a point source of waves. The delta function is given by:

$$
F(x) = \delta(x)
$$

where $\delta(x)$ is the Dirac delta function.

The linear wavemaker equations are derived from the wave equation by incorporating the force term $F(x)$. The resulting equations are:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x^2} + F(x)
$$

These equations describe the propagation of waves in a fluid with a wavemaker present. The wavemaker generates waves that propagate away from the source, and the wave equation describes how these waves evolve over time.

In the next section, we will discuss the nonlinear wavemaker theory, which is used to study the generation of waves by nonlinear wavemakers.




#### 6.2c Applications of Linear Wavemaker Theory

The linear wavemaker theory is not only used for the design and optimization of wavemakers, but also has applications in other areas of ocean engineering. One such application is in the design of offshore energy systems.

Offshore energy systems, such as wind turbines and wave energy converters, often require the generation of waves for testing and validation purposes. The linear wavemaker theory provides a mathematical framework for understanding the generation of these waves, and can be used to design and optimize wavemakers for these applications.

For example, the linear wavemaker theory can be used to design a wavemaker that generates waves with a specific frequency and amplitude. This is particularly useful for testing offshore energy systems, as it allows for the simulation of real-world conditions in a controlled environment.

Furthermore, the linear wavemaker theory can also be used to study the interaction between waves and offshore energy systems. By understanding how waves interact with a wavemaker, we can gain insights into how they will interact with an offshore energy system. This can help in the design and optimization of these systems, as well as in the prediction of their performance in the ocean.

In conclusion, the linear wavemaker theory has a wide range of applications in the field of ocean engineering. From the design and optimization of wavemakers, to the testing and validation of offshore energy systems, this theory provides a powerful tool for understanding and manipulating waves in the ocean.




#### 6.3a Definition of Nonlinear Wavemaker Theory

Nonlinear wavemaker theory is a branch of wavemaker theory that deals with the generation of waves in a nonlinear regime. Unlike linear wavemaker theory, which assumes that the wavemaker and the fluid it is interacting with are linearly related, nonlinear wavemaker theory takes into account the nonlinearities present in the system.

The nonlinear wavemaker theory is particularly useful in the study of ocean waves, as it allows for a more accurate representation of the physical phenomena. In the ocean, waves often interact with ships and offshore energy systems in a nonlinear manner, and understanding this interaction is crucial for the design and optimization of these systems.

The mathematical representation of nonlinear wavemaker theory is more complex than its linear counterpart. The wavemaker is represented by a nonlinear function $F$, and the output of the wavemaker is given by the equation:

$$
v_{\mathsf{out}} = F(v_{\mathsf{in}})
$$

where $v_{\mathsf{in}}$ is the input signal and $v_{\mathsf{out}}$ is the output signal. The nonlinear function $F$ can be expanded in a power series (MacLaurin series):

$$
F(v_{\mathsf{in}}) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} \left(\frac{d^n F}{dv_{\mathsf{in}}^n}\right)_{v_{\mathsf{in}}=0} v_{\mathsf{in}}^n
$$

The higher order terms above are indicated by an ellipsis ($\cdots$) and only the first terms are shown. Applying the two sine waves at frequencies $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ to this device:

$$
v_{\mathsf{out}} = {} & \alpha_1 \Bigl( A_1 \cos(\omega_1 t) + A_2 \cos(\omega_2 t) \Bigr) \\
& {} + \alpha_2 \Bigl( \tfrac{1}{2} A_1^2 [ 1 + \cos(2 \omega_1 t) ] + A_1 A_2 [\cos(\omega_1 t - \omega_2 t ) + \cos (\omega_1 t + \omega_2 t) ] + \tfrac{1}{2} A_2^2 [ 1 + \cos(2 \omega_2 t) ] \Bigr) + \cdots
$$

Which leaves the two heterodyne frequencies as two among the many terms:

$$
v_{\mathsf{out}} = {} & \alpha_1 \Bigl( A_1 \cos(\omega_1 t) + A_2 \cos(\omega_2 t) \Bigr) \\
& {} + \alpha_2 \Bigl( \tfrac{1}{2} A_1^2 [ 1 + \cos(2 \omega_1 t) ] + A_1 A_2 [\cos(\omega_1 t - \omega_2 t ) + \cos (\omega_1 t + \omega_2 t) ] + \tfrac{1}{2} A_2^2 [ 1 + \cos(2 \omega_2 t) ] \Bigr) + \cdots
$$

The nonlinear wavemaker theory is particularly useful in the study of ocean waves, as it allows for a more accurate representation of the physical phenomena. In the ocean, waves often interact with ships and offshore energy systems in a nonlinear manner, and understanding this interaction is crucial for the design and optimization of these systems.

#### 6.3b Nonlinear Wavemaker Theory in Wave Generation

The nonlinear wavemaker theory is particularly useful in the generation of waves. The nonlinearities present in the system allow for a more accurate representation of the physical phenomena, which is crucial for the design and optimization of ships and offshore energy systems.

The generation of waves in a nonlinear regime can be represented by the following equation:

$$
v_{\mathsf{out}} = F(v_{\mathsf{in}})
$$

where $v_{\mathsf{in}}$ is the input signal and $v_{\mathsf{out}}$ is the output signal. The nonlinear function $F$ can be expanded in a power series (MacLaurin series):

$$
F(v_{\mathsf{in}}) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} \left(\frac{d^n F}{dv_{\mathsf{in}}^n}\right)_{v_{\mathsf{in}}=0} v_{\mathsf{in}}^n
$$

The higher order terms above are indicated by an ellipsis ($\cdots$) and only the first terms are shown. Applying the two sine waves at frequencies $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ to this device:

$$
v_{\mathsf{out}} = {} & \alpha_1 \Bigl( A_1 \cos(\omega_1 t) + A_2 \cos(\omega_2 t) \Bigr) \\
& {} + \alpha_2 \Bigl( \tfrac{1}{2} A_1^2 [ 1 + \cos(2 \omega_1 t) ] + A_1 A_2 [\cos(\omega_1 t - \omega_2 t ) + \cos (\omega_1 t + \omega_2 t) ] + \tfrac{1}{2} A_2^2 [ 1 + \cos(2 \omega_2 t) ] \Bigr) + \cdots
$$

#### 6.4a Definition of Wavemaker Efficiency

Wavemaker efficiency is a critical concept in the study of ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. It is defined as the ratio of the power output of a wavemaker to the power input, expressed as a percentage. Mathematically, it can be represented as:

$$
\eta = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}} \times 100\%
$$

where $\eta$ is the wavemaker efficiency, $P_{out}$ is the power output of the wavemaker, and $P_{in}$ is the power input to the wavemaker.

The efficiency of a wavemaker is a measure of its ability to convert the input power into wave energy. A wavemaker with high efficiency can generate waves with less power input, which is desirable in many applications. However, achieving high efficiency is often challenging due to the complex nature of wave generation and the various factors that can affect it.

The efficiency of a wavemaker can be influenced by several factors, including the design of the wavemaker, the properties of the fluid (such as its density and viscosity), and the operating conditions (such as the frequency and amplitude of the waves).

#### 6.4b Measurement of Wavemaker Efficiency

The measurement of wavemaker efficiency is a crucial step in understanding and optimizing the performance of wavemakers. It involves the use of specialized equipment and techniques to accurately measure the power input and output of the wavemaker.

##### Power Measurement

The power input to the wavemaker, $P_{in}$, can be measured using a power meter. A power meter is a device that measures the power of an electrical signal. It works by converting the electrical signal into a mechanical signal, which is then measured using a calibrated scale. The power meter should be connected to the wavemaker at the point of power input.

The power output of the wavemaker, $P_{out}$, can be measured using a wave energy meter. A wave energy meter is a device that measures the energy of a wave. It works by converting the wave energy into an electrical signal, which is then measured using a power meter. The wave energy meter should be placed in the wave tank at a point where the wave energy is to be measured.

##### Efficiency Calculation

Once the power input and output have been measured, the wavemaker efficiency, $\eta$, can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\eta = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}} \times 100\%
$$

This calculation gives the efficiency of the wavemaker under the specific conditions of the measurement. To obtain the overall efficiency of the wavemaker, multiple measurements should be taken under different conditions and the results averaged.

##### Factors Affecting Efficiency

The efficiency of a wavemaker can be influenced by several factors. These include the design of the wavemaker, the properties of the fluid (such as its density and viscosity), and the operating conditions (such as the frequency and amplitude of the waves). For example, a wavemaker designed for generating small-amplitude waves may have a different efficiency than the same wavemaker used for generating large-amplitude waves.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the techniques used to improve wavemaker efficiency.

#### 6.4c Improvement of Wavemaker Efficiency

The design of the wavemaker plays a significant role in its efficiency. The shape and size of the wavemaker, as well as the materials used, can affect the power output and input. For instance, a wavemaker with a larger surface area can generate more power, but it may also require more power input. Therefore, the design of the wavemaker should be optimized to balance power output and input.

##### Advanced Technologies

Advanced technologies can also be used to improve the efficiency of wavemakers. For example, the use of piezoelectric transducers can increase the efficiency of wavemakers. Piezoelectric transducers can convert electrical energy into mechanical energy more efficiently than traditional electromagnetic transducers. This can result in a higher power output for the same power input.

##### Wave Energy Recovery

Another approach to improving wavemaker efficiency is through wave energy recovery. This involves capturing the energy of the waves generated by the wavemaker and converting it back into electrical energy. This can be achieved using devices such as wave energy converters. These devices can increase the efficiency of the wavemaker by reducing the power input required to generate the waves.

##### Efficiency Enhancement Techniques

Efficiency enhancement techniques can also be used to improve the efficiency of wavemakers. These techniques involve modifying the wavemaker to reduce losses and increase power output. For example, the use of diffraction gratings can reduce the reflection of waves from the wavemaker, thereby increasing the power output. Similarly, the use of waveguides can increase the efficiency of wavemakers by focusing the waves in a specific direction.

In conclusion, improving the efficiency of wavemakers is crucial for their effective operation. This can be achieved through careful design, the use of advanced technologies, and the application of efficiency enhancement techniques.

#### 6.4c Factors Affecting Wavemaker Efficiency

The efficiency of a wavemaker is influenced by several factors, including the design of the wavemaker, the properties of the fluid, and the operating conditions. In this section, we will delve deeper into these factors and discuss how they affect the efficiency of wavemakers.

##### Wavemaker Design

The design of the wavemaker plays a crucial role in its efficiency. The design includes the shape of the wavemaker, the material used, and the method of power input. The shape of the wavemaker can affect the generation of waves, with some shapes being more efficient than others.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the complex world of coordinate systems and their role in understanding and predicting ocean wave interactions with ships and offshore energy systems. Coordinate systems are mathematical frameworks that allow us to describe and locate points in space. In the context of ocean waves, they are essential for understanding the behavior of waves as they interact with different objects in the ocean.

We will begin by discussing the basic concepts of coordinate systems, including the Cartesian coordinate system and the spherical coordinate system. We will then move on to more specialized coordinate systems, such as the geographic coordinate system and the body-fixed coordinate system. Each of these systems has its own unique properties and applications, and understanding them is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of ocean wave interactions.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of coordinate systems and their role in ocean wave interactions. You will also be able to apply this knowledge to real-world scenarios, making you a more informed and effective engineer or scientist. So let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of coordinate systems and translating.




### Subsection: 7.1a Definition of Eulerian and Lagrangian Descriptions

In the study of ocean wave interactions with ships and offshore energy systems, it is crucial to understand the concepts of Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions. These descriptions are mathematical frameworks that allow us to describe the behavior of a system over time.

#### Eulerian Description

The Eulerian description is a mathematical framework that describes the behavior of a system at a fixed point in space. In this description, the system is represented as a function of position and time. For example, the flow velocity is represented by a function $\mathbf{u}\left(\mathbf{x}, t\right)$. This description is particularly useful when studying the behavior of a system at a specific location, such as the behavior of a ship in a particular region of the ocean.

#### Lagrangian Description

On the other hand, the Lagrangian description follows individual fluid parcels through time. These parcels are labeled by some (time-independent) vector field $\mathbf{x}_0$. The position of these parcels at time $t$ is described by the function $\mathbf{X}\left(\mathbf{x}_0,t\right)$. This description is particularly useful when studying the behavior of a system as it moves through space, such as the behavior of a wave as it propagates through the ocean.

The two descriptions are related as follows:

$$
\mathbf{u}\left(\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{x}_0,t), t \right) = \frac{\partial \mathbf{X}}{\partial t} \left(\mathbf{x}_0,t \right),
$$

because both sides describe the velocity of the particle labeled $\mathbf{x}_0$ at time $t$.

Within a chosen coordinate system, $\mathbf{x}_0$ and $\mathbf{x}$ are referred to as the Lagrangian coordinates and Eulerian coordinates of the flow respectively.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical techniques involved in translating coordinates from one system to another, and how these techniques are applied in the study of ocean wave interactions.




#### 7.1b Differences Between Eulerian and Lagrangian Descriptions

The Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions are two fundamental mathematical frameworks used in the study of ocean wave interactions with ships and offshore energy systems. While both descriptions provide valuable insights into the behavior of these systems, they offer different perspectives and are particularly useful in different contexts.

#### Eulerian Description

The Eulerian description, as previously discussed, provides a snapshot of the system at a fixed point in space. This description is particularly useful when studying the behavior of a system at a specific location, such as the behavior of a ship in a particular region of the ocean. The Eulerian description is based on the position vector $\mathbf{x}$ and time $t$, and the flow velocity is represented by the function $\mathbf{u}\left(\mathbf{x}, t\right)$.

#### Lagrangian Description

On the other hand, the Lagrangian description follows individual fluid parcels through time. This description is particularly useful when studying the behavior of a system as it moves through space, such as the behavior of a wave as it propagates through the ocean. The Lagrangian description is based on the Lagrangian coordinates $\mathbf{x}_0$ and time $t$, and the position of these parcels at time $t$ is described by the function $\mathbf{X}\left(\mathbf{x}_0,t\right)$.

The two descriptions are related as follows:

$$
\mathbf{u}\left(\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{x}_0,t), t \right) = \frac{\partial \mathbf{X}}{\partial t} \left(\mathbf{x}_0,t \right),
$$

because both sides describe the velocity of the particle labeled $\mathbf{x}_0$ at time $t$.

#### Differences

The main difference between the Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions lies in their focus. The Eulerian description focuses on the behavior of the system at a fixed point in space, while the Lagrangian description focuses on the behavior of individual fluid parcels as they move through time. This difference in focus leads to different mathematical techniques and applications.

For example, the Eulerian description is often used in the study of fluid dynamics, where the behavior of the fluid at a specific point in space is of interest. On the other hand, the Lagrangian description is often used in the study of wave propagation, where the behavior of individual waves as they move through the fluid is of interest.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical techniques involved in translating coordinates from one system to another, and how these techniques are applied in the study of ocean wave interactions with ships and offshore energy systems.




#### 7.1c Applications of Eulerian and Lagrangian Descriptions in Wave Dynamics

The Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions are not only fundamental mathematical frameworks, but also powerful tools in the study of wave dynamics. They are used in a wide range of applications, from the analysis of ocean waves to the design of offshore energy systems.

#### Eulerian Description in Wave Dynamics

The Eulerian description is particularly useful in the study of wave dynamics. It allows us to analyze the behavior of waves at a fixed point in space, which is crucial for understanding phenomena such as wave reflection, refraction, and breaking. For example, the Eulerian description is used in the study of wave propagation in the ocean, where the position vector $\mathbf{x}$ represents a point in the ocean, and the flow velocity $\mathbf{u}\left(\mathbf{x}, t\right)$ represents the velocity of the water at that point.

#### Lagrangian Description in Wave Dynamics

On the other hand, the Lagrangian description is used in the study of wave propagation in the ocean. It allows us to follow individual wave packets as they move through the ocean, which is crucial for understanding phenomena such as wave dispersion and wave-wave interactions. For example, the Lagrangian description is used in the design of offshore energy systems, where the position of the system is represented by the Lagrangian coordinates $\mathbf{x}_0$ and the position of the system at time $t$ is described by the function $\mathbf{X}\left(\mathbf{x}_0,t\right)$.

#### Relationship between Eulerian and Lagrangian Descriptions

The Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions are related as follows:

$$
\mathbf{u}\left(\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{x}_0,t), t \right) = \frac{\partial \mathbf{X}}{\partial t} \left(\mathbf{x}_0,t \right),
$$

because both sides describe the velocity of the particle labeled $\mathbf{x}_0$ at time $t$. This relationship is crucial for understanding the dynamics of wave propagation in the ocean, as it allows us to relate the behavior of the system at a fixed point in space (described by the Eulerian description) to the behavior of individual wave packets (described by the Lagrangian description).

In conclusion, the Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions are powerful tools in the study of wave dynamics. They provide different perspectives on the behavior of waves, but are complementary in their applications. Understanding these descriptions is crucial for anyone studying ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.




### Section: 7.2 Translation of Coordinate Systems

In the previous section, we discussed the Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions, two fundamental mathematical frameworks used in the study of wave dynamics. These descriptions are based on the concept of coordinate systems, which provide a mathematical framework for describing the position and motion of objects in space. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of coordinate systems and discuss the translation of coordinate systems.

#### 7.2a Definition of Coordinate System Translation

A coordinate system is a system of coordinates that defines the position of a point in space. In the context of wave dynamics, we often deal with two types of coordinate systems: the Eulerian coordinate system and the Lagrangian coordinate system. 

The Eulerian coordinate system is a fixed coordinate system in which the position of a point in space is described by a position vector $\mathbf{x}$. The velocity of a point in this system is described by the flow velocity $\mathbf{u}\left(\mathbf{x}, t\right)$.

The Lagrangian coordinate system, on the other hand, is a moving coordinate system that follows the motion of a point in space. The position of a point in this system is described by the Lagrangian coordinates $\mathbf{x}_0$, and the position of the point at time $t$ is described by the function $\mathbf{X}\left(\mathbf{x}_0,t\right)$.

The translation of a coordinate system refers to the process of transforming coordinates from one system to another. In the context of wave dynamics, this is often necessary when studying the interaction of waves with ships or offshore energy systems. For example, when studying the interaction of waves with a ship, we might need to transform coordinates from the Eulerian system (which describes the position of the ship) to the Lagrangian system (which describes the position of the waves).

In the next subsection, we will discuss the mathematical techniques used to perform these translations.

#### 7.2b Techniques for Coordinate System Translation

The translation of coordinate systems is a fundamental operation in the study of wave dynamics. It allows us to describe the position and motion of objects in different coordinate systems, which is crucial for understanding the interaction of waves with ships and offshore energy systems. In this subsection, we will discuss some of the techniques used for coordinate system translation.

##### Translation of Axes

The translation of axes is a basic operation in coordinate system translation. It involves shifting the origin of a coordinate system to a new location. For an "xyz"-Cartesian coordinate system in three dimensions, suppose that a second Cartesian coordinate system is introduced, with axes "x<nowiki>'</nowiki>", "y<nowiki>'</nowiki>", and "z<nowiki>'</nowiki>" so located that the "x<nowiki>'</nowiki>" axis is parallel to the "x" axis and "h" units from it, the "y<nowiki>'</nowiki>" axis is parallel to the "y" axis and "k" units from it, and the "z<nowiki>'</nowiki>" axis is parallel to the "z" axis and "l" units from it. A point "P" in space will have coordinates in both systems. If its coordinates are ("x", "y", "z") in the original system and ("x<nowiki>'</nowiki>", "y<nowiki>'</nowiki>", "z<nowiki>'</nowiki>") in the second system, the equations

$$
x' = x - h, \qquad y' = y - k, \qquad z' = z - l
$$

define a translation of axes in three dimensions where ("h", "k", "l") are the "xyz"-coordinates of the new origin. A translation of axes in any finite number of dimensions is defined similarly.

##### Translation of Coordinate Systems

The translation of coordinate systems involves transforming coordinates from one system to another. This is often necessary when studying the interaction of waves with ships or offshore energy systems. For example, when studying the interaction of waves with a ship, we might need to transform coordinates from the Eulerian system (which describes the position of the ship) to the Lagrangian system (which describes the position of the waves).

The translation of coordinate systems can be performed using various techniques, including the use of transformation matrices, the use of vector spaces, and the use of differential equations. These techniques allow us to describe the position and motion of objects in different coordinate systems, which is crucial for understanding the interaction of waves with ships and offshore energy systems.

In the next subsection, we will delve deeper into these techniques and discuss how they are used in the study of wave dynamics.

#### 7.2c Applications of Coordinate System Translation

It allows us to describe the position and motion of objects in different coordinate systems, which is crucial for understanding the interaction of waves with ships and offshore energy systems. In this subsection, we will discuss some of the applications of coordinate system translation.

##### Translation of Coordinate Systems in Wave Dynamics

In wave dynamics, the translation of coordinate systems is often used to describe the propagation of waves. For example, consider a wave propagating in a three-dimensional space. The position of the wave at any given time can be described using a coordinate system. By translating this coordinate system, we can describe the position of the wave at any future time. This allows us to predict the future propagation of the wave.

##### Translation of Coordinate Systems in Ship Dynamics

In ship dynamics, the translation of coordinate systems is used to describe the motion of a ship. The position of the ship at any given time can be described using a coordinate system. By translating this coordinate system, we can describe the position of the ship at any future time. This allows us to predict the future motion of the ship, which is crucial for navigation and control.

##### Translation of Coordinate Systems in Offshore Energy Systems

In offshore energy systems, the translation of coordinate systems is used to describe the position and motion of energy sources and receivers. The position of an energy source or receiver at any given time can be described using a coordinate system. By translating this coordinate system, we can describe the position of the energy source or receiver at any future time. This allows us to predict the future position of the energy source or receiver, which is crucial for energy extraction and distribution.

In conclusion, the translation of coordinate systems is a fundamental operation in the study of wave dynamics. It allows us to describe the position and motion of objects in different coordinate systems, which is crucial for understanding the interaction of waves with ships and offshore energy systems.

## Chapter 8: Nonlinear Wave Interactions

### Introduction

The study of ocean waves is a complex and fascinating field, and one of the most intriguing aspects of this discipline is the nonlinear wave interactions. These interactions are fundamental to understanding the behavior of waves in the ocean, and they play a crucial role in a wide range of applications, from the design of offshore structures to the prediction of extreme weather events.

In this chapter, we will delve into the world of nonlinear wave interactions, exploring the underlying principles and theories that govern these phenomena. We will begin by introducing the basic concepts of nonlinear wave theory, including the nonlinear Schrödinger equation and the concept of wave steepness. We will then move on to discuss the various types of nonlinear wave interactions, such as wave-wave interactions, wave-current interactions, and wave-structure interactions.

We will also explore the mathematical models used to describe these interactions, including the use of Fourier series and transforms, and the application of these models to real-world problems.

It is our hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for those seeking to understand and apply the principles of nonlinear wave theory in their work.




#### 7.2b Methods for Coordinate System Translation

There are several methods for translating coordinate systems, each with its own advantages and applications. In this subsection, we will discuss two of these methods: the Gauss-Seidel method and the GeoVector method.

##### Gauss-Seidel Method

The Gauss-Seidel method is a numerical technique used for solving a system of linear equations. In the context of coordinate system translation, this method can be used to solve for the unknown coordinates of a point in a coordinate system, given the coordinates of the point in another system.

The Gauss-Seidel method is an iterative method, meaning that it requires multiple iterations to converge on a solution. The method works by solving the system of equations one variable at a time, using the values of the other variables as known quantities. This process is repeated until the values of the variables converge to a solution within a specified tolerance.

The Gauss-Seidel method can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
x_1^{(n+1)} &= \frac{1}{a_{11}} \left( b_1 - a_{12}x_2^{(n)} - \cdots - a_{1n}x_n^{(n)} \right) \\
x_2^{(n+1)} &= \frac{1}{a_{22}} \left( b_2 - a_{21}x_1^{(n+1)} - \cdots - a_{2n}x_n^{(n)} \right) \\
&\vdots \\
x_n^{(n+1)} &= \frac{1}{a_{nn}} \left( b_n - a_{n1}x_1^{(n+1)} - \cdots - a_{nn-1}x_{n-1}^{(n+1)} \right)
\end{align*}
$$

where $x_i^{(n)}$ is the $i$-th component of the $n$-th iteration, $a_{ij}$ are the coefficients of the system, and $b_i$ are the constants.

##### GeoVector Method

The GeoVector method is a vector-based approach to coordinate system translation. This method is particularly useful when dealing with large systems of equations, as it allows for the efficient representation and manipulation of coordinate systems.

The GeoVector method represents a coordinate system as a vector, with each component of the vector representing a coordinate of a point in the system. The translation of a coordinate system from one system to another can then be represented as a vector transformation.

The GeoVector method can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
\mathbf{x}_2 = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_1
$$

where $\mathbf{x}_1$ and $\mathbf{x}_2$ are the vectors representing the coordinate systems, and $\mathbf{A}$ is the transformation matrix.

In the next section, we will discuss how these methods can be applied to the translation of coordinate systems in the context of wave dynamics.

#### 7.2c Applications of Coordinate System Translation

The translation of coordinate systems is a fundamental concept in the study of wave dynamics. It is used in a variety of applications, including the analysis of wave propagation, the design of offshore energy systems, and the study of ship dynamics. In this section, we will discuss some of these applications in more detail.

##### Wave Propagation Analysis

In the analysis of wave propagation, it is often necessary to translate coordinates from one system to another. For example, consider a wave propagating in a three-dimensional medium. The wave can be described by a system of equations in Cartesian coordinates. However, it may be more convenient to describe the wave in spherical coordinates, particularly if the wave is propagating in a direction that is not aligned with the Cartesian axes.

The translation of coordinates in this case can be represented as a transformation from Cartesian coordinates to spherical coordinates. This transformation can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
x &= r\sin\theta\cos\phi \\
y &= r\sin\theta\sin\phi \\
z &= r\cos\theta
\end{align*}
$$

where $r$ is the radius, $\theta$ is the polar angle, and $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle.

##### Offshore Energy Systems

In the design of offshore energy systems, such as wind turbines or wave energy converters, it is often necessary to translate coordinates from a fixed reference frame to a moving frame that follows the motion of the system. This is particularly important in the design of systems that need to withstand large waves and currents.

The translation of coordinates in this case can be represented as a transformation from a fixed reference frame to a moving frame. This transformation can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
x' &= x - v_x t \\
y' &= y - v_y t \\
z' &= z - v_z t
\end{align*}
$$

where $v_x$, $v_y$, and $v_z$ are the velocities of the moving frame in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively, and $t$ is time.

##### Ship Dynamics

In the study of ship dynamics, it is often necessary to translate coordinates from a fixed reference frame to a moving frame that follows the motion of the ship. This is particularly important in the analysis of ship motions under wave loads.

The translation of coordinates in this case can be represented as a transformation from a fixed reference frame to a moving frame. This transformation can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
x' &= x - v_x t \\
y' &= y - v_y t \\
z' &= z - v_z t
\end{align*}
$$

where $v_x$, $v_y$, and $v_z$ are the velocities of the moving frame in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively, and $t$ is time.

In conclusion, the translation of coordinate systems is a powerful tool in the study of wave dynamics. It allows us to describe and analyze complex systems in a variety of applications.




#### 7.2c Effects of Coordinate System Translation on Wave Dynamics

The translation of coordinate systems can have significant effects on the dynamics of ocean waves. This is particularly true in the context of ship and offshore energy systems, where the translation of coordinate systems can affect the propagation and interaction of waves with these systems.

##### Effects on Wave Propagation

The translation of coordinate systems can affect the propagation of ocean waves in several ways. For instance, the translation of a coordinate system can change the direction of wave propagation, which can impact the energy transfer between different parts of the ocean. This is particularly important in the context of offshore energy systems, where the direction of wave propagation can affect the efficiency of energy extraction.

Moreover, the translation of coordinate systems can also affect the speed of wave propagation. This is because the speed of wave propagation is often dependent on the properties of the medium, such as its density and elasticity. By changing the coordinate system, we can effectively change the properties of the medium, which can in turn affect the speed of wave propagation.

##### Effects on Wave Interaction

The translation of coordinate systems can also affect the interaction of waves with ship and offshore energy systems. For instance, the translation of a coordinate system can change the location of a ship or an offshore energy system relative to a wave, which can affect the way the wave interacts with the system. This can be particularly important in the context of wave energy extraction, where the interaction of waves with offshore energy systems is a key factor.

Furthermore, the translation of coordinate systems can also affect the forces exerted by waves on ships and offshore energy systems. This is because the forces exerted by waves are often dependent on the properties of the waves, such as their amplitude and direction. By changing the coordinate system, we can effectively change the properties of the waves, which can in turn affect the forces exerted by the waves.

In conclusion, the translation of coordinate systems can have significant effects on the dynamics of ocean waves. These effects can be particularly important in the context of ship and offshore energy systems, where the translation of coordinate systems can affect the propagation and interaction of waves with these systems.

In the previous section, we discussed the effects of coordinate system translation on wave dynamics. Now, we will delve into the mathematical representation of wave equations in moving coordinate systems.

##### Liénard–Wiechert Potential

The Liénard–Wiechert potential is a solution to the nonhomogeneous electromagnetic wave equation. It is defined as:

$$
\varphi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \frac{\delta(t' - t_r)}{1 - \boldsymbol{\beta}_s \cdot (\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_s)/|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_s|}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\beta}_s = \mathbf{v}_s/c$ and $\mathbf{r}_s$ are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$, and we have used the identity $|\mathbf{x}|' = \hat{\mathbf{x}} \cdot \mathbf{v}$ with $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{x}'$. The retarded time $t_r$ is the solution of the equation $t_r = t - \frac{1}{c} |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_s(t_r)|$. The delta function picks out $t' = t_r$, and

$$
\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r}, t) = \frac{\delta(t' - t_r)}{1 - \boldsymbol{\beta}_s \cdot (\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_s)/|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_s|}
$$

##### Lorenz Gauge, Electric and Magnetic Fields

In order to calculate the derivatives of $\varphi$ and $\mathbf{A}$, it is convenient to first compute the derivatives of the retarded time. Taking the derivatives of both sides of its defining equation (remembering that $\mathbf{r_s} = \mathbf{r_s}(t_r)$):

$$
\frac{d t_r}{d t} + \frac{1}{c}\frac{d t_r}{d t}\frac{d |\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r_s}|}{d t_r}= 1
$$

Differentiating with respect to $t$,

$$
\frac{d^2 t_r}{d t^2} + \frac{1}{c}\frac{d^2 t_r}{d t^2}\frac{d |\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r_s}|}{d t_r}= 0
$$

Differentiating again with respect to $t$,

$$
\frac{d^3 t_r}{d t^3} + \frac{1}{c}\frac{d^3 t_r}{d t^3}\frac{d |\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r_s}|}{d t_r}= 0
$$

These derivatives can be used to calculate the derivatives of $\varphi$ and $\mathbf{A}$, and hence the electric and magnetic fields. This is a crucial step in understanding the interaction of waves with moving coordinate systems, and will be further explored in the next section.

#### 7.3b Wave Equations in Translating Systems

In the previous section, we discussed the wave equations in moving coordinate systems. Now, we will extend our discussion to translating systems, where the coordinate system is not only moving but also changing in time.

##### Translating Coordinate Systems

A translating coordinate system is a coordinate system that is moving and changing in time. This can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\mathbf{r}(t) = \mathbf{r}_0 + \mathbf{v}t
$$

where $\mathbf{r}_0$ is the initial position of the coordinate system and $\mathbf{v}$ is the constant velocity of the coordinate system.

##### Wave Equations in Translating Systems

The wave equations in translating systems can be derived from the wave equations in moving coordinate systems. The key difference is that the retarded time $t_r$ is now a function of time, and the velocity $\mathbf{v}$ is no longer constant.

The wave equations in translating systems can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \nabla^2 \varphi = 0
$$

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{A}}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \nabla^2 \mathbf{A} = 0
$$

where $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator. These equations describe the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a translating coordinate system.

##### Lorenz Gauge in Translating Systems

The Lorenz gauge is a crucial concept in the study of wave equations in translating systems. It is defined as:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} + \frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial t} = 0
$$

In translating systems, the Lorenz gauge takes the form:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} + \frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\delta(t' - t_r)}{1 - \boldsymbol{\beta}_s \cdot (\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_s)/|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_s|}\right) = 0
$$

This equation is crucial in the calculation of the electric and magnetic fields in translating systems. It allows us to express the electric and magnetic fields in terms of the scalar and vector potentials, and their derivatives.

In the next section, we will discuss the solutions to these wave equations in translating systems, and their physical interpretation.

This is particularly relevant in the study of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.

##### Wave Propagation in Translating Systems

The wave propagation in translating systems can be understood by considering the Liénard–Wiechert potential. The Liénard–Wiechert potential is a solution to the wave equations in translating systems, and it describes the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a translating coordinate system.

The Liénard–Wiechert potential is defined as:

$$
\varphi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \frac{\delta(t' - t_r)}{1 - \boldsymbol{\beta}_s \cdot (\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_s)/|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_s|}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\beta}_s = \mathbf{v}_s/c$ and $\mathbf{r}_s$ are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$, and we have used the identity $|\mathbf{x}|' = \hat{\mathbf{x}} \cdot \mathbf{v}$ with $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{x}'$. The retarded time $t_r$ is the solution of the equation $t_r = t - \frac{1}{c} |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_s(t_r)|$. The delta function picks out $t' = t_r$, and

$$
\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r}, t) = \frac{\delta(t' - t_r)}{1 - \boldsymbol{\beta}_s \cdot (\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_s)/|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_s|}
$$

##### Wave Propagation in Translating Systems

The wave propagation in translating systems can be understood by considering the Lorenz gauge. The Lorenz gauge is a crucial concept in the study of wave equations in translating systems. It is defined as:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} + \frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial t} = 0
$$

In translating systems, the Lorenz gauge takes the form:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} + \frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\delta(t' - t_r)}{1 - \boldsymbol{\beta}_s \cdot (\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_s)/|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_s|}\right) = 0
$$

This equation is crucial in the calculation of the electric and magnetic fields in translating systems. It allows us to express the electric and magnetic fields in terms of the scalar and vector potentials, and their derivatives.

In the next section, we will discuss the solutions to these wave equations in translating systems, and their physical interpretation.

$$
\frac{d^2 t_r}{d t^2} + \frac{1}{c}\frac{d^2 t_r}{d t^2}\frac{d |\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r_s}|}{d t_r}= 0

## Chapter 8: Wave Propagation:




### Introduction

The study of ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems is a complex and multifaceted field. It is a field that has been studied extensively for decades, yet there are still many unanswered questions and areas of research to be explored. In this chapter, we will delve into the topic of ship Kelvin wakes, a phenomenon that has been of particular interest to researchers in recent years.

The Kelvin wake is a type of wave that is generated by a moving ship. It is a longitudinal wave that propagates along the length of the ship, and it is named after the British physicist Lord Kelvin who first described it in the late 19th century. The Kelvin wake is a significant component of the overall wave field generated by a ship, and it plays a crucial role in the interaction between ships and waves.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of ship Kelvin wakes and their role in ocean wave interaction.




### Section: 8.1 Kelvin Wake Formation:

The Kelvin wake is a phenomenon that is observed when a ship or other object moves through water. It is a longitudinal wave that propagates along the length of the object, and it is named after the British physicist Lord Kelvin who first described it in the late 19th century. The Kelvin wake is a significant component of the overall wave field generated by a ship, and it plays a crucial role in the interaction between ships and waves.

#### 8.1a Definition of Kelvin Wake

The Kelvin wake is a type of wave that is generated by a moving ship. It is a longitudinal wave that propagates along the length of the ship, and it is named after the British physicist Lord Kelvin who first described it in the late 19th century. The Kelvin wake is a significant component of the overall wave field generated by a ship, and it plays a crucial role in the interaction between ships and waves.

The Kelvin wake is characterized by two wake lines that form the arms of a chevron, V, with the source of the wake at the vertex of the V. For sufficiently slow motion, each wake line is offset from the path of the wake source by around arcsin(1/3) = 19.47° and is made up of feathery wavelets angled at roughly 53° to the path.

The inside of the V (of total opening 39° as indicated above) is filled with transverse curved waves, each of which resembles an arc of a circle centered at a point lying on the path at a distance twice that of the arc to the wake source. This part of the pattern is independent of the speed and size of the wake source over a significant range of values.

However, at higher speeds (specifically, at large Froude number) other parts of the pattern come into play. At the tips of the transverse wave arcs their crests turn around and continue inside the V cone and towards the source, forming an overlapping pattern of narrower waves directed outside of the cone. As the source's speed increases, these shorter waves begin to dominate and form a second V within the pattern, which grows narrower as the increased speed of the source emphasizes the shorter waves that are closer to the source's path.

The angles in this pattern are not intrinsic properties of merely water: Any isentropic and incompressible liquid with low viscosity will exhibit the same phenomenon. Furthermore, this phenomenon has nothing to do with turbulence. Everything discussed here is based on the linear theory of an ideal fluid, cf. Airy wave theory.

Parts of the pattern may be obscured by the effects of propeller wash, and tail eddies behind the boat's stern, and by the boat being a large object and not a point source. The water need not be stationary, but may be moving with a steady velocity. The Kelvin wake pattern is a result of the interaction between the ship and the water, and it is a complex phenomenon that is still being studied and understood.

#### 8.1b Formation of Kelvin Wake

The formation of the Kelvin wake is a result of the interaction between the ship and the water. As the ship moves through the water, it creates a disturbance that propagates away from the ship in the form of a wave. This wave is a longitudinal wave, meaning that it propagates along the length of the ship. The wave is characterized by two wake lines that form the arms of a chevron, V, with the source of the wake at the vertex of the V.

For sufficiently slow motion, each wake line is offset from the path of the wake source by around arcsin(1/3) = 19.47° and is made up of feathery wavelets angled at roughly 53° to the path. This offset and angle are not intrinsic properties of the water, but rather a result of the specific characteristics of the ship and its motion.

The inside of the V (of total opening 39° as indicated above) is filled with transverse curved waves, each of which resembles an arc of a circle centered at a point lying on the path at a distance twice that of the arc to the wake source. This part of the pattern is independent of the speed and size of the wake source over a significant range of values.

However, at higher speeds (specifically, at large Froude number) other parts of the pattern come into play. At the tips of the transverse wave arcs their crests turn around and continue inside the V cone and towards the source, forming an overlapping pattern of narrower waves directed outside of the cone. As the source's speed increases, these shorter waves begin to dominate and form a second V within the pattern, which grows narrower as the increased speed of the source emphasizes the shorter waves that are closer to the source's path.

The formation of the Kelvin wake is a complex phenomenon that is still being studied and understood. It is influenced by a variety of factors, including the speed and size of the wake source, the properties of the water, and the specific characteristics of the ship. Understanding the formation of the Kelvin wake is crucial for predicting and mitigating the effects of ship wakes on marine ecosystems and offshore energy systems.

#### 8.1c Applications of Kelvin Wake

The Kelvin wake, as we have seen, is a complex and fascinating phenomenon that is still being studied and understood. Its applications, however, are numerous and far-reaching. In this section, we will explore some of the key applications of the Kelvin wake in various fields.

##### Marine Navigation

The Kelvin wake is a crucial factor in marine navigation, particularly for large ships. The wake lines of the Kelvin wake can be used as a reference point for determining the direction and speed of a ship. This is particularly useful in low visibility conditions, such as fog or heavy rain, where other navigation methods may be less reliable.

##### Oceanography

In the field of oceanography, the Kelvin wake is used to study ocean currents and wave propagation. The Kelvin wake is a self-propagating wave, meaning that it can travel long distances without losing energy. This makes it an ideal tool for studying ocean currents, as it can provide valuable information about the direction and speed of water movement.

##### Offshore Energy Systems

The Kelvin wake plays a crucial role in the design and operation of offshore energy systems, such as wind turbines and wave energy converters. The Kelvin wake can significantly affect the performance of these systems, and understanding its formation and characteristics is essential for optimizing their design.

##### Environmental Impact Assessment

The Kelvin wake is also a key factor in environmental impact assessments. The wake lines of the Kelvin wake can be used to assess the impact of ship traffic on marine ecosystems. This is particularly important in areas where marine life is sensitive to disturbance, such as around offshore energy systems or in protected areas.

##### Ship Design

In ship design, the Kelvin wake is used to optimize the performance of ships. By understanding the formation of the Kelvin wake, engineers can design ships that minimize the generation of wake lines, reducing their impact on marine ecosystems and offshore energy systems.

In conclusion, the Kelvin wake is a complex and fascinating phenomenon with numerous applications. Its study is crucial for a wide range of fields, from marine navigation to environmental impact assessment. As our understanding of the Kelvin wake continues to grow, so too will its potential applications.




### Section: 8.1b Mechanisms of Kelvin Wake Formation

The formation of the Kelvin wake is a complex process that involves the interaction of various forces and factors. These include the shape and size of the ship, the speed and direction of the ship, the properties of the water, and the effects of rotation and stratification.

#### 8.1b.1 Ship Shape and Size

The shape and size of the ship play a significant role in the formation of the Kelvin wake. The length and width of the ship, as well as its draft, determine the size and shape of the wake. Longer and wider ships tend to generate larger and more complex wakes, while deeper drafts can lead to deeper and more pronounced wakes.

#### 8.1b.2 Ship Speed and Direction

The speed and direction of the ship also have a profound impact on the formation of the Kelvin wake. The speed of the ship determines the frequency and amplitude of the waves, with faster ships generating higher frequencies and larger amplitudes. The direction of the ship, on the other hand, determines the orientation of the wake. If the ship is moving in a straight line, the wake will form a V-shape with the source at the vertex. If the ship is turning, the wake will take on a more complex shape, with the V-shape becoming distorted.

#### 8.1b.3 Water Properties

The properties of the water, such as its density and viscosity, also play a role in the formation of the Kelvin wake. Density differences between the water and the ship can lead to buoyancy effects, which can alter the shape and size of the wake. Viscosity, on the other hand, affects the dissipation of the wake, with higher viscosities leading to more rapid dissipation.

#### 8.1b.4 Rotation and Stratification

Rotation and stratification can also have a significant impact on the formation of the Kelvin wake. Rotation can lead to the formation of eddies and vortices, which can alter the shape and size of the wake. Stratification, on the other hand, can lead to the formation of layers of water with different densities, which can affect the propagation of the waves.

In conclusion, the formation of the Kelvin wake is a complex process that involves the interaction of various forces and factors. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for predicting and mitigating the effects of ship wakes on marine ecosystems and offshore energy systems.

### Section: 8.2 Kelvin Wake Characteristics:

The Kelvin wake is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by various factors, including ship speed, water depth, and wave conditions. In this section, we will explore the characteristics of the Kelvin wake and how they are affected by these factors.

#### 8.2a Characteristics of Kelvin Wake

The Kelvin wake is characterized by its V-shaped pattern, which is formed by two wake lines that are offset from the path of the wake source. This pattern is a result of the interference between the waves generated by the ship and the waves already present in the water. The offset of the wake lines is approximately 19.47°, which is determined by the arcsin(1/3) formula.

The inside of the V is filled with transverse curved waves, each of which resembles an arc of a circle. These waves are centered at a point lying on the path of the wake source, at a distance twice that of the arc to the source. This part of the pattern is independent of the speed and size of the wake source over a significant range of values.

However, at higher speeds, other parts of the pattern come into play. At the tips of the transverse wave arcs, their crests turn around and continue inside the V cone and towards the source. This results in an overlapping pattern of narrower waves directed outside of the cone. As the source's speed increases, these shorter waves begin to dominate and form a second V within the pattern, which grows narrower as the increased speed of the source emphasizes the shorter waves that are closer to the source's path.

The angles in this pattern are not intrinsic properties of merely water. Any isentropic and incompressible liquid with low viscosity will exhibit the same phenomenon. Furthermore, this phenomenon has nothing to do with turbulence. Everything discussed here is based on the linear theory of an ideal fluid, cf. Airy wave theory.

Parts of the pattern may be obscured by the effects of propeller wash, and tail eddies behind the boat's stern, and by the boat being a large object and not a point source. The water need not be stationary, but may be moving at a constant velocity. The Kelvin wake is a dynamic phenomenon that is constantly changing as the ship moves through the water.

In the next section, we will explore the effects of the Kelvin wake on ships and offshore energy systems.

#### 8.2c.1 Ship Maneuverability

The Kelvin wake can significantly impact the maneuverability of a ship. The formation of the Kelvin wake behind a ship can create a region of turbulent water, which can increase the drag force acting on the ship. This increased drag can make it more difficult for the ship to change direction or speed, particularly in the presence of strong currents or waves.

#### 8.2c.2 Ship Stability

The Kelvin wake can also affect the stability of a ship. The formation of the Kelvin wake can cause a change in the hydrodynamic forces acting on the ship, which can lead to a change in the ship's center of buoyancy. This change can cause the ship to heel or roll, particularly in the presence of strong waves or currents.

#### 8.2c.3 Ship Noise and Vibration

The Kelvin wake can also contribute to the noise and vibration levels on a ship. The turbulent water behind the ship can create noise and vibrations that can be transmitted into the ship's structure. This can lead to increased levels of noise and vibration on the ship, which can be a source of discomfort for crew members and can also affect the performance of sensitive equipment.

#### 8.2c.4 Ship Performance

The Kelvin wake can also affect the overall performance of a ship. The increased drag and changes in hydrodynamic forces can lead to a decrease in the ship's speed and efficiency. This can be particularly problematic for ships operating in high-speed or high-wave conditions, where the effects of the Kelvin wake can be more pronounced.

In conclusion, the Kelvin wake plays a crucial role in the dynamics of ships and offshore energy systems. Understanding the characteristics and effects of the Kelvin wake is essential for the design, operation, and safety of these systems.

## Chapter: Chapter 9: Wave-Structure Interaction

### Introduction

The interaction between waves and structures is a complex and fascinating field of study. This chapter, "Wave-Structure Interaction," delves into the intricate dynamics of this interaction, focusing on the ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. 

The ocean is a vast and dynamic environment, and the waves that move across its surface are a significant force to be reckoned with. They can exert immense pressure on structures, causing vibrations and potentially leading to structural failure if not properly accounted for in the design process. Understanding the principles of wave-structure interaction is therefore crucial for the design and operation of ships and offshore energy systems.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental principles that govern wave-structure interaction, including the concepts of wave propagation, reflection, and refraction. We will also delve into the mathematical models that describe these phenomena, using the powerful language of differential equations and linear algebra. For instance, the wave-structure interaction can be described by the equation `$\Delta w = \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2}$`, where `$\Delta w$` is the wave displacement, `$t$` is time, `$x$` is the spatial coordinate, and `$c$` is the wave speed.

We will also discuss the practical implications of wave-structure interaction, including its impact on the design and operation of ships and offshore energy systems. This includes the design of structures to withstand wave forces, the prediction of wave-induced vibrations, and the optimization of energy efficiency in offshore systems.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of the principles of wave-structure interaction and be able to apply this knowledge to the design and operation of ships and offshore energy systems. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field, this chapter will provide you with the tools and knowledge you need to navigate the complex world of wave-structure interaction.




#### 8.3a Effects of Kelvin Wake on Ship Motion

The Kelvin wake, as we have seen, is a complex phenomenon that affects the dynamics of ships and offshore energy systems. In this section, we will delve deeper into the effects of the Kelvin wake on ship motion.

#### 8.3a.1 Ship Motion in Kelvin Wake

The Kelvin wake can significantly affect the motion of a ship. The formation of the Kelvin wake behind a ship can create a region of turbulent water, which can increase the drag force acting on the ship. This increased drag can make it more difficult for the ship to change direction or speed, particularly in the presence of strong currents or waves.

The Kelvin wake can also affect the stability of a ship. The formation of the Kelvin wake can cause a change in the hydrodynamic forces acting on the ship, which can lead to a change in the ship's center of buoyancy. This change can cause the ship to heel or roll, particularly in the presence of strong waves or currents.

#### 8.3a.2 Ship Noise and Vibration in Kelvin Wake

The Kelvin wake can also contribute to the noise and vibration levels on a ship. The turbulent water behind the ship can create noise and vibrations that can be transmitted into the ship's structure. This can lead to increased levels of noise and vibration on the ship, which can be a source of discomfort for crew members and can also affect the performance of sensitive equipment.

#### 8.3a.3 Ship Performance in Kelvin Wake

The Kelvin wake can also affect the overall performance of a ship. The increased drag and changes in hydrodynamic forces can lead to a decrease in the ship's speed and efficiency. This can be particularly problematic for ships operating in high-speed or high-wave conditions, where the effects of the Kelvin wake can be more pronounced.

In the next section, we will explore the methods and techniques used to study and model the Kelvin wake, and how these can be used to predict and mitigate its effects on ship motion.

Moreover, the placement of the propellers and other appendages can also play a crucial role. By strategically placing the propellers and other appendages, the formation of the Kelvin wake can be minimized, thereby reducing the effects on ship motion.

#### 8.3b.2 Propulsion Systems

The propulsion system of a ship can also play a significant role in mitigating the effects of the Kelvin wake. By optimizing the propulsion system, the formation of the Kelvin wake can be minimized, thereby reducing the increased drag and changes in hydrodynamic forces.

For instance, the use of water jets or azimuth thrusters can be effective in mitigating the effects of the Kelvin wake. These propulsion systems can provide additional control and thrust, thereby reducing the effects of the Kelvin wake on ship motion.

#### 8.3b.3 Ship Operation and Maintenance

The operation and maintenance of a ship can also play a crucial role in mitigating the effects of the Kelvin wake. Regular maintenance of the ship can help in identifying and addressing any issues that can contribute to the formation of the Kelvin wake.

Moreover, the operation of the ship can also be optimized to minimize the effects of the Kelvin wake. For instance, the speed of the ship can be adjusted to minimize the formation of the Kelvin wake, thereby reducing the effects on ship motion.

In conclusion, the effects of the Kelvin wake on ship motion can be mitigated through various strategies. These strategies aim to reduce the formation of the Kelvin wake, thereby reducing the increased drag and changes in hydrodynamic forces. By implementing these strategies, the performance and efficiency of a ship can be significantly improved.

### Subsection: 9.1a Definition of Linear Wave-Body Forces

Linear wave-body forces refer to the forces exerted by a wave on a body, which are directly proportional to the wave amplitude. These forces can be either hydrodynamic or aerodynamic, depending on whether the wave is in the water or in the air. 

#### Hydrodynamic Forces

Hydrodynamic forces are the forces exerted by a wave on a body immersed in a fluid, such as water. These forces can be further divided into two types: hydrodynamic drag and hydrodynamic lift. 

Hydrodynamic drag is the force that opposes the motion of the body in the direction of the wave propagation. It is caused by the friction between the body and the fluid, and it is proportional to the square of the wave amplitude. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
F_D = \frac{1}{2} C_D \rho g A^2
$$

where $F_D$ is the hydrodynamic drag force, $C_D$ is the drag coefficient, $\rho$ is the fluid density, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $A$ is the wave amplitude.

Hydrodynamic lift is the force that acts perpendicular to the direction of the wave propagation. It is caused by the pressure difference between the front and the back of the body, and it is proportional to the cube of the wave amplitude. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
F_L = \frac{1}{2} C_L \rho g A^3
$$

where $F_L$ is the hydrodynamic lift force, $C_L$ is the lift coefficient, and the other variables have the same meaning as in the equation for hydrodynamic drag.

#### Aerodynamic Forces

Aerodynamic forces are the forces exerted by a wave on a body immersed in a gas, such as air. These forces can also be divided into two types: aerodynamic drag and aerodynamic lift. 

Aerodynamic drag is the force that opposes the motion of the body in the direction of the wave propagation. It is caused by the friction between the body and the gas, and it is proportional to the square of the wave amplitude. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
F_D = \frac{1}{2} C_D \rho A^2
$$

where $F_D$ is the aerodynamic drag force, $C_D$ is the drag coefficient, $\rho$ is the gas density, and $A$ is the wave amplitude.

Aerodynamic lift is the force that acts perpendicular to the direction of the wave propagation. It is caused by the pressure difference between the front and the back of the body, and it is proportional to the cube of the wave amplitude. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
F_L = \frac{1}{2} C_L \rho A^3
$$

where $F_L$ is the aerodynamic lift force, $C_L$ is the lift coefficient, and the other variables have the same meaning as in the equation for aerodynamic drag.

In the next section, we will discuss the methods used to calculate these forces.




### Subsection: 9.1b Calculation of Linear Wave-Body Forces

The calculation of linear wave-body forces involves the application of the principles of fluid dynamics and aerodynamics. The forces are calculated based on the wave amplitude, the properties of the fluid or gas, and the geometry of the body. 

#### Hydrodynamic Forces

The calculation of hydrodynamic forces involves the application of the principles of fluid dynamics. The hydrodynamic drag force, $F_D$, and lift force, $F_L$, can be calculated using the equations provided in the previous section. These equations involve the wave amplitude, the drag and lift coefficients, the fluid density, and the acceleration due to gravity. 

The drag coefficient, $C_D$, and lift coefficient, $C_L$, are dimensionless quantities that depend on the shape of the body and the properties of the fluid. They can be determined experimentally or theoretically. 

#### Aerodynamic Forces

The calculation of aerodynamic forces involves the application of the principles of aerodynamics. The aerodynamic drag force, $F_D$, and lift force, $F_L$, can be calculated using similar equations to those for hydrodynamic forces. However, the properties of the gas (air) are used instead of the fluid properties. 

The aerodynamic drag coefficient, $C_D$, and lift coefficient, $C_L$, are also dimensionless quantities that depend on the shape of the body and the properties of the gas. They can be determined experimentally or theoretically. 

In the next section, we will discuss the methods for determining the drag and lift coefficients for both hydrodynamic and aerodynamic forces.




#### 9.1c Effects of Linear Wave-Body Forces on Ship Dynamics

The effects of linear wave-body forces on ship dynamics are significant and complex. These forces can cause a ship to heave, pitch, and roll, which can affect the ship's stability and maneuverability. The magnitude and direction of these forces depend on the wave amplitude, the properties of the fluid or gas, and the geometry of the ship.

#### Heave

Heave is the vertical motion of a ship caused by wave-body forces. This motion can be calculated using the equations for hydrodynamic and aerodynamic forces. The heave force, $F_H$, can be calculated using the equation:

$$
F_H = \frac{1}{2} \rho g A \sin(\omega t - k x)
$$

where $\rho$ is the fluid density, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $A$ is the wave amplitude, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $k$ is the wave number, and $x$ is the horizontal position of the ship.

The heave force can cause a ship to rise and fall, which can affect the ship's stability. This is particularly important for ships operating in rough seas or high winds.

#### Pitch

Pitch is the rotational motion of a ship about its longitudinal axis caused by wave-body forces. This motion can be calculated using the equations for hydrodynamic and aerodynamic forces. The pitch moment, $M_P$, can be calculated using the equation:

$$
M_P = \frac{1}{2} \rho g A \sin(\omega t - k x) \cdot L
$$

where $L$ is the length of the ship.

The pitch moment can cause a ship to roll, which can affect the ship's stability and maneuverability. This is particularly important for ships operating in waves or wind.

#### Roll

Roll is the rotational motion of a ship about its transverse axis caused by wave-body forces. This motion can be calculated using the equations for hydrodynamic and aerodynamic forces. The roll moment, $M_R$, can be calculated using the equation:

$$
M_R = \frac{1}{2} \rho g A \sin(\omega t - k x) \cdot B
$$

where $B$ is the breadth of the ship.

The roll moment can cause a ship to roll, which can affect the ship's stability and maneuverability. This is particularly important for ships operating in waves or wind.

In the next section, we will discuss the methods for determining the wave-body forces and their effects on ship dynamics.




#### 9.2a Definition of Added Mass and Damping Coefficients

In the study of wave-body interaction, two key parameters are the added mass and damping coefficients. These parameters are crucial in understanding the behavior of a body in a fluid medium, particularly in the context of ship dynamics and offshore energy systems.

#### Added Mass

The added mass, $m_a$, is a concept in fluid dynamics that describes the increase in mass of a body when it is immersed in a fluid. This increase in mass is due to the fluid displacement caused by the body's motion. The added mass can be calculated using the equation:

$$
m_a = \rho_f \cdot V_f
$$

where $\rho_f$ is the fluid density and $V_f$ is the volume of the fluid displaced by the body.

The added mass can significantly affect the dynamics of a body in a fluid medium. For instance, in the case of a ship, the added mass can increase the ship's mass and inertia, which can affect the ship's response to wave forces.

#### Damping Coefficients

Damping coefficients, often denoted as $C$ and $D$, are parameters that describe the rate at which a body loses energy in a fluid medium. These coefficients are crucial in understanding the behavior of a body in a wave field.

The damping coefficients can be calculated using the equations:

$$
C = \frac{1}{2} \rho_f \cdot V_f \cdot U_f
$$

$$
D = \frac{1}{2} \rho_f \cdot V_f \cdot V_f
$$

where $U_f$ is the velocity of the fluid and $V_f$ is the velocity of the body relative to the fluid.

The damping coefficients play a significant role in the dynamics of a body in a wave field. For instance, in the case of a ship, the damping coefficients can affect the ship's response to wave forces and the ship's natural frequency.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the calculation and application of these parameters in the context of wave-body interaction.

#### 9.2b Calculation of Added Mass and Damping Coefficients

The calculation of added mass and damping coefficients is a crucial step in understanding the behavior of a body in a fluid medium. These calculations are based on the principles of fluid dynamics and are essential in the design and analysis of ships and offshore energy systems.

##### Added Mass

The calculation of added mass involves determining the volume of the fluid displaced by the body and the density of the fluid. The volume of the fluid displaced by the body can be calculated using the equation:

$$
V_f = \int_{V_b} \rho_f dV
$$

where $V_b$ is the volume of the body and $\rho_f$ is the density of the fluid. The added mass can then be calculated using the equation:

$$
m_a = \rho_f \cdot V_f
$$

##### Damping Coefficients

The calculation of damping coefficients involves determining the velocity of the fluid and the velocity of the body relative to the fluid. The velocity of the fluid can be calculated using the equation:

$$
U_f = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y} \right)
$$

where $\phi$ and $\psi$ are the stream functions for the fluid velocity in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. The velocity of the body relative to the fluid can be calculated using the equation:

$$
V_f = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\partial \phi_b}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \psi_b}{\partial y} \right)
$$

where $\phi_b$ and $\psi_b$ are the stream functions for the body velocity in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. The damping coefficients can then be calculated using the equations:

$$
C = \frac{1}{2} \rho_f \cdot V_f \cdot U_f
$$

$$
D = \frac{1}{2} \rho_f \cdot V_f \cdot V_f
$$

It is important to note that the calculation of added mass and damping coefficients is a complex process that requires a deep understanding of fluid dynamics and the principles of wave-body interaction. These calculations are essential in the design and analysis of ships and offshore energy systems, and they play a crucial role in ensuring the safety and efficiency of these systems.

#### 9.2b Calculation of Added Mass and Damping Coefficients

The calculation of added mass and damping coefficients is a crucial step in understanding the dynamics of a body in a fluid medium. These parameters are particularly important in the context of wave-body interaction, where they can significantly affect the response of a body to wave forces.

#### Added Mass

The added mass, $m_a$, can be calculated using the equation:

$$
m_a = \rho_f \cdot V_f
$$

where $\rho_f$ is the fluid density and $V_f$ is the volume of the fluid displaced by the body. This equation assumes that the fluid is incompressible and that the body's motion is small compared to the wavelength of the fluid.

The added mass can be calculated directly from the fluid properties and the volume of the fluid displaced by the body. However, in practice, it is often more convenient to use empirical correlations or numerical methods to estimate the added mass.

The damping coefficients can significantly affect the ship's response to wave forces, particularly in the context of wave-body interaction.

The damping coefficients can be calculated using the equations:

$$
C = \frac{1}{2} \rho_f \cdot V_f \cdot U_f
$$

Wave-induced hydrodynamic forces are the forces that result from the interaction of the wave with the structure's hydrodynamic properties, while wave-induced hydrostatic forces are the forces that result from the interaction of the wave with the structure's hydrostatic properties.

Wave-radiated forces, on the other hand, are the forces that a structure experiences due to the radiation of waves from the structure. These forces can be further divided into two types: wave-radiated hydrodynamic forces and wave-radiated hydrostatic forces. Wave-radiated hydrodynamic forces are the forces that result from the radiation of waves from the structure's hydrodynamic properties, while wave-radiated hydrostatic forces are the forces that result from the radiation of waves from the structure's hydrostatic properties.

The exciting forces can be calculated using various methods, such as the Taylor's series method, the Morison's equation, and the Taylor's hypothesis. These methods take into account the properties of the wave, the properties of the structure, and the interaction between the wave and the structure.

In the next section, we will discuss the calculation of wave-induced hydrostatic forces and wave-radiated hydrostatic forces.

#### 9.3c Effects of Exciting Forces on Structures

The effects of exciting forces on structures can be significant, particularly in the context of offshore energy systems and ships. These forces can cause structural vibrations, which can lead to fatigue damage and potential structural failure if not properly managed. 

##### Structural Vibrations

Structural vibrations are a common consequence of exciting forces. These vibrations can be caused by both wave-induced and wave-radiated forces. The Morison's equation and the Taylor's series method, as discussed in the previous section, can be used to calculate these forces and predict the resulting vibrations.

The vibrations can be represented as a function of time and position along the structure, given by:

$$
v(t, x) = V \cos(\omega t - kx)
$$

where $v(t, x)$ is the velocity of the structure at time $t$ and position $x$, $V$ is the amplitude of the vibration, and other symbols have the same meaning as in the Morison's equation and the Taylor's series method.

##### Fatigue Damage

Fatigue damage is a major concern in the design and operation of offshore energy systems and ships. It is caused by repeated loading and unloading of the structure due to wave forces. The fatigue damage can be calculated using various methods, such as the Miner's rule and the Paris-Erdoğan law.

The Miner's rule is given by:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{N_i}{N_{f,i}} = 1
$$

where $N_i$ is the number of cycles at a specific load level $i$, $N_{f,i}$ is the fatigue life at that load level, and $n$ is the number of load levels.

The Paris-Erdoğan law is given by:

$$
\frac{da}{dN} = C(\Delta K)^m
$$

where $a$ is the crack length, $N$ is the number of cycles, $C$ and $m$ are material constants, and $\Delta K$ is the stress intensity factor range.

##### Structural Failure

Structural failure can occur if the fatigue damage exceeds the structural strength. This can lead to catastrophic consequences, particularly in offshore energy systems and ships, where the consequences of failure can be severe. Therefore, it is crucial to manage the exciting forces and the resulting vibrations to prevent fatigue damage and structural failure.

In the next section, we will discuss the methods for managing exciting forces and the resulting vibrations.

##### Taylor's Series Method

The Taylor's Series Method is a mathematical technique used to approximate the motion of a structure due to wave-induced forces. The method is based on the Taylor's hypothesis, which assumes that the motion of the structure is small compared to the wavelength of the wave. 

The Taylor's Series Method can be used to calculate the exciting forces on a structure due to wave-induced hydrodynamic forces and wave-induced hydrostatic forces.

The resulting equations can be solved to obtain the exciting forces.

##### Morison's Equation

Morison's Equation is another method used to calculate the exciting forces on structures. The equation is based on the assumption that the wave-induced forces on a structure can be represented by a sum of the wave-induced hydrodynamic forces and the wave-induced hydrostatic forces.

Morison's Equation can be written as:

$$
F = \frac{1}{2} \rho g A \left( C_m + C_p \right) \eta
$$

where $F$ is the exciting force, $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $A$ is the area of the structure's surface, $C_m$ and $C_p$ are the wave-induced hydrodynamic and hydrostatic coefficients, respectively, and $\eta$ is the wave amplitude.

##### Taylor's Hypothesis

Taylor's Hypothesis is a simplifying assumption used in the calculation of exciting forces. The hypothesis assumes that the motion of the structure is small compared to the wavelength of the wave. This assumption allows for the simplification of the wave field and the resulting equations, making the calculation of exciting forces more tractable.

These effects are particularly important in the design and operation of ships and offshore energy systems, where the structures are subjected to a wide range of wave conditions.

##### Resonance

Resonance occurs when the frequency of the exciting force matches the natural frequency of the structure. This results in a large amplitude of motion, which can lead to fatigue and failure if the structure is not designed to withstand these forces. The natural frequency of a structure is determined by its mass, stiffness, and damping characteristics.

##### Fatigue and Failure

Fatigue and failure can occur due to the repeated application of exciting forces on a structure. This is particularly important in the case of offshore energy systems, where the structures are subjected to a wide range of wave conditions. The fatigue life of a structure is determined by the magnitude and frequency of the exciting forces, as well as the material properties and design of the structure.

##### Wave-Induced Vibrations

Wave-induced vibrations can cause significant motion of a structure, which can lead to fatigue and failure. These vibrations can be caused by wave-induced hydrodynamic forces and wave-induced hydrostatic forces. The effects of these vibrations can be mitigated by designing the structure to withstand the expected wave conditions, as well as by using damping devices to reduce the amplitude of the vibrations.

Therefore, it is crucial to consider these effects in the design and operation of these structures.




#### 9.4a Definition of Motion Response

The motion response of a structure refers to the displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the structure due to the interaction with ocean waves. This interaction can be linear or nonlinear, and the response of the structure can be static or dynamic. 

##### Static Motion Response

Static motion response refers to the response of a structure when it is subjected to a constant force or load. This type of response is typically associated with the static analysis of structures, where the effects of the applied load are determined without considering the dynamic response of the structure. The static motion response can be calculated using the equations of equilibrium, which state that the sum of all forces acting on a structure must be equal to zero.

##### Dynamic Motion Response

Dynamic motion response refers to the response of a structure when it is subjected to a variable force or load that changes over time. This type of response is typically associated with the dynamic analysis of structures, where the effects of the applied load are determined by considering the dynamic response of the structure. The dynamic motion response can be calculated using the equations of motion, which state that the sum of all forces acting on a structure must be equal to the mass of the structure times its acceleration.

##### Linear and Nonlinear Motion Response

The motion response of a structure can be linear or nonlinear, depending on the nature of the applied load and the response of the structure. Linear motion response refers to the response of a structure when the applied load is proportional to the displacement of the structure. Nonlinear motion response refers to the response of a structure when the applied load is not proportional to the displacement of the structure.

##### Wave-Induced Motion Response

Wave-induced motion response refers to the response of a structure when it is subjected to ocean waves. This type of response is particularly important in the design and operation of ships and offshore energy systems, where the structures are subjected to a wide range of wave conditions.

#### 9.4b Wave-Induced Motion Response

Wave-induced motion response is a critical aspect of the interaction between ocean waves and structures. This response is influenced by various factors, including the properties of the wave, the characteristics of the structure, and the environmental conditions. 

##### Wave Properties

The properties of the wave, such as its height, frequency, and direction, play a significant role in the wave-induced motion response. The height of the wave determines the magnitude of the force exerted on the structure, while the frequency of the wave determines the rate at which the force changes over time. The direction of the wave determines the direction of the force exerted on the structure.

##### Structure Characteristics

The characteristics of the structure, such as its mass, stiffness, and damping, also influence the wave-induced motion response. The mass of the structure determines its inertia, which resists changes in velocity. The stiffness of the structure determines its resistance to deformation, which resists changes in displacement. The damping of the structure determines its resistance to oscillation, which resists changes in velocity.

##### Environmental Conditions

The environmental conditions, such as the wind speed and sea state, can also affect the wave-induced motion response. The wind speed can increase the wave height and change the wave direction, while the sea state can change the wave frequency and direction.

##### Wave-Induced Motion Response Equations

The wave-induced motion response can be calculated using the equations of motion, which state that the sum of all forces acting on a structure must be equal to the mass of the structure times its acceleration. This equation can be written as:

$$
\sum F = m \cdot a
$$

where $\sum F$ is the sum of all forces acting on the structure, $m$ is the mass of the structure, and $a$ is the acceleration of the structure. The forces acting on the structure include the wave force, the wind force, and the structural damping force.

The wave force can be calculated using the wave force equation, which states that the wave force is proportional to the wave height, the wave frequency, and the structural mass. This equation can be written as:

$$
F_w = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \rho \cdot g \cdot H \cdot \omega \cdot m
$$

where $F_w$ is the wave force, $\rho$ is the density of the water, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $H$ is the wave height, $\omega$ is the wave frequency, and $m$ is the mass of the structure.

The wind force can be calculated using the wind force equation, which states that the wind force is proportional to the wind speed, the wind direction, and the structural area. This equation can be written as:

$$
F_w = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \rho \cdot v \cdot A
$$

where $F_w$ is the wind force, $\rho$ is the density of the air, $v$ is the wind speed, and $A$ is the area of the structure.

The structural damping force can be calculated using the damping force equation, which states that the damping force is proportional to the structural velocity. This equation can be written as:

$$
F_d = c \cdot v
$$

where $F_d$ is the damping force, $c$ is the damping coefficient, and $v$ is the velocity of the structure.
