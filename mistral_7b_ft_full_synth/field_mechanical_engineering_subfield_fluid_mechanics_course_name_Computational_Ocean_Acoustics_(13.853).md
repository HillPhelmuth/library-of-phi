#### 1.1a Introduction to Acoustic Wave Equation

The acoustic wave equation is a fundamental equation in the field of ocean acoustics. It describes the propagation of acoustic waves through a material medium, such as water, and is a second-order partial differential equation. The equation is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $p$ is the acoustic pressure, $t$ is time, $x$ is position, and $c$ is the speed of sound. This equation describes the evolution of acoustic pressure or particle velocity as a function of position and time.

The acoustic wave equation is a simplified form of the more general wave equation, which describes waves in three dimensions. It is also used to describe propagating waves in a pre-defined direction using the first-order one-way wave equation.

In the case of lossy media, where there is frequency-dependent attenuation and phase speed, more intricate models are needed. These models often incorporate fractional derivative terms, as discussed in the acoustic attenuation article and the survey paper.

#### 1.1b The Wave Equation in One Dimension

The wave equation describing a standing wave field in one dimension (position $x$) is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $p$ is the acoustic pressure, $t$ is time, $x$ is position, and $c$ is the speed of sound.

#### 1.1c The Solution to the Wave Equation

Provided that the speed $c$ is a constant, not dependent on frequency (the dispersionless case), then the most general solution to the wave equation is given by:

$$
p(x,t) = f(x+ct) + g(x-ct)
$$

where $f$ and $g$ are any two twice-differentiable functions. This may be pictured as the superposition of two waveforms of arbitrary profile, one ( $f$ ) traveling up the $x$-axis and the other ( $g$ ) down the $x$-axis at the speed $c$.

The particular case of a sinusoidal wave traveling in one direction is obtained by choosing either $f$ or $g$ to be a sinusoid, and the other to be zero, giving:

$$
p(x,t) = A \sin(kx-\omega t)
$$

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the wave and $k$ is its wave number.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the implications of the acoustic wave equation and its solutions, and explore their applications in ocean acoustics.

#### 1.1d The Wave Equation in Three Dimensions

The wave equation can also be extended to three dimensions, where it describes the propagation of acoustic waves in a three-dimensional medium. The wave equation in three dimensions is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 p
$$

where $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator, which in Cartesian coordinates is given by:

$$
\nabla^2 = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}
$$

This equation describes the evolution of acoustic pressure as a function of time and position in three dimensions. It is a more general form of the wave equation in one dimension, as it allows for the propagation of waves in three directions.

The solution to the wave equation in three dimensions is given by the superposition of three one-dimensional wave equations, one for each direction. This means that the solution can be written as:

$$
p(x,y,z,t) = f(x+ct) + g(y+ct) + h(z+ct)
$$

where $f$, $g$, and $h$ are any three twice-differentiable functions. This solution describes the propagation of three waves, one in each direction, with speeds $c$, $c$, and $c$, respectively.

In the next section, we will discuss the implications of the wave equation in three dimensions and its applications in ocean acoustics.

#### 1.1e The Wave Equation in a Moving Medium

In the previous sections, we have discussed the wave equation in a stationary medium. However, in many practical applications, such as underwater acoustics, the medium (water) is not stationary. The wave equation in a moving medium is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 p - \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} \nabla p
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the medium, and $\nabla p$ is the gradient of the pressure. The term $\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} \nabla p$ accounts for the effect of the medium's motion on the wave propagation.

In the case of a fluid medium, such as water, the density can change with pressure and temperature. This can be accounted for by including the terms $\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial p}$ and $\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial T}$ in the wave equation, where $T$ is the temperature. The equation then becomes:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 p - \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} \nabla p + \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial p} \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial T} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
$$

This equation describes the propagation of acoustic waves in a fluid medium with varying density and temperature. It is a more complex form of the wave equation, but it is necessary for accurately modeling the behavior of acoustic waves in the ocean.

In the next section, we will discuss the solutions to the wave equation in a moving medium and their applications in ocean acoustics.

#### 1.1f The Wave Equation in a Non-Uniform Medium

In the previous sections, we have discussed the wave equation in a uniform medium, where the properties of the medium (such as density and speed of sound) are constant. However, in many practical applications, such as underwater acoustics, the medium is non-uniform. The wave equation in a non-uniform medium is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 p - \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} \nabla p + \frac{\partial c}{\partial p} \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial c}{\partial T} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
$$

where $c$ is the speed of sound, and $\frac{\partial c}{\partial p}$ and $\frac{\partial c}{\partial T}$ are the partial derivatives of the speed of sound with respect to pressure and temperature, respectively. These terms account for the effect of the medium's non-uniformity on the wave propagation.

In the case of a fluid medium, such as water, the speed of sound can change with pressure and temperature. This can be accounted for by including the terms $\frac{\partial c}{\partial p}$ and $\frac{\partial c}{\partial T}$ in the wave equation, where $T$ is the temperature. The equation then becomes:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 p - \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} \nabla p + \frac{\partial c}{\partial p} \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial c}{\partial T} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
$$

This equation describes the propagation of acoustic waves in a fluid medium with varying density, speed of sound, and temperature. It is a more complex form of the wave equation, but it is necessary for accurately modeling the behavior of acoustic waves in the ocean.

In the next section, we will discuss the solutions to the wave equation in a non-uniform medium and their applications in ocean acoustics.




#### 1.1b Derivation of Acoustic Wave Equation

The derivation of the acoustic wave equation involves three steps: derivation of the equation of state, the linearized one-dimensional continuity equation, and the linearized one-dimensional force equation.

##### Equation of State

The equation of state describes the relationship between pressure, density, and temperature in a fluid. For an ideal gas, this relationship is given by the ideal gas law:

$$
P = \rho R_g T
$$

where $P$ is pressure, $\rho$ is density, $R_g$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is temperature. In an adiabatic process, where no heat is exchanged, the equation of state can be linearized to:

$$
P = \rho C
$$

where $C$ is some constant.

##### Linearized One-Dimensional Continuity Equation

The continuity equation describes the conservation of mass in a fluid. In one dimension, this equation can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial (\rho u)}{\partial x} = 0
$$

where $u$ is the velocity. In the case of an adiabatic process, the density is constant, and the continuity equation simplifies to:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0
$$

##### Linearized One-Dimensional Force Equation

The force equation describes the balance of forces in a fluid. In one dimension, this equation can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial P}{\partial x} = \rho \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}
$$

Substituting the linearized continuity equation and equation of state into this equation, we obtain the acoustic wave equation:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2}
$$

This equation describes the propagation of acoustic waves through a fluid medium. It is a second-order partial differential equation, and its solutions represent the pressure variations in the fluid as a function of position and time.

#### 1.1c Solutions to Acoustic Wave Equation

The acoustic wave equation is a second-order partial differential equation that describes the propagation of acoustic waves through a fluid medium. The solutions to this equation represent the pressure variations in the fluid as a function of position and time.

##### General Solution

The general solution to the acoustic wave equation is given by:

$$
p(x,t) = f(x+ct) + g(x-ct)
$$

where $f$ and $g$ are any two twice-differentiable functions. This solution represents the superposition of two waveforms of arbitrary profile, one traveling up the $x$-axis and the other traveling down the $x$-axis at the speed $c$.

##### Standing Wave Solution

In the case of a standing wave, the waveforms $f$ and $g$ are complex conjugates of each other. This results in a standing wave pattern, where the pressure variations repeat themselves at regular intervals along the $x$-axis.

##### Traveling Wave Solution

In the case of a traveling wave, the waveforms $f$ and $g$ are real and have different profiles. This results in a traveling wave pattern, where the pressure variations move along the $x$-axis at the speed $c$.

##### Sinusoidal Wave Solution

The particular case of a sinusoidal wave traveling in one direction is obtained by choosing $f$ and $g$ to be sinusoidal functions. This results in a sinusoidal pressure variation that travels along the $x$-axis at the speed $c$.

In the next section, we will discuss the physical interpretation of these solutions and their applications in ocean acoustics.




#### 1.1c Applications of Acoustic Wave Equation

In conclusion, the acoustic wave equation is a powerful tool in the field of ocean acoustics. It is used to model the propagation of acoustic waves in a variety of applications, from underwater communication to viscoelastic modeling. Understanding this equation is crucial for anyone working in this field.




#### 1.2a Basics of Integral Transforms

Integral transforms are mathematical operations that transform a function from one domain to another. They are particularly useful in the field of ocean acoustics, where they are used to model the propagation of acoustic waves. In this section, we will introduce the concept of integral transforms and discuss their applications in ocean acoustics.

##### Fourier Transform

The Fourier transform is a common type of integral transform. It transforms a function from the time domain to the frequency domain. In the context of ocean acoustics, the Fourier transform is used to model the propagation of acoustic waves in the ocean. The Fourier transform of a function $f(t)$ is given by:

$$
F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)e^{-i\omega t} dt
$$

where $F(\omega)$ is the Fourier transform of $f(t)$, $\omega$ is the frequency, and $i$ is the imaginary unit.

##### Laplace Transform

The Laplace transform is another type of integral transform. It transforms a function from the time domain to the complex frequency domain. In the field of ocean acoustics, the Laplace transform is used to model the propagation of acoustic waves in the ocean. The Laplace transform of a function $f(t)$ is given by:

$$
F(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty} f(t)e^{-st} dt
$$

where $F(s)$ is the Laplace transform of $f(t)$, $s$ is the complex frequency, and $i$ is the imaginary unit.

##### Integral Transforms in Ocean Acoustics

Integral transforms are used extensively in ocean acoustics to model the propagation of acoustic waves. For example, the Fourier transform is used to model the propagation of acoustic waves in the frequency domain, while the Laplace transform is used to model the propagation of acoustic waves in the complex frequency domain. These transforms allow us to analyze the propagation of acoustic waves in the ocean in a more tractable manner.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the applications of integral transforms in ocean acoustics, focusing on the Lambert W function and its applications in the field.

#### 1.2b Applications of Integral Transforms

Integral transforms have a wide range of applications in ocean acoustics. They are used to model the propagation of acoustic waves, to analyze the effects of ocean currents and turbulence on acoustic signals, and to design and analyze acoustic imaging systems. In this section, we will discuss some of these applications in more detail.

##### Lambert W Function

The Lambert W function, denoted as $W(x)$, is a special function that appears in the solutions of differential equations. It has been used in the analysis of acoustic wave propagation in the ocean. The Lambert W function is defined as the function $W(x)$ that satisfies the equation $W(x)e^{W(x)} = x$.

The Lambert W function has been used in the analysis of acoustic wave propagation in the ocean. For example, it has been used in the analysis of the effects of ocean currents and turbulence on acoustic signals. The Lambert W function has also been used in the design and analysis of acoustic imaging systems.

##### Indefinite Integrals

The indefinite integral of the Lambert W function has been used in the analysis of acoustic wave propagation in the ocean. The indefinite integral of the Lambert W function is given by:

$$
\int \frac{ W(x) }{x} \, dx \; = \; \frac{ W(x)^2}{2} + W(x) + C
$$

where $C$ is the constant of integration. This result has been used in the analysis of acoustic wave propagation in the ocean.

##### Definite Integrals

The definite integral of the Lambert W function has also been used in the analysis of acoustic wave propagation in the ocean. The definite integral of the Lambert W function is given by:

$$
\int W\left(A e^{Bx}\right) \, dx \; = \; \frac{ W\left(A e^{Bx}\right) ^2}{2B} + \frac{ W\left(A e^{Bx}\right) }{B} + C
$$

where $A$ and $B$ are constants. This result has been used in the analysis of acoustic wave propagation in the ocean.

In the next section, we will discuss more advanced topics in computational ocean acoustics, including the use of machine learning techniques for acoustic signal processing and the use of high-performance computing for the simulation of acoustic wave propagation in the ocean.

#### 1.2c Challenges in Integral Transforms

Integral transforms, while powerful tools in the analysis of acoustic wave propagation in the ocean, are not without their challenges. These challenges often arise from the inherent complexity of the ocean environment and the mathematical models used to describe it.

##### Complexity of the Ocean Environment

The ocean is a complex and dynamic environment, with a wide range of physical properties that can affect acoustic wave propagation. These properties include temperature, salinity, and density, which can vary significantly over short distances. The effects of these properties on acoustic wave propagation can be modeled using integral transforms, but the resulting equations can be highly complex and difficult to solve.

For example, the equation for the propagation of acoustic waves in the ocean can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 P + \frac{1}{\rho_0} \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}
$$

where $P$ is the pressure, $t$ is time, $c$ is the speed of sound, $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator, $\rho_0$ is the reference density, and $\rho$ is the density. This equation is a partial differential equation (PDE) that describes the propagation of acoustic waves in the ocean. However, solving this equation can be challenging due to the complexity of the terms involved and the need to account for the effects of ocean currents and turbulence.

##### Mathematical Challenges

The mathematical models used to describe acoustic wave propagation in the ocean often involve integral transforms. These transforms can be difficult to apply due to the complexity of the functions involved and the need to account for boundary conditions.

For example, the Fourier transform, a common integral transform used in the analysis of acoustic wave propagation, is defined as:

$$
F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)e^{-i\omega t} dt
$$

where $f(t)$ is a function of time, $\omega$ is the frequency, and $i$ is the imaginary unit. Applying this transform to a function can be challenging due to the need to account for the effects of ocean currents and turbulence, which can cause the function to vary rapidly with time.

In conclusion, while integral transforms are powerful tools in the analysis of acoustic wave propagation in the ocean, they also present significant challenges due to the complexity of the ocean environment and the mathematical models used to describe it. Future research in computational ocean acoustics will likely focus on developing more sophisticated and efficient methods for applying these transforms.




#### 1.2b Fourier and Laplace Transforms

The Fourier and Laplace transforms are two of the most commonly used integral transforms in the field of ocean acoustics. They allow us to transform a function from the time domain to the frequency domain, and from the time domain to the complex frequency domain, respectively. In this section, we will delve deeper into these transforms and explore their properties and applications in ocean acoustics.

##### Fourier Transform

The Fourier transform is a linear operator that transforms a function from the time domain to the frequency domain. It is defined as:

$$

where $F(s)$ is the Laplace transform of $f(t)$, $s$ is the complex frequency, and $i$ is the imaginary unit. The inverse Laplace transform is given by:

$$
f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\gamma-i\infty}^{\gamma+i\infty} F(s)e^{st} ds
$$

where $\gamma$ is a real number such that all the poles of $F(s)$ have negative real parts. The Laplace transform also has several important properties, including linearity, time shifting, frequency shifting, and scaling. These properties make the Laplace transform a powerful tool in the analysis of signals in the complex frequency domain, which can be particularly useful in the analysis of acoustic waves in the ocean.

##### Fractional Fourier Transform

The fractional Fourier transform is a generalization of the Fourier transform that allows for a rotation in the time-frequency plane. It is defined as:

$$
F_\alpha(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)e^{-i\omega t\cos\alpha - it\sin\alpha} dt
$$

where $F_\alpha(\omega)$ is the fractional Fourier transform of $f(t)$, $\omega$ is the frequency, $t$ is the time, and $\alpha$ is the rotation angle. The fractional Fourier transform has several important properties, including linearity, time shifting, frequency shifting, and scaling. These properties make the fractional Fourier transform a powerful tool in the analysis of signals in the time-frequency plane, which can be particularly useful in the analysis of acoustic waves in the ocean.

##### Integral Transforms in Ocean Acoustics

Integral transforms, including the Fourier and Laplace transforms, play a crucial role in the field of ocean acoustics. They allow us to transform a function from the time domain to the frequency domain, and from the time domain to the complex frequency domain, respectively. This transformation is particularly useful in the analysis of acoustic waves in the ocean, as it allows us to study the propagation of these waves in the frequency domain. Furthermore, the properties of these transforms, such as linearity, time shifting, frequency shifting, and scaling, provide us with powerful tools for manipulating signals in the frequency domain.




#### 1.2c Applications in Ocean Acoustics

The applications of integral transforms, particularly the Fourier and Laplace transforms, are vast in the field of ocean acoustics. These transforms allow us to analyze and manipulate signals in the frequency domain, which is crucial in understanding the behavior of acoustic waves in the ocean. In this section, we will explore some of the key applications of these transforms in ocean acoustics.

##### Ambient Noise Analysis

Ambient noise, as discussed in the previous section, is a significant factor in underwater acoustics. It is the background noise that is independent of the source, receiver, and platform characteristics. The Fourier and Laplace transforms are used to analyze the frequency components of ambient noise. This analysis can help us understand the sources of ambient noise and their impact on acoustic signals.

##### Reverberation Modeling

Reverberation is the reflection of sound waves from the ocean surface, bottom, or volume. It is a critical factor in underwater acoustics, as it can significantly affect the propagation of acoustic signals. The Fourier and Laplace transforms are used to model reverberation, allowing us to predict how it will affect acoustic signals in different ocean conditions.

##### Signal Processing

The Fourier and Laplace transforms are used in underwater imaging to analyze the frequency components of the reflected waves, which can help us create high-resolution images of the underwater environment.

In conclusion, the Fourier and Laplace transforms are powerful tools in the field of ocean acoustics. They allow us to analyze and manipulate signals in the frequency domain, which is crucial in understanding the behavior of acoustic waves in the ocean. Their applications are vast and varied, ranging from ambient noise analysis to underwater imaging.




#### 1.3a Introduction to Helmholtz Equation

The Helmholtz equation is a second-order linear partial differential equation that describes the propagation of scalar fields, such as sound waves, in space. It is named after the German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz, who first derived it in the 19th century. The Helmholtz equation is a fundamental equation in the field of ocean acoustics, as it describes the propagation of acoustic waves in the ocean.

The Helmholtz equation can be derived from the wave equation, which describes the propagation of waves in a medium. The wave equation can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $u$ is the wave function, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the wave speed. The Helmholtz equation is obtained by separating the variables $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$, and substituting them into the wave equation. This results in two separate equations, one for the spatial part $X(x)$ and one for the temporal part $T(t)$. The spatial part leads to the Helmholtz equation:

$$
\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 X}{\partial t^2} = \frac{\partial^2 X}{\partial x^2}
$$

The Helmholtz equation describes the propagation of a wave in space, where the wave speed $c$ is constant. It is a linear equation, meaning that the wave function $X(x)$ is a linear combination of the spatial derivatives of $X(x)$. This linearity allows us to solve the Helmholtz equation using various methods, such as the Fourier and Laplace transforms, which we have discussed in the previous sections.

In the next sections, we will delve deeper into the Helmholtz equation and explore its applications in ocean acoustics. We will discuss how the Helmholtz equation describes the propagation of acoustic waves in the ocean, and how it can be used to model and analyze these waves. We will also discuss the boundary conditions of the Helmholtz equation, which describe the behavior of the wave at the boundaries of the medium. These boundary conditions are crucial in understanding the behavior of acoustic waves in the ocean, and they will be the focus of our discussion in the next section.

#### 1.3b Solving Helmholtz Equation

The Helmholtz equation is a second-order linear partial differential equation that describes the propagation of scalar fields, such as sound waves, in space. It is a fundamental equation in the field of ocean acoustics, as it describes the propagation of acoustic waves in the ocean. In this section, we will discuss the methods for solving the Helmholtz equation.

The Helmholtz equation can be solved using various methods, including the Fourier and Laplace transforms, which we have discussed in the previous sections. These methods allow us to transform the Helmholtz equation into a simpler form, which can be solved more easily.

Another method for solving the Helmholtz equation is the method of separation of variables. This method involves assuming a solution of the form $X(x)T(t)$, where $X(x)$ is the spatial part and $T(t)$ is the temporal part. Substituting this solution into the Helmholtz equation, we obtain two separate equations, one for the spatial part $X(x)$ and one for the temporal part $T(t)$. The spatial part leads to the Helmholtz equation, which can be solved using the Fourier and Laplace transforms.

#### 1.3c Applications in Ocean Acoustics

The Helmholtz equation plays a crucial role in the field of ocean acoustics. It is used to describe the propagation of acoustic waves in the ocean, which are used for various applications such as underwater communication, sonar, and acoustic tomography.

One of the key applications of the Helmholtz equation in ocean acoustics is in the design and analysis of underwater communication systems. These systems use acoustic waves to transmit information underwater, and the Helmholtz equation is used to model the propagation of these waves. By solving the Helmholtz equation, we can predict the behavior of the acoustic waves and design communication systems that can effectively transmit information underwater.

The Helmholtz equation is also used in sonar systems, which are used to detect and locate objects underwater. Sonar systems use acoustic waves to detect objects, and the Helmholtz equation is used to model the propagation of these waves. By solving the Helmholtz equation, we can predict the behavior of the acoustic waves and design sonar systems that can effectively detect and locate objects underwater.

#### 1.3b Derivation and Solutions

The Helmholtz equation can be derived from the wave equation by separating the variables $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$, and substituting them into the wave equation. This results in two separate equations, one for the spatial part $X(x)$ and one for the temporal part $T(t)$. The spatial part leads to the Helmholtz equation:

$$
\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 X}{\partial t^2} = \frac{\partial^2 X}{\partial x^2}
$$

The Helmholtz equation describes the propagation of a wave in space, where the wave speed $c$ is constant. It is a linear equation, meaning that the wave function $X(x)$ is a linear combination of the spatial derivatives of $X(x)$. This linearity allows us to solve the Helmholtz equation using various methods, such as the Fourier and Laplace transforms, which we have discussed in the previous sections.

The solutions to the Helmholtz equation can be classified into two types: bounded solutions and unbounded solutions. Bounded solutions are those that satisfy the boundary conditions of the problem, while unbounded solutions do not. The bounded solutions are of particular interest, as they represent the propagation of waves in a finite medium.

The solutions to the Helmholtz equation can be found by separating the variables $X(x) = X_1(x)X_2(x)$, and substituting them into the equation. This results in two separate equations, one for the spatial part $X_1(x)$ and one for the temporal part $X_2(x)$. The spatial part leads to the Helmholtz equation:

$$
\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 X_1}{\partial t^2} = \frac{\partial^2 X_1}{\partial x^2}
$$

The temporal part leads to the equation:

$$
\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 X_2}{\partial t^2} = \frac{\partial^2 X_2}{\partial x^2}
$$

The solutions to these equations can be found using the Fourier and Laplace transforms, as discussed in the previous sections. The solutions can also be found by using the method of separation of variables, as discussed in the previous section.

In the next section, we will discuss the applications of the Helmholtz equation in ocean acoustics.

### Subsection: 2.1a Definition and Properties

Green's functions, also known as propagators, are fundamental solutions to the wave equation in unbounded media. They describe the propagation of a wave from a point source in space and time, and are named after the British mathematician George Green. 

#### Definition of Green's Functions

Green's functions, denoted as $G(\vec{r}, \vec{r}', t, t')$, are solutions to the wave equation in unbounded media. They satisfy the following properties:

1. Superposition principle: The sum of two Green's functions is also a Green's function. This property allows us to construct more complex Green's functions from simpler ones.

2. Causality: Green's functions are causal, meaning that they are zero for all $t < t'$. This property ensures that the wave propagates forward in time.

3. Symmetry: Green's functions are symmetric in space and time, meaning that $G(\vec{r}, \vec{r}', t, t') = G(\vec{r}', \vec{r}, t', t)$. This property is a consequence of the symmetry of the wave equation.

4. Delta function property: The Green's function for a point source at $\vec{r}'$ and time $t'$ is given by the delta function, $G(\vec{r}, \vec{r}', t, t') = \delta(\vec{r} - \vec{r}')\delta(t - t')$. This property allows us to represent a point source as a delta function in space and time.

#### Properties of Green's Functions

Green's functions have several important properties that make them useful in the study of wave propagation. These properties include:

1. Fourier transform: The Fourier transform of a Green's function is also a Green's function. This property allows us to transform the wave equation from the time domain to the frequency domain, where it can be solved more easily.

3. Convolution integral: The response of a system to a continuous input is given by the convolution integral, which involves the Green's function of the system. This property allows us to calculate the response of a system to any input from its response to a point source.

4. Causal response: The response of a system to a causal input is also causal. This property ensures that the system does not respond to future inputs.

5. Stability: The Green's function of a stable system is also stable. This property ensures that the system does not grow unbounded in response to any input.

6. Time-invariance: The Green's function of a time-invariant system is also time-invariant. This property allows us to simplify the analysis of time-invariant systems.

8. Additivity: The Green's function of a system with multiple inputs is equal to the sum of the Green's functions of the system with each input individually. This property allows us to construct the Green's function of a system with multiple inputs from the Green's functions of the system with each input individually.

9. Uniqueness: The Green's function of a system is unique. This property ensures that the Green's function of a system is well-defined and does not depend on the choice of basis inputs.

10. Continuity: The Green's function of a continuous system is also continuous. This property ensures that the system responds smoothly to any input.

11. Differentiation: The Green's function of a differentiable system is also differentiable. This property allows us to calculate the derivative of the system's response to any input from its response to a point source.

12. Integration: The Green's function of an integrable system is also integrable. This property allows us to calculate the integral of the system's response to any input from its response to a point source.

13. Convergence: The Green's function of a convergent system is also convergent. This property ensures that the system responds to any input in a finite time.

14. Boundedness: The Green's function of a bounded system is also bounded. This property ensures that the system does not respond to any input in an unbounded manner.

15. Analyticity: The Green's function of an analytic system is also analytic. This property allows us to represent the system's response to any input as an analytic function.

#### 2.1b Derivation of Green's Functions

Green's functions can be derived from the wave equation in unbounded media. The wave equation in unbounded media is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $u$ is the wave function, $t$ is time, $x$ is position, and $c$ is the wave speed. The Green's function $G(x, t|x', t')$ satisfies this equation with a delta function source at position $x'$ and time $t'$:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial x^2} \delta(x - x')\delta(t - t')
$$

The solution to this equation is given by the delta function property of Green's functions:

$$
G(x, t|x', t') = \delta(x - x')\delta(t - t')
$$

This solution satisfies the wave equation and the properties of Green's functions. It represents a wave propagating from the source at $x'$ and time $t'$ to all other points in space and time.

The Green's function can also be derived from the Fourier transform of the wave equation. The Fourier transform of the wave equation is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \tilde{u}}{\partial t^2} = -c^2 k^2 \tilde{u}
$$

where $\tilde{u}$ is the Fourier transform of the wave function, $k$ is the wave number, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency. The Green's function $\tilde{G}(k, \omega|k', \omega')$ satisfies this equation with a delta function source at wave number $k'$ and angular frequency $\omega'$:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \tilde{G}}{\partial t^2} = -c^2 k^2 \tilde{G} \delta(k - k')\delta(\omega - \omega')
$$

The solution to this equation is given by the Fourier transform of the delta function property of Green's functions:

$$
\tilde{G}(k, \omega|k', \omega') = \delta(k - k')\delta(\omega - \omega')
$$

This solution satisfies the wave equation and the properties of Green's functions. It represents a wave propagating from the source at wave number $k'$ and angular frequency $\omega'$ to all other points in wave number and angular frequency space.

In the next section, we will discuss how to use Green's functions to solve the wave equation for more complex sources and boundary conditions.

#### 2.1c Applications in Ocean Acoustics

Green's functions have a wide range of applications in ocean acoustics. They are used to model and analyze the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, which is a complex process due to the ocean's large size and the presence of various boundaries and interfaces. 

One of the key applications of Green's functions in ocean acoustics is in the modeling of sound propagation in the ocean. The ocean can be modeled as an unbounded medium, and the wave equation in this medium can be solved using Green's functions. This allows us to predict the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, which is crucial for many applications such as sonar, underwater communication, and oceanographic research.

Green's functions are also used in the analysis of sound sources in the ocean. For example, they can be used to analyze the sound produced by a ship or a submarine, or to analyze the sound reflected from the ocean surface or the seafloor. This is done by convolving the source signal with the Green's function of the ocean, which gives the response of the ocean to the source signal.

Another important application of Green's functions in ocean acoustics is in the analysis of sound scattering in the ocean. Sound scattering occurs when sound waves are deflected or absorbed by particles or structures in the ocean. This can be modeled using the scattering Green's function, which describes the scattering of sound waves by a point source in the ocean.

Green's functions are also used in the analysis of sound absorption in the ocean. Sound absorption occurs when sound waves are absorbed by the ocean, which can be modeled using the absorption Green's function. This function describes the absorption of sound waves by a point source in the ocean.

In the next section, we will discuss how to derive the Green's functions for various types of sources in the ocean, and how to use these functions to analyze the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.




#### 2.1c Applications in Ocean Acoustics

Green's functions have a wide range of applications in ocean acoustics. They are used to model and analyze the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, which is crucial for understanding and predicting the behavior of marine animals, underwater vehicles, and other sources of sound in the ocean.

One of the primary applications of Green's functions in ocean acoustics is in the modeling of sound propagation. The wave equation, which describes the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, can be solved using Green's functions. This allows us to model the propagation of sound waves from a source in the ocean, taking into account the effects of the medium (such as the presence of boundaries or inhomogeneities) and the source itself.

Green's functions are also used in the analysis of sound fields in the ocean. By convolving the Green's function with the source function, we can obtain the sound field at any point in the ocean. This allows us to analyze the effects of the source on the sound field, and to predict the behavior of the sound field in response to changes in the source or the medium.

In addition to their use in modeling and analysis, Green's functions are also used in the design and optimization of sources in the ocean. By convolving the Green's function with the source function, we can obtain the sound field at any point in the ocean. This allows us to design sources that emit sound in a desired manner, or to optimize the emission of sound from a source.

Finally, Green's functions are used in the study of the effects of sound on marine animals. By convolving the Green's function with the source function, we can obtain the sound field at any point in the ocean. This allows us to study the effects of sound on marine animals, and to design sources that minimize these effects.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the applications of Green's functions in ocean acoustics, focusing on their use in the modeling and analysis of sound propagation in the ocean.




#### 2.2a Statement and Proof of Green's Theorem

Green's theorem is a fundamental result in the theory of differential equations. It provides a method for solving certain types of differential equations by reducing them to integral equations. In the context of ocean acoustics, Green's theorem is used to solve the wave equation, which describes the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.

The theorem is named after the British mathematician George Green, who first published it in 1839. It is also known as the Green's theorem of potential theory, or the Green's theorem of the first kind.

The theorem states that if $f(x, y)$ and $g(x, y)$ are continuous functions on a simply connected domain $D$ in the plane, and if $f$ and $g$ have continuous first-order partial derivatives on $D$, then the following identity holds:

$$
\int\int_D \left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right) f(x, y) \, dx \, dy = \int\int_D \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}\right) g(x, y) \, dx \, dy
$$

The proof of Green's theorem is based on the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which relate the partial derivatives of a complex-valued function. The proof begins by defining the functions $F(x, y) = \int_0^y f(x, t) \, dt$ and $G(x, y) = \int_0^x g(t, y) \, dt$, and then applying the Cauchy-Riemann equations to these functions. The details of the proof are given in the appendix.

In the context of ocean acoustics, Green's theorem is used to solve the wave equation, which describes the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. The wave equation can be written in the form of Green's theorem, with $f(x, y)$ and $g(x, y)$ representing the components of the sound field in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. By applying Green's theorem to the wave equation, we can obtain a solution for the sound field in terms of the Green's function, which represents the response of the medium to a unit source.

In the next section, we will discuss the applications of Green's theorem in ocean acoustics, including its use in modeling sound propagation and analyzing sound fields.

#### 2.2b Green's Theorem in Unbounded Media

In the previous section, we discussed Green's theorem in the context of a simply connected domain. However, in many practical applications, such as in ocean acoustics, we often deal with unbounded media. In this section, we will extend Green's theorem to these unbounded media.

The extension of Green's theorem to unbounded media is based on the concept of the Green's function in unbounded media. The Green's function $G(x, y)$ in unbounded media is defined as the solution to the wave equation with a unit source at $(x, y)$ and zero boundary conditions. The Green's function satisfies the following properties:

1. The Green's function is symmetric, i.e., $G(x, y) = G(y, x)$.
2. The Green's function satisfies the wave equation, i.e., $\frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial y^2} = 0$.
3. The Green's function is continuous in the entire plane, except at the source point $(x, y)$, where it has a pole of order 2.
4. The Green's function satisfies the radiation condition, i.e., $|G(x, y)| \leq C/|x - y|$ as $|x - y| \to \infty$.

Using these properties, we can extend Green's theorem to unbounded media. The extended theorem states that if $f(x, y)$ and $g(x, y)$ are continuous functions on the plane, and if $f$ and $g$ have continuous first-order partial derivatives on the plane, then the following identity holds:

$$
\int\int_{\mathbb{R}^2} \left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right) f(x, y) \, dx \, dy = \int\int_{\mathbb{R}^2} \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}\right) g(x, y) \, dx \, dy
$$

The proof of this extended theorem is similar to the proof of the original Green's theorem, but it requires some additional considerations due to the presence of the Green's function. The details of the proof are given in the appendix.

In the context of ocean acoustics, the extended Green's theorem is used to solve the wave equation in unbounded media, such as the ocean. The wave equation can be written in the form of Green's theorem, with $f(x, y)$ and $g(x, y)$ representing the components of the sound field in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. By applying the extended Green's theorem to the wave equation, we can obtain a solution for the sound field in terms of the Green's function.

#### 2.2c Applications in Ocean Acoustics

In the field of ocean acoustics, Green's theorem plays a crucial role in understanding the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. The ocean is an unbounded medium, and the properties of the Green's function in unbounded media are particularly relevant in this context.

One of the key applications of Green's theorem in ocean acoustics is in the modeling of sound propagation. The wave equation, which describes the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, can be written in the form of Green's theorem. This allows us to solve the wave equation for the sound field in the ocean, given the Green's function.

The Green's function in the ocean is particularly important due to the presence of boundaries, such as the ocean floor and the surface. These boundaries can significantly affect the propagation of sound waves, and the Green's function takes these effects into account. For example, the Green's function satisfies the radiation condition, which ensures that the sound waves do not increase without bound as they propagate away from the source.

Another important application of Green's theorem in ocean acoustics is in the analysis of sound fields. The Green's theorem provides a method for calculating the sound field at any point in the ocean, given the Green's function. This allows us to analyze the effects of different sources on the sound field, and to predict the behavior of the sound field in response to changes in the source or the medium.

In addition to these applications, Green's theorem is also used in the design and optimization of sources in the ocean. By convolving the Green's function with the source function, we can obtain the sound field at any point in the ocean. This allows us to design sources that emit sound in a desired manner, or to optimize the emission of sound from a source.

In conclusion, Green's theorem is a powerful tool in the field of ocean acoustics. Its applications range from the modeling of sound propagation to the analysis of sound fields and the design of sources. The properties of the Green's function in unbounded media, particularly in the presence of boundaries, make it a crucial concept in understanding the behavior of sound waves in the ocean.




#### 2.2b Applications in Acoustic Wave Propagation

Green's theorem has a wide range of applications in the field of ocean acoustics. One of the most significant applications is in the study of acoustic wave propagation. The theorem provides a powerful tool for solving the wave equation, which describes the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.

The wave equation can be written in the form of Green's theorem, with $f(x, y)$ and $g(x, y)$ representing the components of the sound field in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. By applying Green's theorem to the wave equation, we can obtain a solution for the sound field in terms of the Green's function, which represents the response of the medium to a unit source.

The Green's function is particularly useful in the study of acoustic wave propagation. It allows us to calculate the response of the medium to any source, not just a unit source. This is achieved by multiplying the Green's function by the source term, which represents the strength and location of the source. The resulting function gives the response of the medium to the source.

In the context of ocean acoustics, the Green's function can be used to model the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. This is particularly useful in the study of underwater acoustics, where sound waves can travel long distances and interact with complex underwater environments.

The Green's function can also be used to study the effects of boundaries on acoustic wave propagation. In the context of ocean acoustics, boundaries can include the ocean surface, the seafloor, and the interface between different layers of water. By incorporating these boundaries into the Green's function, we can study how they affect the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.

In conclusion, Green's theorem and its applications in acoustic wave propagation provide a powerful tool for studying sound waves in the ocean. By providing a solution to the wave equation in terms of the Green's function, we can gain a deeper understanding of how sound waves propagate in the ocean and how they interact with various boundaries.

#### 2.2c Numerical Implementation

The numerical implementation of Green's theorem in the context of acoustic wave propagation is a crucial aspect of computational ocean acoustics. This section will discuss the numerical methods used to solve the wave equation using Green's theorem.

The wave equation can be written in the form of Green's theorem as follows:

$$
\int\int_D \left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right) f(x, y) \, dx \, dy = \int\int_D \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}\right) g(x, y) \, dx \, dy
$$

where $f(x, y)$ and $g(x, y)$ are the components of the sound field in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. The Green's function $G(x, y)$ is the solution to this equation.

The numerical implementation of Green's theorem involves discretizing the domain $D$ into a grid and approximating the derivatives in the equation using finite difference approximations. This results in a system of linear equations that can be solved to obtain an approximation of the Green's function.

The system of equations can be written as:

$$
\sum_{i,j} \left(\frac{\partial g_i}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial y}\right) f_i = \sum_{i,j} \left(\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial g_i}{\partial y}\right) g_i
$$

where $f_i$ and $g_i$ are the approximations of $f(x, y)$ and $g(x, y)$ at the grid points $(x_i, y_i)$, respectively.

The system of equations can be solved using various numerical methods, such as the Gauss-Seidel method or the conjugate gradient method. The choice of method depends on the size and complexity of the system of equations.

In the context of ocean acoustics, the numerical implementation of Green's theorem can be used to model the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. This is particularly useful in the study of underwater acoustics, where sound waves can travel long distances and interact with complex underwater environments.

The Green's function obtained from the numerical implementation can be used to study the effects of boundaries on acoustic wave propagation. In the context of ocean acoustics, boundaries can include the ocean surface, the seafloor, and the interface between different layers of water. By incorporating these boundaries into the Green's function, we can study how they affect the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.

In conclusion, the numerical implementation of Green's theorem is a powerful tool in the study of acoustic wave propagation in the ocean. It allows us to model the propagation of sound waves in complex underwater environments and study the effects of boundaries on wave propagation.




#### 2.2c Green's Theorem in Bounded Media

In the previous section, we discussed the application of Green's theorem in unbounded media. In this section, we will extend our discussion to bounded media, where the medium is confined within a finite region.

In bounded media, the Green's function is no longer a simple function of the position vector, but rather a function of the position vector and the boundary conditions of the medium. This is because the boundary conditions can affect the propagation of sound waves, and therefore need to be incorporated into the Green's function.

The Green's function in bounded media can be written as $G(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r}_0; \mathbf{n})$, where $\mathbf{r}$ is the position vector, $\mathbf{r}_0$ is the position of the source, and $\mathbf{n}$ is the unit normal vector to the boundary at $\mathbf{r}_0$. The Green's function represents the response of the medium to a unit source at $\mathbf{r}_0$, under the boundary conditions specified by $\mathbf{n}$.

The boundary conditions can be represented as a set of equations, known as the boundary conditions equations, which relate the Green's function to the boundary conditions. These equations can be derived from the physical properties of the medium, such as its density and elasticity.

The boundary conditions equations can be used to solve for the Green's function, and therefore the response of the medium to any source. This is achieved by substituting the boundary conditions equations into the Green's function equation, and solving for the unknown Green's function.

In the context of ocean acoustics, the boundary conditions can represent the properties of the ocean, such as its salinity, temperature, and depth. By incorporating these boundary conditions into the Green's function, we can study the propagation of sound waves in the ocean under different conditions.

In the next section, we will discuss some specific examples of boundary conditions and how they affect the Green's function in ocean acoustics.

#### 3.1a Introduction to Integral Transform Solutions

In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of reflection and transmission in computational ocean acoustics. We discussed the fundamental principles, mathematical models, and practical applications of these phenomena. In this section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical aspects of reflection and transmission by introducing the integral transform solution.

The integral transform solution is a powerful mathematical tool used to solve problems involving reflection and transmission. It allows us to express the reflection and transmission coefficients in terms of the properties of the media involved. This solution is particularly useful in the study of ocean acoustics, where the properties of the media can vary significantly.

The integral transform solution is based on the principle of superposition, which states that the total response of a system is the sum of the individual responses of each input. In the context of reflection and transmission, this principle can be applied to the incident wave and the reflected wave. The integral transform solution then allows us to express the reflection and transmission coefficients in terms of the incident wave and the properties of the media.

The integral transform solution is particularly useful in the study of ocean acoustics, where the properties of the media can vary significantly. For example, the speed of sound in water can vary with depth, temperature, and salinity. The integral transform solution allows us to account for these variations and calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients accurately.

In the following sections, we will explore the integral transform solution in more detail. We will discuss its derivation, its properties, and its applications in the study of reflection and transmission in computational ocean acoustics. We will also provide examples and exercises to help you understand and apply the integral transform solution.

#### 3.1b Derivation of Integral Transform Solutions

The integral transform solution is derived from the principle of superposition, which states that the total response of a system is the sum of the individual responses of each input. In the context of reflection and transmission, this principle can be applied to the incident wave and the reflected wave.

Let's consider a wave incident on a boundary between two media. The incident wave can be represented as $Ae^{i(k_xx+k_yy-\omega t)}$, where $A$ is the amplitude, $k_x$ and $k_y$ are the wave numbers in the x and y directions, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency. The reflected wave can be represented as $Be^{i(k_xx+k_yy-\omega t)}$, where $B$ is the reflection coefficient.

According to the principle of superposition, the total wave can be represented as $Ae^{i(k_xx+k_yy-\omega t)} + Be^{i(k_xx+k_yy-\omega t)}$. The reflection coefficient $B$ can then be expressed in terms of the incident wave and the properties of the media.

The integral transform solution is particularly useful in the study of ocean acoustics, where the properties of the media can vary significantly. For example, the speed of sound in water can vary with depth, temperature, and salinity. The integral transform solution allows us to account for these variations and calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients accurately.

In the following sections, we will explore the integral transform solution in more detail. We will discuss its properties, its applications, and provide examples and exercises to help you understand and apply the integral transform solution.

#### 3.1c Applications of Integral Transform Solutions

The integral transform solution has a wide range of applications in the field of computational ocean acoustics. It is particularly useful in the study of reflection and transmission phenomena, which are fundamental to understanding how sound waves behave in the ocean.

One of the key applications of the integral transform solution is in the study of the ocean's acoustic properties. The ocean is a complex medium, with its acoustic properties varying significantly with depth, temperature, and salinity. The integral transform solution allows us to account for these variations and calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients accurately.

For example, consider a wave incident on a boundary between two layers of water with different salinities. The speed of sound in water is directly proportional to its salinity, so the wave will travel faster in the layer with higher salinity. The integral transform solution can be used to calculate the reflection coefficient at this boundary, taking into account the different speeds of sound in the two layers.

Another important application of the integral transform solution is in the design and analysis of sonar systems. Sonar systems rely on the reflection and transmission of sound waves to detect objects in the water. The integral transform solution can be used to calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients for different types of objects, allowing us to optimize the design of sonar systems for different conditions.

The integral transform solution also has applications in the study of ocean acoustics in the presence of noise. Noise can significantly affect the accuracy of acoustic measurements, but the integral transform solution can be used to account for noise and improve the accuracy of these measurements.

In the following sections, we will explore these applications in more detail, providing examples and exercises to help you understand and apply the integral transform solution. We will also discuss the limitations and future directions of this approach.

For example, consider a sound wave incident on the interface between two layers of water with different properties. The integral transform solution can be used to calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients for this system. These coefficients can then be used to predict the behavior of the sound wave as it propagates through the ocean.

##### 3.1b.2 Underwater Imaging

The integral transform solution also has applications in underwater imaging. In this field, sound waves are used to create images of objects underwater. The reflection and transmission of sound waves at the interface between different media play a crucial role in the formation of these images.

The integral transform solution can be used to calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients for different media, allowing us to predict the behavior of sound waves in the ocean. This information can then be used to design more effective imaging systems.

While the integral transform solution has proven to be a powerful tool in the study of reflection and transmission in computational ocean acoustics, it is not without its challenges. These challenges, along with potential future directions, are discussed below.

##### 3.1c.1 Complexity of the Ocean Environment

The ocean is a complex environment with a wide range of properties that can affect the behavior of sound waves. These properties include depth, temperature, salinity, and the presence of various types of marine life. The integral transform solution, while powerful, can be difficult to apply in such a complex environment due to the need to account for all of these variables.

Future research in this area could focus on developing more sophisticated models that can account for these complexities. This could involve incorporating more detailed information about the ocean environment into the integral transform solution, or developing new methods that can handle this complexity more effectively.

##### 3.1c.2 Limitations of the Integral Transform Solution

The integral transform solution is based on the assumption that the media involved are homogeneous and isotropic. In reality, this is often not the case in the ocean. For example, the ocean floor can be rough, and the water can have varying properties due to temperature and salinity gradients.

Future research could focus on extending the integral transform solution to handle non-homogeneous and non-isotropic media. This could involve developing new mathematical techniques, or exploring the limitations of the current solution in more detail.

##### 3.1c.3 Computational Challenges

The integral transform solution involves solving a complex integral equation, which can be computationally intensive. This can be a challenge when dealing with large-scale problems, such as those encountered in ocean acoustics.

Future research could focus on developing more efficient computational methods for solving the integral transform equation. This could involve using parallel computing techniques, or developing new numerical methods that can handle the complexity of the equation more effectively.

##### 3.1c.4 Applications in Other Fields

While the integral transform solution has been primarily applied to ocean acoustics, there is potential for its use in other fields. For example, it could be applied to other areas of acoustics, such as underwater acoustics or acoustics in general.

Future research could focus on exploring these potential applications, and developing new methods for applying the integral transform solution in these areas.

##### 3.1c.1 Reflection and Transmission at a Water-Air Interface

Consider a sound wave incident on the interface between water and air. The integral transform solution can be used to calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients for this system. These coefficients can then be used to predict the behavior of the sound wave as it propagates through the air.

The reflection coefficient, $R$, and the transmission coefficient, $T$, can be calculated using the following equations:

$$
R = \left|\frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_2 + Z_1}\right|^2
$$

$$
T = 1 - R = \frac{4Z_1Z_2}{\left(Z_2 + Z_1\right)^2}
$$

where $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are the acoustic impedances of the water and air, respectively.

##### 3.1c.2 Reflection and Transmission at a Water-Ice Interface

In the winter, sound waves can also be incident on the interface between water and ice. The integral transform solution can be used to calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients for this system as well.

The reflection coefficient, $R$, and the transmission coefficient, $T$, can be calculated using the same equations as above, but with the acoustic impedances of the water and ice.

##### 3.1c.3 Reflection and Transmission at a Water-Oil Interface

These case studies illustrate the versatility of the integral transform solution in the study of reflection and transmission in computational ocean acoustics. By accounting for the variations in the properties of different media, the integral transform solution allows us to accurately predict the behavior of sound waves in the ocean.




#### 3.2a Introduction to Half-space Sources

In the previous sections, we have discussed the reflection and transmission of sound waves at various interfaces. Now, we will delve into the concept of half-space sources and their role in computational ocean acoustics.

A half-space source is a source of sound waves that is confined to a half-space. This could be a source located in the water column, for instance. The sound waves emitted by such a source can be described using the integral transform solution, similar to the reflection and transmission at interfaces.

The integral transform solution for a half-space source can be derived using the method of images. This method involves imagining a mirror image of the source in the other half-space, and then solving the problem for the combined source and image. The solution for the original source can then be obtained by subtracting the solution for the image.

The integral transform solution for a half-space source can be used to calculate the pressure field in the water column. This can be particularly useful in understanding the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, and in designing acoustic devices such as sonars.

In the following sections, we will explore the integral transform solution for half-space sources in more detail, and discuss its applications in computational ocean acoustics.

#### 3.2b Field Equations for Half-space Sources

The field equations for half-space sources are derived from the integral transform solution. These equations describe the pressure field in the water column due to a half-space source. 

The field equations for a half-space source can be written as:

$$
p(x,y,z) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\delta(x'-x)\delta(y'-y)\delta(z'-z)}{4\pi\sqrt{x'^2+y'^2+z'^2}} p_0(x',y',z') dx' dy' dz'
$$

where $p(x,y,z)$ is the pressure field at a point $(x,y,z)$ in the water column, $p_0(x',y',z')$ is the pressure at the source point $(x',y',z')$, and $\delta(x)$ is the Dirac delta function.

The integral in the above equation represents the summation over all points in the half-space source. The Dirac delta functions ensure that the integral is non-zero only at the source point.

The field equations for a half-space source can be used to calculate the pressure field in the water column due to the source. This can be particularly useful in understanding the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, and in designing acoustic devices such as sonars.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of these field equations in the context of half-space sources.

#### 3.2c Applications of Half-space Sources

The applications of half-space sources in computational ocean acoustics are vast and varied. They are used in a wide range of fields, including but not limited to, underwater acoustics, sonar technology, and oceanographic research.

One of the primary applications of half-space sources is in the design and operation of sonars. Sonars, or sound navigation and ranging systems, are used to detect and locate objects underwater. The field equations for half-space sources, as discussed in the previous section, are used to calculate the pressure field in the water column due to the sonar source. This information is then used to determine the location and characteristics of objects in the water.

Half-space sources are also used in oceanographic research. By understanding the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, researchers can gain insights into the physical properties of the ocean, such as its depth and temperature. The field equations for half-space sources are used to model the pressure field in the water column, which can then be compared with real-world measurements to validate oceanographic models.

In addition to these applications, half-space sources are also used in the design of acoustic devices. For instance, they are used in the design of acoustic cameras, which are used to image the underwater environment. The field equations for half-space sources are used to calculate the pressure field in the water column due to the source, which can then be used to reconstruct an image of the underwater environment.

#### 3.2b Mathematical Representation

The mathematical representation of a half-space source is crucial for understanding the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. This representation is based on the field equations derived from the integral transform solution.

The mathematical representation of a half-space source can be written as:

$$
p(x,y,z) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\delta(x'-x)\delta(y'-y)\delta(z'-z)}{4\pi\sqrt{x'^2+y'^2+z'^2}} p_0(x',y',z') dx' dy' dz'
$$

This equation represents the pressure field at a point $(x,y,z)$ in the water column due to a source at $(x',y',z')$. The delta functions in the equation ensure that the pressure at a point is only influenced by the source at that point.

The integral transform solution, from which this equation is derived, is a powerful tool for understanding the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. It allows us to calculate the pressure field at any point in the water column due to a source at any point in the half-space.

### Subsection: 4.1a Introduction to Pekeris Waveguide

The Pekeris waveguide is a type of ideal waveguide that is commonly used in computational ocean acoustics. It is named after the Dutch physicist and mathematician Willem Hendrik Pekeris, who first described the waveguide in 1948. The Pekeris waveguide is a cylindrical structure that guides and confines electromagnetic waves, including sound waves.

The Pekeris waveguide is defined by two concentric cylinders, with the inner cylinder representing the core of the waveguide and the outer cylinder representing the cladding. The core and cladding are typically made of different materials, with the core being a good conductor of sound and the cladding being a poor conductor. This creates a boundary between the core and the cladding, which is where the waveguide's confinement of sound waves occurs.

The behavior of sound waves in a Pekeris waveguide is governed by the wave equation, which describes how the wave's amplitude, phase, and frequency change over time and space. The wave equation for a Pekeris waveguide can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $p$ is the pressure of the sound wave, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the speed of sound in the medium.

The solutions to this equation represent the different modes of propagation that the waveguide can support. These modes are characterized by their propagation constant, which is a measure of how much the wave's phase changes over a certain distance. The propagation constant is given by:

$$
\beta = \sqrt{k^2 - k_z^2}
$$

where $k$ is the wave number and $k_z$ is the propagation constant in the z-direction.

The Pekeris waveguide has many applications in ocean acoustics. It is used to model and predict the behavior of sound waves in the ocean, as well as in the design and optimization of acoustic systems. However, like all ideal waveguides, the Pekeris waveguide has its limitations and challenges. For example, it assumes that the waveguide is perfectly cylindrical and that the core and cladding materials are perfectly uniform. In reality, these assumptions are often not met, leading to deviations from the ideal behavior of the waveguide.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the theory behind the Pekeris waveguide, discussing the wave equation and its solutions in more detail. We will also explore the applications of the Pekeris waveguide in ocean acoustics, including its role in the design and optimization of acoustic systems.




### Subsection: 4.1b Mathematical Model

The mathematical model of the Pekeris waveguide is based on the wave equation, which describes the propagation of sound waves in a medium. The wave equation for the Pekeris waveguide can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $p$ is the pressure of the sound wave, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the speed of sound in the medium.

The solutions to this equation represent the different modes of propagation that the waveguide can support. These modes are characterized by their propagation constant, which is a measure of how much the wave's phase changes over a certain distance. The propagation constant is given by:

$$
\beta = \sqrt{k^2 - k_z^2}
$$

where $k$ is the wave number and $k_z$ is the propagation constant in the z-direction.

The Pekeris waveguide is a cylindrical structure, and the wave equation can be solved for different boundary conditions depending on the properties of the core and cladding materials. For example, if the core and cladding are made of the same material, the wave equation can be solved with the boundary condition that the wave's amplitude is continuous at the boundary. If the core and cladding are made of different materials, the wave equation can be solved with the boundary condition that the wave's amplitude is discontinuous at the boundary.

The mathematical model of the Pekeris waveguide can be used to predict the behavior of sound waves in the waveguide, such as their propagation constant and mode structure. This model is essential for understanding the behavior of sound waves in the ocean, as the ocean can be modeled as a Pekeris waveguide with the ocean floor representing the core and the water column representing the cladding.

### Subsection: 4.1c Applications in Ocean Acoustics

The Pekeris waveguide model has been widely used in ocean acoustics to study the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. The ocean can be modeled as a Pekeris waveguide, with the ocean floor representing the core and the water column representing the cladding. This model allows us to understand the behavior of sound waves in the ocean, which is crucial for many applications such as underwater communication, sonar, and acoustic tomography.

One of the key applications of the Pekeris waveguide model in ocean acoustics is in the study of sound propagation in the ocean. The model can be used to predict the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, including their mode structure and propagation constant. This is important for understanding how sound waves travel through the ocean, and how they are affected by factors such as ocean depth, water density, and the presence of obstacles.

The Pekeris waveguide model is also used in the design and optimization of underwater communication systems. By understanding the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, engineers can design systems that can effectively transmit and receive signals. This is crucial for applications such as underwater communication between submarines and surface vessels, as well as for acoustic modems used for positioning and navigation.

In addition, the Pekeris waveguide model is used in the development of sonar systems. Sonar systems use sound waves to detect and locate objects underwater, and the model can be used to predict the behavior of these sound waves in the ocean. This is important for optimizing the performance of sonar systems, and for understanding the limitations of their detection capabilities.

Finally, the Pekeris waveguide model is used in the field of acoustic tomography, which is a technique used to image the ocean floor. Acoustic tomography uses sound waves to create images of the ocean floor, and the model can be used to understand how these sound waves propagate through the ocean. This is crucial for interpreting the images created by acoustic tomography, and for understanding the structure and properties of the ocean floor.

In conclusion, the Pekeris waveguide model is a powerful tool in the field of ocean acoustics. Its applications range from understanding sound propagation in the ocean to the design of underwater communication systems and sonar. By studying the behavior of sound waves in the ocean, we can gain a deeper understanding of the ocean and its properties, and develop more effective technologies for exploring and utilizing the ocean.

The model has been used to predict the behavior of sound waves in the ocean, such as their propagation constant and mode structure. This has been particularly useful in understanding the effects of the ocean floor and water column on sound propagation.

Another application of the Pekeris waveguide model is in the design and analysis of underwater acoustic devices. The model has been used to predict the behavior of sound waves in the ocean, which is crucial in designing devices such as sonar systems and underwater communication systems.

The Pekeris waveguide model has also been used in case studies to investigate specific phenomena in ocean acoustics. For example, it has been used to study the effects of ocean currents on sound propagation, and to investigate the impact of ocean floor topography on sound propagation.

In addition to these applications, the Pekeris waveguide model has also been used in theoretical studies to explore the fundamental principles of sound propagation in the ocean. This has led to a deeper understanding of the behavior of sound waves in the ocean, and has contributed to the development of more advanced models and theories in ocean acoustics.

Overall, the Pekeris waveguide model has been a valuable tool in the study of ocean acoustics.

### Section: 5.1 Layer Solutions and Interface Conditions:

In this section, we will explore the concept of layer solutions and interface conditions in the context of wavenumber integration. These concepts are crucial in understanding the behavior of ocean acoustic waves and their interactions with different layers of the ocean.

#### 5.1a Introduction to Layer Solutions

In the previous chapter, we discussed the concept of wavenumber integration and its applications in ocean acoustics. We saw how this technique allows us to analyze and understand the behavior of ocean acoustic waves. In this section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical foundations of wavenumber integration and explore the concept of layer solutions.

A layer solution is a solution to a differential equation that describes the behavior of a wave within a specific layer of the ocean. These layers can be defined based on various properties such as temperature, salinity, or density. The behavior of a wave within a layer is governed by the properties of that layer, and the interface between two layers can have a significant impact on the wave's behavior.

To understand the behavior of a wave within a layer, we can use the method of layer potentials. This method involves solving the differential equation for the wave within the layer and then using the boundary conditions at the interface to determine the behavior of the wave outside the layer. This approach allows us to analyze the behavior of a wave as it propagates through different layers of the ocean.

#### 5.1b Interface Conditions

The interface between two layers plays a crucial role in determining the behavior of a wave. The properties of the interface, such as its thickness and the properties of the layers on either side, can have a significant impact on the wave's behavior. To understand this behavior, we can use the concept of interface conditions.

Interface conditions are mathematical expressions that describe the behavior of a wave at the interface between two layers. These conditions are derived from the boundary conditions at the interface and can be used to determine the behavior of the wave outside the layer. They are essential in understanding the behavior of a wave as it propagates through different layers of the ocean.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of interface conditions and their applications in ocean acoustics. We will also discuss the advantages and limitations of using interface conditions in wavenumber integration.

### Equilibrium

The second condition that has to be satisfied for substructure assembly is the "force equilibrium" for matching interface forces <math>\mathbf g</math>. For the current example, this condition can be written as <math>
\mathbf g_2^A = -\mathbf g_2^B
</math>. Similar to the compatibility equation, the force equilibrium condition can be expressed using a Boolean matrix. Use is made of the transpose of the Boolean localisation matrix <math> \mathbf L </math> that was introduced to write compatibility:
\mathbf L^T \mathbf g = \mathbf 0 
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\mathbf g_1^A = \mathbf 0 \\
\mathbf g_2^A + \mathbf g_2^B = \mathbf 0 \\
\mathbf g_3^B = \mathbf 0
</math>

The equations for <math>\mathbf g_1</math> and <math>\mathbf g_3</math> state that the interface forces on internal nodes are zero, hence not present. The equation for <math>\mathbf g_2</math> correctly establishes the force equilibrium between a matching pair of interface DoFs according to Newton's third law.

A second notation in which the equilibrium condition can be expressed is by introducing a set of Lagrange multipliers <math>\boldsymbol \lambda </math>. The substitution of these Lagrange multipliers is possible as <math> \mathbf g_2^A </math> and <math> \mathbf g_2^B </math> differ only in sign, not in value. Using again the signed Boolean matrix <math>
\mathbf B
</math>:

\mathbf g = -\mathbf B^T \boldsymbol{\lambda} 
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\mathbf g_1^A = \mathbf 0 \\
\mathbf g_2^A = \boldsymbol{\lambda}\\
\mathbf g_2^B = -\boldsymbol{\lambda}\\
\mathbf g_3^B =\mathbf 0 \\
</math>

The set <math>\boldsymbol{\lambda}</math> defines the intensity of the interface forces <math>\mathbf g_2</math>. Each Lagrange multiplier represents the magnitude of two matching interface forces in the assembly. By defining the interface forces <math>\mathbf g</math> using Lagrange multipliers <math>\boldsymbol \lambda </math>, force equilibrium is automatically satisfied. This approach allows us to analyze the behavior of a wave as it propagates through different layers of the ocean, taking into account the interface conditions between each layer.

#### 5.1c Applications of Layer Solutions and Interface Conditions

The concept of layer solutions and interface conditions has numerous applications in ocean acoustics. One such application is in the study of sound propagation in the ocean. By understanding the behavior of a wave as it propagates through different layers of the ocean, we can better predict and model sound propagation in the ocean.

Another important application is in the design and analysis of underwater structures. By considering the interface conditions between different layers, we can ensure that the structure is stable and can withstand the forces exerted by the surrounding water.

Furthermore, the concept of layer solutions and interface conditions is also crucial in the study of ocean currents. By understanding the behavior of a wave as it propagates through different layers, we can better understand the movement of water in the ocean and its impact on marine life.

In conclusion, the concept of layer solutions and interface conditions is a fundamental aspect of ocean acoustics. By understanding the behavior of a wave as it propagates through different layers of the ocean, we can gain valuable insights into various phenomena such as sound propagation, underwater structures, and ocean currents.

### Section: 5.2 Global Matrix Solution:

The global matrix solution is a powerful method for solving linear systems, particularly those that arise in the field of computational ocean acoustics. This method is based on the concept of the global matrix, which is a matrix that represents the entire system of equations. The global matrix solution involves finding the solution vector that minimizes the residual, which is the difference between the right-hand side vector and the product of the global matrix and the solution vector.

#### 5.2a Introduction to Global Matrix Solution

The global matrix solution is a variant of the Arnoldi/Lanczos iteration, which is a method for solving linear systems. The Arnoldi iteration starts with a vector $\boldsymbol{r}_0$ and gradually builds an orthonormal basis $\{\boldsymbol{v}_1,\boldsymbol{v}_2,\boldsymbol{v}_3,\ldots\}$ of the Krylov subspace by defining $\boldsymbol{v}_i=\boldsymbol{w}_i/\lVert\boldsymbol{w}_i\rVert_2$ where

$$
\boldsymbol{w}_i = \boldsymbol{Av}_{i-1} - \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} \boldsymbol{v}_j \boldsymbol{v}_j^\mathrm{T} \boldsymbol{Av}_{i-1}
$$

for $i>1$, and $\boldsymbol{v}_1 = \boldsymbol{Av}_0 - \boldsymbol{b}$. The Krylov subspace is then spanned by the vectors $\{\boldsymbol{v}_1,\boldsymbol{v}_2,\boldsymbol{v}_3,\ldots\}$, and the solution vector $\boldsymbol{x}$ is approximated as $\boldsymbol{x} \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} \boldsymbol{v}_i \boldsymbol{v}_i^\mathrm{T} \boldsymbol{r}_0$.

The global matrix solution involves finding the solution vector $\boldsymbol{x}$ that minimizes the residual $\boldsymbol{r} = \boldsymbol{b} - \boldsymbol{Ax}$. This is achieved by solving the linear system $\boldsymbol{Ax} = \boldsymbol{b}$, where $\boldsymbol{A}$ is the global matrix and $\boldsymbol{b}$ is the right-hand side vector. The global matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ is a sparse matrix, and its structure is determined by the structure of the system of equations.

The global matrix solution is particularly useful in computational ocean acoustics, where the system of equations often arises from the discretization of the wave equation. The global matrix solution allows for the efficient computation of the solution vector, which represents the acoustic field at any point in the ocean. This is crucial for understanding and predicting the behavior of sound waves in the ocean, and for designing effective sonar systems.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the global matrix solution, discussing its properties, its implementation, and its applications in computational ocean acoustics.

#### 5.2b Solving Global Matrix Equations

The global matrix solution involves solving a system of linear equations represented by the global matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$. This is typically achieved using iterative methods, such as the Gauss-Seidel method or the conjugate gradient method.

The Gauss-Seidel method is a simple and intuitive iterative method for solving linear systems. It starts with an initial guess for the solution vector $\boldsymbol{x}_0$ and iteratively updates the solution vector until it converges to the true solution. The update equation for the Gauss-Seidel method is given by

$$
\boldsymbol{x}_{n+1} = \boldsymbol{x}_n + \boldsymbol{r}_n
$$

where $\boldsymbol{r}_n$ is the residual at the $n$-th iteration, and is calculated as

$$
\boldsymbol{r}_n = \boldsymbol{b} - \boldsymbol{Ax}_n
$$

The conjugate gradient method, on the other hand, is a more sophisticated iterative method that is particularly effective for solving large, sparse linear systems. It is based on the Arnoldi/Lanczos iteration, and involves building an orthonormal basis of the Krylov subspace, as discussed in the previous section. The update equation for the conjugate gradient method is given by

$$
\boldsymbol{x}_{n+1} = \boldsymbol{x}_n + \boldsymbol{V}_n \boldsymbol{y}_n
$$

where $\boldsymbol{V}_n$ is the matrix of the Krylov basis vectors, and $\boldsymbol{y}_n$ is the solution vector at the $n$-th iteration. The solution vector is then updated at each iteration until it converges to the true solution.

Both the Gauss-Seidel method and the conjugate gradient method have their advantages and disadvantages. The Gauss-Seidel method is simple to implement and requires little memory, but it may not converge for ill-conditioned systems. The conjugate gradient method, on the other hand, is more complex to implement but can handle ill-conditioned systems and often converges faster than the Gauss-Seidel method.

In the context of computational ocean acoustics, the global matrix solution allows for the efficient computation of the acoustic field at any point in the ocean. This is crucial for understanding and predicting the behavior of sound waves in the ocean, and for designing effective sonar systems.

#### 5.2c Applications in Wavenumber Integration

Wavenumber integration is a powerful tool in computational ocean acoustics, particularly in the context of the global matrix solution. It allows for the efficient computation of the acoustic field at any point in the ocean, which is crucial for understanding and predicting the behavior of sound waves in the ocean.

The global matrix solution, as discussed in the previous section, involves solving a system of linear equations represented by the global matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$. This is typically achieved using iterative methods, such as the Gauss-Seidel method or the conjugate gradient method. The conjugate gradient method, in particular, is particularly effective for solving large, sparse linear systems, which are often encountered in computational ocean acoustics.

Wavenumber integration is used in the conjugate gradient method to build an orthonormal basis of the Krylov subspace. This is achieved by defining $\boldsymbol{v}_i=\boldsymbol{w}_i/\lVert\boldsymbol{w}_i\rVert_2$ where

$$
\boldsymbol{w}_i = \boldsymbol{Av}_{i-1} - \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} \boldsymbol{v}_j \boldsymbol{v}_j^\mathrm{T} \boldsymbol{Av}_{i-1}
$$

for $i>1$, and $\boldsymbol{v}_1 = \boldsymbol{Av}_0 - \boldsymbol{b}$. The Krylov subspace is then spanned by the vectors $\{\boldsymbol{v}_1,\boldsymbol{v}_2,\boldsymbol{v}_3,\ldots\}$, and the solution vector $\boldsymbol{x}$ is approximated as $\boldsymbol{x} \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} \boldsymbol{v}_i \boldsymbol{v}_i^\mathrm{T} \boldsymbol{r}_0$.

Wavenumber integration is also used in the Gauss-Seidel method, where the residual $\boldsymbol{r}_n$ is calculated as

$$
\boldsymbol{r}_n = \boldsymbol{b} - \boldsymbol{Ax}_n
$$

The residual is then used to update the solution vector at each iteration, until it converges to the true solution.

In conclusion, wavenumber integration plays a crucial role in the global matrix solution, which is a powerful method for solving linear systems in computational ocean acoustics. It allows for the efficient computation of the acoustic field at any point in the ocean, which is crucial for understanding and predicting the behavior of sound waves in the ocean.

#### 5.2b Mathematical Representation

The global matrix solution can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
\boldsymbol{Ax} = \boldsymbol{b}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{A}$ is the global matrix, $\boldsymbol{x}$ is the solution vector, and $\boldsymbol{b}$ is the right-hand side vector. The global matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ is a sparse matrix, and its structure is determined by the structure of the system of equations.

The global matrix solution involves finding the solution vector $\boldsymbol{x}$ that minimizes the residual $\boldsymbol{r} = \boldsymbol{b} - \boldsymbol{Ax}$. This is achieved by solving the linear system $\boldsymbol{Ax} = \boldsymbol{b}$, where $\boldsymbol{A}$ is the global matrix and $\boldsymbol{b}$ is the right-hand side vector.

The global matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ can be represented as a sum of outer products of the vectors $\{\boldsymbol{v}_1,\boldsymbol{v}_2,\boldsymbol{v}_3,\ldots\}$, i.e.,

$$
\boldsymbol{A} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \boldsymbol{v}_i \boldsymbol{v}_i^\mathrm{T}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{v}_i$ are the orthonormal basis vectors of the Krylov subspace. The solution vector $\boldsymbol{x}$ can then be approximated as

$$
\boldsymbol{x} \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} \boldsymbol{v}_i \boldsymbol{v}_i^\mathrm{T} \boldsymbol{r}_0
$$

where $\boldsymbol{r}_0 = \boldsymbol{b} - \boldsymbol{Ax}$.

The global matrix solution is a powerful method for solving linear systems, particularly those that arise in the field of computational ocean acoustics. It is a variant of the Arnoldi/Lanczos iteration, which is a method for solving linear systems. The Arnoldi iteration starts with a vector $\boldsymbol{r}_0$ and gradually builds an orthonormal basis $\{\boldsymbol{v}_1,\boldsymbol{v}_2,\boldsymbol{v}_3,\ldots\}$ of the Krylov subspace by defining $\boldsymbol{v}_i=\boldsymbol{w}_i/\lVert\boldsymbol{w}_i\rVert_2$ where

The global matrix solution, as discussed in the previous sections, is a powerful method for solving linear systems. In the field of computational ocean acoustics, this method has found numerous applications. One such application is in the modeling of sound propagation in the ocean.

The propagation of sound in the ocean is governed by the wave equation, which is a linear partial differential equation. The solution to this equation can be represented as a sum of plane waves, each with a specific wavenumber and direction. The global matrix solution provides a method to solve this equation numerically, by discretizing the ocean into a grid of points and approximating the solution at each point.

The global matrix solution is particularly useful in the context of ocean acoustics because it allows for the efficient computation of the sound field at any point in the ocean. This is achieved by solving the wave equation at each point in the ocean, and then using the global matrix solution to compute the sound field at any desired point.

The global matrix solution also allows for the incorporation of boundary conditions, which are essential in the modeling of sound propagation in the ocean. These boundary conditions can be represented as constraints on the solution vector $\boldsymbol{x}$, and can be incorporated into the global matrix solution by modifying the right-hand side vector $\boldsymbol{b}$.

In conclusion, the global matrix solution is a powerful tool in the field of computational ocean acoustics. It provides a method to solve the wave equation numerically, and allows for the efficient computation of the sound field at any point in the ocean. Its applications are not limited to sound propagation, and can be extended to other areas such as ocean current modeling and underwater acoustics.

#### 5.3a Introduction to Propagator Matrix

The propagator matrix, also known as the propagation matrix, is a fundamental concept in the field of computational ocean acoustics. It is a mathematical representation of the propagation of acoustic waves in the ocean, and it plays a crucial role in the solution of the linear systems that arise in the processing of ocean acoustic data.

The propagator matrix is a square matrix that represents the propagation of acoustic waves from one point in the ocean to another. It is defined as the product of the propagation matrices for each small segment of the path from the first point to the second. The propagation matrix for a small segment is approximately equal to the identity matrix, with a small correction term that accounts for the propagation of the wave during the time interval corresponding to the segment.

The propagator matrix is used in the global matrix solution, which is a powerful tool for solving linear systems. The global matrix solution involves the multiplication of the propagator matrix with the initial conditions at the first point, and the result is the solution at the second point. This process can be repeated for any number of points, allowing for the solution of the linear system at any point in the ocean.

The propagator matrix is also used in the invariant embedding solution, which is a method for solving the linear systems that arise in the processing of ocean acoustic data. The invariant embedding solution involves the construction of an invariant subspace of the propagator matrix, and the solution of the linear system is then found within this subspace.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the properties and applications of the propagator matrix, and we will explore its role in the global matrix solution and the invariant embedding solution.

The propagator matrix, as we have seen, is a fundamental concept in the field of computational ocean acoustics. It is a mathematical representation of the propagation of acoustic waves in the ocean, and it plays a crucial role in the solution of the linear systems that arise in the processing of ocean acoustic data. In this section, we will explore the relationship between the propagator matrix and the invariant embedding solution, a powerful method for solving these linear systems.

The invariant embedding solution involves the construction of an invariant subspace of the propagator matrix, and the solution of the linear system is then found within this subspace. This method is based on the principle of invariant embedding, which states that the solution of a linear system remains invariant under the action of the propagator matrix.

The invariant embedding solution can be formulated as follows:

Given a linear system represented by the propagator matrix $P$, and an initial condition vector $x_0$, the solution at time $t$ is given by the vector $x(t) = P^t x_0$, where $P^t$ is the t-th power of the propagator matrix.

The invariant embedding solution involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the propagator matrix. The eigenvalues of the propagator matrix represent the growth or decay rates of the linear system, while the eigenvectors represent the directions of growth or decay.

The invariant embedding solution can be written as:

$$
x(t) = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i^t x_i x_i^T x_0
$$

where $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of the propagator matrix, $x_i$ are the eigenvectors, and $n$ is the number of eigenvalues.

The invariant embedding solution provides a powerful method for solving the linear systems that arise in the processing of ocean acoustic data. It allows us to understand the behavior of the system over time, and to predict the future state of the system based on its current state.

## Chapter: Chapter 6: Ray Tracing

### Introduction

In the vast and complex world of ocean acoustics, the ability to accurately predict the path of sound waves is crucial. This is where the concept of ray tracing comes into play. Chapter 6, "Ray Tracing," delves into the theory and applications of this fundamental concept in computational ocean acoustics.

Ray tracing, in the context of ocean acoustics, is a mathematical model used to predict the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. It is a simplified model that assumes the sound waves travel in straight lines, or rays, and are not affected by the complex three-dimensional structure of the ocean. This model is particularly useful for large-scale predictions, where the details of the ocean's structure are not as important as the overall trend of the sound wave propagation.

In this chapter, we will explore the principles behind ray tracing, its assumptions, and its limitations. We will also discuss how ray tracing is used in various applications, from predicting the spread of underwater noise to designing effective sonar systems. 

We will also delve into the mathematical aspects of ray tracing, using the popular Markdown format and the MathJax library to render mathematical expressions. For example, we might represent the propagation of a sound wave as `$y_j(n)$`, where `$y_j(n)$` represents the amplitude of the sound wave at position `$j$` and time `$n$`.

#### 5.3b Invariant Embedding Solution

The invariant embedding solution is a powerful method for solving the linear systems that arise in the processing of ocean acoustic data. It is based on the concept of invariant subspaces, which are subspaces of a matrix that are preserved under multiplication by the matrix. In the context of the propagator matrix, an invariant subspace is a subspace that is preserved under the propagation of acoustic waves.

The invariant embedding solution involves the construction of an invariant subspace of the propagator matrix, and the solution of the linear system is then found within this subspace. This is achieved by finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the propagator matrix, and using these to construct the invariant subspace.

The eigenvalues of the propagator matrix represent the propagation speeds of the acoustic waves, while the eigenvectors represent the directions of propagation. By finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we can determine the propagation speeds and directions of the acoustic waves, and use this information to construct the invariant subspace.

The invariant subspace is then used to solve the linear system by projecting the initial conditions onto the subspace, and solving the resulting system within the subspace. This provides a solution to the linear system at any point in the ocean, and can be repeated for any number of points to solve the system at any point in the ocean.

The invariant embedding solution is particularly useful in the context of the global matrix solution, as it allows for the solution of the linear system at any point in the ocean. It is also useful in the context of the propagator matrix, as it provides a method for solving the linear system within the invariant subspace.

#### 5.4a Introduction to Numerical Evaluation

In the previous sections, we have discussed the theory behind wavenumber integration and its applications in ocean acoustics. However, in practical applications, we often encounter problems where the wavenumber integral cannot be solved analytically. In such cases, we need to resort to numerical methods for evaluating the wavenumber integral.

Numerical evaluation of the wavenumber integral involves discretizing the wavenumber domain into a finite set of points, and then evaluating the integral at these points. This approach is particularly useful when the wavenumber domain is continuous or infinite, and the integral cannot be solved analytically.

The numerical evaluation of the wavenumber integral can be performed using various numerical methods, such as the Gauss-Seidel method, the Simple Function Point method, and the Remez algorithm. These methods are based on different principles and have their own advantages and disadvantages.

The Gauss-Seidel method is an iterative method that can be used to solve arbitrary non-linear equations. It is particularly useful for solving the wavenumber integral when the integrand is a non-linear function of the wavenumber. The method involves iteratively updating the solution at each point in the wavenumber domain, until the solution converges to a desired level of accuracy.

The Simple Function Point method is a numerical method for evaluating the wavenumber integral when the integrand is a linear function of the wavenumber. It is based on the concept of function points, which are points in the wavenumber domain where the integrand takes on a non-zero value. The method involves discretizing the wavenumber domain into a finite set of function points, and then evaluating the integral at these points.

The Remez algorithm is a numerical method for approximating functions by polynomials. It can be used to approximate the integrand in the wavenumber integral, and then evaluate the integral using the approximated function. The algorithm involves iteratively improving the approximation until the error is minimized.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these numerical methods and discuss their applications in the evaluation of the wavenumber integral. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of these methods, and how to overcome them.

#### 5.4b Numerical Methods for Wavenumber Integration

In this section, we will delve deeper into the numerical methods for evaluating the wavenumber integral. We will discuss the Gauss-Seidel method, the Simple Function Point method, and the Remez algorithm in more detail. We will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these methods, and how to choose the most appropriate method for a given problem.

##### Gauss-Seidel Method

The Gauss-Seidel method is an iterative method for solving arbitrary non-linear equations. It is particularly useful for solving the wavenumber integral when the integrand is a non-linear function of the wavenumber. The method involves iteratively updating the solution at each point in the wavenumber domain, until the solution converges to a desired level of accuracy.

The Gauss-Seidel method is based on the principle of linear interpolation. At each iteration, the method updates the solution at a point by interpolating the solutions at the neighboring points. The interpolation is performed using the Gauss-Seidel interpolation formula, which is given by:

$$
x_{n+1} = \frac{x_{n} - x_{n-1}}{h} + x_{n}
$$

where $x_{n}$ is the solution at the $n$-th point, $h$ is the step size, and $x_{n-1}$ is the solution at the previous point.

The Gauss-Seidel method is simple to implement and can handle non-linear integrands. However, it may not always converge to a solution, and the convergence rate can be slow.

##### Simple Function Point Method

The Simple Function Point method is a numerical method for evaluating the wavenumber integral when the integrand is a linear function of the wavenumber. It is based on the concept of function points, which are points in the wavenumber domain where the integrand takes on a non-zero value. The method involves discretizing the wavenumber domain into a finite set of function points, and then evaluating the integral at these points.

The Simple Function Point method is easy to implement and can handle linear integrands. However, it may not be suitable for non-linear integrands, and the accuracy of the result depends on the number of function points used.

##### Remez Algorithm

The Remez algorithm is a numerical method for approximating functions by polynomials. It can be used to approximate the integrand in the wavenumber integral, and then evaluate the integral using the approximated function. The algorithm involves iteratively improving the approximation until the error is minimized.

The Remez algorithm is powerful and can handle non-linear integrands. However, it requires the knowledge of the derivatives of the integrand, which may not always be available.

In the next section, we will discuss how to choose the most appropriate numerical method for a given problem.

#### 5.4c Applications and Case Studies

One of the most common applications of wavenumber integration in ocean acoustics is the propagation of acoustic waves in the ocean. The propagation of acoustic waves can be modeled using the wave equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes the propagation of waves in space and time. The wave equation can be solved numerically using various methods, including the Gauss-Seidel method and the Simple Function Point method.

For example, consider the propagation of acoustic waves in a homogeneous and isotropic ocean. The wave equation for this case can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 p
$$

where $p$ is the pressure field, $t$ is time, $c$ is the speed of sound in the ocean, and $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator.

The Gauss-Seidel method can be used to solve this equation iteratively, updating the pressure field at each point in the ocean until the solution converges. The Simple Function Point method, on the other hand, can be used to discretize the ocean into a finite set of points, and then evaluate the wave equation at these points.

##### Case Study 2: Underwater Acoustics

Another important application of wavenumber integration in ocean acoustics is underwater acoustics. Underwater acoustics involves the study of sound propagation in the underwater environment, which is characterized by high pressure and variable density.

The wave equation for underwater acoustics can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 p + \beta \frac{\partial p}{\partial t}
$$

where $\beta$ is the bulk modulus of the water, which accounts for the variation in density with pressure.

The Remez algorithm can be used to approximate the wave equation in this case, providing a more efficient way to solve the equation numerically. The accuracy of the approximation can be improved iteratively until the error is minimized.

These case studies illustrate the power and versatility of numerical methods for wavenumber integration in ocean acoustics. They show how these methods can be used to solve complex problems in the field, providing valuable insights into the behavior of acoustic waves in the ocean.

#### 5.4b Techniques and Methods

In this section, we will delve deeper into the numerical methods used for evaluating the wavenumber integral. We will discuss the Gauss-Seidel method, the Simple Function Point method, and the Remez algorithm in more detail. We will also explore other techniques and methods that can be used for numerical evaluation of the wavenumber integral.

##### Gauss-Seidel Method

The Gauss-Seidel method is an iterative method that can be used to solve arbitrary non-linear equations. It is particularly useful for solving the wavenumber integral when the integrand is a non-linear function of the wavenumber. The method involves iteratively updating the solution at each point in the wavenumber domain, until the solution converges to a desired level of accuracy.

The Gauss-Seidel method is based on the principle of linear interpolation. Given a set of points $(x_i, y_i)$ for $i = 1, ..., n$, the Gauss-Seidel method can be used to approximate the value of $y$ at any point $x$ between $x_1$ and $x_n$ using the following formula:

$$
y = y_1 + \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} (x - x_1)
$$

This formula can be extended to handle more points, and can be used to approximate the integrand in the wavenumber integral. The method involves iteratively updating the approximation of the integrand at each point in the wavenumber domain, until the approximation converges to the true value of the integrand.

##### Simple Function Point Method

The Simple Function Point method is a numerical method for evaluating the wavenumber integral when the integrand is a linear function of the wavenumber. It is based on the concept of function points, which are points in the wavenumber domain where the integrand takes on a non-zero value. The method involves discretizing the wavenumber domain into a finite set of function points, and then evaluating the integral at these points.

The Simple Function Point method is particularly useful when the integrand is a simple linear function of the wavenumber. However, it can also be used for more complex integrands by approximating the integrand with a linear function in the vicinity of each function point.

##### Remez Algorithm

The Remez algorithm is a numerical method for approximating functions by polynomials. It can be used to approximate the integrand in the wavenumber integral, and then evaluate the integral using the polynomial approximation.

The Remez algorithm is based on the principle of minimizing the maximum error over a given interval. Given a function $f(x)$ defined on the interval $[a, b]$, the Remez algorithm finds a polynomial $p(x)$ of degree $n$ that minimizes the maximum error over the interval:

$$
\max_{x \in [a, b]} |f(x) - p(x)|
$$

The Remez algorithm can be used to approximate the integrand in the wavenumber integral, and then evaluate the integral using the polynomial approximation. The method involves iteratively refining the interval $[a, b]$ and updating the polynomial approximation until the maximum error is minimized.

##### Other Techniques and Methods

In addition to the Gauss-Seidel method, the Simple Function Point method, and the Remez algorithm, there are many other techniques and methods that can be used for numerical evaluation of the wavenumber integral. These include the Adams-Bashforth method, the Adams-Moulton method, and the backward differentiation formula (BDF).

The Adams-Bashforth method is a family of explicit methods for solving ordinary differential equations. It is particularly useful for solving the wavenumber integral when the integrand is a non-linear function of the wavenumber. The method involves approximating the derivative of the integrand at each point in the wavenumber domain, and then integrating these approximations to obtain an approximation of the integrand.

The Adams-Moulton method is a family of implicit methods for solving ordinary differential equations. It is particularly useful for solving the wavenumber integral when the integrand is a non-linear function of the wavenumber. The method involves approximating the derivative of the integrand at each point in the wavenumber domain, and then integrating these approximations to obtain an approximation of the integrand.

The backward differentiation formula (BDF) is a family of implicit methods for solving ordinary differential equations. It is particularly useful for solving the wavenumber integral when the integrand is a non-linear function of the wavenumber. The method involves approximating the derivative of the integrand at each point in the wavenumber domain, and then integrating these approximations to obtain an approximation of the integrand.

In the next section, we will discuss how to implement these numerical methods in a computational framework.

#### 5.4c Applications and Examples

In this section, we will explore some practical applications and examples of the numerical evaluation of the wavenumber integral. These examples will illustrate how the techniques and methods discussed in the previous section can be applied to solve real-world problems in ocean acoustics.

##### Example 1: Simple Function Point Method in Ocean Acoustics

Consider a simple scenario where we want to evaluate the wavenumber integral for a linear function of the wavenumber in the context of ocean acoustics. The Simple Function Point method can be used to discretize the wavenumber domain into a finite set of function points, and then evaluate the integral at these points.

Let's assume that the integrand is a linear function of the wavenumber, given by $f(k) = a + bk$. The Simple Function Point method involves discretizing the wavenumber domain into a finite set of function points, and then evaluating the integral at these points. The function points can be chosen to be the roots of the polynomial $p(k) = a + bk$.

The Simple Function Point method can be implemented as follows:

```
function wavenumber_integral(a, b, k_min, k_max, n)
    k = linspace(k_min, k_max, n)
    f = a + b*k
    integral = sum(f.*k)
end
```

where `a` and `b` are the coefficients of the integrand, `k_min` and `k_max` are the minimum and maximum wavenumbers, and `n` is the number of function points.

##### Example 2: Gauss-Seidel Method in Ocean Acoustics

The Gauss-Seidel method can be used to solve the wavenumber integral when the integrand is a non-linear function of the wavenumber. Consider a scenario where the integrand is a non-linear function, given by $f(k) = a + bk + ck^2$.

The Gauss-Seidel method involves iteratively updating the approximation of the integrand at each point in the wavenumber domain, until the approximation converges to the true value of the integrand. The method can be implemented as follows:

```
function wavenumber_integral(a, b, c, k_min, k_max, n)
    k = linspace(k_min, k_max, n)
    f = a + b*k + c*k^2
    y = zeros(n)
    for i = 1:n
        y[i] = (f[i] - a - b*k[i] - c*k[i]^2)/(2*c*k[i])
    end
    integral = sum(y.*k)
end
```

where `a`, `b`, and `c` are the coefficients of the integrand, `k_min` and `k_max` are the minimum and maximum wavenumbers, and `n` is the number of points in the wavenumber domain.

These examples illustrate how the numerical evaluation of the wavenumber integral can be used to solve real-world problems in ocean acoustics. The choice of method depends on the specific characteristics of the integrand, such as its linearity and smoothness.




#### 5.4c Challenges and Solutions

The numerical evaluation of the wavenumber integral poses several challenges. These challenges arise from the inherent complexity of the integral, the need for high accuracy, and the computational resources required. In this section, we will discuss some of these challenges and propose solutions to address them.

##### Computational Complexity

The wavenumber integral is a high-dimensional integral, with the dimension equal to the number of variables in the integrand. This makes the integral computationally intensive, especially when the integrand is a complex function. The Gauss-Seidel method and the Simple Function Point method, while effective, can be computationally expensive due to the need to evaluate the integrand at each point in the wavenumber domain.

To address this challenge, we can use techniques such as parallel computing and adaptive grid refinement. Parallel computing allows us to distribute the computation across multiple processors, reducing the time required for the computation. Adaptive grid refinement involves refining the grid in regions where the integrand is large, reducing the number of points that need to be evaluated.

##### Accuracy

The accuracy of the numerical evaluation of the wavenumber integral is crucial. Any error in the evaluation can lead to significant errors in the final results. The Gauss-Seidel method and the Simple Function Point method, while accurate, can be sensitive to the initial approximation of the integrand.

To address this challenge, we can use techniques such as error analysis and adaptive step size control. Error analysis involves estimating the error in the numerical evaluation and adjusting the step size accordingly. Adaptive step size control involves adjusting the step size in regions where the error is large, reducing the overall error in the evaluation.

##### Computational Resources

The numerical evaluation of the wavenumber integral requires significant computational resources, including memory and storage. The Gauss-Seidel method and the Simple Function Point method, while efficient, can be memory-intensive due to the need to store the approximation of the integrand at each point in the wavenumber domain.

To address this challenge, we can use techniques such as data compression and memory management. Data compression can be used to reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored, reducing the memory requirements. Memory management techniques can be used to optimize the use of the available memory, reducing the need for additional memory.

In conclusion, the numerical evaluation of the wavenumber integral poses several challenges, but these challenges can be addressed using a combination of techniques and methods. By leveraging the power of modern computing and advanced numerical methods, we can overcome these challenges and obtain accurate and efficient solutions for the evaluation of the wavenumber integral.





#### 5.5a Definition and Causes of Aliasing

Aliasing is a common phenomenon in digital signal processing that occurs when high-frequency components of a signal are incorrectly interpreted as low-frequency components due to the Nyquist sampling theorem. In the context of wavenumber integration, aliasing can occur when the wavenumber domain is not properly sampled, leading to errors in the numerical evaluation of the wavenumber integral.

The Nyquist sampling theorem states that in order to accurately reconstruct a signal, the sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency component of the signal. In the context of wavenumber integration, this means that the wavenumber domain must be sampled at a rate of at least twice the highest wavenumber component.

Aliasing can occur when the wavenumber domain is not properly sampled, leading to errors in the numerical evaluation of the wavenumber integral. This can happen if the wavenumber domain is not sampled at a rate of at least twice the highest wavenumber component. In such cases, high-frequency components of the integrand can be incorrectly interpreted as low-frequency components, leading to errors in the evaluation of the integral.

The causes of aliasing in wavenumber integration can be traced back to the numerical methods used to evaluate the wavenumber integral. The Gauss-Seidel method and the Simple Function Point method, while effective, can be sensitive to the sampling rate of the wavenumber domain. If the sampling rate is not high enough, these methods can lead to errors in the evaluation of the wavenumber integral due to aliasing.

To address this issue, it is important to ensure that the wavenumber domain is properly sampled at a rate of at least twice the highest wavenumber component. This can be achieved by using techniques such as parallel computing and adaptive grid refinement, as discussed in the previous section.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of wrap-around and its implications for wavenumber integration.

#### 5.5b Effects of Aliasing and Wrap-around

Aliasing and wrap-around are two related phenomena that can significantly impact the accuracy of wavenumber integration. Aliasing, as discussed in the previous section, occurs when high-frequency components of a signal are incorrectly interpreted as low-frequency components due to insufficient sampling. Wrap-around, on the other hand, is a phenomenon that occurs when the value of a variable wraps around to its minimum value due to the finite range of the variable.

In the context of wavenumber integration, wrap-around can occur when the wavenumber domain is not properly sampled. This can lead to errors in the numerical evaluation of the wavenumber integral, as the high-frequency components of the integrand can be incorrectly interpreted as low-frequency components due to aliasing.

The effects of aliasing and wrap-around can be seen in the following example. Consider a signal $x(t)$ that is sampled at a rate of $f_s$ samples per second. The signal $x(t)$ can be represented as a sum of sinusoidal components, each with a frequency $f$ and an amplitude $A_f$:

$$
x(t) = \sum_{f} A_f \sin(2\pi ft)
$$

If the signal $x(t)$ is sampled at a rate of $f_s$ samples per second, the highest frequency component that can be accurately reconstructed is $f_s/2$. Any component with a frequency higher than $f_s/2$ will be incorrectly interpreted as a lower frequency component due to aliasing.

Now, consider a wavenumber domain that is not properly sampled. The wavenumber domain can be represented as a sum of sinusoidal components, each with a wavenumber $k$ and an amplitude $A_k$:

$$
k(t) = \sum_{k} A_k \sin(2\pi kt)
$$

If the wavenumber domain is not properly sampled, the highest wavenumber component that can be accurately reconstructed is $f_s/2$. Any component with a wavenumber higher than $f_s/2$ will be incorrectly interpreted as a lower wavenumber component due to aliasing.

In addition to aliasing, wrap-around can also occur in the wavenumber domain. This can happen if the wavenumber domain is not properly sampled, leading to errors in the numerical evaluation of the wavenumber integral. The wrap-around effect can be seen in the following example.

Consider a wavenumber domain that is sampled at a rate of $f_s$ samples per second. The wavenumber domain can be represented as a sum of sinusoidal components, each with a wavenumber $k$ and an amplitude $A_k$:

$$
k(t) = \sum_{k} A_k \sin(2\pi kt)
$$

If the wavenumber domain is sampled at a rate of $f_s$ samples per second, the highest wavenumber component that can be accurately reconstructed is $f_s/2$. However, if the wavenumber domain is not properly sampled, the wavenumber can wrap around to its minimum value of $0$ due to the finite range of the wavenumber. This can lead to errors in the numerical evaluation of the wavenumber integral, as the high-frequency components of the integrand can be incorrectly interpreted as low-frequency components due to aliasing.

In conclusion, aliasing and wrap-around are two related phenomena that can significantly impact the accuracy of wavenumber integration. It is important to ensure that the wavenumber domain is properly sampled to avoid these issues.

#### 5.5c Mitigation of Aliasing and Wrap-around

Aliasing and wrap-around are two common issues that can significantly impact the accuracy of wavenumber integration. In this section, we will discuss some strategies to mitigate these issues.

##### Mitigating Aliasing

Aliasing occurs when high-frequency components of a signal are incorrectly interpreted as low-frequency components due to insufficient sampling. To mitigate aliasing, it is crucial to ensure that the signal is sampled at a rate that is at least twice the highest frequency component. This is known as the Nyquist sampling rate.

In the context of wavenumber integration, this means that the wavenumber domain should be sampled at a rate of at least twice the highest wavenumber component. This can be achieved by increasing the sampling rate or by using interpolation techniques to fill in the gaps in the wavenumber domain.

##### Mitigating Wrap-around

Wrap-around occurs when the value of a variable wraps around to its minimum value due to the finite range of the variable. In the context of wavenumber integration, this can lead to errors in the numerical evaluation of the wavenumber integral.

To mitigate wrap-around, it is important to ensure that the wavenumber domain is properly sampled. This can be achieved by increasing the sampling rate or by using interpolation techniques to fill in the gaps in the wavenumber domain.

In addition, it is also important to ensure that the wavenumber domain is not truncated at the boundaries. This can be achieved by using periodic boundary conditions, which allow the wavenumber domain to wrap around to its minimum value without causing errors in the numerical evaluation of the wavenumber integral.

##### Mitigating Both Aliasing and Wrap-around

In some cases, both aliasing and wrap-around can occur simultaneously. To mitigate both issues, it is important to ensure that the wavenumber domain is properly sampled and that the wavenumber domain is not truncated at the boundaries. This can be achieved by using a combination of increased sampling rate, interpolation techniques, and periodic boundary conditions.

In conclusion, aliasing and wrap-around are two common issues that can significantly impact the accuracy of wavenumber integration. By understanding these issues and implementing appropriate mitigation strategies, we can ensure the accuracy and reliability of our computational ocean acoustics models.

## Chapter: Chapter 6: Dispersion

### Introduction

The study of ocean acoustics is a vast and complex field, and one of the most intriguing aspects of this discipline is the phenomenon of dispersion. This chapter, Chapter 6: Dispersion, delves into the fascinating world of dispersion, a concept that is fundamental to understanding how sound waves propagate in the ocean.

Dispersion, in the context of ocean acoustics, refers to the variation of the speed of sound with frequency. This variation can significantly affect the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, influencing everything from the range of a sonar system to the ability of marine mammals to communicate.

In this chapter, we will explore the theoretical underpinnings of dispersion, examining how it is influenced by factors such as temperature, salinity, and pressure. We will also discuss the practical implications of dispersion, looking at how it can be measured and modeled, and how these models can be used to predict the behavior of sound waves in the ocean.

We will also delve into the role of dispersion in the propagation of sound waves, exploring how it can affect the range and direction of sound waves, and how it can influence the perception of sound by marine animals.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of dispersion, from its fundamental principles to its practical applications. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field of ocean acoustics, we hope that this chapter will enhance your understanding of this fascinating and important aspect of the field.

As we journey through the world of dispersion, we hope to illuminate the complex and intriguing world of ocean acoustics, providing a solid foundation for further study and research. So, let's dive in and explore the world of dispersion in ocean acoustics.




#### 5.5b Wrap-around in Wavenumber Integration

Wrap-around is another common phenomenon in digital signal processing that can occur in wavenumber integration. It occurs when the high-frequency components of a signal are incorrectly interpreted as low-frequency components due to the periodic nature of the wavenumber domain.

In the context of wavenumber integration, the wavenumber domain is a periodic domain, meaning that the wavenumber values repeat after a certain range. This can lead to wrap-around errors if the wavenumber domain is not properly sampled.

The wrap-around error can be understood as follows: Suppose we have a signal with a highest wavenumber component of $k_{max}$. If the wavenumber domain is not sampled at a rate of at least twice $k_{max}$, some of the high-frequency components of the signal will be incorrectly interpreted as low-frequency components due to the periodic nature of the wavenumber domain. This can lead to errors in the numerical evaluation of the wavenumber integral.

The wrap-around error can be minimized by ensuring that the wavenumber domain is properly sampled at a rate of at least twice the highest wavenumber component. This can be achieved by using techniques such as parallel computing and adaptive grid refinement, as discussed in the previous section.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of spectral leakage and its implications for wavenumber integration.

#### 5.5c Mitigation of Aliasing and Wrap-around

Aliasing and wrap-around are two common issues that can occur in wavenumber integration. These issues can lead to errors in the numerical evaluation of the wavenumber integral and can significantly affect the accuracy of the results. In this section, we will discuss some strategies to mitigate these issues.

##### Mitigation of Aliasing

As discussed in the previous sections, aliasing occurs when high-frequency components of a signal are incorrectly interpreted as low-frequency components due to the Nyquist sampling theorem. To mitigate aliasing, we can increase the sampling rate of the wavenumber domain. This can be achieved by using techniques such as parallel computing and adaptive grid refinement.

Parallel computing involves dividing the computational task into smaller, parallel tasks that can be executed simultaneously. This can significantly increase the sampling rate of the wavenumber domain and reduce the likelihood of aliasing.

Adaptive grid refinement is another technique that can be used to increase the sampling rate of the wavenumber domain. This involves refining the grid in regions where it is needed, based on the solution of the equation. This can help to capture the high-frequency components of the signal more accurately and reduce the likelihood of aliasing.

##### Mitigation of Wrap-around

Wrap-around occurs when the high-frequency components of a signal are incorrectly interpreted as low-frequency components due to the periodic nature of the wavenumber domain. To mitigate wrap-around, we can increase the number of samples in the wavenumber domain. This can be achieved by using techniques such as parallel computing and adaptive grid refinement, as discussed above.

In addition, we can also use spectral leakage correction techniques to mitigate wrap-around. These techniques involve correcting for the spectral leakage that occurs when the high-frequency components of the signal are incorrectly interpreted as low-frequency components. This can help to reduce the errors caused by wrap-around and improve the accuracy of the results.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of spectral leakage and its implications for wavenumber integration.

#### 5.6a Understanding the Concept of Spectral Leakage

Spectral leakage is a phenomenon that occurs in the Fourier domain when the frequency components of a signal are not confined to their original locations due to the finite length of the signal. This can lead to errors in the numerical evaluation of the wavenumber integral and can significantly affect the accuracy of the results.

The concept of spectral leakage can be understood in the context of the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a signal is given by:

$$
F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t)e^{-j\omega t} dt
$$

where $x(t)$ is the signal, $\omega$ is the frequency, and $j$ is the imaginary unit. The Fourier transform of a signal is a complex-valued function that represents the frequency components of the signal.

However, in practical applications, the signal is often finite in length. This means that the Fourier transform of the signal is a periodic function with a period equal to the length of the signal. As a result, the frequency components of the signal are not confined to their original locations, but are spread out over a range of frequencies. This is known as spectral leakage.

Spectral leakage can be mitigated by increasing the length of the signal. This can be achieved by using techniques such as zero-padding and cyclic extension. Zero-padding involves adding zeros to the end of the signal, while cyclic extension involves repeating the signal over a longer period. Both of these techniques can help to reduce the spectral leakage and improve the accuracy of the results.

In the next section, we will discuss some strategies to mitigate spectral leakage in wavenumber integration.

#### 5.6b Mitigation of Spectral Leakage

Spectral leakage is a common issue that can significantly affect the accuracy of the results in wavenumber integration. In this section, we will discuss some strategies to mitigate spectral leakage.

##### Zero-Padding

One of the most common techniques to mitigate spectral leakage is zero-padding. As mentioned in the previous section, zero-padding involves adding zeros to the end of the signal. This can be represented mathematically as:

$$
x_{p}(t) = \begin{cases}
x(t) & \text{if } t \in [0, T] \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

where $x_{p}(t)$ is the zero-padded signal, $x(t)$ is the original signal, and $T$ is the length of the signal. The Fourier transform of the zero-padded signal is given by:

$$
F_{p}(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x_{p}(t)e^{-j\omega t} dt = F(\omega)
$$

where $F_{p}(\omega)$ is the Fourier transform of the zero-padded signal, and $F(\omega)$ is the Fourier transform of the original signal. The zero-padding technique can help to reduce the spectral leakage by increasing the length of the signal.

##### Cyclic Extension

Another technique to mitigate spectral leakage is cyclic extension. Cyclic extension involves repeating the signal over a longer period. This can be represented mathematically as:

$$
x_{c}(t) = \begin{cases}
x(t) & \text{if } t \in [0, T] \\
x(t - T) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

where $x_{c}(t)$ is the cyclic extended signal, and $T$ is the length of the signal. The Fourier transform of the cyclic extended signal is given by:

$$
F_{c}(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x_{c}(t)e^{-j\omega t} dt = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{k=0}^{T-1} F(\omega)e^{-jk\omega T}
$$

where $F_{c}(\omega)$ is the Fourier transform of the cyclic extended signal, and $F(\omega)$ is the Fourier transform of the original signal. The cyclic extension technique can help to reduce the spectral leakage by increasing the period of the signal.

##### Spectral Leakage Correction

In addition to the above techniques, spectral leakage correction can also be used to mitigate spectral leakage. This involves correcting for the spectral leakage that occurs when the frequency components of a signal are not confined to their original locations. This can be achieved by using techniques such as the Parks-McClellan algorithm and the Remez algorithm. These techniques involve finding the best approximation of a function over a given interval, and can be used to correct for the spectral leakage in wavenumber integration.

In the next section, we will discuss some practical applications of these techniques in wavenumber integration.

#### 5.6c Applications of Spectral Leakage Mitigation

Spectral leakage mitigation techniques have a wide range of applications in computational ocean acoustics. These techniques are particularly useful in situations where the signal is finite in length, such as in the case of ocean acoustic signals. In this section, we will discuss some of the key applications of spectral leakage mitigation in computational ocean acoustics.

##### Wavenumber Integration

One of the primary applications of spectral leakage mitigation techniques is in wavenumber integration. Wavenumber integration is a method used to calculate the energy of a signal in the frequency domain. However, due to the finite length of the signal, spectral leakage can occur, leading to inaccurate results. By using techniques such as zero-padding and cyclic extension, the spectral leakage can be mitigated, leading to more accurate results.

##### Ocean Acoustic Tomography

Ocean acoustic tomography is a technique used to study the properties of the ocean by analyzing the propagation of sound waves. This technique relies heavily on the accurate calculation of the wavenumber integral, which can be affected by spectral leakage. By mitigating spectral leakage, more accurate results can be obtained, leading to a better understanding of the ocean's properties.

##### Underwater Imaging

Underwater imaging is another application where spectral leakage mitigation techniques are crucial. Underwater imaging involves the use of sound waves to create images of objects underwater. The accuracy of these images can be affected by spectral leakage, which can be mitigated using techniques such as zero-padding and cyclic extension.

##### Ocean Noise Analysis

Ocean noise analysis is a field that studies the noise generated by the ocean. This noise can be caused by a variety of sources, including wind, waves, and marine life. The analysis of this noise often involves the calculation of the wavenumber integral, which can be affected by spectral leakage. By mitigating spectral leakage, more accurate results can be obtained, leading to a better understanding of the sources of ocean noise.

In conclusion, spectral leakage mitigation techniques play a crucial role in computational ocean acoustics. By reducing the effects of spectral leakage, these techniques can lead to more accurate results in a variety of applications, including wavenumber integration, ocean acoustic tomography, underwater imaging, and ocean noise analysis.

These issues can lead to errors in the numerical evaluation of the wavenumber integral and can significantly affect the accuracy of the results. In this section, we will discuss some strategies to mitigate these issues.

##### Mitigation of Aliasing

As discussed in the previous sections, aliasing occurs when high-frequency components of a signal are incorrectly interpreted as low-frequency components due to the Nyquist sampling theorem. This can be mitigated by ensuring that the sampling rate is at least twice the highest frequency component of the signal. This can be achieved by using techniques such as parallel computing and adaptive grid refinement, as discussed in the previous section.

##### Mitigation of Wrap-around

Wrap-around occurs when the wavenumber domain is not properly sampled, leading to errors in the numerical evaluation of the wavenumber integral. This can be mitigated by ensuring that the wavenumber domain is properly sampled at a rate of at least twice the highest wavenumber component. This can be achieved by using techniques such as parallel computing and adaptive grid refinement, as discussed in the previous section.

##### Spectral Leakage

Spectral leakage is another issue that can occur in wavenumber integration. This occurs when the energy of a signal at a particular frequency leaks into other frequencies. This can be mitigated by using techniques such as windowing and filtering. Windowing involves applying a window function to the signal, which reduces the spectral leakage by limiting the support of the signal. Filtering involves applying a filter to the signal, which removes the unwanted frequencies.

##### Conclusion

In conclusion, aliasing, wrap-around, and spectral leakage are common issues that can occur in wavenumber integration.

Wave propagation is a fundamental concept in the study of sound waves in the ocean, and it is the backbone of many applications in ocean acoustics. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of wave propagation, its mathematical representation, and its practical applications in the field of ocean acoustics.

#### 5.6b Finite Difference and Finite Element Methods

The Finite Difference Method (FDM) and Finite Element Method (FEM) are two popular numerical methods used in wavenumber integration. These methods are particularly useful for problems with complex geometries or boundary conditions.

The Finite Difference Method (FDM) is a numerical method used to approximate the derivatives in the wavenumber domain using finite differences. This method is particularly useful for problems with complex geometries or boundary conditions.

The FDM involves discretising the wavenumber domain into a finite set of points, and approximating the derivatives at these points using finite differences. This allows for the efficient computation of the wavenumber integral.

The FDM is based on the Taylor series expansion, which allows for the approximation of the derivative at a point using the values of the function at nearby points. This is particularly useful in the context of wavenumber integration, where the function (representing the sound wave) may vary rapidly in the wavenumber domain.

##### Finite Element Method (FEM)

The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a numerical method used to solve complex problems in ocean acoustics. It is particularly useful for problems with complex geometries or boundary conditions.

The FEM involves discretising the wavenumber domain into a finite set of elements, and approximating the solution within each element using a set of basis functions. This allows for the efficient computation of the wavenumber integral.

The FEM is based on the principle of virtual work, which allows for the approximation of the solution within each element using a set of basis functions. This is particularly useful in the context of wavenumber integration, where the solution may vary rapidly in the wavenumber domain.

##### Comparison of FDM and FEM

Both the Finite Difference Method (FDM) and Finite Element Method (FEM) are powerful numerical methods used in wavenumber integration. However, they have different strengths and weaknesses.

The FDM is particularly useful for problems with complex geometries or boundary conditions, and is relatively easy to implement. However, it may not be as accurate as the FEM for problems with rapidly varying solutions.

The FEM, on the other hand, is particularly useful for problems with rapidly varying solutions, and can provide more accurate results than the FDM. However, it is more complex to implement than the FDM, and may not be as well-suited to problems with complex geometries or boundary conditions.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the application of these numerical methods in wavenumber integration.

The FDM and FEM are particularly useful in these cases, as they allow for the efficient computation of the wavenumber integral even in the presence of complex geometries or boundary conditions.

For example, consider a medium with a varying sound speed $c(x)$, and a density $\rho(x)$. The wave equation in this medium can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2(x) \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2} + \frac{1}{\rho(x)} \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x} \frac{\partial p}{\partial x}
$$

where $p$ is the pressure, $t$ is time, and $x$ is the spatial coordinate. The FDM and FEM can be used to discretise this equation and solve it numerically.

$$

where $A_n(\mathbf{x})$ and $\omega_n(\mathbf{x})$ are the amplitude and frequency of the $n$th normal mode, respectively, and $t$ is time. This equation represents the superposition principle, which states that the response of the system to any input can be represented as a sum of the responses to the individual normal modes.

The model expansion of the Green's function is a powerful tool in the study of normal modes. It allows us to understand the behavior of the system in terms of its normal modes, and to predict the response of the system to any input. This is particularly useful in applications such as ocean exploration, where we may be interested in the response of the ocean to a variety of inputs.

In the following sections, we will explore the model expansion of the Green's function in more detail, discussing its properties, its applications, and the methods for computing the normal modes and their amplitudes. We will also discuss the implications of the model expansion for the study of normal modes in ocean acoustics.

#### 6.2b Model Expansion Techniques

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of model expansion of the Green's function. In this section, we will delve deeper into the techniques used for this expansion. 

The model expansion of the Green's function involves representing the Green's function as a sum of normal modes, each with its own amplitude and phase. This expansion is given by the equation:

$$
G(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}') = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n(\mathbf{x})e^{i\omega_n(\mathbf{x})t}
$$

where $A_n(\mathbf{x})$ and $\omega_n(\mathbf{x})$ are the amplitude and frequency of the $n$th normal mode, respectively, and $t$ is time. 

The model expansion techniques involve determining the amplitudes and frequencies of the normal modes. This is typically done through numerical methods, such as the finite element method or the boundary element method. These methods involve discretizing the system into a finite number of elements, and solving the equations of motion for each element. The solutions for each element are then combined to form the solution for the entire system.

The finite element method, for example, involves dividing the system into a finite number of elements, and approximating the solution within each element using a set of basis functions. The coefficients of the basis functions are determined by minimizing the residual of the equations of motion. The solution for the entire system is then obtained by assembling the solutions for each element.

The boundary element method, on the other hand, involves approximating the solution on the boundary of the system using a set of basis functions. The coefficients of the basis functions are determined by satisfying the boundary conditions. The solution for the entire system is then obtained by solving the resulting system of equations.

In the next section, we will discuss the properties of the model expansion of the Green's function, and its implications for the study of normal modes in ocean acoustics.

#### 6.2c Applications in Ocean Acoustics

The model expansion techniques discussed in the previous section have found extensive applications in the field of ocean acoustics. These techniques are used to study the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, and to understand the effects of various factors such as ocean currents, temperature gradients, and underwater topography on the propagation of these waves.

One of the key applications of model expansion in ocean acoustics is in the study of normal modes. Normal modes are the natural frequencies of the ocean, and they play a crucial role in the propagation of sound waves. The model expansion techniques allow us to determine the normal modes of the ocean, and to understand how these modes are affected by various factors.

For example, consider the case of a spherical ocean basin. The normal modes of such a system can be represented as a sum of spherical harmonics, each with its own amplitude and phase. The model expansion techniques can be used to determine these amplitudes and phases, and to understand how they are affected by factors such as the depth of the ocean and the distribution of mass in the ocean.

Another important application of model expansion in ocean acoustics is in the study of sound propagation in the ocean. The model expansion techniques can be used to determine the Green's function of the ocean, which describes the response of the ocean to a point source of sound. This Green's function can then be used to predict the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, and to understand the effects of various factors on this propagation.

In addition to these applications, the model expansion techniques are also used in the design and analysis of underwater acoustic devices. These devices, which include sonars and underwater microphones, rely on the understanding of the normal modes of the ocean to operate effectively. The model expansion techniques provide a powerful tool for studying these normal modes, and for designing devices that can take advantage of them.

In the next section, we will discuss some specific examples of these applications, and will provide more details on how the model expansion techniques are used in these contexts.




#### 6.2b Application of Green's Function in Model Expansion

The application of the Green's function in the model expansion is a crucial aspect of understanding the normal modes of the ocean. The Green's function, as we have seen, represents the response of the system to a unit impulse at $\mathbf{x}'$. In the context of ocean acoustics, this impulse could be a sound wave. The model expansion of the Green's function allows us to understand the response of the ocean to this sound wave in terms of its normal modes.

The model expansion of the Green's function is particularly useful in the study of ocean acoustics because it allows us to understand the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. The ocean is a complex medium, with varying properties such as density, temperature, and salinity. The normal modes of the ocean represent the different ways in which sound waves can propagate through this medium. By understanding these normal modes, we can predict how sound waves will propagate in the ocean, and how they will interact with the ocean floor and the surface.

The application of the Green's function in the model expansion is also crucial in the development of advanced technologies for ocean exploration and monitoring. For example, the Gauss-Seidel method, which is used to solve arbitrary equations, can be used to solve the equations that describe the normal modes of the ocean. This allows us to develop more accurate models of the ocean, and to predict the behavior of sound waves in the ocean with greater precision.

In conclusion, the application of the Green's function in the model expansion is a powerful tool in the study of normal modes in ocean acoustics. It allows us to understand the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, and to develop advanced technologies for ocean exploration and monitoring.

#### 6.2c Challenges in Model Expansion

While the model expansion of the Green's function provides a powerful tool for understanding the normal modes of the ocean, it is not without its challenges. These challenges arise from the inherent complexity of the ocean as a medium, and from the mathematical difficulties associated with solving the equations that describe the normal modes.

One of the main challenges in model expansion is the need for accurate and detailed data about the properties of the ocean. The ocean is a complex medium, with varying properties such as density, temperature, and salinity. These properties can change rapidly and unpredictably, making it difficult to develop accurate models of the ocean. This is particularly true in the case of the ocean floor, which can be difficult to map and study due to its depth and the presence of underwater mountains and valleys.

Another challenge in model expansion is the mathematical difficulty associated with solving the equations that describe the normal modes of the ocean. These equations are non-linear and coupled, making them difficult to solve analytically. Numerical methods, such as the Gauss-Seidel method, can be used to solve these equations, but these methods can be computationally intensive and may not always provide accurate solutions.

The use of the Multiscale Green's function (MSGF) method has helped to address some of these challenges. The MSGF method allows for the linkage of length scales, from the atomistic scales to the macroscopic scales, which is crucial for understanding the behavior of sound waves in the ocean. However, the MSGF method also has its limitations. For example, it assumes a perfect lattice without defects, which may not always be the case in the ocean.

In conclusion, while the model expansion of the Green's function provides a powerful tool for understanding the normal modes of the ocean, it is also a complex and challenging area of study. Further research and development are needed to overcome these challenges and to develop more accurate and detailed models of the ocean.

## Chapter 7: Wave Propagation

### Introduction

The study of wave propagation in the ocean is a complex and fascinating field, and it is the focus of this chapter. Wave propagation refers to the movement of waves through a medium, in this case, the ocean. It is a fundamental concept in ocean acoustics, as it helps us understand how sound waves travel through the ocean, and how they interact with the ocean's environment.

In this chapter, we will delve into the theory behind wave propagation, exploring the mathematical models that describe how waves move through the ocean. We will also look at the practical applications of this theory, discussing how it can be used to predict wave behavior and to design systems for ocean acoustics.

We will begin by discussing the basic principles of wave propagation, including the concepts of wave speed, wavelength, and frequency. We will then move on to more advanced topics, such as the effects of ocean currents and the ocean floor on wave propagation, and the role of wave propagation in the transmission of sound waves in the ocean.

Throughout this chapter, we will use mathematical expressions to describe the concepts we discuss. These expressions will be formatted using the TeX and LaTeX style syntax, for example, `$y_j(n)$` for inline math and `$$\Delta w = ...$$` for equations. This will allow us to express complex mathematical concepts in a clear and concise manner.

#### 6.2c Challenges in Model Expansion

While the model expansion of the Green's function provides a powerful tool for understanding the normal modes of the ocean, it is not without its challenges. These challenges arise from the inherent complexity of the ocean system and the mathematical models used to represent it.

One of the main challenges in model expansion is the accurate representation of the ocean system. The ocean is a complex, non-linear system with many interacting components. These include the water column, the seafloor, the atmosphere, and the biosphere. Each of these components can influence the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, and their interactions can lead to complex, non-linear dynamics.

The mathematical models used to represent the ocean system also pose challenges. These models often involve differential equations, which can be difficult to solve analytically. Numerical methods, such as the Gauss-Seidel method, can be used to solve these equations, but they can also introduce errors and uncertainties.

Another challenge in model expansion is the validation of the models. The accuracy of a model can only be determined by comparing its predictions with real-world observations. However, observational data in the ocean is often sparse and noisy, making it difficult to validate the models with high confidence.

Finally, the computational demands of model expansion can be a challenge. The solution of the equations representing the ocean system often requires significant computational resources, including high-performance computing and advanced numerical algorithms.

Despite these challenges, the model expansion of the Green's function remains a powerful tool in the study of normal modes in ocean acoustics. With continued research and development, these challenges can be addressed, leading to a deeper understanding of the ocean system and its normal modes.




#### 6.3a Introduction to Isovelocity Problem

The isovelocity problem is a fundamental concept in the study of normal modes in ocean acoustics. It is a mathematical model that describes the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, taking into account the effects of the ocean's stratification and rotation. The isovelocity problem is particularly useful in understanding the behavior of normal modes, which are the natural oscillations of the ocean system.

The isovelocity problem is based on the assumption that the ocean is stratified, meaning that the properties of the water (such as its density and sound speed) vary with depth. This stratification leads to the formation of normal modes, which are standing waves that propagate vertically through the water column. The isovelocity problem provides a mathematical description of these normal modes, allowing us to understand their properties and behavior.

The isovelocity problem is also used to study the effects of rotation on normal modes. The Earth's rotation introduces a Coriolis force, which can deflect the path of sound waves and alter the behavior of normal modes. The isovelocity problem takes into account these effects, providing a more accurate description of normal modes in the ocean.

The mathematical formulation of the isovelocity problem involves solving a set of differential equations that describe the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. These equations are derived from the principles of fluid dynamics and acoustics, and they take into account the effects of stratification and rotation. The solutions to these equations represent the normal modes of the ocean system.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the isovelocity problem, exploring its mathematical formulation, its physical interpretation, and its applications in the study of normal modes in ocean acoustics. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of the isovelocity problem, and how these can be addressed through the use of computational models and numerical methods.

#### 6.3b Solving Isovelocity Problem

The isovelocity problem is a complex mathematical model that describes the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. Solving this problem involves solving a set of differential equations that describe the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. These equations are derived from the principles of fluid dynamics and acoustics, and they take into account the effects of stratification and rotation.

The isovelocity problem can be solved using a variety of numerical methods. One common approach is to use the Gauss-Seidel method, a numerical method for solving a system of linear equations. This method is particularly useful for solving the isovelocity problem because it allows us to handle the non-linear nature of the equations.

Another approach is to use the finite element method, a numerical method for solving partial differential equations. This method is particularly useful for solving the isovelocity problem because it allows us to handle the complex geometry of the ocean system.

The isovelocity problem can also be solved using the finite difference method, a numerical method for solving partial differential equations. This method is particularly useful for solving the isovelocity problem because it allows us to handle the discontinuities that can occur in the ocean system.

In the following sections, we will explore these numerical methods in more detail, discussing their advantages and limitations, and providing examples of how they can be used to solve the isovelocity problem. We will also discuss the role of computational models in solving the isovelocity problem, and how these models can be used to study the behavior of normal modes in the ocean.

#### 6.3c Applications of Isovelocity Problem

The isovelocity problem is a fundamental concept in the study of normal modes in ocean acoustics. It has a wide range of applications in understanding the behavior of sound waves in the ocean. In this section, we will explore some of these applications in more detail.

One of the primary applications of the isovelocity problem is in the study of normal modes. Normal modes are the natural oscillations of the ocean system, and they play a crucial role in the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. The isovelocity problem provides a mathematical description of these normal modes, allowing us to understand their properties and behavior.

The isovelocity problem is also used to study the effects of rotation on normal modes. The Earth's rotation introduces a Coriolis force, which can deflect the path of sound waves and alter the behavior of normal modes. The isovelocity problem takes into account these effects, providing a more accurate description of normal modes in the ocean.

Another important application of the isovelocity problem is in the study of stratification. Stratification refers to the variation of properties (such as density and sound speed) with depth in the ocean. The isovelocity problem provides a mathematical description of this stratification, allowing us to understand how it affects the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.

The isovelocity problem is also used in the design and analysis of acoustic devices. For example, it can be used to design underwater acoustic devices that can operate effectively in the presence of stratification and rotation. It can also be used to analyze the performance of these devices, helping us to understand how they interact with the ocean system.

#### 6.3b Mathematical Representation

The mathematical representation of the isovelocity problem involves solving a set of differential equations that describe the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. These equations are derived from the principles of fluid dynamics and acoustics, and they take into account the effects of stratification and rotation. The solutions to these equations represent the normal modes of the ocean system.

The isovelocity problem can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial z^2}
$$

where $p$ is the pressure, $t$ is time, $z$ is the vertical coordinate (positive upwards), and $c$ is the sound speed. This equation represents the wave equation for sound propagation in the ocean, and it is the basis for the isovelocity problem.

The solutions to this equation represent the normal modes of the ocean system. These normal modes are standing waves that propagate vertically through the water column. They are characterized by their frequency and wavenumber, and they are determined by the boundary conditions at the ocean surface and bottom.

The isovelocity problem also takes into account the effects of rotation on normal modes. The Earth's rotation introduces a Coriolis force, which can deflect the path of sound waves and alter the behavior of normal modes. This is represented mathematically by the addition of a Coriolis term to the wave equation:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial z^2} + 2\Omega \frac{\partial p}{\partial z}
$$

where $\Omega$ is the Earth's rotation rate. This term represents the Coriolis force, and it introduces a vertical shear into the normal modes.

The isovelocity problem can be solved numerically using various methods, such as the finite difference method or the finite element method. These methods discretize the wave equation and solve it iteratively to obtain the normal modes of the ocean system.

In the next section, we will discuss the physical interpretation of the isovelocity problem and its applications in the study of normal modes in ocean acoustics.

Normal modes are the natural oscillations of the ocean system, and they are characterized by their frequency and wavenumber. The solutions to the wave equation represent these normal modes, and they can be used to understand the behavior of the ocean system under different conditions.

For instance, the isovelocity problem can be used to study the effects of stratification on normal modes. Stratification refers to the variation of properties such as density and sound speed with depth in the ocean. The wave equation can be solved under different stratification conditions to understand how these conditions affect the normal modes of the ocean system.

Similarly, the isovelocity problem can be used to study the effects of rotation on normal modes. The Coriolis term in the wave equation introduces a vertical shear into the normal modes, which can be used to understand the effects of rotation on sound propagation in the ocean.

In addition to these applications, the isovelocity problem also forms the basis for many numerical methods used in ocean acoustics. These methods, such as the finite difference method and the finite element method, discretize the wave equation and solve it iteratively to obtain the normal modes of the ocean system. These methods are particularly useful in complex ocean systems where analytical solutions may not be possible.

## Chapter: Chapter 7: Waveguides

### Introduction

In the vast and complex world of ocean acoustics, waveguides play a pivotal role. This chapter, "Waveguides," is dedicated to exploring the theory and applications of waveguides in the context of computational ocean acoustics. 

Waveguides are structures that guide waves along a path, confining them within a limited region. In the realm of ocean acoustics, waveguides are often used to guide sound waves, allowing them to travel long distances with minimal loss of energy. This is particularly important in underwater communication systems, where sound waves can travel vast distances but are often subject to significant energy loss due to absorption and scattering in the water.

In this chapter, we will delve into the mathematical models that describe waveguides, including the equations that govern wave propagation within these structures. We will also explore the various types of waveguides used in ocean acoustics, such as cylindrical and spherical waveguides, and discuss their unique properties and applications.

Furthermore, we will examine the role of waveguides in the design and operation of underwater communication systems. This includes the use of waveguides in acoustic modems, which are devices used for underwater communication, and the application of waveguide theory in the design of these devices.

Finally, we will discuss the challenges and future directions in the field of waveguides in ocean acoustics. This includes the ongoing research aimed at improving the efficiency and reliability of waveguides, as well as the potential for new applications of waveguide technology in the future.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of waveguides in computational ocean acoustics, from the theoretical foundations to practical applications. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field, we hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource in your exploration of this fascinating subject.




#### 6.4a Introduction to Generalized Derivation

In the previous sections, we have discussed the isovelocity problem and its applications in ocean acoustics. We have seen how the normal modes of the ocean can be used to predict the behavior of sound waves and to design and analyze various systems. In this section, we will introduce a generalized derivation of these normal modes, which will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the problem.

The generalized derivation of the normal modes involves the use of implicit data structures and differentiation rules. These concepts are fundamental to the understanding of computational ocean acoustics. Implicit data structures are data structures where the data is not explicitly stored, but can be computed from other data. This is particularly useful in the context of ocean acoustics, where the data can be complex and difficult to store explicitly.

Differentiation rules, on the other hand, are used to compute the derivatives of functions. In the context of ocean acoustics, these rules are used to compute the derivatives of the normal modes with respect to the parameters of the system. This allows us to understand how the normal modes change as the parameters of the system change, which is crucial for the design and analysis of systems.

The generalized derivation of the normal modes also involves the use of the first-order second-moment method. This method is used to approximate the objective function of a system by a Taylor series at the mean vector. This approximation is then used to compute the mean and variance of the objective function, which are crucial for the understanding of the system.

In the following subsections, we will delve deeper into these concepts and their applications in ocean acoustics. We will also discuss the use of Vaughan's identity and the generalizations of this identity, which are crucial for the understanding of the normal modes. Finally, we will discuss the use of the Gauss-Seidel method and the conjugate gradient method, which are powerful tools for solving the equations that describe the normal modes.

#### 6.4b Generalized Derivation Techniques

In this subsection, we will delve deeper into the generalized derivation techniques used in the context of ocean acoustics. We will discuss the use of the Gauss-Seidel method and the conjugate gradient method, which are powerful tools for solving the equations that describe the normal modes.

The Gauss-Seidel method is an iterative technique used for solving a system of linear equations. It is particularly useful in the context of ocean acoustics, where the equations that describe the normal modes can be complex and difficult to solve directly. The Gauss-Seidel method works by iteratively updating the solution vector, using the current estimate of the solution to compute the next estimate. This process is repeated until the solution converges to a desired level of accuracy.

The conjugate gradient method, on the other hand, is a more general technique for solving linear equations. It is particularly useful when the system of equations is sparse, i.e., when most of the coefficients are zero. The conjugate gradient method works by constructing a sequence of vectors that converge to the solution, using the conjugate gradient property to ensure that the sequence converges in a minimal number of steps.

Both the Gauss-Seidel method and the conjugate gradient method are implemented in the `scipy` library, which is a popular Python library for scientific computing. The `scipy.sparse` module provides additional functionality for handling sparse matrices, which is particularly useful in the context of ocean acoustics.

In the next subsection, we will discuss the use of Vaughan's identity and the generalizations of this identity, which are crucial for the understanding of the normal modes. We will also discuss the use of the first-order second-moment method, which is used to approximate the objective function of a system by a Taylor series at the mean vector. This approximation is then used to compute the mean and variance of the objective function, which are crucial for the understanding of the system.

#### 6.4c Applications in Ocean Acoustics

In this subsection, we will explore the applications of the generalized derivation techniques in the field of ocean acoustics. We will discuss how these techniques are used to solve the equations that describe the normal modes of the ocean, and how they can be used to understand the behavior of sound waves in the ocean.

The normal modes of the ocean are the natural frequencies at which the ocean can oscillate. These frequencies are determined by the properties of the ocean, such as its depth, density, and elasticity. The equations that describe these normal modes are often complex and difficult to solve directly. However, by using the generalized derivation techniques, we can solve these equations iteratively and understand the behavior of the ocean at these natural frequencies.

The Gauss-Seidel method and the conjugate gradient method are particularly useful in this context. The Gauss-Seidel method allows us to solve the equations that describe the normal modes, even when the system of equations is large and complex. The conjugate gradient method, on the other hand, is more general and can handle sparse systems of equations, which are common in the context of ocean acoustics.

In addition to solving the equations that describe the normal modes, the generalized derivation techniques also allow us to understand the sensitivity of these modes to changes in the properties of the ocean. By computing the derivatives of the normal modes with respect to the parameters of the system, we can understand how these modes change as the properties of the ocean change. This is crucial for understanding the behavior of sound waves in the ocean, as these waves interact with the normal modes of the ocean.

In the next subsection, we will discuss the use of Vaughan's identity and the generalizations of this identity, which are crucial for the understanding of the normal modes. We will also discuss the use of the first-order second-moment method, which is used to approximate the objective function of a system by a Taylor series at the mean vector. This approximation is then used to compute the mean and variance of the objective function, which are crucial for the understanding of the system.

#### 6.4d Future Directions

As we continue to explore the field of computational ocean acoustics, it is important to consider the future directions of this field. The generalized derivation techniques discussed in this chapter provide a powerful tool for understanding the normal modes of the ocean and their sensitivity to changes in the properties of the ocean. However, there are still many areas of research that can be explored to further enhance our understanding of ocean acoustics.

One such area is the development of more advanced numerical methods for solving the equations that describe the normal modes of the ocean. While the Gauss-Seidel method and the conjugate gradient method are powerful tools, they are not without their limitations. For example, the Gauss-Seidel method can be slow to converge, and the conjugate gradient method can struggle with sparse systems of equations. Therefore, there is a need for the development of new methods that can overcome these limitations.

Another area of research is the incorporation of more complex physical models into the computational ocean acoustics framework. Currently, the models used to describe the ocean are often simplified to make the equations tractable. However, by incorporating more detailed physical models, we can gain a more accurate understanding of the behavior of sound waves in the ocean. This could involve incorporating models of ocean currents, turbulence, and other physical phenomena that can affect the propagation of sound waves.

Finally, there is a need for more interdisciplinary research that combines computational ocean acoustics with other fields such as oceanography, geophysics, and environmental science. By combining these fields, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the ocean and its acoustic properties. This could involve studying the effects of climate change on the normal modes of the ocean, or using ocean acoustics to study the structure and dynamics of the ocean.

In conclusion, the future of computational ocean acoustics is bright, with many opportunities for further research and development. By continuing to explore these opportunities, we can deepen our understanding of the ocean and its acoustic properties, and contribute to the development of new technologies for ocean exploration and monitoring.

The study of ocean acoustics is a vast and complex field, with applications ranging from underwater communication to marine navigation. In this chapter, we will delve into the specific area of applications in oceanography, exploring how computational models of ocean acoustics are used to understand and predict the behavior of sound waves in the ocean.

Oceanography, the study of the ocean, is a multidisciplinary field that encompasses a wide range of topics, from physical oceanography, which deals with the movement of water, to biological oceanography, which studies the life in the ocean.

#### 6.4b Mathematical Approach

In this subsection, we will delve deeper into the mathematical approach to the generalized derivation of normal modes. We will start by discussing the use of implicit data structures and differentiation rules.

##### Implicit Data Structures

Implicit data structures are a fundamental concept in computational ocean acoustics. They allow us to store complex data in a compact and efficient manner. For example, the data structure `L \setminus (M \setminus R)` can be represented as `(L \setminus M) \cup (L \cap R)`. This representation is more compact and efficient than storing the data explicitly.

In the context of normal modes, implicit data structures can be used to represent the system parameters and the normal modes themselves. This allows us to compute the derivatives of the normal modes with respect to the parameters more efficiently.

##### Differentiation Rules

Differentiation rules are used to compute the derivatives of functions. In the context of normal modes, these rules are used to compute the derivatives of the normal modes with respect to the parameters of the system. This allows us to understand how the normal modes change as the parameters of the system change.

For example, the derivative of the normal modes with respect to the parameters can be computed using the chain rule. If `$f(x)$` is differentiable at `$a$`, and `$g(x) = h(f(x))$`, then the derivative of `$g(x)$` at `$a$` is given by `$g'(a) = h'(f(a)) \cdot f'(a)$`.

##### First-Order Second-Moment Method

The first-order second-moment method is used to approximate the objective function of a system by a Taylor series at the mean vector. This approximation is then used to compute the mean and variance of the objective function.

In the context of normal modes, the first-order second-moment method can be used to approximate the normal modes by a Taylor series at the mean vector. This allows us to understand the behavior of the normal modes as the parameters of the system change.

##### Vaughan's Identity and Its Generalizations

Vaughan's identity is a fundamental concept in the study of normal modes. It provides a relationship between the normal modes and the system parameters. This relationship is crucial for the understanding of the system.

The generalizations of Vaughan's identity provide further insights into the behavior of the normal modes. For example, the generalization `$$\Delta w = ...$$` provides a more detailed understanding of the relationship between the normal modes and the system parameters.

In the next subsection, we will discuss the application of these mathematical concepts to the study of normal modes in ocean acoustics.

The normal modes of the ocean can be used to analyze the scattering of sound by ocean structures. For example, the scattering of sound by a submarine can be modeled using the normal modes of the ocean. This allows us to predict the direction and intensity of the scattered sound, which is crucial for detecting submarines.

The normal modes of the ocean can also be used to analyze the interaction of sound with the ocean floor. This is particularly important in the study of seismic imaging, where sound waves are used to create images of the ocean floor. The normal modes provide a basis for the analysis of the sound waves after they have interacted with the ocean floor, allowing us to extract information about the ocean floor from the sound waves.

##### Normal Modes and Sound Propagation

The normal modes of the ocean are also fundamental to understanding the propagation of sound in the ocean. The normal modes provide a basis for the analysis of the sound waves as they propagate through the ocean. This allows us to predict the behavior of the sound waves as they encounter different regions of the ocean, such as regions with different temperatures or salinities.

The normal modes of the ocean can also be used to analyze the effects of ocean currents on sound propagation. This is particularly important in the study of acoustic tomography, where sound waves are used to create images of the ocean. The normal modes provide a basis for the analysis of the sound waves as they are transported by the ocean currents, allowing us to extract information about the ocean currents from the sound waves.

##### Normal Modes and Ocean Noise

The normal modes of the ocean can be used to analyze ocean noise, which is the background noise in the ocean caused by various sources such as wind, waves, and marine life. The normal modes provide a basis for the analysis of the ocean noise, allowing us to extract information about the sources of the noise from the ocean noise.

The normal modes of the ocean can also be used to analyze the effects of ocean noise on sound propagation. This is particularly important in the study of sonar, where sound waves are used to detect objects in the ocean. The normal modes provide a basis for the analysis of the sound waves as they are affected by the ocean noise, allowing us to predict the effects of the ocean noise on the detection of objects in the ocean.

In conclusion, the generalized derivation of normal modes provides a powerful tool for the analysis of various phenomena in ocean acoustics. It allows us to predict the behavior of sound waves in the ocean, to analyze the scattering and interaction of sound with ocean structures and the ocean floor, and to understand the effects of ocean noise on sound propagation.

#### 6.4c Applications in Ocean Acoustics

The generalized derivation of normal modes has a wide range of applications in ocean acoustics. In this section, we will explore some of these applications, focusing on the use of implicit data structures, differentiation rules, and the first-order second-moment method.

##### Implicit Data Structures in Ocean Acoustics

Implicit data structures are particularly useful in ocean acoustics due to the complex nature of the data involved. For example, the data structure `L \setminus (M \setminus R)` can be used to represent the set of all possible ocean acoustic signals, where `L` represents the set of all possible frequencies, `M` represents the set of all possible wavelengths, and `R` represents the set of all possible directions of propagation.

This representation allows us to efficiently store and manipulate large amounts of data, which is crucial in ocean acoustics where we often deal with signals of varying frequencies, wavelengths, and directions of propagation.

##### Differentiation Rules in Ocean Acoustics

Differentiation rules are used extensively in ocean acoustics to compute the derivatives of various quantities with respect to the parameters of the system. For example, the derivative of the normal modes with respect to the parameters can be used to compute the sensitivity of the normal modes to changes in the parameters.

This is particularly important in the design and optimization of ocean acoustic systems, where we often need to understand how changes in the parameters affect the performance of the system.

##### First-Order Second-Moment Method in Ocean Acoustics

The first-order second-moment method is used in ocean acoustics to approximate the objective function of a system by a Taylor series at the mean vector. This approximation is then used to compute the mean and variance of the objective function, which can provide valuable insights into the behavior of the system.

For example, in the context of normal modes, the first-order second-moment method can be used to approximate the normal modes by a Taylor series at the mean vector. This allows us to understand the behavior of the normal modes as the parameters of the system change.

## Chapter 7: Wave Propagation

### Introduction

Wave propagation is a fundamental concept in the field of ocean acoustics. It is the process by which sound waves travel through the ocean, carrying information about the environment and the organisms that inhabit it. This chapter will delve into the theory and applications of wave propagation in the ocean, providing a comprehensive understanding of this crucial aspect of ocean acoustics.

The propagation of sound waves in the ocean is a complex phenomenon, influenced by a multitude of factors such as the properties of the water, the presence of boundaries, and the frequency of the sound. Understanding these factors and how they interact is essential for predicting the behavior of sound waves in the ocean, and for designing effective acoustic systems.

This knowledge will provide a foundation for the subsequent chapters, which will delve deeper into the specific applications of computational ocean acoustics.




#### 6.5a Introduction to Munk Profile

The Munk Profile, named after the Canadian oceanographer Harry H. Munk, is a fundamental concept in the study of ocean acoustics. It is a theoretical model that describes the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, taking into account the effects of the ocean floor and the water column.

The Munk Profile is particularly useful in the study of normal modes, as it provides a mathematical framework for understanding the interaction between the ocean floor and the propagating sound waves. This interaction is crucial in determining the normal modes of the ocean, which are the natural frequencies at which the ocean resonates.

The Munk Profile is defined by the following equation:

$$
M(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{gk}} \frac{dC}{dz}
$$

where $M(z)$ is the Munk Profile, $z$ is the vertical coordinate (positive upwards), $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $k$ is the wavenumber, and $C$ is the sound speed.

The Munk Profile is a function of the vertical coordinate $z$, and it describes the variation of the sound speed with depth in the ocean. The Munk Profile is typically used in conjunction with the normal mode equations to solve for the normal modes of the ocean.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the Munk Profile and its applications in ocean acoustics. We will explore how the Munk Profile can be used to understand the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, and how it can be used to solve for the normal modes of the ocean. We will also discuss the implications of the Munk Profile for the design and optimization of ocean acoustic systems.

#### 6.5b Munk Profile and Normal Modes

The Munk Profile plays a crucial role in the study of normal modes in ocean acoustics. As we have seen in the previous section, the Munk Profile describes the variation of the sound speed with depth in the ocean. This variation is a key factor in determining the normal modes of the ocean.

The normal modes of the ocean are the natural frequencies at which the ocean resonates. They are determined by the solution of the normal mode equations, which are a set of differential equations that describe the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. The Munk Profile is used in conjunction with these equations to solve for the normal modes.

The normal mode equations can be written as:

$$
\frac{d^2 M}{dz^2} - k^2 M = 0
$$

where $M$ is the Munk Profile, $z$ is the vertical coordinate (positive upwards), $k$ is the wavenumber, and the second derivative is taken with respect to the vertical coordinate.

The solutions to these equations are the normal modes of the ocean. Each normal mode corresponds to a specific frequency at which the ocean resonates. The normal modes are important in ocean acoustics because they determine the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.

The Munk Profile is used in the solution of the normal mode equations because it describes the variation of the sound speed with depth in the ocean. The sound speed is a key parameter in the normal mode equations, as it determines the wavenumber $k$. The Munk Profile provides a mathematical model for this variation, which is crucial in solving the normal mode equations.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of the Munk Profile and the normal modes for the design and optimization of ocean acoustic systems. We will also discuss some of the challenges and limitations of using the Munk Profile in ocean acoustics.

#### 6.5c Applications in Ocean Acoustics

The Munk Profile and the concept of normal modes have wide-ranging applications in the field of ocean acoustics. These applications span from the design and optimization of sonar systems to the understanding of oceanic sound propagation and the prediction of noise pollution.

##### Sonar Systems

Sonar systems, which are used for underwater navigation and detection of objects, rely heavily on the understanding of normal modes and the Munk Profile. The normal modes of the ocean determine the propagation of sound waves, which are used in sonar systems. The Munk Profile, on the other hand, provides a mathematical model for the variation of sound speed with depth, which is crucial in predicting the behavior of sound waves in the ocean.

The design and optimization of sonar systems often involve the use of the normal mode equations. These equations are solved to determine the normal modes of the ocean, which in turn determine the propagation of sound waves. The Munk Profile is used in conjunction with these equations to account for the variation of sound speed with depth.

##### Oceanic Sound Propagation

The Munk Profile and the concept of normal modes are also used in the study of oceanic sound propagation. The normal modes of the ocean determine the propagation of sound waves, which can be used to understand the behavior of sound in the ocean.

For instance, the normal modes can be used to predict the attenuation of sound waves in the ocean. The attenuation is the reduction in the intensity of sound waves as they propagate through the ocean. The normal modes provide a mathematical model for this attenuation, which can be used to predict the behavior of sound waves in the ocean.

##### Prediction of Noise Pollution

The Munk Profile and the concept of normal modes are also used in the prediction of noise pollution in the ocean. Noise pollution, which is the unwanted or harmful sound in the ocean, can be predicted by understanding the normal modes of the ocean.

The normal modes of the ocean determine the propagation of sound waves, which can be used to predict the dispersion of noise in the ocean. The dispersion is the spreading of noise as it propagates through the ocean. The normal modes provide a mathematical model for this dispersion, which can be used to predict the behavior of noise in the ocean.

#### 6.5b Mathematical Representation

The Munk Profile can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
M(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{gk}} \frac{dC}{dz}
$$

where $M(z)$ is the Munk Profile, $z$ is the vertical coordinate (positive upwards), $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $k$ is the wavenumber, and $C$ is the sound speed.

#### 6.6a Introduction to Numerical Approaches

In the previous sections, we have discussed the theoretical aspects of normal modes and their applications in ocean acoustics. However, in many practical scenarios, it is necessary to solve complex problems that involve normal modes. This is where numerical approaches come into play.

Numerical approaches are computational methods used to solve mathematical problems that cannot be solved analytically. In the context of normal modes, these methods are used to solve the eigenvalue problem that arises when determining the normal modes of a system.

One of the most common numerical approaches used in the study of normal modes is the Gauss-Seidel method. This iterative method is used to solve a system of linear equations, which is often the case when dealing with normal modes. The Gauss-Seidel method is particularly useful when dealing with large systems of equations, as it allows for the efficient computation of the solutions.

Another important numerical approach is the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). This method has been proven to be a powerful tool for solving problems at different length and time scales. It has been used in a variety of applications, including the study of normal modes in ocean acoustics.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these numerical approaches and explore their applications in the study of normal modes. We will also discuss other numerical methods, such as the Gradient Discretisation Method (GDM), and their relevance to the study of normal modes.

#### 6.6b Gauss-Seidel Method

The Gauss-Seidel method is an iterative technique used to solve a system of linear equations. It is named after the German mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauss and Philipp Ludwig von Seidel, who developed it in the 19th century.

The method is particularly useful when dealing with large systems of equations, as it allows for the efficient computation of the solutions. This is because the Gauss-Seidel method updates the solution vector in a sequential manner, using the updated values of the previous iterations.

The general form of the Gauss-Seidel method can be written as:

$$
x^{(k+1)}_i = \frac{1}{a_{ii}} \left( b_i - \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_{ij}x^{(k+1)}_j - \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} a_{ij}x^{(k)}_j \right)
$$

where $x^{(k)}_i$ is the $i$-th component of the $k$-th iteration, $a_{ij}$ are the coefficients of the system, and $b_i$ are the constants on the right-hand side of the equations.

The Gauss-Seidel method is an example of a relaxation method, where the solution is approached gradually, with each iteration providing a better approximation of the true solution. The method is particularly effective when the system of equations is diagonally dominant, i.e., when the absolute value of the diagonal elements is greater than the sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal elements.

In the context of normal modes, the Gauss-Seidel method can be used to solve the eigenvalue problem that arises when determining the normal modes of a system. This is because the eigenvalue problem can often be formulated as a system of linear equations.

In the next section, we will explore another important numerical approach, the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), and its applications in the study of normal modes.

#### 6.6c Lattice Boltzmann Method

The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is a numerical technique used to solve problems at different length and time scales. It has been widely used in various fields, including fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and, more recently, in the study of normal modes in ocean acoustics.

The LBM is a simplified version of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical behavior of a large number of particles in a system. The LBM discretizes the Boltzmann equation into a set of lattice sites, each representing a small volume of the system. The evolution of the system is then governed by the movement of particles between these lattice sites.

The LBM has several advantages over other numerical methods. It is inherently parallel, making it suitable for parallel computing architectures. It also has a natural implementation of boundary conditions, which can be crucial in many applications.

In the context of normal modes, the LBM has been used to simulate the propagation of acoustic waves in the ocean. This is particularly relevant in the study of ocean acoustics, where the propagation of sound waves can be complex and difficult to model analytically.

The LBM can be used to solve the normal modes problem by discretizing the wave equation into a set of lattice sites. The evolution of the wave field is then governed by the movement of particles between these lattice sites. This approach allows for the efficient computation of the normal modes, even in complex geometries and boundary conditions.

The LBM is also particularly well-suited to handle the non-linearities that often arise in the study of normal modes. This is because the LBM is a conservative method, meaning that it preserves the total energy and momentum of the system. This property can be crucial in the study of non-linear systems, where the conservation laws can play a crucial role in determining the behavior of the system.

In the next section, we will explore another important numerical approach, the Gauss-Seidel method, and its applications in the study of normal modes.

#### 6.6d Gradient Discretisation Method

The Gradient Discretisation Method (GDM) is a numerical technique used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). It has been applied to a wide range of problems since it was first introduced in the 1990s. In the context of normal modes, the GDM has been used to solve the wave equation, which describes the propagation of acoustic waves in the ocean.

The GDM is based on the concept of gradient discretisation, where the derivatives in the PDEs are approximated by finite differences. This is achieved by discretising the domain into a set of grid points, and approximating the derivatives at these points using the values of the function at the neighboring points.

The GDM has several advantages over other numerical methods. It is a variational method, meaning that it satisfies certain properties that can be crucial in the analysis of the solution. These properties include coercivity, GD-consistency, limit-conformity, and compactness, which are all satisfied by the GDM.

In the context of normal modes, the GDM has been used to solve the wave equation by discretising the domain into a set of grid points and approximating the derivatives in the wave equation using the values of the wave field at the neighboring points. This approach allows for the efficient computation of the normal modes, even in complex geometries and boundary conditions.

The GDM is also particularly well-suited to handle the non-linearities that often arise in the study of normal modes. This is because the GDM is a gradient-based method, meaning that it can handle non-linearities by incorporating them into the gradient. This property can be crucial in the study of non-linear systems, where the behavior of the system can be highly dependent on the gradient of the system.

In the next section, we will explore another important numerical approach, the Gauss-Seidel method, and its applications in the study of normal modes.

#### 6.6e Applications and Examples

In this section, we will explore some practical applications and examples of the numerical approaches discussed in the previous sections. These examples will illustrate how these methods can be used to solve real-world problems in ocean acoustics.

##### Example 1: Lattice Boltzmann Method for Ocean Acoustics

The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) has been used to simulate the propagation of acoustic waves in the ocean. This is particularly relevant in the study of normal modes, as it allows for the efficient computation of the normal modes even in complex geometries and boundary conditions.

Consider a simple example where we want to simulate the propagation of a sound wave in a homogeneous and isotropic medium. The wave equation for this problem can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 p
$$

where $p$ is the pressure, $t$ is time, $c$ is the speed of sound, and $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator.

The LBM can be used to discretise this equation and solve it numerically. The domain is discretised into a set of lattice sites, and the pressure at each site is represented by a set of particles. The evolution of the system is then governed by the movement of these particles between the lattice sites.

##### Example 2: Gradient Discretisation Method for Normal Modes

The Gradient Discretisation Method (GDM) has been used to solve the wave equation for the study of normal modes. This method is particularly well-suited to handle the non-linearities that often arise in the study of normal modes.

Consider a simple example where we want to solve the wave equation for a spherical domain with a point source at the center. The wave equation for this problem can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 p + \delta(r-r_0)
$$

where $r$ is the distance from the center of the sphere, $r_0$ is the distance from the point source, and $\delta(r-r_0)$ is the Dirac delta function.

The GDM can be used to discretise this equation and solve it numerically. The domain is discretised into a set of grid points, and the pressure at each point is represented by a set of values. The derivatives in the wave equation are approximated by finite differences, and the equation is solved iteratively using a gradient-based method.

These examples illustrate the power and versatility of the numerical approaches discussed in this chapter. They show how these methods can be used to solve complex problems in ocean acoustics, and how they can be adapted to handle the non-linearities that often arise in these problems.

#### 6.6c Applications in Ocean Acoustics

The study of normal modes in ocean acoustics has a wide range of applications. These applications span from understanding the propagation of sound waves in the ocean to predicting the behavior of marine animals and even detecting submarines. In this section, we will explore some of these applications in more detail.

##### Understanding Propagation of Sound Waves in the Ocean

One of the primary applications of studying normal modes in ocean acoustics is understanding the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. The ocean is a complex medium with varying properties such as density, temperature, and salinity. These properties can affect the propagation of sound waves, leading to phenomena such as refraction and diffraction. By studying the normal modes of the ocean, we can gain a better understanding of how these properties affect the propagation of sound waves.

For example, consider a sound wave propagating in the ocean. The wave can be represented as a superposition of normal modes, each with its own frequency and wavenumber. The interaction of these normal modes with the varying properties of the ocean can lead to phenomena such as refraction, where the wave bends as it encounters a change in the properties of the medium. By studying the normal modes, we can gain a better understanding of how this refraction occurs and how it affects the propagation of the sound wave.

##### Predicting the Behavior of Marine Animals

Another important application of studying normal modes in ocean acoustics is predicting the behavior of marine animals. Many marine animals, such as whales and dolphins, use sound waves to navigate and communicate. These animals can detect and interpret the normal modes of the ocean, allowing them to navigate and communicate effectively.

By studying the normal modes of the ocean, we can gain a better understanding of how these animals use sound waves. This can help us predict their behavior and potentially even communicate with them. For example, by understanding the normal modes of the ocean, we can predict how a whale will respond to a sound wave. This can be useful in situations where whales need to be deterred from approaching a ship or other hazard.

##### Detecting Submarines

Finally, studying normal modes in ocean acoustics can also be used to detect submarines. Submarines are difficult to detect because they can operate at great depths and can be quieter than surface ships. However, the sound waves they generate can interact with the normal modes of the ocean, leading to phenomena such as reverberation.

By studying the normal modes of the ocean, we can gain a better understanding of how these interactions occur. This can help us develop more effective methods for detecting submarines. For example, by understanding the normal modes, we can predict how a sound wave will interact with the ocean and how this interaction will change over time. This can help us develop more effective sonar systems for detecting submarines.

In conclusion, the study of normal modes in ocean acoustics has a wide range of applications. From understanding the propagation of sound waves in the ocean to predicting the behavior of marine animals and even detecting submarines, the study of normal modes is a crucial aspect of ocean acoustics.

#### 6.7a Introduction to Numerical Procedures

In the previous sections, we have discussed the theory behind normal modes and their applications in ocean acoustics. However, in many practical situations, we need to solve complex problems that involve normal modes. These problems often involve non-linear systems and require numerical procedures to find solutions. In this section, we will introduce some of the numerical procedures used in the study of normal modes.

##### Gauss–Seidel Method

The Gauss–Seidel method is a numerical procedure used to solve a system of linear equations. It is an iterative method that starts with an initial guess for the solution and then iteratively updates the solution until it converges to the true solution. The method is named after the German mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauss and Philipp Ludwig von Seidel.

The Gauss–Seidel method is particularly useful when dealing with large systems of equations. It is an example of a relaxation method, where the solution is approached gradually, with each iteration improving the solution. The method is based on the idea of splitting the system of equations into two parts, one that involves the unknowns and one that involves the knowns. The solution is then updated iteratively by solving the two parts alternately.

The Gauss–Seidel method can be used to solve the system of equations that arise in the study of normal modes. For example, consider the system of equations that describe the normal modes of a string. The system can be written as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} &= \lambda y, \\
y(0) &= 0, \\
y(L) &= 0.
\end{align*}
$$

where $y$ is the displacement of the string, $x$ is the position along the string, $L$ is the length of the string, and $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue. The Gauss–Seidel method can be used to solve this system of equations to find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the string.

In the next section, we will discuss another numerical procedure, the Adams–Moulton methods, and how it can be used to solve systems of differential equations that arise in the study of normal modes.

#### 6.7b Implementing Numerical Procedures

In this section, we will discuss how to implement the numerical procedures introduced in the previous section, such as the Gauss–Seidel method and the Adams–Moulton methods. We will also discuss how to use these procedures to solve systems of equations that arise in the study of normal modes.

##### Implementing the Gauss–Seidel Method

The Gauss–Seidel method is an iterative method that updates the solution iteratively until it converges to the true solution. The method is particularly useful when dealing with large systems of equations. Here are the steps to implement the Gauss–Seidel method:

1. Start with an initial guess for the solution.
2. Split the system of equations into two parts, one that involves the unknowns and one that involves the knowns.
3. Update the solution iteratively by solving the two parts alternately.
4. Check for convergence. If the solution has not yet converged, go back to step 2.

The Gauss–Seidel method can be used to solve the system of equations that describe the normal modes of a string. For example, consider the system of equations that describe the normal modes of a string:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} &= \lambda y, \\
y(0) &= 0, \\
y(L) &= 0.
\end{align*}
$$

where $y$ is the displacement of the string, $x$ is the position along the string, $L$ is the length of the string, and $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue. The Gauss–Seidel method can be used to solve this system of equations to find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the string.

##### Implementing the Adams–Moulton Methods

The Adams–Moulton methods are a family of implicit numerical methods used to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These methods are particularly useful when dealing with stiff ODEs. Here are the steps to implement the Adams–Moulton methods:

1. Start with an initial guess for the solution.
2. Split the ODE into two parts, one that involves the unknowns and one that involves the knowns.
3. Update the solution iteratively by solving the two parts alternately.
4. Check for convergence. If the solution has not yet converged, go back to step 2.

The Adams–Moulton methods can be used to solve the system of equations that describe the normal modes of a string. For example, consider the system of equations that describe the normal modes of a string:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} &= \lambda y, \\
y(0) &= 0, \\
y(L) &= 0.
\end{align*}
$$

where $y$ is the displacement of the string, $x$ is the position along the string, $L$ is the length of the string, and $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue. The Adams–Moulton methods can be used to solve this system of equations to find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the string.

In the next section, we will discuss how to implement these numerical procedures in a computer program.

#### 6.7c Applications in Ocean Acoustics

In this section, we will explore the applications of the numerical procedures discussed in the previous section, particularly the Gauss–Seidel method and the Adams–Moulton methods, in the field of ocean acoustics. We will focus on how these methods can be used to solve systems of equations that describe the normal modes of ocean acoustics.

##### Normal Modes in Ocean Acoustics

Normal modes are solutions to the wave equation that describe the propagation of waves in a medium. In the context of ocean acoustics, these modes are used to describe the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. The normal modes of the ocean are determined by the properties of the ocean, such as its depth, density, and temperature.

The normal modes of the ocean can be described by a system of equations. For example, consider the system of equations that describe the normal modes of a stratified fluid layer, as discussed in the previous chapter:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x^2} &= \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2}, \\
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} &= 0 \quad \text{at} \quad x = 0, \\
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} &= 0 \quad \text{at} \quad x = L, \\
\eta(x,0) &= 0, \\
\eta(x,T) &= 0.
\end{align*}
$$

where $\eta$ is the vertical displacement of the fluid layer, $x$ is the horizontal position, $t$ is time, $c$ is the speed of sound in the fluid layer, and $L$ is the length of the fluid layer.

##### Solving the System of Equations

The system of equations that describe the normal modes of the ocean can be solved using the numerical procedures discussed in the previous section. For example, the Gauss–Seidel method can be used to solve the system of equations iteratively, updating the solution until it converges to the true solution. Similarly, the Adams–Moulton methods can be used to solve the system of equations implicitly, updating the solution iteratively until it converges to the true solution.

By solving the system of equations, we can determine the normal modes of the ocean, which describe the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. This information is crucial in many applications in ocean acoustics, such as predicting the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, designing underwater acoustic devices, and understanding the effects of ocean properties on sound propagation.

In the next section, we will discuss how to implement these numerical procedures in a computer program, and how to use the program to solve the system of equations that describe the normal modes of the ocean.

4. Use the updated unknown part to update the known part.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the solution converges.

The Gauss-Seidel method can be used to solve the system of equations that describe the normal modes of a string. For example, consider the system of equations that describe the normal modes of a string:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} &= \lambda y, \\
y(0) &= 0, \\
y(L) &= 0.
\end{align*}
$$

where $y$ is the displacement of the string, $x$ is the position along the string, $L$ is the length of the string, and $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue. The Gauss-Seidel method can be used to solve this system of equations to find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the string.

##### Adams-Moulton Methods

The Adams-Moulton methods are a family of implicit numerical methods used to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These methods are particularly useful when dealing with stiff ODEs, which often arise in the study of normal modes. The Adams-Moulton methods are an extension of the Adams-Bashforth methods, which are explicit methods.

The Adams-Moulton methods are similar to the Adams-Bashforth methods in that they also have $a_{s-1} = -1$ and $a_{s-2} = \cdots = a_0 = 0$. However, the Adams-Moulton methods are implicit methods, which means that they involve the solution at the next time step. The Adams-Moulton methods can reach order $s+1$ with "s" steps, while the Adams-Bashforth methods have only order "s".

The steps for the Adams-Moulton methods are as follows:

1. Write the ODE in the form $y'(t) = f(t, y(t))$.
2. Choose a time step $h$.
3. Use the Adams-Moulton method to approximate $y(t+h)$.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the solution converges.

The Adams-Moulton methods can be used to solve the ODEs that describe the normal modes of a system. For example, consider the ODEs that describe the normal modes of a string:

$$
\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = \lambda y,
$$

where $y$ is the displacement of the string, $t$ is time, and $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue. The Adams-Moulton methods can be used to solve this ODE to find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the string.

#### 6.7c Applications and Examples

In this section, we will explore some practical applications and examples of the numerical procedures discussed in the previous sections. We will focus on the Gauss-Seidel method and the Adams-Moulton methods, and how they are used to solve normal modes problems in ocean acoustics.

##### Gauss-Seidel Method in Ocean Acoustics

The Gauss-Seidel method is a powerful tool in the study of normal modes in ocean acoustics. It is particularly useful when dealing with large systems of equations, which often arise in the study of normal modes. The method is based on the idea of splitting the system of equations into two parts, one that involves the unknowns and one that involves the knowns. The solution is then updated iteratively by solving the two parts alternately.

In the context of ocean acoustics, the Gauss-Seidel method can be used to solve the system of equations that describe the normal modes of a system. For example, consider the system of equations that describe the normal modes of a string:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} &= \lambda y, \\
y(0) &= 0, \\
y(L) &= 0.
\end{align*}
$$

where $y$ is the displacement of the string, $x$ is the position along the string, $L$ is the length of the string, and $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue. The Gauss-Seidel method can be used to solve this system of equations to find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the string.

##### Adams-Moulton Methods in Ocean Acoustics

The Adams-Moulton methods are a family of implicit numerical methods used to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These methods are particularly useful when dealing with stiff ODEs, which often arise in the study of normal modes in ocean acoustics.

The Adams-Moulton methods are similar to the Adams-Bashforth methods, which are explicit methods. However, the Adams-Moulton methods are implicit methods, which means that they involve the solution at the next time step. This makes them particularly useful for solving stiff ODEs, where the solution changes rapidly over a small range of the independent variable.

In the context of ocean acoustics, the Adams-Moulton methods can be used to solve the ODEs that describe the normal modes of a system. For example, consider the ODEs that describe the normal modes of a string:

$$
\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = \lambda y,
$$

where $y$ is the displacement of the string, $t$ is time, and $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue. The Adams-Moulton methods can be used to solve this ODE to find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the string.




#### 6.7c Applications and Case Studies

In this section, we will explore some applications and case studies that demonstrate the use of numerical procedures in solving normal modes problems. These examples will provide a practical understanding of the concepts discussed in the previous sections.

##### Case Study 1: Normal Modes of a String

Consider a string of length $L$ that is fixed at both ends. The normal modes of this string can be found by solving the system of equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} &= \lambda y, \\
y(0) &= 0, \\
y(L) &= 0.
\end{align*}
$$

where $y$ is the displacement of the string, $x$ is the position along the string, $L$ is the length of the string, and $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue. The Gauss-Seidel method can be used to solve this system of equations to find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the string.

##### Case Study 2: Normal Modes of a Circle

Consider a circle of radius $R$ that is fixed at its center. The normal modes of this circle can be found by solving the system of equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} &= \lambda y, \\
y(0) &= 0, \\
y(2\pi R) &= 0.
\end{align*}
$$

where $y$ is the displacement of the circle, $x$ is the angle around the circle, $R$ is the radius of the circle, and $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue. The Adams-Moulton methods can be used to solve this system of equations to find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the circle.

##### Case Study 3: Normal Modes of a Cylinder

Consider a cylinder of radius $R$ that is fixed at its ends. The normal modes of this cylinder can be found by solving the system of equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} &= \lambda y, \\
y(0) &= 0, \\
y(2\pi R) &= 0.
\end{align*}
$$

where $y$ is the displacement of the cylinder, $x$ is the angle around the cylinder, $R$ is the radius of the cylinder, and $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue. The Adams-Moulton methods can be used to solve this system of equations to find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the cylinder.

These case studies demonstrate the versatility of numerical procedures in solving normal modes problems. They can be applied to a wide range of systems, from simple strings and circles to more complex cylinders. The choice of method depends on the specific characteristics of the system, such as its stiffness and the number of unknowns.




#### 6.8a Introduction to Range-dependent Environment

In the previous sections, we have discussed the normal modes of various structures such as strings, circles, and cylinders. These structures are assumed to be homogeneous, meaning that their properties do not change with position. However, in many real-world applications, we encounter structures that are range-dependent, meaning that their properties vary with position. This can be due to various factors such as material inhomogeneity, boundary conditions, or external forces.

In this section, we will introduce the concept of range-dependent environment and discuss its implications for normal modes. We will also explore some examples of range-dependent environments and how they affect the normal modes of structures.

#### 6.8b Range-dependent Environment and Normal Modes

The normal modes of a structure are determined by the system of equations that govern its motion. In the case of a range-dependent environment, these equations can be written as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} &= \lambda y, \\
y(0) &= 0, \\
y(L) &= 0.
\end{align*}
$$

where $y$ is the displacement of the structure, $x$ is the position along the structure, $L$ is the length of the structure, and $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue. However, in a range-dependent environment, the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of this system can vary with position.

This means that the normal modes of a range-dependent structure can be different at different points along the structure. This can have significant implications for the behavior of the structure, especially in dynamic systems where the structure is subjected to external forces.

#### 6.8c Examples of Range-dependent Environment

There are many examples of range-dependent environments in ocean acoustics. One common example is the variation of water density with depth. The density of water decreases with depth due to the pressure and temperature changes. This can affect the normal modes of structures immersed in the water, such as ships or submarines.

Another example is the variation of material properties with position in a structure. This can occur due to manufacturing defects or intentional design features. For example, in a ship, the material properties can vary along the length of the hull due to differences in construction methods. This can affect the normal modes of the ship and can lead to unexpected behavior under certain conditions.

#### 6.8d Conclusion

In this section, we have introduced the concept of range-dependent environment and discussed its implications for normal modes. We have also explored some examples of range-dependent environments and how they affect the normal modes of structures. In the next section, we will delve deeper into the theory of normal modes in range-dependent environments and discuss some numerical methods for solving these systems.

#### 6.8b Normal Modes in Range-dependent Environment

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of range-dependent environment and its implications for normal modes. In this section, we will delve deeper into the theory of normal modes in range-dependent environments and explore some numerical methods for solving these systems.

#### 6.8c Applications and Case Studies

The theory of normal modes in range-dependent environments has many practical applications in ocean acoustics. One such application is in the design and analysis of underwater structures. For instance, the design of a submarine hull must take into account the range-dependent environment of the water. The hull must be designed to withstand the varying pressures and temperatures at different depths, and this can be achieved by understanding the normal modes of the hull in a range-dependent environment.

Another application is in the study of ocean waves. The normal modes of the ocean can be used to understand the propagation of waves and their interaction with structures. This is particularly important in the design of offshore structures, such as oil rigs, which must be able to withstand the forces exerted by the ocean waves.

To illustrate these concepts, let's consider a simple case study. Suppose we have a cylindrical pipe immersed in a range-dependent environment, such as a body of water with varying density. The normal modes of this pipe can be found by solving the system of equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} &= \lambda y, \\
y(0) &= 0, \\
y(L) &= 0.
\end{align*}
$$

where $y$ is the displacement of the pipe, $x$ is the position along the pipe, $L$ is the length of the pipe, and $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue. The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of this system can vary with position due to the range-dependent environment, and this can be used to understand the behavior of the pipe under different conditions.

In conclusion, the theory of normal modes in range-dependent environments is a powerful tool in the field of ocean acoustics. It allows us to understand the behavior of structures in a range-dependent environment and design structures that can withstand these environments. In the next section, we will explore some numerical methods for solving these systems in more detail.

#### 6.8d Conclusion

We have also seen how this theory can be applied in practical situations, such as the design of underwater structures and the study of ocean waves.

The theory of normal modes in range-dependent environments is a powerful tool in the field of ocean acoustics. It allows us to understand the complex interactions between structures and their environment, and to design structures that can withstand these interactions. However, it is also a complex theory that requires a deep understanding of mathematics and physics. Therefore, it is important to continue studying and exploring this theory to fully understand its potential and its limitations.

In conclusion, the study of normal modes in range-dependent environments is a crucial aspect of computational ocean acoustics. It provides a powerful tool for understanding and designing structures in the ocean, and it is a field that continues to evolve and expand.

#### 6.8b Mathematical Representation

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of range-dependent environment and discussed its implications for normal modes. In this section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical representation of range-dependent environments and how it affects the normal modes of structures.

The mathematical representation of a range-dependent environment is typically given by a function that describes the variation of the system's properties with position. For example, in the case of a structure with material inhomogeneity, this function could be the density of the material as a function of position.

The system of equations that govern the motion of the structure can then be written as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} &= \lambda y, \\

This means that the normal modes of a range-dependent structure can be different at different points along the structure. This can have significant implications for the behavior of the structure, especially in dynamic systems where the structure is subjected to external forces.

In the next section, we will explore some examples of range-dependent environments and how they affect the normal modes of structures.

### Subsection: 6.9a Introduction to Coupled Modes

In the previous sections, we have discussed the normal modes of structures in range-dependent environments. However, in many practical applications, structures are not isolated but are coupled with other structures. This coupling can significantly affect the behavior of the structures and their normal modes. In this section, we will introduce the concept of coupled modes and discuss their importance in ocean acoustics.

Coupled modes refer to the normal modes of a system that are influenced by the interaction between different parts of the system. In the context of ocean acoustics, this can occur when two or more structures are connected or when sound waves propagate between different media. The coupling between these modes can lead to interesting phenomena such as mode splitting and mode coupling.

To understand the concept of coupled modes, let's consider two substructures A and B that are coupled together. The dynamic equations for these substructures can be written as:

$$
\mathbf Z^A \mathbf u^A + \mathbf Z^{AB} \mathbf u^B = \mathbf f^A + \mathbf g^A
$$

$$
\mathbf Z^{BA} \mathbf u^A + \mathbf Z^B \mathbf u^B = \mathbf f^B + \mathbf g^B
$$

where $\mathbf Z^A$ and $\mathbf Z^B$ are the impedance matrices of substructures A and B, respectively, and $\mathbf Z^{AB}$ and $\mathbf Z^{BA}$ are the coupling impedance matrices. The vectors $\mathbf u^A$ and $\mathbf u^B$ represent the displacement vectors of substructures A and B, respectively, and $\mathbf f^A$ and $\mathbf f^B$ are the external force vectors. The vectors $\mathbf g^A$ and $\mathbf g^B$ represent the coupling forces between substructures A and B.

The coupling between the two substructures can be visualized as a coupling between their normal modes. This coupling can lead to mode splitting, where a single normal mode of the uncoupled system splits into multiple normal modes in the coupled system. It can also lead to mode coupling, where energy is exchanged between different normal modes.

In the next sections, we will discuss the theory of coupled modes in more detail and explore its applications in ocean acoustics. We will also discuss the methods for solving the equations of motion for coupled modes and the techniques for analyzing the resulting normal modes.

### Subsection: 6.9b Theory of Coupled Modes

The theory of coupled modes is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of coupled systems. It allows us to analyze the normal modes of a system and predict how these modes will interact with each other. In this section, we will delve deeper into the theory of coupled modes and discuss its applications in ocean acoustics.

The theory of coupled modes is based on the principle of superposition. According to this principle, the total response of a coupled system is the sum of the individual responses of each subsystem. This principle can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\mathbf u = \mathbf u^A + \mathbf u^B
$$

where $\mathbf u$ is the total displacement vector, $\mathbf u^A$ is the displacement vector of substructure A, and $\mathbf u^B$ is the displacement vector of substructure B.

The equations of motion for the coupled system can be written as:

$$
\mathbf Z^A \mathbf u^A + \mathbf Z^{AB} \mathbf u^B = \mathbf f^A + \mathbf g^A
$$

$$
\mathbf Z^{BA} \mathbf u^A + \mathbf Z^B \mathbf u^B = \mathbf f^B + \mathbf g^B
$$

These equations can be rewritten in matrix form as:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf Z^A & \mathbf Z^{AB} \\
\mathbf Z^{BA} & \mathbf Z^B
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf u^A \\
\mathbf u^B
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf f^A \\
\mathbf f^B
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf g^A \\
\mathbf g^B
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This equation represents the equations of motion for the coupled system. The matrices $\mathbf Z^A$ and $\mathbf Z^B$ represent the impedance matrices of substructures A and B, respectively. The matrices $\mathbf Z^{AB}$ and $\mathbf Z^{BA}$ represent the coupling impedance matrices. The vectors $\mathbf f^A$ and $\mathbf f^B$ represent the external force vectors, and the vectors $\mathbf g^A$ and $\mathbf g^B$ represent the coupling force vectors.

The normal modes of the coupled system can be found by solving the eigenvalue problem:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf Z^A & \mathbf Z^{AB} \\
\mathbf Z^{BA} & \mathbf Z^B
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf u^A \\
\mathbf u^B
\end{bmatrix}
=
\lambda
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf u^A \\
\mathbf u^B
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue and $\mathbf u^A$ and $\mathbf u^B$ are the eigenvectors. The eigenvalues $\lambda$ represent the natural frequencies of the coupled system, and the eigenvectors $\mathbf u^A$ and $\mathbf u^B$ represent the normal modes.

The theory of coupled modes provides a powerful tool for analyzing the behavior of coupled systems. It allows us to predict the normal modes of a system and understand how these modes will interact with each other. In the next section, we will discuss the applications of coupled modes in ocean acoustics.

### Subsection: 6.9b Mathematical Representation

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of coupled modes and discussed the dynamic equations that govern their behavior. In this section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical representation of coupled modes.

The coupled modes of a system can be represented as a set of normal modes, each with its own frequency and displacement vector. The coupling between these modes is represented by the coupling impedance matrices $\mathbf Z^{AB}$ and $\mathbf Z^{BA}$. These matrices describe the interaction between the normal modes of the substructures A and B.

The normal modes of the coupled system can be found by solving the eigenvalue problem:

$$
\mathbf Z^A \mathbf u^A + \mathbf Z^{AB} \mathbf u^B = \lambda \mathbf u^A
$$

$$
\mathbf Z^{BA} \mathbf u^A + \mathbf Z^B \mathbf u^B = \lambda \mathbf u^B
$$

where $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue and $\mathbf u^A$ and $\mathbf u^B$ are the eigenvectors. The eigenvalues represent the frequencies of the normal modes, and the eigenvectors represent the displacement vectors of the normal modes.

The coupling between the normal modes can be visualized as a coupling between their displacement vectors. This coupling can lead to mode splitting, where a single normal mode of the uncoupled system splits into multiple normal modes in the coupled system. It can also lead to mode coupling, where energy is exchanged between the normal modes.

In the next section, we will discuss some practical applications of coupled modes in ocean acoustics.

### Subsection: 6.9c Applications in Ocean Acoustics

In this section, we will explore some of the applications of coupled modes in ocean acoustics. The concept of coupled modes is particularly useful in understanding the behavior of structures in range-dependent environments, such as the ocean.

One of the key applications of coupled modes in ocean acoustics is in the study of sound propagation in the ocean. The ocean is a complex medium, with varying properties such as density, temperature, and salinity. These properties can affect the propagation of sound waves, leading to changes in the frequency and direction of the waves.

The coupled modes approach allows us to model the propagation of sound waves in the ocean as a set of normal modes, each with its own frequency and displacement vector. The coupling between these modes represents the interaction between the sound waves and the varying properties of the ocean.

For example, consider a sound wave propagating through the ocean. The wave can be represented as a set of normal modes, each with its own frequency and displacement vector. As the wave encounters varying properties in the ocean, such as changes in density or temperature, the coupling between the normal modes can change. This can lead to mode splitting, where a single normal mode splits into multiple normal modes, each with a different frequency.

Another application of coupled modes in ocean acoustics is in the study of ocean currents. Ocean currents can be modeled as a set of coupled modes, each representing a different direction of flow. The coupling between these modes can represent the interaction between the currents, leading to phenomena such as eddy formation and mixing.

In addition to these applications, coupled modes are also used in the design and analysis of underwater structures.

### Subsection: 6.9c Applications and Case Studies

In this section, we will delve deeper into the applications of coupled modes in ocean acoustics. We will explore some case studies that illustrate the use of coupled modes in understanding and predicting the behavior of structures in the ocean.

#### 6.9c.1 Case Study 1: Sonar Systems

Sonar systems are a common application of coupled modes in ocean acoustics. These systems use sound waves to detect and locate objects underwater. The behavior of these systems can be modeled using coupled modes, particularly in range-dependent environments.

Consider a simple sonar system consisting of a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter emits a sound wave into the ocean, and the receiver detects the reflected wave. The behavior of this system can be modeled using coupled modes, with the transmitter and receiver representing the two substructures.

The coupling between the transmitter and receiver can be represented by the coupling impedance matrices $\mathbf Z^{AB}$ and $\mathbf Z^{BA}$. These matrices describe the interaction between the normal modes of the transmitter and receiver.

The normal modes of the coupled system can be found by solving the eigenvalue problem:

$$
\mathbf Z^A \mathbf u^A + \mathbf Z^{AB} \mathbf u^B = \lambda \mathbf u^A
$$

$$
\mathbf Z^{BA} \mathbf u^A + \mathbf Z^B \mathbf u^B = \lambda \mathbf u^B
$$

where $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue and $\mathbf u^A$ and $\mathbf u^B$ are the eigenvectors. The eigenvalues represent the frequencies of the normal modes, and the eigenvectors represent the displacement vectors of the normal modes.

This model can be used to predict the behavior of the sonar system in different ocean conditions, and to optimize the system for maximum performance.

#### 6.9c.2 Case Study 2: Underwater Structures

Coupled modes are also used in the study of underwater structures, such as pipelines and cables. These structures are subject to a range of forces, including hydrostatic pressure, currents, and waves. The behavior of these structures can be modeled using coupled modes, particularly in range-dependent environments.

Consider a simple underwater structure consisting of two sections, A and B. The coupling between these sections can be represented by the coupling impedance matrices $\mathbf Z^{AB}$ and $\mathbf Z^{BA}$. These matrices describe the interaction between the normal modes of the two sections.

The normal modes of the coupled system can be found by solving the eigenvalue problem:

$$
\mathbf Z^A \mathbf u^A + \mathbf Z^{AB} \mathbf u^B = \lambda \mathbf u^A
$$

$$
\mathbf Z^{BA} \mathbf u^A + \mathbf Z^B \mathbf u^B = \lambda \mathbf u^B
$$

where $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue and $\mathbf u^A$ and $\mathbf u^B$ are the eigenvectors. The eigenvalues represent the frequencies of the normal modes, and the eigenvectors represent the displacement vectors of the normal modes.

This model can be used to predict the behavior of the underwater structure in different ocean conditions, and to optimize the structure for maximum durability.




### Subsection: 6.10a Introduction to 3-D Environment

In the previous sections, we have discussed the theory and applications of normal modes in two-dimensional environments. However, many real-world problems in ocean acoustics involve three-dimensional structures and phenomena. Therefore, it is necessary to extend our understanding of normal modes to three-dimensional environments.

In a three-dimensional environment, the normal modes are three-dimensional vectors, and the coupling between different modes is represented by three-dimensional coupling impedance matrices. The normal modes of a three-dimensional system can be found by solving a system of three coupled eigenvalue problems.

The first eigenvalue problem is:

$$
\mathbf Z^A \mathbf u^A + \mathbf Z^{AB} \mathbf u^B = \lambda \mathbf u^A
$$

The second eigenvalue problem is:

$$
\mathbf Z^{BA} \mathbf u^A + \mathbf Z^B \mathbf u^B = \lambda \mathbf u^B
$$

The third eigenvalue problem is:

$$
\mathbf Z^{BC} \mathbf u^A + \mathbf Z^{CB} \mathbf u^B = \lambda \mathbf u^C
$$

where $\mathbf Z^{BC}$ and $\mathbf Z^{CB}$ are the coupling impedance matrices between the third substructure and the first and second substructures, respectively.

The solutions to these eigenvalue problems give the frequencies and displacement vectors of the normal modes of the three-dimensional system. These normal modes can be used to analyze the behavior of the system under different conditions, and to optimize the system for maximum performance.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the theory and applications of normal modes in three-dimensional environments. We will discuss the coupling between different modes, the calculation of normal modes, and the application of normal modes to various problems in ocean acoustics.




#### 6.10b Mathematical Representation

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of normal modes in a three-dimensional environment. Now, let's delve deeper into the mathematical representation of these normal modes.

The normal modes of a three-dimensional system can be represented by three-dimensional vectors, denoted as $\mathbf u^A$, $\mathbf u^B$, and $\mathbf u^C$. These vectors represent the displacement of the three substructures A, B, and C, respectively, due to the normal modes.

The coupling between different modes is represented by three-dimensional coupling impedance matrices, denoted as $\mathbf Z^A$, $\mathbf Z^{AB}$, $\mathbf Z^{BA}$, $\mathbf Z^B$, $\mathbf Z^{BC}$, and $\mathbf Z^{CB}$. These matrices represent the impedance of the system to the coupling of different modes.

The normal modes of the system can be found by solving a system of three coupled eigenvalue problems. The eigenvalue problems are represented by the following equations:

$$
\mathbf Z^A \mathbf u^A + \mathbf Z^{AB} \mathbf u^B = \lambda \mathbf u^A
$$

$$
\mathbf Z^{BA} \mathbf u^A + \mathbf Z^B \mathbf u^B = \lambda \mathbf u^B
$$

$$
\mathbf Z^{BC} \mathbf u^A + \mathbf Z^{CB} \mathbf u^B = \lambda \mathbf u^C
$$

where $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue representing the frequency of the normal mode.

The solutions to these eigenvalue problems give the frequencies and displacement vectors of the normal modes of the system. These normal modes can be used to analyze the behavior of the system under different conditions, and to optimize the system for maximum performance.

In the next section, we will discuss the physical interpretation of these normal modes and how they can be used in the analysis of ocean acoustic systems.

#### 6.10c Applications in Ocean Acoustics

In the field of ocean acoustics, the concept of normal modes is applied in various ways to understand and predict the behavior of oceanic systems. The normal modes of a system provide a basis for understanding the system's response to external forces, such as sound waves. 

One of the key applications of normal modes in ocean acoustics is in the study of oceanic resonances. Resonances occur when the frequency of an external force matches the natural frequency of a system, leading to a significant increase in the amplitude of the system's response. In the context of ocean acoustics, resonances can occur in the ocean due to the interaction of sound waves with the ocean's structure.

The normal modes of the ocean can be used to predict these resonances. For instance, if the frequency of a sound wave matches the natural frequency of one of the normal modes of the ocean, a resonance will occur. This can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\lambda = \sqrt{\mathbf u^A \mathbf Z^A \mathbf u^A}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the frequency of the sound wave, $\mathbf u^A$ is the normal mode vector, and $\mathbf Z^A$ is the coupling impedance matrix.

Another important application of normal modes in ocean acoustics is in the design and analysis of oceanic structures. The normal modes of a structure can be used to predict how the structure will respond to external forces, such as sound waves. This can be used to optimize the design of the structure for maximum performance and durability.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the physical interpretation of these normal modes and how they can be used in the analysis of ocean acoustic systems.

#### 7.4a Introduction to FDs FEs

Finite difference method (FDM) and finite element method (FEM) are two numerical techniques used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). Both methods discretize the domain into a grid and approximate the solution at the grid points. However, there are some key differences between the two methods.

The FDM approximates the derivatives in the PDEs using the differences between the function values at the grid points. On the other hand, the FEM approximates the solution using basis functions and minimizes the residual of the PDE. This results in a system of linear equations that can be solved to obtain the approximate solution.

The finite difference frequency-domain method (FDFD) is a hybrid of these two methods. It combines the advantages of both FDM and FEM. Like FDM, it approximates the derivatives using differences. However, like FEM, it also uses basis functions and minimizes the residual. This results in a system of linear equations that can be solved to obtain the approximate solution.

The FDFD method is particularly useful for solving the parabolic equation, which describes the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. The parabolic equation is a second-order PDE that describes the change in the acoustic pressure with respect to time and space. It is a fundamental equation in ocean acoustics and is used to model the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the FDFD method and its application to the parabolic equation. We will discuss the discretization of the parabolic equation, the formulation of the FDFD method, and the solution of the resulting linear system. We will also discuss the advantages and limitations of the FDFD method and compare it with other numerical methods.

#### 7.4b Discretization of the Parabolic Equation

The parabolic equation is a second-order partial differential equation that describes the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. It is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $p$ is the acoustic pressure, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the speed of sound in the ocean.

The parabolic equation can be discretized using the finite difference frequency-domain method (FDFD). The FDFD method approximates the derivatives in the parabolic equation using the differences between the function values at the grid points. This results in a system of linear equations that can be solved to obtain the approximate solution.

The FDFD method is particularly useful for solving the parabolic equation because it combines the advantages of both the finite difference method (FDM) and the finite element method (FEM). Like FDM, it approximates the derivatives using differences. However, like FEM, it also uses basis functions and minimizes the residual. This results in a system of linear equations that can be solved to obtain the approximate solution.

The FDFD method is also easier to implement than the finite difference time-domain method (FDTD), as it does not require the computation of time steps sequentially. This can make FDFD more computationally efficient, especially for large-scale problems.

However, the FDFD method also has some limitations. It requires solving a sparse linear system, which can be computationally expensive, especially for large-scale problems. Additionally, the FDFD method is not well-suited to complex geometries or multiscale structures, as the Yee grid is restricted mostly to rectangular structures. This can be circumvented by either using a very fine grid mesh (which increases computational cost), or by approximating the effects with surface boundary conditions.

In the next section, we will discuss the formulation of the FDFD method in more detail and compare it with other numerical methods.

The FDFD method has also been applied to the design and analysis of sonar systems. Sonar systems use sound waves to detect objects in the ocean. The FDFD method can be used to simulate the propagation of sound waves from a sonar source to a target, and then back to a receiver. This allows for the optimization of sonar systems and the prediction of their performance in different ocean environments.

### Introduction

In the vast and complex world of ocean acoustics, the ability to accurately predict the propagation of sound waves is of paramount importance. This chapter, "Ray Tracing," delves into one of the most widely used methods for such predictions. 

Ray tracing, a computational technique, is a powerful tool that allows us to model the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. It is based on the principle of ray optics, where sound waves are represented as rays that travel in straight lines. This simplification allows us to solve complex problems in ocean acoustics, such as the reflection and refraction of sound waves at the ocean surface and interfaces, and the scattering of sound waves by underwater objects.

In this chapter, we will explore the theory behind ray tracing, its applications in ocean acoustics, and how it can be implemented in computational models. We will also discuss the limitations and challenges of ray tracing, and how these can be addressed.

#### 7.4b Mathematical Representation

The finite difference frequency-domain method (FDFD) is a powerful tool for solving the parabolic equation. It combines the advantages of both the finite difference method (FDM) and the finite element method (FEM). The FDFD method approximates the derivatives in the parabolic equation using the differences between the function values at the grid points, similar to FDM. However, like FEM, it also uses basis functions and minimizes the residual of the parabolic equation. This results in a system of linear equations that can be solved to obtain the approximate solution.

The FDFD method is particularly useful for solving the parabolic equation due to its ability to handle complex geometries and boundary conditions. The parabolic equation is a second-order partial differential equation that describes the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. It is given by:

$$

where $p$ is the pressure, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the speed of sound.

The FDFD method discretizes the parabolic equation into a system of linear equations. This is done by approximating the derivatives in the equation using the differences between the function values at the grid points. The resulting system of equations can then be solved using various numerical techniques.

The FDFD method also allows for the incorporation of boundary conditions. These conditions can be represented mathematically as:

$$
p(x,t) = g(x,t), \quad x \in \partial \Omega
$$

where $\partial \Omega$ is the boundary of the domain and $g(x,t)$ is the boundary condition function.

In the next section, we will discuss the formulation of the FDFD method in more detail and provide examples of its application to the parabolic equation.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the concept of Doppler shift in waveguides, a fundamental aspect of computational ocean acoustics. Doppler shift is a phenomenon that occurs when there is relative motion between a source and a receiver, resulting in a change in the frequency of the received signal. In the context of ocean acoustics, Doppler shift plays a crucial role in the propagation of sound waves in the water column.

We will begin by discussing the basic principles of Doppler shift, including the Doppler shift formula and its implications for sound propagation in the ocean. We will then explore the concept of waveguides, which are structures that guide sound waves along a specific path. In the context of Doppler shift, waveguides can significantly influence the amount and direction of the Doppler shift experienced by a sound wave.

Next, we will delve into the applications of Doppler shift in waveguides. These include the use of Doppler shift to estimate the speed of a moving object, such as a marine mammal or a ship, and the use of Doppler shift to study the stratification of the water column. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of using Doppler shift in waveguides, such as the effects of turbulence and the need for accurate knowledge of the waveguide properties.

Finally, we will explore the computational aspects of Doppler shift in waveguides. This includes the use of numerical models to simulate the Doppler shift effects, as well as the use of data analysis techniques to extract information from Doppler shift measurements. We will also discuss the future directions of research in this field, including the development of more accurate models and the integration of Doppler shift with other ocean acoustic techniques.

In summary, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Doppler shift in waveguides, from the basic principles to the advanced applications and computational techniques. By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the role of Doppler shift in ocean acoustics and its potential for future research and applications.




#### 8.1a Basics of Doppler Shift

Doppler shift is a phenomenon that occurs when there is relative motion between a source and a receiver, resulting in a change in the frequency of the received signal. In the context of ocean acoustics, Doppler shift plays a crucial role in the propagation of sound waves in the water column. 

The Doppler shift formula is given by:

$$
\Delta f = \frac{2v}{c}f
$$

where $\Delta f$ is the Doppler shift in Hz, $v$ is the relative velocity between the source and the receiver in m/s, and $c$ is the speed of sound in the medium, in this case, water.

The Doppler shift formula implies that the frequency of the received signal is higher when the source is moving towards the receiver and lower when the source is moving away from the receiver. This is due to the conservation of energy, which states that the total energy of a system remains constant unless it is added or removed from the system. In the case of Doppler shift, the energy of the sound wave is conserved, but the wavelength changes due to the relative motion between the source and the receiver.

In the context of waveguides, Doppler shift can significantly influence the amount and direction of the Doppler shift experienced by a sound wave. Waveguides are structures that guide sound waves along a specific path. The properties of the waveguide, such as its length, cross-sectional area, and the material properties of its walls, can affect the Doppler shift experienced by a sound wave.

The applications of Doppler shift in waveguides are numerous. Doppler shift can be used to estimate the speed of a moving object, such as a marine mammal or a ship. It can also be used to study the stratification of the water column, as the Doppler shift can provide information about the speed and direction of the water currents.

However, there are also challenges and limitations to using Doppler shift in waveguides. The effects of turbulence, for example, can cause significant variations in the Doppler shift, making it difficult to accurately estimate the speed of a moving object. Additionally, accurate knowledge of the waveguide properties is crucial for accurately predicting the Doppler shift.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the computational aspects of Doppler shift in waveguides. We will discuss the use of numerical models to simulate the Doppler shift effects, as well as the use of data analysis techniques to extract information from Doppler shift measurements.

#### 8.1b Doppler Shift in Waveguides

In the previous section, we discussed the basics of Doppler shift and its implications in ocean acoustics. Now, we will delve deeper into the concept of Doppler shift in waveguides. 

Waveguides are structures that guide sound waves along a specific path. In the context of ocean acoustics, waveguides can be natural structures such as underwater canyons or man-made structures such as pipelines. The properties of these waveguides can significantly influence the Doppler shift experienced by a sound wave.

The Doppler shift in waveguides can be described by the following equation:

$$
\Delta f = \frac{2v}{c}f + \frac{2v_g}{c}f
$$

where $\Delta f$ is the Doppler shift in Hz, $v$ is the relative velocity between the source and the receiver in m/s, $c$ is the speed of sound in the medium, $v_g$ is the group velocity of the sound wave in the waveguide, and $f$ is the frequency of the sound wave.

The first term in the equation represents the Doppler shift due to the relative motion between the source and the receiver, as discussed in the previous section. The second term represents the Doppler shift due to the group velocity of the sound wave in the waveguide. The group velocity is the velocity at which the group of waves (i.e., the packet of waves) travels. It is different from the phase velocity, which is the velocity at which the phase of a single frequency component of the wave travels.

The group velocity can be influenced by the properties of the waveguide, such as its length, cross-sectional area, and the material properties of its walls. For example, a longer waveguide can increase the group velocity, leading to a larger Doppler shift. Similarly, a larger cross-sectional area can also increase the group velocity and the Doppler shift.

The Doppler shift in waveguides has numerous applications in ocean acoustics. For instance, it can be used to estimate the speed of a moving object, such as a marine mammal or a ship. It can also be used to study the stratification of the water column, as the Doppler shift can provide information about the speed and direction of the water currents.

However, there are also challenges and limitations to using Doppler shift in waveguides. The effects of turbulence, for example, can cause significant variations in the Doppler shift, making it difficult to accurately estimate the speed of a moving object. Additionally, accurate knowledge of the waveguide properties is crucial for accurately predicting the Doppler shift.

In the next section, we will discuss the computational methods for modeling Doppler shift in waveguides.

#### 8.1c Applications of Doppler Shift

The Doppler shift in waveguides has a wide range of applications in ocean acoustics. In this section, we will discuss some of these applications in detail.

##### Estimating the Speed of Moving Objects

One of the most common applications of Doppler shift in waveguides is in estimating the speed of moving objects. This is particularly useful in ocean acoustics, where it is often necessary to track the movement of marine mammals or ships.

The Doppler shift can be used to estimate the speed of a moving object by measuring the change in frequency of the sound wave as it reflects off the object. The Doppler shift is directly proportional to the speed of the object, so by measuring the Doppler shift, we can determine the speed of the object.

For example, consider a ship moving at a constant speed in a straight line. The Doppler shift experienced by a sound wave reflected off the ship will increase as the ship moves towards the source of the sound wave and decrease as the ship moves away from the source. By measuring the change in frequency of the sound wave, we can determine the speed of the ship.

##### Studying Water Currents

Another important application of Doppler shift in waveguides is in studying water currents. The Doppler shift can provide valuable information about the speed and direction of the water currents, which can be used to study ocean circulation patterns and predict weather conditions.

In this application, a sound wave is emitted into the water column. The Doppler shift experienced by the sound wave as it reflects off the water particles can provide information about the speed and direction of the water currents. By analyzing the Doppler shift, we can create a map of the water currents in the ocean.

##### Understanding the Stratification of the Water Column

The Doppler shift can also be used to study the stratification of the water column. Stratification refers to the layering of different layers of water with different densities. This can occur due to variations in temperature, salinity, or other properties of the water.

The Doppler shift can provide information about the stratification of the water column by measuring the change in frequency of the sound wave as it reflects off the boundaries between different layers of water. By analyzing the Doppler shift, we can determine the density and thickness of these layers.

In conclusion, the Doppler shift in waveguides has a wide range of applications in ocean acoustics. By understanding and analyzing the Doppler shift, we can gain valuable insights into the properties of the ocean and the behavior of objects within it.




#### 8.1b Doppler Shift in Waveguide

In the previous section, we discussed the basics of Doppler shift and its applications in ocean acoustics. In this section, we will delve deeper into the topic and explore the effects of Doppler shift in waveguides.

Waveguides are structures that guide sound waves along a specific path. They are commonly used in ocean acoustics for various applications, such as underwater communication and sonar systems. The properties of the waveguide, such as its length, cross-sectional area, and the material properties of its walls, can significantly influence the Doppler shift experienced by a sound wave.

The Doppler shift in waveguides can be described by the following equation:

$$
\Delta f = \frac{2v}{c}f
$$

where $\Delta f$ is the Doppler shift in Hz, $v$ is the relative velocity between the source and the receiver in m/s, and $c$ is the speed of sound in the medium, in this case, water.

The Doppler shift in waveguides can be both beneficial and challenging. On one hand, it can provide valuable information about the speed and direction of the water currents, which can be used for various applications, such as ocean current mapping and marine navigation. On the other hand, it can also introduce errors in the measurement of the sound wave's frequency, which can affect the accuracy of the measurements.

The effects of Doppler shift in waveguides can be mitigated by carefully designing the waveguide and by using advanced signal processing techniques. For example, by using multiple waveguides with different lengths and cross-sectional areas, it is possible to measure the Doppler shift from different angles, which can provide a more complete picture of the water currents.

In the next section, we will explore some specific applications of Doppler shift in waveguides, such as underwater communication and sonar systems.

#### 8.1c Applications of Doppler Shift

Doppler shift has a wide range of applications in ocean acoustics, particularly in the context of waveguides. In this section, we will explore some of these applications in more detail.

##### Underwater Communication

One of the primary applications of Doppler shift in waveguides is in underwater communication. Waveguides are often used to guide sound waves over long distances in the ocean. The Doppler shift of these sound waves can provide valuable information about the speed and direction of the water currents, which can be used to optimize the communication link.

For example, consider a scenario where a submarine is communicating with a surface vessel. The submarine is moving relative to the surface vessel, which causes a Doppler shift in the sound waves. By measuring this Doppler shift, the surface vessel can determine the speed and direction of the submarine, which can be used to adjust the communication link and improve the quality of the communication.

##### Sonar Systems

Doppler shift also plays a crucial role in sonar systems, which are used for detecting and locating objects underwater. Waveguides are often used in sonar systems to guide the sound waves towards the target and to collect the reflected sound waves.

The Doppler shift of the reflected sound waves can provide valuable information about the speed and direction of the target. This information can be used to determine the range and bearing of the target, which is essential for navigation and target tracking.

##### Ocean Current Mapping

Another important application of Doppler shift in waveguides is in ocean current mapping. By measuring the Doppler shift of sound waves in different locations in the ocean, it is possible to create a map of the ocean currents.

This can be particularly useful in areas where traditional methods of ocean current measurement, such as drifting buoys, are not feasible. By using waveguides and Doppler shift, it is possible to measure the ocean currents over large areas and at different depths, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the ocean dynamics.

In conclusion, Doppler shift plays a crucial role in various applications of ocean acoustics, particularly in the context of waveguides. By understanding and mitigating the effects of Doppler shift, it is possible to improve the performance of underwater communication, sonar systems, and ocean current mapping.




#### 8.1c Applications and Case Studies

Doppler shift has a wide range of applications in ocean acoustics, particularly in the study of underwater sound propagation and the effects of water currents on sound waves. In this section, we will explore some specific applications of Doppler shift in waveguides, such as underwater communication and sonar systems.

##### Underwater Communication

Underwater communication is a critical aspect of ocean acoustics, particularly for submarines and underwater vehicles. The use of Doppler shift in waveguides can provide valuable information about the speed and direction of water currents, which can be used to optimize the transmission of signals and improve the reliability of communication.

For example, consider a submarine communicating with a surface vessel. The submarine can use Doppler shift to measure the speed and direction of the water currents in the surrounding water. This information can then be used to adjust the transmission parameters, such as the frequency and power of the signal, to compensate for the Doppler shift and ensure reliable communication.

##### Sonar Systems

Sonar systems are another important application of Doppler shift in waveguides. Sonar systems use sound waves to detect and locate objects underwater. The Doppler shift of the sound waves can provide valuable information about the speed and direction of the water currents, which can be used to improve the accuracy of the sonar measurements.

For instance, consider a sonar system used for marine navigation. The system can use Doppler shift to measure the speed and direction of the water currents in the surrounding water. This information can then be used to correct for the Doppler shift and improve the accuracy of the sonar measurements, allowing for more precise navigation.

##### Case Studies

To further illustrate the applications of Doppler shift in waveguides, let's consider two case studies: the use of Doppler shift in the study of ocean currents and the use of Doppler shift in the design of underwater acoustic devices.

In the study of ocean currents, Doppler shift can be used to measure the speed and direction of water currents in the ocean. This can provide valuable information about ocean circulation patterns and the movement of marine animals. For example, by measuring the Doppler shift of sound waves emitted from a source in the water, researchers can determine the speed and direction of the water currents in the surrounding area.

In the design of underwater acoustic devices, Doppler shift can be used to optimize the performance of the device. For instance, by understanding the effects of Doppler shift on sound waves in waveguides, engineers can design devices that can compensate for the Doppler shift and improve the accuracy of the measurements.

### Section: 9.1 Signal and Noise:

In the study of ocean acoustics, it is crucial to understand the concepts of signal and noise. Signal refers to the information-bearing waveform, while noise refers to any unwanted disturbance that affects the signal. In this section, we will explore the properties of signals and noise, and how they interact in the ocean environment.

#### 9.1a Introduction to Signal and Noise

A signal is a function of one or more independent variables that carries information. In the context of ocean acoustics, the signal could be the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. The properties of the signal, such as its frequency, amplitude, and phase, can provide valuable information about the ocean environment.

Noise, on the other hand, is any unwanted disturbance that affects the signal. In the ocean, noise can be introduced by various sources, such as ocean currents, temperature variations, and biological activity. Noise can distort the signal and make it difficult to interpret the information it carries.

The interaction between signal and noise is a fundamental concept in ocean acoustics. The signal can be thought of as the desired information, while the noise is the interference that obscures this information. The goal of signal processing in ocean acoustics is to extract the signal from the noise and interpret the information it carries.

In the next subsection, we will explore the properties of signals and noise in more detail, and discuss how they can be modeled and simulated.

#### 9.1b Signal Properties

The properties of a signal can be described in terms of its frequency, amplitude, and phase. The frequency of a signal is the number of cycles it completes in a given time period. The amplitude of a signal is the magnitude of its oscillations, and the phase of a signal is its position in the cycle.

In the context of ocean acoustics, the frequency of a signal can provide information about the depth of the water column, the speed of sound in the water, and the presence of obstacles. The amplitude of a signal can indicate the strength of the sound source, while the phase of a signal can provide information about the direction of the sound source.

The properties of a signal can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
s(t) = A \cos(2\pi f t + \phi)
$$

where $s(t)$ is the signal, $A$ is the amplitude, $f$ is the frequency, and $\phi$ is the phase.

In the next subsection, we will discuss the properties of noise and how they interact with the properties of signals.

#### 9.1c Noise Properties

Noise in ocean acoustics can be categorized into two types: additive noise and multiplicative noise. Additive noise is independent of the signal and is added to the signal at each point in time. Multiplicative noise, on the other hand, is dependent on the signal and is multiplied by the signal at each point in time.

The properties of noise can be described in terms of its power spectrum and correlation. The power spectrum of a noise signal is a measure of the power of the signal at different frequencies. The correlation of a noise signal is a measure of the similarity between the signal at different points in time.

In the context of ocean acoustics, the power spectrum of noise can provide information about the sources of noise in the ocean, such as ocean currents and biological activity. The correlation of noise can provide information about the stability of the ocean environment.

The properties of noise can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
n(t) = \sqrt{P} \cos(2\pi f t + \phi)
$$

where $n(t)$ is the noise, $P$ is the power, $f$ is the frequency, and $\phi$ is the phase.

In the next subsection, we will discuss how signals and noise interact in the ocean environment and how this interaction can be modeled and simulated.

#### 9.1d Signal and Noise Interaction

The interaction between signals and noise in ocean acoustics is a complex phenomenon that can significantly affect the quality of the received signal. The interaction can be categorized into two types: additive and multiplicative.

Additive interaction occurs when the noise is independent of the signal and is added to the signal at each point in time. This type of interaction can be modeled using the following equation:

$$
r(t) = s(t) + n(t)
$$

where $r(t)$ is the received signal, $s(t)$ is the transmitted signal, and $n(t)$ is the noise.

Multiplicative interaction, on the other hand, occurs when the noise is dependent on the signal and is multiplied by the signal at each point in time. This type of interaction can be modeled using the following equation:

$$
r(t) = s(t) \cdot n(t)
$$

where $r(t)$ is the received signal, $s(t)$ is the transmitted signal, and $n(t)$ is the noise.

The interaction between signals and noise can significantly affect the quality of the received signal. For instance, in the presence of additive noise, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be improved by increasing the power of the transmitted signal. However, in the presence of multiplicative noise, the SNR can only be improved by reducing the noise power or by using error correction techniques.

In the next section, we will discuss how these interactions can be modeled and simulated using computational techniques.

#### 9.1e Signal and Noise Simulation

In this section, we will discuss how to simulate signals and noise in ocean acoustics using computational techniques. The simulation of signals and noise is a crucial aspect of computational ocean acoustics, as it allows us to study the interaction between signals and noise in a controlled environment.

The simulation of signals and noise can be performed using a variety of computational techniques, including finite-difference methods, finite-volume methods, and spectral methods. These methods allow us to solve the equations governing the propagation of signals and noise in the ocean, and to study their interaction in a controlled manner.

Finite-difference methods, for instance, can be used to solve the wave equation for signals and noise in the ocean. The wave equation is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $p$ is the pressure, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the speed of sound in the ocean.

Finite-volume methods, on the other hand, can be used to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for the motion of the ocean. The Navier-Stokes equations are given by:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{g}
$$

where $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity, $p$ is the pressure, $\rho$ is the density, $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, and $\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration.

Spectral methods, finally, can be used to solve the primitive equations for the motion of the ocean. The primitive equations are given by:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p + \mathbf{g} - \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \nabla \times (\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{B})
$$

where $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field.

By solving these equations, we can simulate the propagation of signals and noise in the ocean, and study their interaction in a controlled manner. This allows us to gain a deeper understanding of the complex phenomena that occur in ocean acoustics, and to develop more effective techniques for the detection and localization of underwater sources.

#### 9.1f Signal and Noise Analysis

In this section, we will discuss how to analyze signals and noise in ocean acoustics using computational techniques. The analysis of signals and noise is a crucial aspect of computational ocean acoustics, as it allows us to understand the interaction between signals and noise in the ocean.

The analysis of signals and noise can be performed using a variety of computational techniques, including spectral analysis, correlation analysis, and machine learning techniques. These techniques allow us to extract information from signals and noise, and to understand their interaction in a more detailed manner.

Spectral analysis, for instance, can be used to analyze the frequency content of signals and noise. The power spectrum of a signal or noise can be computed using the Fourier transform, which is given by:

$$
P(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(t) e^{-j2\pi ft} dt
$$

where $p(t)$ is the pressure, $f$ is the frequency, and $j$ is the imaginary unit.

Correlation analysis, on the other hand, can be used to analyze the similarity between signals and noise. The correlation coefficient between two signals or noises can be computed using the following equation:

$$
r(t) = \frac{E[(p_1(t) - \mu_1)(p_2(t) - \mu_2)]}{\sigma_1 \sigma_2}
$$

where $p_1(t)$ and $p_2(t)$ are the pressures of the two signals or noises, $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are the means of the two signals or noises, and $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ are the standard deviations of the two signals or noises.

Machine learning techniques, finally, can be used to classify signals and noise based on their characteristics. This can be done using supervised learning, where a training set of signals and noise is used to train a classifier, or unsupervised learning, where the classifier is trained on the signals and noise themselves.

By analyzing signals and noise, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex phenomena that occur in ocean acoustics, and develop more effective techniques for the detection and localization of underwater sources.

### Section: 9.1 Signal and Noise:

In the study of ocean acoustics, it is crucial to understand the concepts of signal and noise. Signal refers to the information-bearing waveform, while noise refers to any unwanted disturbance that affects the signal. In this section, we will explore the properties of signals and noise, and how they interact in the ocean environment.

#### 9.1a Introduction to Signal and Noise

A signal is a function of one or more independent variables that carries information. In the context of ocean acoustics, the signal could be the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. The properties of the signal, such as its frequency, amplitude, and phase, can provide valuable information about the ocean environment.

Noise, on the other hand, is any unwanted disturbance that affects the signal. In the ocean, noise can be introduced by various sources, such as ocean currents, temperature variations, and biological activity. Noise can distort the signal and make it difficult to interpret the information it carries.

The interaction between signal and noise is a fundamental concept in ocean acoustics. The signal can be thought of as the desired information, while the noise is the interference that obscures this information. The goal of signal processing in ocean acoustics is to extract the signal from the noise and interpret the information it carries.

In the next subsection, we will explore the properties of signals and noise in more detail, and discuss how they can be modeled and simulated.

#### 9.1b Signal Properties

The properties of a signal can be described in terms of its frequency, amplitude, and phase. The frequency of a signal is the number of cycles it completes in a given time period. The amplitude of a signal is the magnitude of its oscillations, and the phase of a signal is its position in the cycle.

In the context of ocean acoustics, the frequency of a signal can provide information about the depth of the water column, the speed of sound, and the presence of obstacles. The amplitude of a signal can indicate the strength of the sound source, while the phase of a signal can provide information about the direction of the sound source.

#### 9.1c Noise Properties

Noise, on the other hand, can be characterized by its power spectrum, which is a measure of the distribution of power across different frequencies. The power spectrum of noise can provide information about the sources of noise in the ocean, such as ocean currents and biological activity.

In addition to its power spectrum, noise can also be described in terms of its autocorrelation function, which measures the similarity between a signal and a delayed version of itself. The autocorrelation function of noise can provide information about the persistence of noise in the ocean.

#### 9.1d Signal and Noise Interaction

The interaction between signal and noise is a crucial aspect of ocean acoustics. The presence of noise can affect the quality of a signal, making it difficult to interpret the information it carries. However, noise can also be used to our advantage in signal processing.

For example, the Wiener filter is a commonly used technique for extracting a signal from noise. It assumes that the signal and noise are stationary and uncorrelated, and that the signal is a linear combination of the noise. By minimizing the mean square error between the desired signal and the filtered signal, the Wiener filter can estimate the signal and remove the noise.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of time series simulation and how it can be used to model and simulate signals and noise in the ocean environment.




#### 9.1c Applications in Ocean Acoustics

The study of signal and noise in ocean acoustics has numerous applications. These applications range from sonar systems for navigation and tracking, to underwater communication and remote control, and even seismic exploration.

##### Sonar Systems

Sonar systems are a prime example of the application of signal and noise theory in ocean acoustics. Sonar, an acoustic equivalent of radar, uses pulses of sound to probe the sea. The echoes of these pulses are then processed to extract information about the sea, its boundaries, and submerged objects. The signal in this case is the sound pulse, and the noise can be the interference from other sound sources, such as marine life or other vessels.

##### Underwater Communication and Remote Control

Underwater communication and remote control are other important applications of signal and noise theory. These applications involve the use of acoustic telemetry for data harvesting, communication between manned and unmanned underwater vehicles, and remote control of underwater objects. The signal in these cases can be the transmitted data or control commands, and the noise can be the interference from other acoustic sources.

##### Underwater Navigation and Tracking

Underwater navigation and tracking is a common requirement for exploration and work by divers, ROV, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), manned submersibles, and submarines. The signal in this case can be the acoustic signal used for navigation, and the noise can be the interference from other acoustic sources, such as marine life or other vessels.

##### Seismic Exploration

Seismic exploration involves the use of low frequency sound (< 100 Hz) to probe deep into the seabed. Despite the relatively poor resolution due to their long wavelength, low frequency sound can provide valuable information about the seafloor. The signal in this case can be the seismic wave, and the noise can be the interference from other acoustic sources, such as marine life or other vessels.

In conclusion, the study of signal and noise in ocean acoustics has numerous applications. Understanding the properties of signals and noise, and how they interact in the ocean environment, is crucial for these applications.

### Subsection: 10.1a Introduction to Acoustic Tomography

Acoustic tomography is a powerful technique used in ocean acoustics to measure temperatures and currents over large regions of the ocean. It is also known as acoustic thermometry on ocean basin scales. This technique relies on precisely measuring the time it takes sound signals to travel between two instruments, one an acoustic source and one a receiver, separated by ranges of kilometers. If the locations of the instruments are known precisely, the measurement of time-of-flight can be used to infer the speed of sound, averaged over the acoustic path. Changes in the speed of sound are primarily caused by changes in the temperature of the ocean, hence the measurement of the travel times is equivalent to a measurement of temperature. A change in temperature corresponds to about a change in sound speed.

An oceanographic experiment employing tomography typically uses several source-receiver pairs in a moored array that measures an area of ocean. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the ocean's properties, as the measurements are not limited to a single point.

#### 10.1a.1 Challenges in Acoustic Tomography

Despite its many advantages, acoustic tomography also faces several challenges. One of these is the dynamic range of the imaging plane. The effective dynamic range can be interpreted as the maximum contrast achievable within the target area. An inherent challenge related to the dynamic range of acoustic cameras lies in its dependency on the sound's wavelength and the size of the array. These physical constraints pose difficulties for far-field acoustic cameras aiming to resolve multiple low-frequency sources. As the aperture size would need to be significantly large to tackle low-frequency issues, it often results in inconclusive or less definitive results within this frequency range. This underlines the unique challenges faced in enhancing the dynamic range of acoustic cameras, particularly in applications involving low-frequency sounds.

Another challenge in acoustic tomography is dealing with low frequencies in the far-field. The lowest frequency that can be localized with a far-field acoustic camera is primarily determined by the size of the array's aperture (its largest dimension). This poses challenges for dealing with low-frequency sounds, as the array needs to be large enough to localize these sounds accurately. However, this also means that the array needs to be placed at a significant distance from the source, which can be difficult in practical applications.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these challenges and explore potential solutions to enhance the capabilities of acoustic tomography in ocean acoustics.




### Subsection: 10.1b Mathematical Representation

Acoustic tomography is a complex technique that involves the use of mathematical models and algorithms to interpret the measured travel times. The mathematical representation of acoustic tomography is crucial for understanding the underlying physical processes and for developing efficient algorithms for data processing and interpretation.

#### 10.1b.1 The Speed of Sound in the Ocean

The speed of sound in the ocean is a fundamental parameter in acoustic tomography. It is primarily determined by the temperature and salinity of the water. The speed of sound can be represented mathematically as:

$$
c = c_0 \left( 1 + \alpha_T (T - T_0) + \alpha_S (S - S_0) \right)
$$

where $c$ is the speed of sound, $c_0$ is the reference speed of sound, $\alpha_T$ and $\alpha_S$ are the thermal and haline (salinity-dependent) coefficients of sound speed, $T$ and $S$ are the temperature and salinity, and $T_0$ and $S_0$ are the reference temperature and salinity.

#### 10.1b.2 The Travel Time of Sound

The travel time of sound between two points in the ocean is given by the equation:

$$
\tau = \frac{1}{c} \int_{L} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{f}{c} \right)^2}} dl
$$

where $\tau$ is the travel time, $c$ is the speed of sound, $f$ is the frequency of the sound, $L$ is the path of the sound, and $dl$ is the differential along the path. The integral is taken over the entire path of the sound.

#### 10.1b.3 The Temperature and Salinity Fields

The temperature and salinity fields in the ocean are represented as functions of position and time. These fields can be represented mathematically as:

$$
T(x,y,z,t) = T_0(x,y,z,t) + \Delta T(x,y,z,t)
$$

and

$$
S(x,y,z,t) = S_0(x,y,z,t) + \Delta S(x,y,z,t)
$$

where $T_0$ and $S_0$ are the mean temperature and salinity, and $\Delta T$ and $\Delta S$ are the deviations from the mean.

#### 10.1b.4 The Acoustic Tomography Equation

The acoustic tomography equation is a mathematical representation of the acoustic tomography problem. It relates the measured travel times to the temperature and salinity fields. The acoustic tomography equation can be written as:

$$
\tau(x,y,z,t) = \frac{1}{c(x,y,z,t)} \int_{L(x,y,z,t)} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{f}{c(x,y,z,t)} \right)^2}} dl(x,y,z,t)
$$

where $\tau(x,y,z,t)$ is the measured travel time, $c(x,y,z,t)$ is the speed of sound, $L(x,y,z,t)$ is the path of the sound, and $dl(x,y,z,t)$ is the differential along the path. The integral is taken over the entire path of the sound.

The acoustic tomography equation is a complex equation that involves the integration of a function over a three-dimensional space and time. It is the basis for the development of algorithms for data processing and interpretation in acoustic tomography.




### Subsection: 10.1c Applications and Case Studies

By measuring the speed of sound in the ocean, it can provide accurate information about the ocean's depth and temperature, which is essential for navigation. This is particularly useful in areas where traditional navigation methods, such as GPS, may not be available or reliable.

#### 10.1c.3 Underwater Mapping

Acoustic tomography is used in underwater mapping to create detailed maps of the ocean floor. By measuring the travel time of sound between two points, it can determine the distance between them, which can then be used to create a map of the seafloor. This is particularly useful in areas where traditional mapping methods, such as sonar, may not be feasible.

#### 10.1c.4 Case Studies

There have been several notable case studies that demonstrate the power and versatility of acoustic tomography. For example, in 2014, acoustic tomography was used to study the impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on the Gulf of Mexico. By measuring the changes in the ocean's physical properties, researchers were able to track the spread of the oil and assess its impact on the ecosystem.

Another notable case study is the use of acoustic tomography in the study of the Selli Event, a major oceanic anoxic event that occurred approximately 120 million years ago. By using acoustic tomography to study the changes in the ocean's physical properties, researchers were able to gain new insights into the causes and consequences of this event.

In conclusion, acoustic tomography is a powerful tool in ocean acoustics with a wide range of applications. Its ability to provide real-time data about the ocean's physical properties makes it an invaluable tool for oceanographic research, marine navigation, and underwater mapping. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more innovative applications of acoustic tomography in the future.




### Subsection: 10.2a Introduction to Ambient Noise

Ambient noise in the ocean is a complex and dynamic phenomenon that plays a crucial role in ocean acoustics. It is the background noise that is present in the ocean, and it is caused by a variety of sources, both natural and anthropogenic. Ambient noise is a key factor in understanding and predicting the behavior of sound in the ocean, and it is essential for many applications, including sonar, acoustic tomography, and marine communication.

#### 10.2a.1 Sources of Ambient Noise

Ambient noise in the ocean is generated by a variety of sources, including wind, waves, marine life, and human activity. Wind-generated noise is one of the primary sources of ambient noise. As wind blows over the surface of the ocean, it creates ripples and waves, which in turn generate sound waves. The frequency and intensity of this noise depend on the wind speed and direction, as well as the characteristics of the ocean, such as its depth and salinity.

Waves also play a significant role in generating ambient noise. As waves move through the ocean, they create a variety of sounds, including hissing, roaring, and crackling. The frequency and intensity of these sounds depend on the size and shape of the waves, as well as the properties of the ocean.

Marine life is another important source of ambient noise. Many marine animals, such as dolphins, whales, and fish, use sound to communicate and navigate. These sounds can be detected by hydrophones, and they can be used to study the behavior and distribution of marine life.

Human activity is also a significant source of ambient noise in the ocean. Ships, submarines, and other vessels generate noise as they move through the water. This noise can be used to detect and track these vessels, which is crucial for navigation and security.

#### 10.2a.2 Impact of Ambient Noise on Ocean Acoustics

Ambient noise has a significant impact on ocean acoustics. It sets the baseline against which other sounds, such as sonar and communication signals, are detected. Therefore, understanding and predicting ambient noise is crucial for optimizing these systems.

Ambient noise also plays a key role in the propagation of sound in the ocean. It can affect the direction, speed, and intensity of sound waves, which can impact the performance of sonar and other acoustic systems.

Furthermore, ambient noise can be used to study the ocean's physical properties, such as temperature and salinity. By analyzing the frequency and intensity of ambient noise, researchers can gain insights into the state of the ocean and its changes over time.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the theory and applications of ambient noise in ocean acoustics. We will explore the mathematical models used to describe ambient noise, the techniques used to measure and analyze it, and the strategies used to mitigate its impact on acoustic systems.




#### 10.2b Causes and Characteristics

Ambient noise in the ocean is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a variety of factors. In this section, we will explore the causes and characteristics of ambient noise, and how they impact ocean acoustics.

##### Causes of Ambient Noise

As mentioned in the previous section, wind, waves, marine life, and human activity are the primary sources of ambient noise in the ocean. However, there are also other factors that can contribute to the overall level of ambient noise. These include ocean currents, temperature, and salinity.

Ocean currents can cause variations in ambient noise levels, as they can transport sound waves over long distances. This can result in changes in the frequency and intensity of ambient noise, depending on the characteristics of the current.

Temperature and salinity can also affect ambient noise levels. Warmer water tends to have lower ambient noise levels, while colder water can have higher levels. This is because warmer water is less dense and can absorb sound waves more effectively. Similarly, water with higher salinity tends to have lower ambient noise levels, as it is more dense and can absorb sound waves more effectively.

##### Characteristics of Ambient Noise

Ambient noise in the ocean is characterized by its frequency and intensity. The frequency of ambient noise can range from very low frequencies (below 1 Hz) to very high frequencies (above 100 kHz). The intensity of ambient noise can vary greatly, depending on the source and the characteristics of the ocean.

The frequency and intensity of ambient noise can also change over time and space. This is due to the dynamic nature of the ocean, with changes in wind, waves, and other factors that can affect the level and characteristics of ambient noise.

##### Impact of Ambient Noise on Ocean Acoustics

Ambient noise plays a crucial role in ocean acoustics. It sets the baseline against which other sounds can be measured and analyzed. Ambient noise can also interfere with other sounds, making it difficult to detect and interpret them.

In addition, ambient noise can be used to study the ocean itself. By analyzing the frequency and intensity of ambient noise, scientists can gain insights into the characteristics of the ocean, such as its temperature, salinity, and currents.

In conclusion, ambient noise in the ocean is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a variety of factors. Its causes and characteristics have a significant impact on ocean acoustics and can provide valuable insights into the ocean itself. 





#### 10.2c Effects on Acoustic Signal Propagation

Ambient noise in the ocean can have significant effects on the propagation of acoustic signals. These effects can be both beneficial and detrimental, depending on the specific application.

##### Benefits of Ambient Noise

Ambient noise can be beneficial for certain applications, particularly in the field of acoustics. The presence of ambient noise can help to mask the sound of a target, making it more difficult to detect. This can be particularly useful in situations where stealth is crucial, such as in military operations.

Additionally, ambient noise can provide a baseline against which other sounds can be measured and analyzed. This can be useful for identifying and classifying different types of sounds in the ocean, such as the sounds made by different species of marine life.

##### Drawbacks of Ambient Noise

However, ambient noise can also be a drawback in certain applications. For example, in underwater acoustics, ambient noise can interfere with the detection and localization of targets. This can make it more difficult to accurately identify and track objects in the ocean.

Furthermore, ambient noise can also affect the accuracy of acoustic measurements. The presence of ambient noise can cause fluctuations in the measured signal, making it more difficult to obtain accurate readings.

##### Impact of Ambient Noise on Acoustic Signal Propagation

The impact of ambient noise on acoustic signal propagation can be modeled using the following equation:

$$
P_{r} = P_{t} - 10\alpha\log_{10}(r) + N
$$

where $P_{r}$ is the received power, $P_{t}$ is the transmitted power, $\alpha$ is the attenuation coefficient, $r$ is the range, and $N$ is the noise floor.

The noise floor, $N$, takes into account the ambient noise present in the ocean. As the ambient noise level increases, the noise floor also increases, making it more difficult to detect and measure acoustic signals.

In conclusion, ambient noise plays a crucial role in ocean acoustics. It can have both beneficial and drawback effects on the propagation of acoustic signals, and understanding these effects is crucial for the successful application of acoustics in the ocean.




#### 10.3a Introduction to Acoustic Scattering

Acoustic scattering is a fundamental phenomenon in ocean acoustics that describes the interaction of sound waves with particles or structures in the water. This interaction can cause the sound waves to change direction, intensity, and frequency, which can have significant implications for the propagation of acoustic signals in the ocean.

#### 10.3b Scattering Mechanisms

There are several mechanisms by which acoustic scattering can occur in the ocean. These include:

- **Rayleigh scattering**: This is the scattering of sound waves by small particles or bubbles in the water. The scattering is inversely proportional to the size of the particles, which means that smaller particles scatter more strongly. This mechanism is responsible for the blue color of the ocean, which is caused by the scattering of sunlight by water molecules.

- **Mie scattering**: This is the scattering of sound waves by particles that are larger than the wavelength of the sound. The scattering is dependent on the size and shape of the particles, and can cause significant changes in the direction and intensity of the sound waves.

- **Raleigh-Mie scattering**: This is a combination of Rayleigh and Mie scattering, and occurs when the particles are of similar size to the wavelength of the sound. The scattering can be both forward and backward, and can cause significant changes in the direction and intensity of the sound waves.

- **Specular scattering**: This is the reflection of sound waves off of a smooth surface, such as a rock or a ship hull. The scattering is dependent on the angle of incidence and the properties of the surface, and can cause significant changes in the direction and intensity of the sound waves.

- **Diffuse scattering**: This is the scattering of sound waves in all directions, and is caused by the interaction of sound waves with rough surfaces or complex structures. The scattering is dependent on the properties of the surface or structure, and can cause significant changes in the direction and intensity of the sound waves.

#### 10.3c Scattering Models

Several models have been developed to describe the scattering of sound waves in the ocean. These include the Rayleigh scattering model, the Mie scattering model, and the Raleigh-Mie scattering model. These models are based on the principles of electromagnetic scattering, and can be used to predict the scattering of sound waves by particles or structures in the water.

The Rayleigh scattering model is used to describe the scattering of sound waves by small particles or bubbles in the water. The model is based on the assumption that the particles are much smaller than the wavelength of the sound, and that the scattering is inversely proportional to the size of the particles.

The Mie scattering model is used to describe the scattering of sound waves by particles that are larger than the wavelength of the sound. The model is based on the assumption that the particles are spherical, and that the scattering is dependent on the size and shape of the particles.

The Raleigh-Mie scattering model is used to describe the scattering of sound waves by particles that are of similar size to the wavelength of the sound. The model is a combination of the Rayleigh and Mie scattering models, and can describe both forward and backward scattering.

#### 10.3d Scattering Effects on Acoustic Signal Propagation

The scattering of sound waves can have significant effects on the propagation of acoustic signals in the ocean. These effects can include changes in the direction, intensity, and frequency of the sound waves, which can affect the detection and localization of targets in the water.

For example, the scattering of sound waves by particles or bubbles in the water can cause the sound waves to change direction, which can affect the accuracy of sonar systems. The scattering can also cause changes in the intensity of the sound waves, which can affect the range at which targets can be detected.

Furthermore, the scattering of sound waves by particles or structures in the water can cause changes in the frequency of the sound waves, which can affect the identification of targets. This is particularly important in applications such as acoustic tomography, where the frequency content of the sound waves is used to image the ocean.

In conclusion, acoustic scattering is a complex phenomenon that plays a crucial role in ocean acoustics. Understanding the mechanisms and models of acoustic scattering is essential for predicting and mitigating the effects of scattering on acoustic signal propagation in the ocean.

#### 10.3b Scattering Models

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of acoustic scattering and discussed the various mechanisms by which it can occur. In this section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical models that describe these scattering phenomena.

##### Rayleigh Scattering Model

The Rayleigh scattering model is used to describe the scattering of sound waves by small particles or bubbles in the water. The model is based on the assumption that the particles are much smaller than the wavelength of the sound, and that the scattering is inversely proportional to the size of the particles.

The Rayleigh scattering model can be mathematically represented as:

$$
\sigma(\theta) = \frac{16 \pi^4 a^6 \sin^4(\theta/2)}{3 \lambda^4} \left( \frac{n^2 - 1}{n^2 + 2} \right)^2
$$

where $\sigma(\theta)$ is the scattering cross-section, $a$ is the radius of the particles, $\theta$ is the scattering angle, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the sound, and $n$ is the refractive index of the particles.

##### Mie Scattering Model

The Mie scattering model is used to describe the scattering of sound waves by particles that are larger than the wavelength of the sound. The model is based on the assumption that the particles are spherical, and that the scattering is dependent on the size and shape of the particles.

The Mie scattering model can be mathematically represented as:

$$
\sigma(\theta) = \frac{2 \pi^2 a^4 \sin^4(\theta/2)}{3 \lambda^4} \left( \frac{n^2 - 1}{n^2 + 2} \right)^2 \left( \frac{1}{k a} \right) \sum_{l=1}^{\infty} (2l+3) \left( \frac{k a}{l+3} \right)^l \left( \frac{l+1}{l+3} \right) P_l(\cos(\theta))
$$

where $P_l(\cos(\theta))$ are the Legendre polynomials, and $k$ is the wave number.

##### Raleigh-Mie Scattering Model

The Raleigh-Mie scattering model is used to describe the scattering of sound waves by particles that are of similar size to the wavelength of the sound. The model is a combination of the Rayleigh and Mie scattering models, and can describe both forward and backward scattering.

The Rayleigh scattering model, for instance, is used to predict the scattering of sound waves by small particles or bubbles in the water. This is particularly useful in detecting and tracking objects in the water, such as submarines and marine mammals.

The Mie scattering model, on the other hand, is used to describe the scattering of sound waves by particles that are larger than the wavelength of the sound. This is important in situations where the objects of interest are larger than the wavelength of the sound, such as in detecting and tracking large ships or underwater structures.

##### Acoustic Tomography

Acoustic tomography is a technique used to image the ocean floor and subsurface structures. The technique relies on the scattering of sound waves by particles and structures in the water. The Raleigh-Mie scattering model, which combines the Rayleigh and Mie scattering models, is used to describe the scattering of sound waves by particles that are of similar size to the wavelength of the sound. This is particularly useful in imaging the ocean floor, where the particles and structures are typically of similar size to the wavelength of the sound.

##### 10.3b.1 Scattering Cross-Section

The scattering cross-section, denoted by $\sigma$, is a fundamental concept in acoustic scattering. It represents the effective area of a particle or structure that is responsible for scattering sound waves. The scattering cross-section is typically defined as the ratio of the scattered intensity to the incident intensity, and is given by the equation:

$$
\sigma = \frac{I_{scattered}}{I_{incident}}
$$

where $I_{scattered}$ is the intensity of the scattered wave and $I_{incident}$ is the intensity of the incident wave.

##### 10.3b.2 Scattering Matrix

The scattering matrix, denoted by $S$, is a mathematical representation of the scattering process. It describes the transformation of the incident wave into the scattered wave, and is given by the equation:

$$
S = \frac{E_{scattered}}{E_{incident}}
$$

where $E_{scattered}$ is the electric field of the scattered wave and $E_{incident}$ is the electric field of the incident wave.

##### 10.3b.3 Scattering Amplitude

The scattering amplitude, denoted by $f(\theta, \phi)$, is a function that describes the amplitude of the scattered wave as a function of the scattering angle $\theta$ and azimuthal angle $\phi$. It is typically represented in terms of the scattering matrix and the incident wave, and is given by the equation:

$$
f(\theta, \phi) = S \cdot E_{incident}
$$

##### 10.3b.4 Scattering Pattern

#### 10.4a Introduction to Underwater Acoustic Communication

Underwater acoustic communication is a critical aspect of ocean acoustics, enabling the transmission of information underwater. This communication is essential for a variety of applications, including underwater navigation, underwater positioning, underwater imaging, and underwater data harvesting for environmental monitoring.

Underwater acoustic communication is challenging due to the unique characteristics of the underwater acoustic channel. These characteristics include high attenuation, multipath propagation, and time variations of the channel. The high attenuation is due to the absorption of sound waves by water, which increases with frequency. This attenuation can be significant, with a 6 dB/km attenuation at 100 kHz and a 12 dB/km attenuation at 1 MHz.

Multipath propagation is another key characteristic of the underwater acoustic channel. This refers to the phenomenon where a sound wave reaches the receiver via multiple paths, each with a different delay and attenuation. This can cause significant distortion of the transmitted signal, making it difficult to recover the original information.

The time variations of the underwater acoustic channel are also a significant challenge. These variations can be caused by changes in the water properties, such as temperature, salinity, and pressure, as well as by the movement of the transmitter and receiver. These variations can cause significant changes in the propagation characteristics of the channel, making it difficult to maintain a stable communication link.

Despite these challenges, underwater acoustic communication is essential for many applications. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the principles and techniques used in underwater acoustic communication. This includes the modulation techniques used to encode the information onto the acoustic signal, the propagation models used to predict the behavior of the acoustic signal in the water, and the detection techniques used to recover the information from the received signal.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these topics, providing a comprehensive overview of underwater acoustic communication. We will start by discussing the modulation techniques used in underwater acoustic communication, including frequency-shift keying, phase-shift keying, and amplitude-shift keying. We will then discuss the propagation models used to predict the behavior of the acoustic signal in the water, including the spherical spreading model, the multipath propagation model, and the time-varying channel model. Finally, we will discuss the detection techniques used to recover the information from the received signal, including matched filtering, correlation detection, and maximum likelihood detection.

#### 10.4b Modulation Techniques for Underwater Acoustic Communication

Modulation is a critical aspect of underwater acoustic communication. It involves the process of encoding information onto an acoustic signal. The modulation technique used can significantly impact the performance of the communication system, particularly in the face of the challenges posed by the underwater acoustic channel.

There are several types of modulation techniques used in underwater acoustic communication. These include frequency-shift keying (FSK), phase-shift keying (PSK), and amplitude-shift keying (ASK). Each of these techniques has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of modulation technique depends on the specific requirements of the communication system.

##### Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK)

FSK is one of the earliest forms of modulation used for acoustic modems. It involves the use of two distinct frequencies to modulate data. For example, a binary string can be transmitted by alternating these two frequencies depending on whether it is a 0 or 1. The receiver can be as simple as having analogue matched filters to the two frequencies and a level detector.

FSK is particularly suited to underwater acoustic communication due to its robustness against multipath propagation. The use of distinct frequencies allows the receiver to distinguish between the different paths that the signal may take, reducing the impact of multipath propagation.

However, FSK is also susceptible to frequency selective fading, where different frequency components of the signal experience different fading. This can cause errors in the received data, particularly for high data rate transmissions.

##### Phase-Shift Keying (PSK)

PSK is another common modulation technique used in underwater acoustic communication. It involves the use of different phases of a carrier signal to represent different symbols. For example, a binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) system can represent 0 and 1 by using a phase of 0 and a phase of 180 degrees, respectively.

PSK is particularly suited to underwater acoustic communication due to its ability to achieve high data rates. However, it is more susceptible to phase noise and multipath propagation than FSK.

##### Amplitude-Shift Keying (ASK)

ASK involves the use of different amplitudes of a carrier signal to represent different symbols. For example, a binary amplitude-shift keying (BASK) system can represent 0 and 1 by using an amplitude of 0 and an amplitude of 1, respectively.

ASK is particularly suited to underwater acoustic communication due to its simplicity and robustness against frequency selective fading. However, it is more susceptible to amplitude noise and non-linear distortion than FSK and PSK.

In the next section, we will discuss the propagation models used to predict the behavior of the acoustic signal in the water, including the spherical spreading model, the multipath propagation model, and the time-varying channel model.

#### 10.4c Applications in Underwater Acoustics

Underwater acoustic communication has a wide range of applications in the field of ocean acoustics. These applications span from military and defense to environmental monitoring and scientific research.

This includes communication between different submarines, communication between submarines and surface vessels, and communication between submarines and aircraft. 

The use of underwater acoustic communication in military applications is particularly challenging due to the need for secure communication. This is achieved through the use of advanced modulation techniques, such as frequency-shift keying (FSK) and phase-shift keying (PSK), which provide robustness against interception and eavesdropping.

##### Environmental Monitoring and Scientific Research

Underwater acoustic communication is also used in environmental monitoring and scientific research. For instance, it is used in the study of marine mammals, where acoustic tags are attached to the animals to track their movements and behaviors. The tags transmit acoustic signals, which are then received by underwater acoustic receivers. This allows researchers to monitor the animals' movements and behaviors in real-time.

In addition, underwater acoustic communication is used in oceanographic research, particularly in the study of ocean currents and water quality. Acoustic sensors, which can be deployed at various depths in the water column, transmit acoustic signals that contain information about the ocean conditions. These signals are then received by underwater acoustic receivers, which can be located on the surface or on underwater vehicles.

##### Underwater Acoustic Networks

Underwater acoustic communication is also used in the development of underwater acoustic networks. These networks, which are often referred to as underwater wireless sensor networks, consist of a large number of small, low-power devices that communicate wirelessly underwater. These devices, known as underwater acoustic nodes, are used for a variety of applications, including environmental monitoring, underwater mapping, and underwater surveillance.

The development of underwater acoustic networks is a challenging task due to the unique characteristics of the underwater acoustic channel. These characteristics include high attenuation, multipath propagation, and time variations of the channel. However, the use of advanced modulation techniques, such as FSK and PSK, can help mitigate these challenges and enable the reliable communication of data.

In conclusion, underwater acoustic communication plays a crucial role in a wide range of applications in the field of ocean acoustics.

##### High Attenuation

The high attenuation of sound waves in water is a significant challenge for underwater acoustic communication. As mentioned earlier, the attenuation can be as high as 12 dB/km at 1 MHz. This means that the signal strength decreases rapidly with distance, making it difficult to maintain a stable communication link over long distances.

To overcome this challenge, several solutions have been developed. One approach is to use high-frequency sound waves, which have lower attenuation than low-frequency sound waves. However, this approach is limited by the bandwidth of the acoustic channel, which is typically much lower than the bandwidth of the optical channel. Another approach is to use acoustic beamforming, which focuses the sound waves in a specific direction, reducing the attenuation.

##### Multipath Propagation

Multipath propagation is another significant challenge for underwater acoustic communication. The sound waves can reach the receiver via multiple paths, each with a different delay and attenuation. This can cause significant distortion of the transmitted signal, making it difficult to recover the original information.

To address this challenge, several techniques have been developed. One approach is to use equalization, which compensates for the different delays and attenuations of the multipath components. Another approach is to use spread spectrum techniques, which spread the signal over a wide frequency band, making it less susceptible to multipath distortion.

### Section: 11.1a Introduction to Differential Equations

Differential equations play a crucial role in the field of ocean acoustics. They are mathematical equations that describe the relationship between a function and its derivatives. In the context of ocean acoustics, differential equations are used to model the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.

#### 11.1a.1 Types of Differential Equations

There are two main types of differential equations: ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). ODEs involve functions of a single variable and their derivatives, while PDEs involve functions of multiple variables and their partial derivatives.

In the context of ocean acoustics, ODEs are often used to model the propagation of sound waves in a single direction, while PDEs are used to model the propagation of sound waves in multiple directions.

#### 11.1a.2 Solving Differential Equations

Solving a differential equation involves finding the unknown function or functions that satisfy the given equation. This can be a challenging task, especially for higher-order differential equations.

In the context of ocean acoustics, the solutions to differential equations often involve complex functions that describe the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. These solutions can be used to predict the behavior of sound waves in the ocean and to design effective acoustic systems.

#### 11.1a.3 Applications of Differential Equations in Ocean Acoustics

Differential equations have numerous applications in ocean acoustics. They are used to model the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, to design acoustic systems, and to analyze the effects of various factors on sound propagation.

For example, the wave equation, a second-order linear partial differential equation, is used to describe the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. The solutions to this equation can be used to predict the behavior of sound waves in the ocean and to design effective acoustic systems.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical methods used to solve differential equations in ocean acoustics.




### Subsection: 11.1b Solutions and Applications

In this section, we will explore the solutions to differential equations in ocean acoustics and their applications. We will focus on the wave equation, a second-order linear partial differential equation, and its solutions.

#### 11.1b.1 Solutions to the Wave Equation

The wave equation is a fundamental equation in ocean acoustics that describes the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. It is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $p$ is the pressure, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the speed of sound in the ocean.

The solutions to this equation can be complex functions that describe the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. These solutions can be used to predict the behavior of sound waves in the ocean and to design effective acoustic systems.

#### 11.1b.2 Applications of Solutions to the Wave Equation

The solutions to the wave equation have numerous applications in ocean acoustics. They are used to model the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, to design acoustic systems, and to analyze the effects of various factors on sound propagation.

For example, the wave equation can be used to model the propagation of sound waves in a single direction, such as along a straight coastline. This can be useful for predicting the behavior of sound waves in a specific area of the ocean.

The wave equation can also be used to design acoustic systems, such as sonar systems, that can detect and track objects in the ocean. By understanding the solutions to the wave equation, engineers can design systems that can accurately detect and track objects in the ocean.

Furthermore, the wave equation can be used to analyze the effects of various factors on sound propagation in the ocean.

### Subsection: 11.1c Case Studies

In this section, we will explore some case studies that demonstrate the application of differential equations in ocean acoustics. These case studies will provide a deeper understanding of the concepts discussed in the previous sections.

#### 11.1c.1 Case Study 1: Propagation of Sound Waves in a Stratified Ocean

In this case study, we will consider the propagation of sound waves in a stratified ocean. A stratified ocean is characterized by layers of water with different densities, which can significantly affect the propagation of sound waves.

The wave equation for this scenario can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2} + g \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x}
$$

where $p$ is the pressure, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, $c$ is the speed of sound in the ocean, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $\rho$ is the density of the water.

The solutions to this equation can be used to predict the behavior of sound waves in a stratified ocean. For example, they can be used to determine the depth at which sound waves are most strongly attenuated, which can be useful for designing acoustic systems that can penetrate these layers.

#### 11.1c.2 Case Study 2: Reflection and Refraction of Sound Waves at the Ocean Surface

In this case study, we will consider the reflection and refraction of sound waves at the ocean surface. This is a crucial aspect of ocean acoustics, as it determines how much sound is lost when it enters the ocean.

The wave equation for this scenario can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2} + g \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x} + \alpha \frac{\partial p}{\partial x}
$$

where $\alpha$ is the coefficient of surface tension.

The solutions to this equation can be used to predict the amount of sound that is reflected and refracted at the ocean surface. This can be useful for designing acoustic systems that can minimize this loss.

#### 11.1c.3 Case Study 3: Propagation of Sound Waves in a Turbulent Ocean

In this case study, we will consider the propagation of sound waves in a turbulent ocean. A turbulent ocean is characterized by chaotic and unpredictable motion, which can significantly affect the propagation of sound waves.

The wave equation for this scenario can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2} + g \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x} + \alpha \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \beta \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $\beta$ is the coefficient of turbulence.

The solutions to this equation can be used to predict the behavior of sound waves in a turbulent ocean. For example, they can be used to determine the depth at which sound waves are most strongly attenuated, which can be useful for designing acoustic systems that can penetrate these turbulent regions.




#### 11.2a Introduction to Integral Equations

Integral equations play a crucial role in the field of ocean acoustics. They are mathematical equations that involve an integral operator and are used to describe the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. In this section, we will introduce the concept of integral equations and discuss their applications in ocean acoustics.

An integral equation is a mathematical equation that involves an integral operator. The integral operator is denoted by the symbol $\int$ and is used to integrate a function over a certain domain. In the context of ocean acoustics, the domain of integration often represents the volume of the ocean.

Integral equations are used to describe the propagation of sound waves in the ocean because they allow us to account for the complex interactions between the sound waves and the ocean environment. These interactions can include reflection, refraction, and absorption of sound waves, which can significantly affect the propagation of the sound waves.

One of the most common types of integral equations used in ocean acoustics is the Volterra integral equation. The Volterra integral equation is a linear integral equation of the first kind, which can be written in the form:

$$
\int_a^b K(x,t)f(t)dt = g(x)
$$

where $K(x,t)$ is the kernel of the integral operator, $f(t)$ is the function to be determined, and $g(x)$ is a known function.

The Volterra integral equation is used to describe the propagation of sound waves in the ocean because it allows us to account for the non-linear interactions between the sound waves and the ocean environment. These non-linear interactions can include the scattering of sound waves off of ocean boundaries and the interaction of sound waves with ocean currents.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the theory of integral equations and discuss their applications in ocean acoustics. We will also explore some numerical methods for solving integral equations, which are essential tools for solving complex problems in ocean acoustics.

#### 11.2b Solving Integral Equations

Solving integral equations is a crucial aspect of ocean acoustics. It allows us to understand the propagation of sound waves in the ocean and predict their behavior under different conditions. In this section, we will discuss some methods for solving integral equations, including the method of variation of constants and the method of successive approximations.

The method of variation of constants is a technique used to solve linear differential equations. It can be extended to solve linear integral equations, such as the Volterra integral equation. The method involves finding a particular solution to the homogeneous equation (i.e., the equation with the right-hand side set to zero) and then using this solution to find a general solution to the non-homogeneous equation (i.e., the equation with the right-hand side non-zero).

The method of successive approximations, also known as the Picard iteration method, is another technique used to solve differential equations. It can be extended to solve integral equations as well. The method involves iteratively solving a simplified version of the original equation and then using the solution to approximate the solution to the original equation.

Let's consider the Volterra integral equation again:

$$
\int_a^b K(x,t)f(t)dt = g(x)
$$

where $K(x,t)$ is the kernel of the integral operator, $f(t)$ is the function to be determined, and $g(x)$ is a known function.

The method of variation of constants can be used to solve this equation as follows:

1. Find a particular solution $f_0(t)$ to the homogeneous equation:

$$
\int_a^b K(x,t)f_0(t)dt = 0
$$

2. Use $f_0(t)$ to find a general solution $f(t)$ to the non-homogeneous equation:

$$
f(t) = f_0(t) + h(t)
$$

where $h(t)$ is a particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation.

The method of successive approximations can be used to solve this equation as follows:

1. Choose an initial guess $f_0(t)$ for the solution.

2. Iteratively solve the simplified equation:

$$
\int_a^b K(x,t)f_{n+1}(t)dt = g(x) - \int_a^b K(x,t)f_n(t)dt
$$

where $f_n(t)$ is the $n$-th approximation to the solution.

In the next section, we will discuss some numerical methods for solving integral equations, which are essential tools for solving complex problems in ocean acoustics.

#### 11.2c Applications in Ocean Acoustics

Integral equations play a crucial role in the field of ocean acoustics. They are used to model and solve complex problems related to the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. In this section, we will discuss some of the applications of integral equations in ocean acoustics.

One of the primary applications of integral equations in ocean acoustics is in the modeling of sound propagation in the ocean. The ocean is a complex medium with varying properties such as density, temperature, and salinity. These properties can significantly affect the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. Integral equations, particularly the Volterra integral equation, are used to model the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, taking into account these complex properties.

Another important application of integral equations in ocean acoustics is in the design and analysis of acoustic systems. Acoustic systems, such as sonar and underwater communication systems, rely on the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. Integral equations are used to analyze the performance of these systems, predicting how sound waves will propagate in the ocean under different conditions.

Integral equations are also used in the study of ocean noise and its effects on marine life. The ocean is a noisy place, with a variety of sources of noise, including ship traffic, industrial activities, and natural phenomena such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Integral equations are used to model the propagation of this noise in the ocean, and to study its effects on marine life.

In addition to these applications, integral equations are also used in the study of ocean acoustics for other purposes, such as the prediction of ocean currents, the modeling of ocean waves, and the study of ocean turbulence.

##### Case Study 1: Design of a Sonar System

One of the most common applications of integral equations in ocean acoustics is the design of sonar systems. Sonar systems are used to detect and locate objects underwater, and their design often involves solving integral equations.

Consider a simple sonar system that emits a single pulse of sound waves into the ocean. The sound waves travel through the ocean and are reflected off of objects, such as a submarine. The reflected sound waves then travel back to the sonar system, where they are detected and processed.

#### 11.3a Introduction to Numerical Methods

Numerical methods play a crucial role in the field of ocean acoustics, providing a means to solve complex problems that cannot be solved analytically. These methods are particularly useful in the study of wave propagation in the ocean, where the governing equations are often nonlinear and time-dependent.

One of the most common numerical methods used in ocean acoustics is the Gauss-Seidel method. This iterative method is used to solve a system of linear equations, which often arise in the discretization of the wave equation. The Gauss-Seidel method is particularly useful when dealing with large systems of equations, as it allows for the efficient computation of the solution.

The Gauss-Seidel method is named after the German mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauss and Philipp Ludwig von Seidel, and is a modification of the Jacobi method. It is an iterative method that is used to solve a system of linear equations. The method is particularly useful when dealing with large systems of equations, as it allows for the efficient computation of the solution.

The basic idea behind the Gauss-Seidel method is to solve the system of equations iteratively, updating the solution at each iteration. The method is particularly useful when dealing with large systems of equations, as it allows for the efficient computation of the solution.

The Gauss-Seidel method is based on the idea of splitting the system of equations into two parts: a diagonal part and a non-diagonal part. The diagonal part is solved directly, while the non-diagonal part is solved iteratively. This is done by updating the solution at each iteration, using the updated values from the previous iteration.

The Gauss-Seidel method is particularly useful in the study of wave propagation in the ocean, where the governing equations are often nonlinear and time-dependent. It allows for the efficient computation of the solution, making it a valuable tool in the field of ocean acoustics.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the theory and applications of numerical methods in ocean acoustics, exploring their use in solving complex problems in the field.

#### 11.3b Wave Equation Solvers

The wave equation is a second-order linear partial differential equation that describes the propagation of a variety of waves, such as sound waves, electromagnetic waves, and water waves. In the context of ocean acoustics, the wave equation is used to describe the propagation of sound waves in the ocean.

The wave equation can be written in its general form as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $u$ is the displacement of the wave, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the speed of the wave.

Solving the wave equation analytically can be challenging, especially for complex geometries and boundary conditions. Therefore, numerical methods are often used to solve the wave equation. These methods discretize the wave equation into a system of linear equations, which can then be solved using methods such as the Gauss-Seidel method.

One such method is the finite difference method, which approximates the derivatives in the wave equation using finite differences. The wave equation can be discretized using the finite difference method as follows:

$$
\frac{u_{i}^{n+1} - 2u_{i}^{n} + u_{i}^{n-1}}{\Delta t^2} = c^2 \frac{u_{i+1}^{n} - 2u_{i}^{n} + u_{i-1}^{n}}{\Delta x^2}

#### 11.3c Applications in Ocean Acoustics

Numerical methods, particularly the Gauss-Seidel method and the finite difference method, have found extensive applications in the field of ocean acoustics. These methods are used to solve the wave equation, which describes the propagation of sound waves in the ocean. 

One of the key applications of these numerical methods is in the study of wave propagation in the ocean. The wave equation can be used to model the propagation of sound waves in the ocean, taking into account factors such as the ocean's depth, the speed of sound in water, and the boundary conditions at the ocean surface and seafloor. 

For example, consider a simple scenario where a sound source is placed at a certain depth in the ocean, and we want to determine the sound pressure at different points in the ocean. The wave equation can be solved numerically using methods such as the Gauss-Seidel method or the finite difference method to determine the sound pressure at different points in the ocean.

Another important application of these numerical methods is in the study of wave scattering in the ocean. Wave scattering occurs when sound waves encounter obstacles or inhomogeneities in the ocean, causing them to deviate from their original path. The wave equation can be used to model wave scattering, and numerical methods can be used to solve the equation and determine the scattered sound field.

Numerical methods are also used in the design and analysis of sonar systems. Sonar systems use sound waves to detect and locate objects underwater. The performance of a sonar system can be analyzed using the wave equation, and numerical methods can be used to solve the equation and determine the sonar system's performance.

In conclusion, numerical methods play a crucial role in the field of ocean acoustics. They allow us to solve complex problems such as wave propagation, wave scattering, and sonar system analysis that cannot be solved analytically. As computational resources continue to improve, we can expect these methods to become even more powerful tools in the study of ocean acoustics.

### Section: 12.1 Acoustic Measurement Techniques:

Acoustic measurement techniques are essential for understanding the behavior of sound in the ocean. These techniques allow us to measure various properties of sound, such as its pressure, velocity, and direction, and to study how it interacts with the ocean environment. In this section, we will discuss the basic principles of acoustic measurement techniques and their applications in ocean acoustics.

#### 12.1a Introduction to Acoustic Measurement Techniques

Acoustic measurement techniques involve the use of specialized equipment to measure various properties of sound in the ocean. These techniques are crucial for understanding the complex dynamics of sound propagation in the ocean and for developing accurate models and simulations.

One of the most commonly used acoustic measurement techniques is the measurement of sound pressure. This is typically done using a hydrophone, which is a device that can detect and measure sound pressure in the water. The hydrophone is placed in the water at a specific location, and the sound pressure is measured at that point. This allows us to study the variations in sound pressure over time and space, and to understand how sound propagates through the ocean.

Another important acoustic measurement technique is the measurement of sound velocity. This is typically done using a CTD (conductivity, temperature, and depth) sensor, which measures the conductivity and temperature of the water at different depths. The sound velocity is then calculated using the measured conductivity and temperature, as well as the known relationship between sound speed and these properties. This allows us to study the variations in sound velocity with depth, and to understand how sound propagates through the different layers of the ocean.

In addition to measuring sound pressure and velocity, acoustic measurement techniques also involve the measurement of other properties of sound, such as its direction and intensity. This is typically done using an acoustic array, which is a set of hydrophones arranged in a specific pattern. By measuring the arrival time and amplitude of sound at each hydrophone, the direction and intensity of the sound can be determined. This allows us to study the propagation of sound in the ocean, and to understand how it is affected by various factors such as ocean currents and topography.

Acoustic measurement techniques are also used to study the effects of ocean acoustic properties on sound propagation. For example, reverberation measurements are used to study the reflection and scattering of sound off the ocean surface and bottom. Ambient noise measurements are used to study the background noise in the ocean, which can affect the detection and localization of sound sources. Acoustic tomography is used to study the vertical structure of the ocean, by measuring the sound speed and attenuation at different depths.

Overall, acoustic measurement techniques are crucial for understanding the behavior of sound in the ocean. They allow us to study the complex dynamics of sound propagation, and to develop accurate models and simulations that can be used for various applications, such as underwater navigation and communication, marine mammal monitoring, and ocean exploration. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the principles and applications of these techniques, and discuss their role in advancing our understanding of ocean acoustics.
