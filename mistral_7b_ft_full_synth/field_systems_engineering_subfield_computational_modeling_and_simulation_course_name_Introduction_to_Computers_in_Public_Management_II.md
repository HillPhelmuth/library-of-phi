### Subsection: 2.3a Selecting Fields and Records

In the previous section, we explored the various methods for entering data into a database. Now, we will delve into the process of selecting specific fields and records from a database. This is an essential skill for any database manager, as it allows for targeted data retrieval and analysis.

#### 2.3a.1 Selecting Fields

Fields are the individual pieces of data within a record in a database. When performing a query, we may only want to select certain fields from the database. This can be done using the SELECT statement in SQL.

The SELECT statement allows us to specify which fields we want to retrieve from the database. For example, if we have a database of employee information, we may want to select only the employee's name and salary. This can be done with the following query:

```
SELECT Name, Salary FROM EmployeeDatabase;
```

This query will return a list of all the employees' names and salaries.

#### 2.3a.2 Selecting Records

Records are the individual pieces of data within a database. When performing a query, we may only want to select certain records from the database. This can be done using the WHERE clause in SQL.

The WHERE clause allows us to specify which records we want to retrieve from the database. For example, if we have a database of employee information, we may want to select only the records of employees who make over a certain salary. This can be done with the following query:

```
SELECT Name, Salary FROM EmployeeDatabase WHERE Salary > 50000;
```

This query will return a list of all the employees' names and salaries who make over $50,000.

#### 2.3a.3 Combining Field and Record Selection

We can also combine field and record selection in a single query. This allows us to retrieve specific fields from certain records. For example, if we have a database of employee information, we may want to select only the employees' names and salaries who make over a certain salary. This can be done with the following query:

```
SELECT Name, Salary FROM EmployeeDatabase WHERE Salary > 50000;
```

This query will return a list of all the employees' names and salaries who make over $50,000.

### Conclusion

In this section, we have explored the process of selecting specific fields and records from a database. This is a crucial skill for any database manager, as it allows for targeted data retrieval and analysis. By using the SELECT and WHERE clauses in SQL, we can retrieve specific fields and records from a database, allowing us to perform more complex queries in the future.

#### 2.3b.1 Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions are mathematical operations that are performed on a group of records. These functions are useful for summarizing data and can be used in conjunction with the SELECT statement in SQL.

Some common aggregate functions include:

- COUNT(): This function counts the number of records in a group.
- SUM(): This function adds up the values in a group.
- AVG(): This function calculates the average value in a group.
- MIN(): This function finds the minimum value in a group.
- MAX(): This function finds the maximum value in a group.

#### 2.3b.2 Group By

The GROUP BY clause in SQL allows us to group records together based on a specific field. This is useful when we want to perform an aggregate function on a group of records.

For example, if we have a database of employee information, we may want to find the average salary for each department. We can do this with the following query:

```
SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) FROM EmployeeDatabase GROUP BY Department;
```

This query will return a list of the departments and their average salary.

#### 2.3b.3 Having

The HAVING clause in SQL is used in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause. It allows us to filter the groups that are returned by the GROUP BY clause.

For example, if we want to find the average salary for each department, but only for departments with an average salary over a certain amount, we can use the HAVING clause. This can be done with the following query:

```
SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) FROM EmployeeDatabase GROUP BY Department HAVING AVG(Salary) > 50000;
```

This query will return a list of the departments and their average salary, but only for departments with an average salary over $50,000.

#### 2.3b.4 Combining Aggregation and Selection

We can also combine aggregate functions and selection in a single query. This allows us to perform calculations on a group of records while also selecting specific fields from those records.

For example, if we want to find the average salary for each department, but only for departments with an average salary over a certain amount, we can use the HAVING clause in conjunction with the SELECT statement. This can be done with the following query:

```
SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) FROM EmployeeDatabase GROUP BY Department HAVING AVG(Salary) > 50000 SELECT Name, Salary FROM EmployeeDatabase WHERE Department = 'IT' AND Salary > 60000;
```

This query will return a list of the employees in the IT department who make over $60,000.

### Conclusion

In this section, we learned about simple aggregation in databases. We explored the concept of aggregate functions, the GROUP BY and HAVING clauses, and how to combine aggregation and selection in a single query. These skills are essential for performing calculations and summarizing data in a database. In the next section, we will delve into more advanced topics, such as joins and subqueries.

Census data is a valuable resource for public managers, as it provides a wealth of information about the population and its characteristics. However, this data is often stored in large and complex files, making it difficult to access and analyze. This is where STFs come in.

STFs are standardized files that contain census data in a structured and organized manner. They are created by the Census Bureau and are used by researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders to access and analyze census data. These files are designed to be easily read and manipulated by computer programs, making them a valuable tool for public managers.

To extract census data from STFs, we will use the popular programming language SQL. SQL is a powerful tool for working with relational databases, and it is commonly used in the public sector for data analysis and decision-making. In this section, we will cover the basics of SQL and how it can be used to extract census data from STFs.

#### 5.1b Data Extraction Techniques

There are several techniques for extracting census data from STFs using SQL. One common technique is to use the SELECT statement, which allows us to retrieve specific columns and rows from a table. For example, we can use the following SQL statement to select all the columns from the STF file:

```
SELECT * FROM STF;
```

This will return all the columns and rows from the STF file, allowing us to access and analyze the data.

Another technique is to use the WHERE clause, which allows us to filter the data based on specific criteria. For example, we can use the following SQL statement to select only the rows where the population is greater than 100,000:

```
SELECT * FROM STF WHERE population > 100000;
```

This will return only the rows that meet the specified criteria, making it easier to analyze the data.

#### 5.1c Census Data Extraction Examples

To further illustrate the process of extracting census data from STFs, let's look at some examples.

Example 1: Retrieving Population Data

Using the SELECT statement, we can retrieve the population data from the STF file. This will return all the columns and rows containing population data, allowing us to analyze the population trends and characteristics.

Example 2: Filtering by City Name

Using the WHERE clause, we can filter the data to only include rows where the city name is "Boston". This will allow us to analyze the specific data for that city and compare it to other cities in the dataset.

Example 3: Calculating Population Density

Using SQL's built-in functions, we can calculate the population density for each city in the dataset. This can be useful for understanding the distribution of population and identifying areas with high or low population density.

In conclusion, extracting census data from STFs using SQL is a crucial skill for public managers. By understanding the basics of SQL and using techniques such as the SELECT and WHERE clauses, we can easily access and analyze census data, making informed decisions and improving efficiency in our operations.

Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the use of symbols and colors in the map design.

Another important principle is the use of labels and text. Labels and text can be used to provide additional information about the map, such as the title, source, and legend. However, it is important to use them sparingly and in a clear and concise manner. Too many labels and text can clutter the map and make it difficult to read. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the placement and size of labels and text on the map.

In addition to these principles, there are also specific guidelines for map design that can help enhance the accuracy, clarity, and persuasiveness of the map. These guidelines include:

- Use a consistent and meaningful color scheme.
- Use symbols and colors to represent different categories.
- Use labels and text sparingly and in a clear and concise manner.
- Use a clear and legible font for labels and text.
- Use a consistent and appropriate scale for the map.
- Use a clear and legible title for the map.
- Use a clear and legible legend for the map.
- Use a clear and legible source for the map.

By following these guidelines and principles, we can create maps that are accurate, clear, and persuasive, effectively communicating information to our readers. In the next section, we will explore how these principles can be applied to enhance the accuracy, clarity, and persuasiveness of the map when using census data.


#### 6.1b Map Accuracy and Clarity Techniques

In the previous section, we discussed the importance of map design principles in enhancing the accuracy, clarity, and persuasiveness of the map. In this section, we will explore some specific techniques that can be used to improve map accuracy and clarity.

One technique for improving map accuracy is through the use of geodata. Geodata is a type of data that is used to describe the physical features of a map, such as roads, rivers, and boundaries. By incorporating geodata into the map design, we can ensure that the map accurately represents the real-world features. This can be particularly useful when creating maps based on census data, as it allows for a more precise representation of the data.

Another technique for improving map accuracy is through the use of GIS (Geographic Information System) software. GIS software allows for the integration of multiple data sources, such as census data, geodata, and other spatial data, to create a more comprehensive and accurate map. This can be especially useful when creating maps that involve multiple layers of data, as it allows for a more detailed and accurate representation of the data.

In addition to improving accuracy, there are also techniques that can be used to enhance map clarity. One such technique is through the use of visual hierarchy. Visual hierarchy refers to the arrangement of elements on the map in a way that guides the reader's attention and helps them understand the information being presented. This can be achieved through the use of different colors, sizes, and placements of elements on the map.

Another technique for improving map clarity is through the use of labels and text. As mentioned in the previous section, labels and text can be used to provide additional information about the map. However, it is important to use them in a way that is clear and concise. This can be achieved through the use of a consistent and legible font, as well as careful placement and sizing of labels and text on the map.

In conclusion, by incorporating geodata, using GIS software, and implementing techniques such as visual hierarchy and clear labeling, we can enhance the accuracy and clarity of our maps. This not only improves the effectiveness of the map in communicating information, but also adds to its persuasiveness in conveying a message or argument. In the next section, we will explore how these techniques can be applied to enhance the accuracy, clarity, and persuasiveness of maps created using census data.


#### 6.1c Map Persuasiveness Techniques

In the previous section, we discussed the importance of map accuracy and clarity in effectively communicating information. In this section, we will explore some specific techniques that can be used to enhance the persuasiveness of a map.

One technique for improving map persuasiveness is through the use of emotional appeals. Emotional appeals involve using visual elements and language to evoke emotions in the reader, such as fear, anger, or empathy. This can be particularly effective when creating maps that highlight social or environmental issues, as it can help to create a sense of urgency and motivate action.

Another technique for enhancing map persuasiveness is through the use of storytelling. By incorporating a narrative into the map, we can create a more engaging and relatable experience for the reader. This can be achieved through the use of descriptive language, images, and interactive elements that allow the reader to explore the map in a more immersive way.

In addition to emotional appeals and storytelling, there are also techniques that can be used to improve map persuasiveness through the use of data. One such technique is through the use of data visualization. Data visualization involves presenting complex data in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand way. This can be achieved through the use of charts, graphs, and other visual elements that help to highlight trends and patterns in the data.

Another technique for improving map persuasiveness through data is through the use of data-driven arguments. By using data to support a specific argument or claim, we can create a more persuasive and convincing map. This can be achieved through the use of statistical analysis, comparisons, and other data-based evidence.

In conclusion, by incorporating emotional appeals, storytelling, data visualization, and data-driven arguments, we can enhance the persuasiveness of a map and effectively communicate a message or argument to the reader. These techniques can be particularly useful when creating maps based on census data, as they allow for a more comprehensive and persuasive representation of the data.

### Introduction

Welcome to Chapter 7 of "Introduction to Computers in Public Management II". In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the world of databases and explore advanced database operations. As we have learned in previous chapters, databases are an essential tool for managing and analyzing large amounts of data in the public sector. However, with the increasing complexity of data and the need for more sophisticated analysis, it is crucial to understand advanced database operations.

In this chapter, we will cover various topics related to advanced database operations, including advanced querying techniques, database design, and data modeling. We will also explore the use of databases in data analysis and how they can be used to solve real-world problems in the public sector.

As always, we will use the popular Markdown format to present the information in a clear and concise manner. All math equations will be formatted using the $ and $$ delimiters to insert math expressions in TeX and LaTeX style syntax, rendered using the MathJax library. This will allow us to explain complex concepts in a more accessible way.

We hope that by the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of advanced database operations and be able to apply them in your own work. So let's dive in and explore the world of advanced databases in public management.


## Chapter 7: Advanced Database Operations:




### Section: 7.1 Complex Queries:

In the previous chapters, we have covered the basics of databases and how to perform simple queries. However, in real-world scenarios, we often encounter complex data that requires advanced querying techniques. In this section, we will explore some of these advanced querying techniques and how they can be used to solve real-world problems in the public sector.

#### 7.1a Advanced Query Design

Advanced query design involves creating complex queries that can retrieve data from multiple tables and perform calculations on that data. This is often necessary when dealing with large and complex datasets. In this subsection, we will cover some advanced query design techniques that can help you create efficient and effective queries.

One of the key techniques in advanced query design is the use of joins. Joins allow us to combine data from multiple tables based on a common key. This is particularly useful when dealing with related data, such as customer and order data. By joining these tables, we can retrieve all the necessary information about a customer and their orders in a single query.

Another important aspect of advanced query design is the use of subqueries. Subqueries allow us to embed a query within another query. This can be useful when we need to retrieve data from multiple tables and perform calculations on that data. Subqueries can also be used to filter data and improve the efficiency of our queries.

In addition to joins and subqueries, advanced query design also involves the use of advanced filtering techniques. These techniques allow us to retrieve specific data based on certain criteria. For example, we can use the IN operator to retrieve data based on a list of values, or the BETWEEN operator to retrieve data within a specific range. These filtering techniques can greatly improve the efficiency of our queries and help us retrieve the exact data we need.

Another important aspect of advanced query design is the use of aggregate functions. Aggregate functions allow us to perform calculations on a group of data. For example, we can use the SUM function to calculate the total value of all orders placed by a customer. Aggregate functions can also be used to retrieve the maximum or minimum value in a group of data.

In addition to these techniques, advanced query design also involves the use of advanced query languages such as SQL and PL/SQL. These languages allow us to perform complex queries and calculations on large datasets. They also provide features such as stored procedures and triggers, which can help us automate common tasks and improve the efficiency of our queries.

In conclusion, advanced query design is a crucial skill for anyone working with databases. By understanding and utilizing advanced querying techniques, we can create efficient and effective queries that can help us solve real-world problems in the public sector. In the next section, we will explore some real-world examples of advanced database operations and how they are used in public management.

Query rewriting is a typically automatic transformation that takes a set of database tables, views, and/or queries, usually indices, often gathered data and query statistics, and other metadata, and yields a set of different queries, which produce the same results but execute with better performance (for example, faster, or with lower memory use). Query rewriting can be based on relational algebra or an extension thereof (e.g. multiset relational algebra with sorting, aggregation and three-valued predicates i.e. NULLs as in the case of SQL). The equivalence rules of relational algebra are exploited, in other words, different query structures and orderings can be mathematically proven to yield the same result. For example, filtering on fields A and B, or cross joining R and S can be done in any order, but there can be a performance difference. Multiple operations may be combined, and operation orders may be altered.

The result of query rewriting may not be at the same abstraction level or application programming interface (API) as the original set of queries (though often is). For example, the input queries may be in relational algebra or SQL, and the rewritten queries may be closer to the physical representation of the data, e.g. array operations. Query rewriting can also involve materialization of views and other subqueries; operations that may or may not be available to the API user. The query rewriting transformation can be aided by creating indices from which the optimizer can choose (some database systems may also use other techniques such as query plan caching).

Query rewriting is a powerful technique for improving query performance, but it also has its limitations. For example, it may not be feasible for very complex queries, or for queries that involve user-defined functions or other non-standard features. In such cases, other optimization techniques may be necessary.

Advanced query design involves creating complex queries that can retrieve data from multiple tables and perform calculations on that data. This is often necessary when dealing with large and complex datasets. In this subsection, we will cover some advanced query design techniques that can help you create efficient and effective queries.

These filtering techniques can greatly improve the efficiency of our queries and help us retrieve the exact data we need.

#### 7.1b Query Optimization

Query optimization is the process of improving the performance of a query by reducing the amount of data that needs to be retrieved and processed. This can be achieved through various techniques, such as indexing, partitioning, and query rewriting.

Indexing is a technique used to improve the performance of queries by creating an index on a column or set of columns. This allows the database to quickly retrieve data based on that column, reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned.

Partitioning is another technique used to improve query performance. It involves dividing a large table into smaller, more manageable tables. This can help reduce the amount of data that needs to be retrieved and processed, especially for queries that involve joining multiple tables.

Query rewriting, as mentioned earlier, is a technique used to improve query performance by transforming a query into a more efficient form. This can involve rewriting the query to use different operators or joining tables in a different order.

In addition to these techniques, there are also other factors that can affect query performance, such as the size and structure of the data, the type of database engine being used, and the hardware and software configuration.

By understanding and implementing these advanced query design and optimization techniques, we can create more efficient and effective queries that can handle complex and large datasets in the public sector. 





### Section: 7.1c Practical Application

In this section, we will explore some practical applications of complex queries in public management. These applications will demonstrate the power and versatility of complex queries in solving real-world problems.

#### 7.1c.1 Case Study 1: Analyzing Voter Trends

Consider a public management scenario where a government agency needs to analyze voter trends over time. This agency has a database containing voter registration data, including the voter's name, address, party affiliation, and voting history. The agency wants to generate a report that shows the number of voters registered in each party, the number of votes cast for each party, and the percentage of voters who voted for each party.

A complex query can be used to generate this report. The query would involve multiple joins to combine the voter registration data with the voting history data. It would also involve grouping and aggregation to count the number of voters and votes for each party. The query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT p.party_name, COUNT(v.voter_id) AS num_voters, SUM(v.vote) AS num_votes, ROUND(SUM(v.vote) / COUNT(v.voter_id) * 100, 2) AS vote_percentage
FROM voter_registration v
JOIN party p ON v.party_id = p.party_id
GROUP BY p.party_name
```

This query would generate a report like the following:

| Party Name | Number of Voters | Number of Votes | Vote Percentage |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Democratic | 1000           | 500           | 50.00%        |
| Republican | 1000           | 500           | 50.00%        |
| Independent | 1000           | 500           | 50.00%        |

#### 7.1c.2 Case Study 2: Identifying High-Risk Areas

Consider a public management scenario where a government agency needs to identify areas at high risk for crime. The agency has a database containing crime report data, including the location of the crime, the type of crime, and the time of day the crime occurred. The agency wants to generate a map that shows the areas with the highest number of crimes.

A complex query can be used to generate this map. The query would involve multiple joins to combine the crime report data with the location data. It would also involve grouping and aggregation to count the number of crimes in each location. The query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT l.location, COUNT(c.crime_id) AS num_crimes
FROM crime c
JOIN location l ON c.location_id = l.location_id
GROUP BY l.location
```

This query would generate a report like the following:

| Location | Number of Crimes |
|---------|-----------------|
| Downtown | 100            |
| Uptown   | 50             |
| Suburb   | 20             |

The agency could then use this report to create a map that shows the areas with the highest number of crimes.

#### 7.1c.3 Case Study 3: Analyzing Employee Performance

Consider a public management scenario where a government agency needs to analyze employee performance. The agency has a database containing employee data, including the employee's name, job title, and performance rating. The agency wants to generate a report that shows the number of employees in each job title and their average performance rating.

A complex query can be used to generate this report. The query would involve multiple joins to combine the employee data with the performance rating data. It would also involve grouping and aggregation to count the number of employees in each job title and calculate their average performance rating. The query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT j.job_title, COUNT(e.employee_id) AS num_employees, AVG(p.performance_rating) AS avg_performance_rating
FROM employee e
JOIN job j ON e.job_id = j.job_id
JOIN performance_rating p ON e.employee_id = p.employee_id
GROUP BY j.job_title
```

This query would generate a report like the following:

| Job Title | Number of Employees | Average Performance Rating |
|----------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Manager   | 100              | 80                   |
| Clerk     | 200              | 70                   |
| Technician| 300              | 90                   |

The agency could then use this report to identify areas where employee performance needs improvement.




### Section: 7.2 Data Analysis and Interpretation:

In the previous section, we explored the practical applications of complex queries in public management. In this section, we will delve into the advanced topic of data analysis and interpretation. This is a crucial skill for public managers as it allows them to make informed decisions based on data.

#### 7.2a Statistical Analysis Techniques

Statistical analysis is a powerful tool for understanding and interpreting data. It involves the use of statistical methods to analyze data and draw conclusions from it. In the context of public management, statistical analysis can be used to identify trends, patterns, and relationships in data that can inform policy decisions.

One of the most commonly used statistical techniques in public management is regression analysis. Regression analysis is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is often used to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

For example, consider a public management scenario where a government agency wants to predict the number of votes a candidate will receive based on their campaign spending. The agency has a database containing campaign spending data and voter data. The agency can use regression analysis to model the relationship between campaign spending and votes received.

The regression model would look something like this:

$$
\hat{V} = \beta_0 + \beta_1S + \epsilon
$$

where $\hat{V}$ is the predicted number of votes, $S$ is the campaign spending, $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are the regression coefficients, and $\epsilon$ is the error term.

The regression coefficients $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ can be estimated using the least squares method. Once the coefficients are estimated, the model can be used to predict the number of votes a candidate will receive based on their campaign spending.

Another important statistical technique in public management is hypothesis testing. Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to test a hypothesis about a population based on a sample. It is often used in public management to make inferences about the population based on a sample of data.

For example, consider a public management scenario where a government agency wants to determine if there is a significant difference in voting behavior between different age groups. The agency has a database containing voter data, including age and voting history. The agency can use hypothesis testing to determine if there is a significant difference in voting behavior between different age groups.

The hypothesis test would involve comparing the mean voting behavior of different age groups using a t-test. If the p-value of the t-test is less than the significance level (usually 0.05), the agency can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in voting behavior between different age groups.

In conclusion, statistical analysis techniques are powerful tools for public managers. They allow managers to make informed decisions based on data and to understand the relationships between different variables. In the next section, we will explore another important aspect of data analysis and interpretation - data visualization.

#### 7.2b Data Visualization

Data visualization is a powerful tool for understanding and communicating complex data sets. It involves the use of visual representations, such as charts, graphs, and maps, to present data in a way that is easy to understand and interpret. In the context of public management, data visualization can be used to identify trends, patterns, and relationships in data that can inform policy decisions.

One of the most commonly used data visualization techniques in public management is the use of charts and graphs. Charts and graphs can be used to present data in a visual format that makes it easy to understand and interpret. For example, a bar chart can be used to compare the number of votes received by different candidates in an election.

Another important data visualization technique is the use of maps. Maps can be used to present spatial data, such as the location of crime incidents or the distribution of voters in a region. This can be particularly useful in public management, where decisions often need to be made at a local level.

Data visualization can also be used to present complex data sets in a more manageable way. For example, a heat map can be used to present a large data set in a condensed format, making it easier to identify patterns and trends.

In addition to presenting data, data visualization can also be used for data exploration. By visually exploring data, public managers can gain insights into the data that may not be apparent from just looking at the raw data. This can lead to new hypotheses and questions that can be further investigated using statistical analysis techniques.

In conclusion, data visualization is a powerful tool for understanding and communicating complex data sets. It can be used to present data in a way that is easy to understand and interpret, to explore data for new insights, and to communicate findings to a wider audience. In the next section, we will explore another important aspect of data analysis and interpretation - data interpretation.

#### 7.2c Data Interpretation

Data interpretation is the process of understanding and explaining the meaning of data. It involves the use of statistical analysis techniques and data visualization to make sense of complex data sets. In the context of public management, data interpretation is crucial for making informed decisions and policies.

One of the key aspects of data interpretation is understanding the context of the data. This involves understanding the source of the data, the method of data collection, and any potential biases or limitations in the data. For example, if data on voter preferences is collected through a survey, it is important to understand the sample size, demographic breakdown, and potential response bias.

Another important aspect of data interpretation is understanding the relationships and trends in the data. This can be achieved through statistical analysis techniques, such as regression analysis and hypothesis testing, as discussed in the previous section. By understanding these relationships and trends, public managers can make informed decisions and policies.

Data interpretation also involves communicating the findings to a wider audience. This can be achieved through data visualization, as discussed in the previous section. By presenting data in a visual format, complex data sets can be made easier to understand and interpret.

In addition to understanding and communicating the data, data interpretation also involves using the data to inform decision-making. This can be achieved by identifying key insights and implications from the data. For example, if data on crime rates is analyzed, public managers can use this information to inform policies and resource allocation to address crime.

In conclusion, data interpretation is a crucial aspect of public management. It involves understanding the context of the data, analyzing the relationships and trends, communicating the findings, and using the data to inform decision-making. By mastering these skills, public managers can make informed decisions and policies that benefit the public.

#### 7.3a Data Quality Assessment

Data quality assessment is a critical step in the data analysis process. It involves evaluating the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data. In the context of public management, data quality assessment is crucial for ensuring the reliability and usefulness of data in decision-making and policy development.

One of the key aspects of data quality assessment is understanding the source of the data. This involves understanding the method of data collection, the reliability of the data source, and any potential biases or limitations in the data. For example, if data on voter preferences is collected through a survey, it is important to understand the sample size, demographic breakdown, and potential response bias.

Another important aspect of data quality assessment is understanding the accuracy of the data. This involves checking for errors, inconsistencies, and outliers in the data. For example, if data on crime rates is analyzed, it is important to check for any errors in the reporting of crimes or any outliers that may skew the data.

Data completeness is another crucial aspect of data quality assessment. This involves checking for any missing or incomplete data. Incomplete data can lead to biased or inaccurate results in data analysis. For example, if data on voter preferences is collected through a survey, it is important to check for any missing responses or incomplete surveys.

Data consistency is also an important aspect of data quality assessment. This involves checking for any inconsistencies in the data, such as duplicate entries or conflicting information. Inconsistencies can lead to inaccurate results in data analysis. For example, if data on voter preferences is collected through a survey, it is important to check for any duplicate responses or conflicting information.

In addition to these aspects, data quality assessment also involves understanding the context of the data. This involves understanding the source of the data, the method of data collection, and any potential biases or limitations in the data. By understanding the context of the data, public managers can make informed decisions and policies based on reliable and accurate data.

In conclusion, data quality assessment is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It involves understanding the source of the data, the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the data, and the context of the data. By conducting a thorough data quality assessment, public managers can ensure the reliability and usefulness of data in decision-making and policy development.

#### 7.3b Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is a critical step in the data analysis process. It involves identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in data. In the context of public management, data cleaning is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of data in decision-making and policy development.

One of the key aspects of data cleaning is identifying and correcting errors in the data. This can be achieved through various techniques, such as data validation and error checking. Data validation involves comparing the data against a set of predefined rules or constraints. For example, if data on voter preferences is collected through a survey, data validation can be used to check for any errors in the reporting of preferences.

Error checking, on the other hand, involves identifying and correcting errors in the data. This can be achieved through techniques such as range checking, which involves checking for values that fall outside a predefined range. For example, if data on crime rates is analyzed, error checking can be used to identify and correct any errors in the reporting of crimes.

Another important aspect of data cleaning is dealing with missing values in the data. Missing values can lead to biased or inaccurate results in data analysis. There are various techniques for dealing with missing values, such as imputation and deletion. Imputation involves replacing missing values with estimated values, while deletion involves removing the entire record if it contains missing values.

Data cleaning also involves dealing with inconsistencies in the data. This can be achieved through techniques such as data reconciliation, which involves identifying and resolving inconsistencies in the data. For example, if data on voter preferences is collected through a survey, data reconciliation can be used to identify and resolve any inconsistencies in the reported preferences.

In addition to these aspects, data cleaning also involves understanding the context of the data. This involves understanding the source of the data, the method of data collection, and any potential biases or limitations in the data. By understanding the context of the data, public managers can make informed decisions and policies based on reliable and accurate data.

In conclusion, data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It involves identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in data. By conducting a thorough data cleaning process, public managers can ensure the accuracy and reliability of data in decision-making and policy development.

#### 7.3c Data Integration

Data integration is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It involves combining data from different sources to create a comprehensive and cohesive dataset. In the context of public management, data integration is essential for making informed decisions and policies based on a holistic understanding of the data.

One of the key aspects of data integration is understanding the context of the data. This involves understanding the source of the data, the method of data collection, and any potential biases or limitations in the data. For example, if data on voter preferences is collected through a survey, it is important to understand the demographic breakdown of the sample, the method of data collection, and any potential response bias.

Another important aspect of data integration is identifying and resolving any inconsistencies or discrepancies between different data sources. This can be achieved through techniques such as data reconciliation, which involves identifying and resolving inconsistencies in the data. For example, if data on crime rates is collected from multiple sources, data reconciliation can be used to identify and resolve any discrepancies between the different sources.

Data integration also involves dealing with missing values in the data. This can be achieved through techniques such as imputation, which involves replacing missing values with estimated values. For example, if data on voter preferences is collected through a survey, imputation can be used to replace missing values with estimated values based on the available data.

In addition to these aspects, data integration also involves understanding the relationships and dependencies between different data sources. This can be achieved through techniques such as data fusion, which involves combining data from different sources to create a more comprehensive and accurate dataset. For example, if data on voter preferences is collected through a survey, data fusion can be used to combine this data with other relevant data sources, such as demographic data, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of voter preferences.

In conclusion, data integration is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It involves combining data from different sources to create a comprehensive and cohesive dataset. By understanding the context of the data, identifying and resolving inconsistencies, dealing with missing values, and understanding the relationships and dependencies between different data sources, public managers can make informed decisions and policies based on a holistic understanding of the data.

### Section: 7.2 Data Analysis and Interpretation:

In the previous section, we explored the practical applications of complex queries in public management. In this section, we will delve into the advanced topic of data analysis and interpretation. This is a crucial skill for public managers as it allows them to make informed decisions based on data.

#### 7.2a Statistical Analysis Techniques

Statistical analysis is a powerful tool for understanding and interpreting data. It involves the use of statistical methods to analyze data and draw conclusions from it. In the context of public management, statistical analysis can be used to identify trends, patterns, and relationships in data that can inform policy decisions.

One of the most commonly used statistical techniques in public management is regression analysis. Regression analysis is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is often used to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

For example, consider a public management scenario where a government agency wants to predict the number of votes a candidate will receive based on their campaign spending. The agency has a database containing campaign spending data and voter data. The agency can use regression analysis to model the relationship between campaign spending and votes received.

The regression model would look something like this:

$$
\hat{V} = \beta_0 + \beta_1S + \epsilon
$$

where $\hat{V}$ is the predicted number of votes, $S$ is the campaign spending, $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are the regression coefficients, and $\epsilon$ is the error term.

The regression coefficients $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ can be estimated using the least squares method. Once the coefficients are estimated, the model can be used to predict the number of votes a candidate will receive based on their campaign spending.

Another important statistical technique in public management is data visualization. Data visualization is the graphical representation of data and information. It allows public managers to quickly understand and interpret complex data sets. Data visualization can be used to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in data that may not be apparent in a tabular format.

One popular tool for data visualization is Yoix YDAT (Yoix Data Analysis Tool). YDAT uses a data manager component to coordinate data display and filtering among its several visualization components. It is able to display graphs generated by the GraphViz graph drawing and layout tool, which is another open source tool freely available from AT&T Labs. YDAT is highly configurable at the Yoix language level, allowing public managers to customize their data visualizations to meet their specific needs.

In addition to graph drawing, Yoix technology also provides good support for organizing and displaying cells of data. The YChart data visualization toolkit, added to the Yoix distribution with release 2.2.0, allows public managers to organize and display cells of data in a user-friendly manner. Two interactive YChart applications contained in the Yoix distribution are a Periodic Table of the Elements and a Unicode Chart. These tools can be useful for public managers who need to quickly access and interpret large amounts of data.

In conclusion, statistical analysis and data visualization are essential skills for public managers. They allow managers to make informed decisions based on data and to effectively communicate their findings to others. By understanding and utilizing these techniques, public managers can improve their decision-making processes and ultimately better serve the public.

Spatial queries are a crucial aspect of spatial data analysis. They allow us to retrieve data based on spatial relationships, such as proximity or containment. In this section, we will explore the basics of spatial queries, including their definition, types, and applications.

#### 8.2a Spatial Query Design

Spatial query design is the process of creating a spatial query that retrieves the desired data based on spatial relationships. This involves defining the spatial data types, functions, and operators that will be used in the query.

The first step in spatial query design is to define the spatial data types that will be used. As mentioned earlier, spatial data can be represented in different ways, such as raster, vector, topological, and temporal. The choice of data type depends on the specific needs and requirements of the query.

Next, we need to define the functions and operators that will be used in the query. These functions and operators are used to perform spatial operations, such as finding the distance between two points or determining if a point is within a polygon. Some commonly used functions and operators in spatial queries include ST_Contains, ST_Intersection, and ST_Distance.

Once the data types, functions, and operators have been defined, we can then write the spatial query. This involves using the appropriate syntax and keywords for the specific spatial database being used. For example, in PostGIS, a spatial join between two layers can be performed using the following syntax:

```
SELECT * FROM cities, countries WHERE ST_Contains(countries.shape, cities.shape);
```

Spatial queries have a wide range of applications in public management. They can be used to identify areas with high crime rates, determine the best location for a new public facility, or analyze the impact of a new transportation system on the surrounding communities. By using spatial queries, we can gain valuable insights into the spatial data and make informed decisions.

## Spatial query<anchor|Query>

A spatial query is a special type of database query supported by spatial databases, including geodatabases. The queries differ from non-spatial SQL queries in several important ways. Two of the most important are that they allow for the use of geometry data types such as points, lines and polygons and that these queries consider the spatial relationship between these geometries.

The function names for queries differ across geodatabases. The following are a few of the functions built into PostGIS, a free geodatabase which is a PostgreSQL extension (the term 'geometry' refers to a point, line, box or other two or three dimensional shape):

Function prototype: "functionName (parameter(s)) : return type "

Thus, a spatial join between a points layer of cities and a polygon layer of countries could be performed in a spatially-extended SQL statement as:

<code>SELECT * FROM cities, countries WHERE ST_Contains(countries.shape, cities.shape)</code>

The Intersect vector overlay operation (a core element of GIS software) could be replicated as:

<code>SELECT ST_Intersection(veg.shape, soil.shape) int_poly, veg.*, soil.* FROM veg, soil where ST_Intersects(veg.shape, soil # Object-based spatial database

### GRASS GIS

It supports raster and some set of vector representation # SpatiaLite

SpatiaLite is a spatial extension to SQLite, providing vector geodatabase functionality. It is similar to PostGIS, Oracle Spatial, and SQL Server with spatial extensions, although SQLite/SpatiaLite aren't based on client-server architecture: they adopt a simpler personal architecture. i.e. the whole SQL engine is directly embedded within the application itself: a complete database simply is an ordinary file which can be freely copied and transferred from one computer/OS to a different one without any special precaution.

SpatiaLite extends SQLite's existing spatial support to cover the OGC's SFS specification. It isn't necessary to use Spa

### Section: 9.1 Advanced Map Design:

In this section, we will explore advanced map design principles that can help us create effective and informative maps. These principles are essential for creating maps that accurately represent data and communicate information effectively.

#### 9.1a Advanced Map Design Principles

When designing advanced maps, it is important to keep in mind the following principles:

1. Clarity: The map should be clear and easy to read. This means using appropriate symbols, colors, and labels to effectively convey information.

2. Simplicity: The map should be simple and uncluttered. Too many elements on a map can make it difficult to interpret and understand.

3. Accuracy: The map should accurately represent the data. This means using appropriate scales, projections, and generalization techniques.

4. Relevance: The map should be relevant to the purpose and audience. It should effectively communicate the intended message and be useful to the intended audience.

5. Balance: The map should be balanced in terms of visual weight and information density. This means avoiding overcrowding and ensuring that all elements are visually balanced.

6. Contrast: The map should have good contrast between different elements. This helps to create visual hierarchy and guide the reader's attention.

7. Consistency: The map should be consistent in terms of design elements and symbols. This helps to create a cohesive and visually appealing map.

8. Hierarchy: The map should have a clear visual hierarchy, with the most important elements being the most prominent. This helps to guide the reader's attention and prioritize information.

9. Proximity: Related elements should be placed close together on the map. This helps to create a sense of organization and make it easier for the reader to understand the relationships between different elements.

10. Scale: The map should be at an appropriate scale to effectively represent the data. This means considering the size and complexity of the data and choosing an appropriate scale to accurately represent it.

By following these principles, we can create advanced maps that effectively communicate information and help us gain a deeper understanding of complex public management issues. In the next section, we will explore advanced mapping techniques that can help us create more detailed and nuanced maps.





### Subsection: 9.1b Map Accuracy and Clarity

In this subsection, we will focus on the principles of map accuracy and clarity. These are crucial for creating maps that effectively communicate information and accurately represent data.

#### 9.1b.1 Map Accuracy

Map accuracy refers to the degree to which a map represents the real-world features it depicts. It is essential for ensuring that the information presented on the map is accurate and reliable. There are several factors that can affect map accuracy, including:

1. Scale: The scale of a map determines how much of the real world is represented on the map. A larger scale means a more detailed representation, but it can also introduce distortion and errors.

2. Projection: The projection used to create a map can also affect its accuracy. Different projections have different properties and can introduce distortion in different ways.

3. Generalization: Generalization is the process of simplifying complex data to create a more manageable representation. This can introduce errors and inaccuracies, especially when dealing with large and complex datasets.

To ensure map accuracy, it is important to carefully consider the scale, projection, and generalization techniques used in the mapping process. It is also crucial to regularly update and review maps to identify and correct any errors or inaccuracies.

#### 9.1b.2 Map Clarity

Map clarity refers to the ease with which a map can be read and understood. It is closely related to the principles of simplicity and balance discussed in section 9.1a. A clear map should have a simple and uncluttered design, with a good balance of visual elements. This can be achieved by following the principles of visual hierarchy and proximity, as well as using appropriate symbols, colors, and labels.

In addition to these principles, there are also specific techniques that can be used to improve map clarity. These include:

1. Label placement: Labels should be placed in a way that is easy to read and understand. They should be close to the features they represent and should not overlap with other elements on the map.

2. Symbol size and color: The size and color of symbols should be carefully chosen to ensure that they are easily distinguishable and do not create visual clutter.

3. Line thickness and weight: The thickness and weight of lines should be carefully chosen to create a sense of hierarchy and guide the reader's attention.

4. Contrast: As mentioned earlier, good contrast between different elements is crucial for creating a clear and visually appealing map.

By following these principles and techniques, we can create maps that are both accurate and clear, effectively communicating information and helping us make informed decisions.





### Subsection: 9.1c Persuasive Mapping Techniques

In addition to accuracy and clarity, maps can also be used as persuasive tools. Persuasive mapping is a technique used to influence decision-making by presenting information in a way that is compelling and persuasive. This can be particularly useful in public management, where decisions can have significant impacts on society.

#### 9.1c.1 Principles of Persuasive Mapping

Persuasive mapping is based on the principles of cognitive psychology and persuasive communication. These principles can be applied to map design to create maps that effectively persuade decision-makers. Some of these principles include:

1. Framing: Framing refers to the way information is presented and interpreted. In persuasive mapping, different frames can be used to highlight different aspects of the data and influence how it is perceived. For example, a map showing the impact of a policy on poverty levels could be framed in terms of the number of people lifted out of poverty (positive frame) or the number of people still living in poverty (negative frame).

2. Anchoring and adjustment: This principle refers to the tendency for individuals to rely on the first information they receive when making decisions. In persuasive mapping, this can be used to anchor the decision-maker's perception of the data. For example, if a map shows a significant increase in poverty levels, the decision-maker may adjust their perception of the data based on this anchor.

3. Availability heuristic: This is a cognitive shortcut that individuals use to make decisions based on information that is readily available to them.

### Subsection: 9.2a Data Integration Techniques

Data integration is a crucial aspect of advanced thematic mapping. It involves the combination of data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive and accurate map. In this section, we will discuss some of the techniques used for data integration.

#### 9.2a.1 Data Warehousing

Data warehousing is a traditional approach to data integration. It involves extracting, transforming, and loading data from heterogeneous sources into a unique view schema. This approach is particularly useful for large-scale data integration, as demonstrated by the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) at the University of Minnesota. By making thousands of population databases interoperable, IPUMS demonstrated the feasibility of large-scale data integration.

The data warehouse approach offers a tightly coupled architecture, where the data are already physically reconciled in a single queryable repository. This usually takes little time to resolve queries. However, this approach is less feasible for data sets that are frequently updated, requiring the extract, transform, load (ETL) process to be continuously re-executed for synchronization.

#### 9.2a.2 Loose Coupling of Data

The trend in data integration currently favors the loose coupling of data and providing a unified query-interface to access real-time data over a mediated schema. This approach relies on mappings between the mediated schema and the schema of original sources, and translating a query into decomposed queries to match the schema of the original databases.

This approach is consistent with the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach popular in recent years. It allows for more flexibility and adaptability, as the data sources can be updated or changed without affecting the overall data integration process. However, this approach also requires more complex mapping and translation processes, which can be challenging to manage.

#### 9.2a.3 Data Integration Tools

There are several tools available for data integration, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of these tools include:

1. **Data Integration Tools**: These are software applications designed specifically for data integration tasks. They often include features for data profiling, data cleansing, and data transformation.

2. **Data Integration Services**: These are services that provide data integration capabilities as a service. They can be accessed through APIs and can handle a wide range of data integration tasks.

3. **Data Integration Platforms**: These are comprehensive platforms that provide a range of data integration capabilities, including data integration tools and services. They often also include features for data management and data analysis.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the challenges and considerations in data integration.

The IPUMS project at the University of Minnesota is a prime example of data integration on a large scale. The project aims to make thousands of population databases interoperable, allowing for the integration of data from various sources. This is achieved through the use of a data warehouse approach, where data are physically reconciled in a single queryable repository.

The IPUMS project demonstrates the feasibility of large-scale data integration. However, it also highlights the challenges associated with this approach. The data warehouse architecture requires the extract, transform, load (ETL) process to be continuously re-executed for synchronization, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

#### 9.2b.2 Loose Coupling of Data at IPUMS

Despite the challenges associated with the data warehouse approach, the IPUMS project also incorporates elements of loose coupling of data. This allows for a unified query-interface to access real-time data over a mediated schema. This approach relies on mappings between the mediated schema and the schema of original sources, and translating a query into decomposed queries to match the schema of the original databases.

This approach provides more flexibility and adaptability, as the data sources can be updated or changed without affecting the overall data integration process. However, it also requires more complex mapping and translation processes, which can be challenging to manage.

#### 9.2b.3 Lessons Learned from IPUMS

The IPUMS project provides valuable insights into the challenges and benefits of data integration. It highlights the importance of careful planning and consideration when choosing a data integration approach. The project also underscores the need for continuous monitoring and maintenance of the data integration process, particularly in the case of a data warehouse approach.

### Spatial and temporal analysis of crime ellipses

The development of spatial and temporal analysis of crime ellipses, or STAC ellipses, started off as a program to determine a "hot circle" of crime incidents on crime maps. Samuel Bates created a formula that used a grid, rectangular or triangular, to create boundaries around an area. A radius then would be defined, and a circle would be created around a pinpoint of each crime incident. Following this, another grid is created that creates circles that are half of the original radius defined. This grid is then combined with the first grid to create a circle that contains the highest number of incidents, creating the "hot circle". This method created the foundation of what is now used to create hot spot ellipses.

Bate's original formula did not answer if the "hot circle" represented an area that clearly had a higher density of crime incidents or not. The formula had other problems as some "hot circles" would overlap and share same crime incidents. The "hot circles" also sometimes became elongated creating ovals. These problems led to the creation of the hot spot ellipses.

Ellipses are created now to show different levels of dispersion of crime incidents. They are always used in analysis to examine if there are any directional trends in the data set. First a user sets the size of the ellipses, typically for a crime data set on a map, miles are used. Following this, the user defines the standard deviation amount they want to use; this determines the number of data points wanted to be included in the ellipse. The standard deviation is then calculated for each point in the data set, and the points that fall within the defined standard deviation are included in the ellipse. This process is repeated for multiple ellipses, each with a different standard deviation, to create a series of ellipses that represent different levels of dispersion.

The use of ellipses in crime analysis allows for a more comprehensive understanding of crime patterns and trends. By examining the different levels of dispersion, analysts can identify areas that have a higher density of crime incidents and focus their efforts on preventing and reducing crime in those areas. Additionally, the use of ellipses can also help identify any directional trends in the data set, providing valuable insights for decision-making and resource allocation.

In the next section, we will explore the case study of how computers are used in analyzing crime data in a major city. We will see how the use of ellipses and other tools and techniques have helped improve crime analysis and public management in this city.

#### 15.2a.1 Designing Housing Data Queries

Designing housing data queries involves identifying the specific data points that need to be retrieved, the relationships between different data points, and the desired output format. This process is crucial as it determines the efficiency and effectiveness of the query execution.

To design a housing data query, one needs to have a clear understanding of the data model. The data model provides a visual representation of the data and its relationships, making it easier to identify the data points and their relationships. For instance, in the case of the 8 House, the data model would show the relationships between the house, its rooms, and the people living in those rooms.

Once the data model is understood, the next step is to identify the specific data points that need to be retrieved. This could be information about the house, its rooms, or the people living in those rooms. For example, one might want to retrieve information about the number of rooms in a house, the number of people living in each room, or the average number of people per room.

The next step is to define the relationships between different data points. This involves identifying the join conditions between different tables. For instance, in the case of the 8 House, the join condition between the house and room tables would be the house ID.

Finally, one needs to define the desired output format. This could be a table, a graph, or a combination of both. The output format should be chosen based on the specific needs and requirements of the query.

#### 15.2a.2 Executing Housing Data Queries

Once the housing data query is designed, it needs to be executed. This involves translating the query into a format that can be understood by the database. In the case of SQL, this involves writing the query in a specific syntax.

For instance, a query to retrieve the number of rooms in a house could be written as follows:

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM room WHERE house_id = <house_id>;
```

This query would retrieve the number of rooms in a house with a specific house ID.

Similarly, a query to retrieve the average number of people per room could be written as follows:

```
SELECT AVG(COUNT(*) / COUNT(DISTINCT room_id)) FROM person, room WHERE person.room_id = room.room_id AND house_id = <house_id>;
```

This query would retrieve the average number of people per room in a house with a specific house ID.

#### 15.2a.3 Challenges and Solutions

Designing and executing housing data queries can be challenging due to the complexity of the data and the relationships between different data points. However, there are several solutions that can help overcome these challenges.

One solution is to use a graph query language like GQL. GQL is designed to handle complex data models and relationships, making it easier to design and execute housing data queries.

Another solution is to use a property graph query language like SQL/PGQ Property Graph Query. This language is specifically designed for property graphs, which are a type of graph where each node has properties associated with it. This makes it particularly useful for housing data queries, where each house, room, and person can have multiple properties associated with them.

In conclusion, designing and executing housing data queries is a crucial step in housing and community development. By understanding the data model, identifying the specific data points and relationships, and choosing the right output format, one can design efficient and effective housing data queries.

The housing map of Boston is updated regularly to reflect changes in the housing landscape. This allows city officials to track changes in housing conditions over time and to respond to emerging housing needs.

##### Case Study 2: Housing Mapping in the State of California

The State of California has also been a leader in housing mapping. The state has developed a statewide housing map that includes information on housing affordability, housing quality, and demographic information. This map is used by state officials to identify areas with high housing needs and to plan for future housing development.

The housing map of California is a large-scale document that covers the entire state. It includes multiple layers of information, similar to the housing map of Boston. However, the California map also includes additional layers representing information on housing policies and programs, such as affordable housing programs and housing regulations.

The housing map of California is updated annually to reflect changes in the housing landscape. This allows state officials to track changes in housing conditions over time and to respond to emerging housing needs.

##### Interpreting and Presenting Housing Mapping Case Studies

Interpreting and presenting housing mapping case studies involves understanding the data used to create the map, the symbols and colors used to represent it, and the context of the map. This could involve understanding the purpose of the map, the area it represents, and the time period it covers. It could also involve understanding the policies and programs represented on the map.

Presenting housing mapping case studies effectively involves communicating this information to stakeholders in a clear and understandable way. This could involve explaining the purpose of the map, the data used to create it, and the key or legend. It could also involve discussing the findings of the map, such as areas with high housing needs or changes in housing conditions over time.




#### 15.3c Practical Application

The practical application of housing mapping in housing and community development is vast and multifaceted. It is a tool that can be used to address a variety of issues, from identifying areas with high housing needs to tracking changes in housing conditions over time.

##### Housing Mapping in Addressing Housing Needs

Housing mapping can be used to identify areas with high housing needs. By mapping the distribution of housing conditions, decision-makers can pinpoint areas where there is a high demand for affordable housing, or where there are high levels of housing disrepair. This information can then be used to target resources and interventions to these areas.

For example, a housing map could be used to identify areas with a high concentration of rental properties. This could indicate a high demand for affordable housing in these areas. By targeting resources to these areas, decision-makers can help address the housing needs of these communities.

##### Housing Mapping in Tracking Changes in Housing Conditions

Housing mapping can also be used to track changes in housing conditions over time. By creating housing maps at different points in time, decision-makers can track how housing conditions are changing in different areas. This can help identify trends and patterns, and inform decisions about future housing policies and interventions.

For example, a housing map could be used to track changes in the distribution of housing conditions in a city over the course of a decade. This could reveal trends such as an increase in the number of areas with high housing needs, or a decrease in the number of areas with affordable housing. This information could then be used to inform decisions about future housing policies and interventions.

##### Housing Mapping in Informing Housing Policies and Interventions

Housing mapping can also be used to inform housing policies and interventions. By providing a visual representation of the housing landscape, housing maps can help decision-makers understand the context in which housing policies and interventions are being implemented. This can help inform decisions about the most effective and appropriate policies and interventions.

For example, a housing map could be used to inform a policy decision about where to locate affordable housing developments. By mapping the distribution of housing conditions, decision-makers can identify areas where there is a high demand for affordable housing, and where there is available land for development. This could inform a decision to locate affordable housing developments in these areas.

In conclusion, housing mapping is a powerful tool in housing and community development. It can be used to address a variety of issues, from identifying areas with high housing needs to tracking changes in housing conditions over time. By effectively interpreting and presenting housing maps, decision-makers can make informed decisions about housing policies and interventions.

## Types of data used in education

There are 4 major types of data used in education: demographics data, perceptions data, student learning data, and school processes data.

1. Demographics data in educational organizations answers the question, "Who are we?". Demographics show the current context of the school and shows the trends. Trends help to predict and plan for the future, along with seeing measures where leaders work towards continuous school improvement. Thorough demographic data explains the structure of school, system, and the leadership. In education demographic data to the next items: number of students in the school, number of students with special needs, number of English learners, age or grade of students in cohorts, socio-economical status of students, attendance rates, ethnicity/race/religious beliefs, graduation rates, dropout rates, experience information of teachers, information about parents of students.

2. Perception data tells us what students, staff, and parents think about a school and answers the question, "How do we do business?". School culture, climate, and organizational processes are assessed by perception data. Perception data includes values, beliefs, perceptions, opinions, observations. Perception data is collected mostly questionnaires. Perception data can be differentiate by two groups: 1- staff, 2 - students and parents. Staff are being asked if any changes in instruction or curriculum need to take place. Students and parents are questioned to report their interests, how difficult material is to learn, how are they taught and treated.

3. Student learning data answers two questions: How are our students doing? and Where are we now? Student learning data requires information from all subject areas, disaggregated by demographic groups, by teachers, by grade level, by cohorts over time, and individual student growth. This type of data helps to address academic achievement, identify areas of improvement, and track student progress. It can also be used to inform instructional decisions and resource allocation.

4. School processes data focuses on the systems and procedures within a school. This data can help identify areas of efficiency and inefficiency, and inform decisions about resource allocation and school improvement. Process data can include information about student enrollment, attendance, discipline, and graduation rates. It can also include data on teacher hiring, training, and retention. By analyzing process data, schools can identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to enhance school operations.

### Subsection: 16.1b Education Data Management

In the previous section, we discussed the various types of data used in education. Now, we will delve into the management of this data, specifically focusing on the Learning Object Metadata (LOM) data model.

#### The LOM Data Model

The LOM data model is a hierarchical structure that organizes the various elements of learning object metadata. It consists of nine categories, each containing sub-elements that may be simple data holders or aggregate elements containing further sub-elements. The semantics of an element are determined by its context, which is influenced by its parent or container element and other elements within the same container.

The data model allows for the repetition of certain elements, either individually or as a group. For instance, while the elements 9.2 ("Description") and 9.1 ("Purpose") can only occur once within each instance of the "Classification" container element, the "Classification" element may be repeated, allowing for multiple descriptions for different purposes.

#### Value Spaces and Datatypes

The LOM data model also specifies the value space and datatype for each of the simple data elements. The value space defines the restrictions, if any, on the data that can be entered for that element. For many elements, the value space allows any string of Unicode characters to be entered, while others require data to be drawn from a declared list (i.e., a controlled vocabulary) or to be in a specified format (e.g., date and language codes).

Some element datatypes simply allow a string of characters to be entered, while others comprise two parts. The first part describes the type of data, such as a string or a date, while the second part provides additional information about the data, such as the language or the format of a date.

#### Implementing the LOM Data Model

When implementing the LOM data model, it is not necessary to support all the elements. The creation of an application profile allows a community of users to specify the elements that are most relevant to their needs. This flexibility allows for the tailoring of the data model to specific educational contexts and requirements.

In the next section, we will explore how this data management system is used in practice, focusing on the challenges and benefits of implementing such a system in an educational setting.




### Subsection: 16.1c Practical Application

In this section, we will explore the practical application of the LOM data model in education. The LOM data model is used in various learning management systems (LMS) to store and manage learning object metadata. This allows for the efficient organization and retrieval of learning objects, which can be anything from a simple document to a complex interactive simulation.

#### Learning Management Systems

LMS are software applications that are used to create, manage, and deliver online learning content. They are used in both formal education (e.g., schools and universities) and informal education (e.g., corporate training and e-learning platforms). The LOM data model is used in these systems to store and manage the metadata of learning objects.

#### Learning Object Repositories

Learning object repositories (LOR) are digital libraries that store and manage learning objects. They are used in both formal and informal education to share and reuse learning objects. The LOM data model is used in these repositories to store and manage the metadata of learning objects.

#### Learning Analytics

Learning analytics is the use of data and technology to improve learning. It involves the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data about learners and their learning processes. The LOM data model is used in learning analytics to store and manage the metadata of learning objects, which can then be used to track learner progress and identify areas for improvement.

#### Conclusion

The LOM data model plays a crucial role in the management of learning objects in education. It provides a standardized way of storing and managing learning object metadata, which is essential for the efficient organization and retrieval of learning objects. Its practical applications in learning management systems, learning object repositories, and learning analytics make it a valuable tool in the field of education.

As mentioned in the previous section, the Learning Object Metadata (LOM) data model is widely used in education for organizing and storing learning objects. This data model is based on the Dublin Core metadata elements, which provide a standard set of elements for describing resources on the internet.

When designing education data queries, it is important to consider the different types of data that need to be retrieved. This includes information about the learning objects themselves, such as their title, description, and keywords, as well as information about the learners, such as their demographics and learning progress.

#### Executing Education Data Queries

Once the education data queries have been designed, they can be executed using various tools and techniques. One popular tool for executing education data queries is the Oracle Warehouse Builder (OWB). OWB is a data integration and modeling tool that allows for the creation of data warehouses and the execution of queries on large datasets.

Another technique for executing education data queries is through the use of SQL. SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a programming language used for interacting with databases. It allows for the retrieval, manipulation, and insertion of data in a structured and efficient manner.

#### Importance of Education Data Query Design and Execution

The design and execution of education data queries are crucial for understanding and analyzing education data. By designing and executing queries, we can retrieve the necessary information to answer important questions about education, such as the effectiveness of different teaching methods or the impact of technology on learning.

Furthermore, the use of tools and techniques such as OWB and SQL allows for the efficient and accurate retrieval of education data. This is especially important in the field of education, where large amounts of data need to be analyzed in a timely manner.

#### 16.3a Education Map Design

Education mapping is a powerful tool that can be used to visualize and analyze education data. It allows us to see patterns and trends in education, identify areas of improvement, and make informed decisions. In this section, we will explore the design principles that guide the creation of education maps.

##### Purpose and Audience

Every education map has a purpose and an audience. The purpose of the map may be to teach the major physical and political features of the entire world, or to convince a neighbor to move a fence. The audience may be as broad as the general public or as narrow as a single person. Education map designers use design principles to guide them in constructing a map that is effective for its purpose and audience.

##### Cartographic Process

The cartographic process spans many stages, starting from conceiving the need for a map and extending all the way through its consumption by an audience. Conception begins with a real or imagined environment. As the education map designer gathers information about the subject, they consider how that information is structured and how that structure should inform the map's design. Next, the education map designer experiment with generalization, symbolization, typography, and other map elements to find ways to portray the information so that the map reader can interpret the map as intended. Guided by these experiments, the education map designer settles on a design and creates the map, whether in physical or electronic form. Once finished, the map is delivered to its audience. The map reader interprets the symbols and patterns on the map to draw conclusions and perhaps to take action. By the spatial perspective provided by the map, the audience can gain a better understanding of the education system and make informed decisions.

##### Map Elements

Education maps are composed of various elements, including but not limited to, schools, students, teachers, and performance data. These elements are represented using symbols, colors, and text. The choice of these elements and their representation is guided by the purpose and audience of the map. For instance, a map designed to show the distribution of schools in a region may use different symbols to represent different types of schools (e.g., primary schools, secondary schools, and universities). The colors used in the map may be used to highlight areas of high or low performance. The text on the map may provide additional information about the schools, such as their name, location, and performance data.

##### Map Interaction

Education maps can be interactive, allowing the user to explore the map and interact with its elements. This can be particularly useful for large and complex education systems, where it may not be possible to show all the information on a single map. Interactive maps allow the user to zoom in and out, pan across the map, and filter the information shown on the map. This can help the user to focus on specific areas of interest and gain a deeper understanding of the education system.

In conclusion, education mapping is a powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing education data. By understanding the principles of map design and the elements of education maps, we can create effective maps that help us to understand and improve the education system.

#### 16.3b Education Map Analysis

After the design of an education map, the next step is to analyze the map to gain insights into the education system. This analysis can be done using various techniques, including statistical analysis, spatial analysis, and network analysis.

##### Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis involves the use of statistical methods to analyze the data represented on the map. This can include calculating measures of central tendency (such as mean and median), measures of dispersion (such as standard deviation and range), and other statistical measures. For example, a statistical analysis of a map showing the distribution of schools in a region could involve calculating the mean and median number of schools per district, as well as the standard deviation and range of school counts across all districts.

##### Spatial Analysis

Spatial analysis involves the use of spatial statistics and geographic information systems (GIS) to analyze the spatial patterns represented on the map. This can include identifying clusters of schools, identifying areas of high or low school density, and identifying patterns of school location relative to other features (such as population density or socio-economic status). For example, a spatial analysis of a map showing the distribution of schools in a region could involve identifying clusters of schools in areas of high population density, or identifying areas of low school density in areas of low socio-economic status.

##### Network Analysis

Network analysis involves the use of network theory and graph theory to analyze the relationships represented on the map. This can include identifying key nodes (such as schools with high student enrollment), identifying key links (such as routes between schools), and identifying patterns of connectivity (such as clusters of schools that are well-connected). For example, a network analysis of a map showing the connections between schools in a region could involve identifying key nodes (such as large schools), identifying key links (such as routes between schools), and identifying patterns of connectivity (such as clusters of schools that are well-connected).

By combining these techniques, education map analysts can gain a deeper understanding of the education system and make informed decisions about education policy and practice.
