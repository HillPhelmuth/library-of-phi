#### 2.1a Basics of Orbital Mechanics

Orbital mechanics is a complex field that combines principles from mechanics, mathematics, and physics to predict the behavior of satellites in orbit. In this section, we will explore the fundamental principles of orbital mechanics, including Kepler's laws of planetary motion, the two-body problem, and the concept of orbital elements.

#### Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion

Kepler's laws of planetary motion are three scientific laws describing the motion of planets around the Sun. These laws were formulated by Johannes Kepler in the 17th century based on his observations of the orbits of Mars. They are as follows:

1. The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.
2. A line segment joining a planet and a point on its elliptical orbit traces out a sector of an angle whose size is proportional to the area of the sector.
3. The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis.

These laws apply to satellites in orbit around any central body, including the Earth.

#### The Two-Body Problem

The two-body problem is a fundamental problem in celestial mechanics that deals with the motion of two bodies under the influence of their mutual gravitational attraction. The problem is to determine the motion of the two bodies as functions of time, given their initial positions and velocities.

The two-body problem can be solved exactly for two bodies of equal mass moving in a vacuum. In this case, the motion of the two bodies is confined to a plane, and their orbits are ellipses with the same semi-major axis.

#### Orbital Elements

Orbital elements are a set of six parameters that define the shape, size, and orientation of a satellite's orbit. These elements are used to describe the orbit of a satellite in space. They are as follows:

1. Semi-major axis ($a$) - This is the longest diameter of the ellipse and is a measure of the size of the orbit.
2. Eccentricity ($e$) - This is a measure of the shape of the orbit. An eccentricity of 0 indicates a circular orbit, while an eccentricity greater than 0 indicates an elliptical orbit.
3. Inclination ($i$) - This is the angle between the orbital plane and the equatorial plane of the central body.
4. Longitude of the ascending node ($\Omega$) - This is the angle between the vernal equinox and the ascending node.
5. Argument of periapsis ($\omega$) - This is the angle between the ascending node and the periapsis.
6. True anomaly ($\nu$) - This is the angle between the periapsis and the current position of the satellite.

These elements are used to calculate the position and velocity of a satellite at any given time using Kepler's laws of planetary motion and the two-body problem.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the practical applications of orbital mechanics in satellite engineering.

#### 2.1b Orbital Maneuvers

Orbital maneuvers are the set of actions taken to change the orbit of a satellite. These maneuvers are necessary for a variety of reasons, including adjusting the satellite's orbit to avoid collisions, changing the satellite's altitude, or transferring the satellite from one orbit to another.

##### Hohmann Transfer Orbit

The Hohmann Transfer Orbit is a type of orbital maneuver that is used to transfer a satellite from one circular orbit to another. The maneuver involves two engine burns. The first burn moves the satellite from its original circular orbit to an elliptical orbit with the same semi-major axis. The second burn, at the other end of the orbit, circularizes the orbit at the desired altitude.

The time taken for the satellite to travel from the first burn to the second burn is given by the equation:

$$
\Delta t = \frac{2\pi a^2}{\mu}
$$

where $a$ is the semi-major axis of the orbit and $\mu$ is the gravitational parameter of the central body.

The change in the argument of periapsis ($\Delta \omega$) during the transfer is given by the equation:

$$
\Delta \omega = \frac{2\pi a^2}{\mu}
$$

##### Orbital Inclination Change

The inclination of an orbit can be changed by performing an orbital inclination change maneuver. This maneuver involves a Hohmann Transfer Orbit, but with the additional requirement that the plane of the transfer orbit is not the same as the plane of the original orbit. This requires an additional engine burn to change the plane of the orbit.

The change in the inclination ($\Delta i$) during the maneuver is given by the equation:

$$
\Delta i = \frac{\pi a^2}{\mu}
$$

##### Orbital Eccentricity Change

The eccentricity of an orbit can be changed by performing an orbital eccentricity change maneuver. This maneuver involves a Hohmann Transfer Orbit, but with the additional requirement that the semi-major axis of the transfer orbit is not the same as the semi-major axis of the original orbit. This requires an additional engine burn to change the semi-major axis.

The change in the eccentricity ($\Delta e$) during the maneuver is given by the equation:

$$
\Delta e = \frac{\pi a^2}{\mu}
$$

These orbital maneuvers are fundamental to the operation of satellite systems. They allow satellites to be moved to different orbits, adjust their altitude, and change their orientation in space. Understanding these maneuvers is crucial for anyone working in the field of satellite engineering.

#### 2.1c Satellite Orbits

Satellite orbits are the paths that satellites follow around a central body due to the force of gravity. These orbits can be circular, elliptical, or parabolic, depending on the satellite's velocity and the gravitational pull of the central body.

##### Circular Orbits

A satellite in a circular orbit has a constant distance from the central body. The orbit is defined by the satellite's velocity and the gravitational parameter of the central body. The velocity of a satellite in a circular orbit is given by the equation:

$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{G M}{r}}
$$

where $v$ is the velocity of the satellite, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the central body, and $r$ is the radius of the orbit.

##### Elliptical Orbits

An elliptical orbit is defined by the semi-major axis of the ellipse, the eccentricity of the orbit, and the longitude of the periapsis. The semi-major axis is the longest diameter of the ellipse and is a measure of the size of the orbit. The eccentricity is a measure of the shape of the orbit, with an eccentricity of 0 indicating a circular orbit and an eccentricity greater than 0 indicating an elliptical orbit. The longitude of the periapsis is the angle between the vernal equinox and the point on the orbit where the satellite is closest to the central body.

The velocity of a satellite in an elliptical orbit is given by the equation:

$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{G M}{2 a (1 - e \cos E)}}
$$

where $v$ is the velocity of the satellite, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the central body, $a$ is the semi-major axis of the orbit, $e$ is the eccentricity of the orbit, and $E$ is the true anomaly, which is the angle between the periapsis and the current position of the satellite.

##### Parabolic Orbits

A parabolic orbit is a special case of an elliptical orbit where the eccentricity is 1. In a parabolic orbit, the satellite's velocity is equal to the square root of the product of the gravitational parameter of the central body and the radius of the orbit. The orbit is defined by the semi-latus rectum, which is half the length of the latus rectum, a line segment that is perpendicular to the major axis of the parabola.

The velocity of a satellite in a parabolic orbit is given by the equation:

$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{G M}{p}}
$$

where $v$ is the velocity of the satellite, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the central body, and $p$ is the semi-latus rectum.

Understanding the different types of orbits and how to calculate their properties is crucial for anyone working in the field of satellite engineering. These calculations are used to design and operate satellite systems, including satellite communication, navigation, and remote sensing.




#### 2.1b Orbital Elements

Orbital elements are a set of six parameters that define the shape, size, and orientation of a satellite's orbit. These elements are used to describe the orbit of a satellite in space. They are as follows:

1. Semi-major axis ($a$) - This is the longest diameter of the ellipse and is a measure of the size of the orbit.
2. Eccentricity ($e$) - This is a measure of how much the orbit deviates from a perfect circle. An eccentricity of 0 indicates a circular orbit, while an eccentricity greater than 0 indicates an elliptical orbit.
3. Inclination ($i$) - This is the angle between the orbital plane and the equatorial plane of the central body.
4. Longitude of the ascending node ($\Omega$) - This is the angle between the vernal equinox and the ascending node, which is the point on the orbit where the satellite crosses the equatorial plane from south to north.
5. Argument of periapsis ($\omega$) - This is the angle between the ascending node and the periapsis, which is the point on the orbit where the satellite is closest to the central body.
6. True anomaly ($f$) - This is the angle between the periapsis and the satellite's current position on the orbit.

These elements are used to solve the two-body problem and predict the motion of a satellite in orbit. They are also used to calculate other important parameters such as the orbital period and the true anomaly at any given time.

In the next section, we will explore how these orbital elements are used in the calculation of the orbit of a satellite.

#### 2.1c Orbital Maneuvers

Orbital maneuvers are the set of actions taken to modify the orbit of a satellite. These maneuvers are necessary to achieve various objectives such as changing the orbit, raising the orbit, or deorbiting a satellite. The most common type of orbital maneuver is the Hohmann transfer orbit, which is used to change the orbit of a satellite from one circular orbit to another.

The Hohmann transfer orbit is named after Walter Hohmann, who first described it in 1925. It involves two engine burns: one to raise the orbit of the satellite and another to circularize the orbit at the desired altitude. The first burn is performed in the plane of the original orbit, and the second burn is performed in the plane of the new orbit. The two burns are timed so that the satellite's orbit intersects the plane of the new orbit at the desired point.

The Hohmann transfer orbit is the most efficient way to change the orbit of a satellite. It requires the least amount of propellant and the shortest amount of time. However, it is not always possible to perform a Hohmann transfer orbit. For example, if the satellite's orbit is highly elliptical, the transfer orbit may not exist.

Other types of orbital maneuvers include the bi-elliptic transfer orbit, which is used to change the orbit of a satellite from one elliptical orbit to another, and the orbital inclination change, which is used to change the inclination of a satellite's orbit.

In the next section, we will explore the equations and calculations used to perform these orbital maneuvers.

#### 2.1d Orbital Debris

Orbital debris, also known as space debris, is a significant concern in the field of satellite engineering. These are man-made objects in space that no longer serve a useful purpose and are no longer under active control. They can range from defunct satellites and rocket stages to fragments from explosions or collisions in space.

The problem of orbital debris is twofold. First, these objects can pose a threat to active satellites and spacecraft. If a satellite or spacecraft collides with orbital debris, it can cause catastrophic damage, potentially rendering the satellite or spacecraft inoperable. Second, orbital debris can contribute to the growing problem of space clutter, which can interfere with satellite communications and navigation systems.

The issue of orbital debris has become increasingly important as the number of satellites and spacecraft in orbit has increased. According to the European Space Agency, there are currently over 1,000 active satellites in orbit, and the number is expected to increase in the coming years.

The United States Space Surveillance Network tracks over 23,000 pieces of orbital debris larger than 10 centimeters in diameter. These objects can remain in orbit for decades or even centuries, posing a long-term threat to active satellites and spacecraft.

The problem of orbital debris is not just a theoretical concern. In 2009, the Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251 satellites collided in orbit, creating over 2,000 pieces of orbital debris. This collision highlighted the need for more stringent regulations and guidelines for the disposal of defunct satellites and spacecraft.

In the next section, we will explore the various methods and technologies used to track and monitor orbital debris.

#### 2.1e Orbital Resonances

Orbital resonances are a phenomenon that can occur when two satellites orbiting the same central body have a specific ratio of their orbital periods. This ratio is known as the resonance ratio. If the resonance ratio is a rational number, the two satellites can enter into a state of orbital resonance.

The most common type of orbital resonance is the 2:1 resonance, where the orbital period of one satellite is twice that of the other. This type of resonance is particularly interesting because it can lead to the formation of stable orbital configurations known as Lissajous orbits.

Lissajous orbits are named after the French mathematician Jules Henri Poincaré, who first described them in 1895. They are a type of quasi-periodic orbit that can occur when two satellites are in a 2:1 orbital resonance. The orbits of the two satellites intersect at regular intervals, forming a closed loop.

The existence of Lissajous orbits has important implications for satellite engineering. For example, they can be used to stabilize the orbits of satellites, reducing the need for frequent orbital maneuvers. They can also be used to create satellite constellations with specific coverage patterns.

The study of orbital resonances and Lissajous orbits is an active area of research in satellite engineering. It involves the use of advanced mathematical techniques, including the theory of dynamical systems and the method of multiple scales.

In the next section, we will explore the equations and calculations used to study orbital resonances and Lissajous orbits.

#### 2.1f Orbital Perturbations

Orbital perturbations are small changes in the orbit of a satellite caused by various factors such as atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure, and gravitational effects from other celestial bodies. These perturbations can accumulate over time and can significantly affect the orbit of a satellite.

Atmospheric drag is a major source of orbital perturbations. As a satellite orbits the Earth, it moves through different layers of the Earth's atmosphere. The molecules in the atmosphere exert a small force on the satellite, which can cause the satellite to slow down and lose altitude. This effect is more pronounced for satellites in lower orbits.

Solar radiation pressure is another important source of orbital perturbations. The Sun exerts a small force on a satellite due to the pressure of the solar radiation. This force can cause the satellite to accelerate or decelerate, depending on whether the satellite is facing the Sun or away from the Sun.

Gravitational effects from other celestial bodies can also cause orbital perturbations. For example, the gravitational pull of the Moon can cause small changes in the orbit of a satellite around the Earth. These effects are typically very small, but they can accumulate over time and can cause significant changes in the orbit of a satellite.

The study of orbital perturbations is a crucial aspect of satellite engineering. It involves the use of advanced mathematical techniques, including the theory of dynamical systems and the method of multiple scales. The equations used to describe orbital perturbations are often nonlinear and can be difficult to solve analytically. Therefore, numerical methods are often used to study these equations.

In the next section, we will explore the equations and calculations used to study orbital perturbations.

#### 2.1g Orbital Decay

Orbital decay, also known as atmospheric drag, is a natural process that affects the orbits of satellites and other objects in space. It is caused by the interaction of the object with the Earth's atmosphere, which exerts a small force on the object. This force is due to the atmospheric molecules colliding with the object and imparting momentum to it.

The rate of orbital decay is dependent on several factors, including the altitude of the object, the density of the atmosphere at that altitude, and the shape and surface properties of the object. Generally, objects in lower orbits experience more significant orbital decay due to the higher density of the atmosphere at lower altitudes.

The equation for orbital decay is given by:

$$
\frac{dv}{dt} = -\frac{1}{m} \int_{A} \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 C_d A dA
$$

where $v$ is the relative velocity of the object with respect to the atmosphere, $m$ is the mass of the object, $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the object, $\rho$ is the density of the atmosphere, $v$ is the velocity of the atmospheric molecules, $C_d$ is the drag coefficient, and $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the object.

The integral is taken over the entire surface of the object. The drag coefficient $C_d$ is a dimensionless quantity that depends on the shape and surface properties of the object. It is typically determined experimentally.

The equation for orbital decay can be used to calculate the change in velocity of an object over time due to atmospheric drag. This change in velocity is directly related to the change in the object's orbit.

Orbital decay is a significant concern in satellite engineering. It can lead to the deorbiting of satellites, which can pose a risk to other satellites and spacecraft. Therefore, it is essential to consider orbital decay when designing and operating satellites.

In the next section, we will explore the methods used to mitigate orbital decay and extend the lifetime of satellites.

In the next section, we will explore the equations and calculations used to study orbital resonances and Lissajous orbits.

#### 2.1t Orbital Debris

Orbital debris, also known as space debris, is a significant concern in satellite engineering. These are man-made objects in space that are no longer in use and are not under active control. They can range from defunct satellites and rocket stages to fragments from explosions or collisions in space.

The problem of orbital debris is twofold. First, these objects can pose a threat to active satellites and spacecraft. If a satellite or spacecraft collides with orbital debris, it can cause catastrophic damage, potentially rendering the satellite or spacecraft inoperable. Second, orbital debris can contribute to the growing problem of space clutter, which can interfere with satellite communications and navigation systems.

The issue of orbital debris has become increasingly important as the number of satellites and spacecraft in orbit has increased. According to the European Space Agency, there are currently over 1,000 active satellites in orbit, and the number is expected to increase in the coming years.

The United States Space Surveillance Network tracks over 23,000 pieces of orbital debris larger than 10 centimeters in diameter. These objects can remain in orbit for decades or even centuries, posing a long-term threat to active satellites and spacecraft.

The problem of orbital debris is not just a theoretical concern. In 2009, the Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251 satellites collided in orbit, creating over 2,000 pieces of orbital debris. This collision highlighted the need for more stringent regulations and guidelines for the disposal of defunct satellites and spacecraft.

In the next section, we will explore the various methods and technologies used to track and monitor orbital debris.

#### 2.1u Orbital Maneuvers

Orbital maneuvers are the set of actions taken to modify the orbit of a satellite. These maneuvers are necessary to achieve various objectives such as changing the orbit, raising the orbit, or deorbiting a satellite. The most common type of orbital maneuver is the Hohmann transfer orbit, which is used to change the orbit of a satellite from one circular orbit to another.

The Hohmann transfer orbit is named after Walter Hohmann, who first described it in 1925. It involves two engine burns: one to raise the orbit of the satellite and another to circularize the orbit at the desired altitude. The first burn is performed in the plane of the original orbit, and the second burn is performed in the plane of the new orbit. The two burns are timed so that the satellite's orbit intersects the plane of the new orbit at the desired point.

The Hohmann transfer orbit is the most efficient way to change the orbit of a satellite. It requires the least amount of propellant and the shortest amount of time. However, it is not always possible to perform a Hohmann transfer orbit. For example, if the satellite's orbit is highly elliptical, the transfer orbit may not exist.

Other types of orbital maneuvers include the bi-elliptic transfer orbit, which is used to change the orbit of a satellite from one elliptical orbit to another, and the orbital inclination change, which is used to change the inclination of a satellite's orbit.

In the next section, we will explore the equations and calculations used to perform these orbital maneuvers.

#### 2.1v Orbital Resonances

Orbital resonances are a phenomenon that can occur when two satellites orbiting the same central body have a specific ratio of their orbital periods. This ratio is known as the resonance ratio. If the resonance ratio is a rational number, the two satellites can enter into a state of orbital resonance.

The most common type of orbital resonance is the 2:1 resonance, where the orbital period of one satellite is twice that of the other. This type of resonance is particularly interesting because it can lead to the formation of stable orbital configurations known as Lissajous orbits.

Lissajous orbits are named after the French mathematician Jules Henri Poincaré, who first described them in 1895. They are a type of quasi-periodic orbit that can occur when two satellites are in a 2:1 orbital resonance. The orbits of the two satellites intersect at regular intervals, forming a closed loop.

The existence of Lissajous orbits has important implications for satellite engineering. For example, they can be used to stabilize the orbits of satellites, reducing the need for frequent orbital maneuvers. They can also be used to create satellite constellations with specific coverage patterns.

The study of orbital resonances and Lissajous orbits is an active area of research in satellite engineering. It involves the use of advanced mathematical techniques, including the theory of dynamical systems and the method of multiple scales.

In the next section, we will explore the equations and calculations used to study orbital resonances and Lissajous orbits.

#### 2.1w Orbital Debris

#### 2.1c Orbital Maneuvers

Orbital maneuvers are the set of actions taken to modify the orbit of a satellite. These maneuvers are necessary to achieve various objectives such as changing the orbit, raising the orbit, or deorbiting a satellite. The most common type of orbital maneuver is the Hohmann transfer orbit, which is used to change the orbit of a satellite from one circular orbit to another.

The Hohmann transfer orbit is named after Walter Hohmann, a German mathematician who first described the maneuver in 1925. The maneuver involves two engine burns, one at the beginning of the maneuver and one at the end. The first burn is used to raise the satellite's orbit to a higher altitude, and the second burn is used to change the orbit's inclination.

The Hohmann transfer orbit is a semi-major axis transfer, meaning that the semi-major axis of the initial and final orbits are equal. This results in the transfer orbit having the same period as the initial and final orbits. The transfer orbit is also an elliptical orbit, with the periapsis of the initial orbit as its periapsis and the apoapsis of the final orbit as its apoapsis.

The Hohmann transfer orbit is not always possible, especially for satellites in highly elliptical orbits. In these cases, other types of orbital maneuvers may be necessary, such as the bi-elliptic transfer orbit or the orbital inclination change maneuver.

The orbital inclination change maneuver is used to change the inclination of a satellite's orbit. This maneuver involves two engine burns, one at the beginning of the maneuver and one at the end. The first burn is used to raise the satellite's orbit to a higher altitude, and the second burn is used to change the orbit's inclination.

The orbital inclination change maneuver is a bi-elliptic transfer, meaning that the semi-major axis of the initial and final orbits are not equal. This results in the transfer orbit having a different period than the initial and final orbits. The transfer orbit is also an elliptical orbit, with the periapsis of the initial orbit as its periapsis and the apoapsis of the final orbit as its apoapsis.

The orbital inclination change maneuver is not always possible, especially for satellites in highly elliptical orbits. In these cases, other types of orbital maneuvers may be necessary, such as the Hohmann transfer orbit or the bi-elliptic transfer orbit.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of orbital resonance and its implications for satellite engineering.

Welcome to Chapter 3 of "Satellite Engineering: A Comprehensive Guide". In this chapter, we will be discussing the crucial topic of spacecraft power systems. As we delve deeper into the world of satellite engineering, it is important to understand the fundamental principles and components that make up the power systems of these spacecraft.

The power system of a satellite is responsible for providing the necessary energy to operate the various subsystems and components of the spacecraft. This includes everything from communication systems, navigation, and attitude control to scientific instruments and payloads. Without a reliable and efficient power system, a satellite would not be able to function and fulfill its intended purpose.

In this chapter, we will explore the different types of power systems used in satellites, their components, and their functions. We will also discuss the challenges and considerations that engineers face when designing and implementing these systems. By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of spacecraft power systems and their role in satellite engineering.

So, let's embark on this journey to uncover the inner workings of spacecraft power systems and their crucial role in satellite engineering. 


## Chapter 3: Spacecraft Power Systems:




### Section: 3.1 SMAD, sec. 11.4: Power Generation in Spacecraft

#### 3.1a Power Generation in Spacecraft

Power generation is a crucial aspect of spacecraft design, as it provides the necessary energy to operate the various subsystems and components of the spacecraft. In this section, we will discuss the different methods of power generation used in spacecraft, with a focus on solar arrays.

Solar arrays are the most commonly used method of power generation in spacecraft. They are composed of solar cells, which convert sunlight into electricity. The International Space Station (ISS) is a prime example of a spacecraft that uses solar arrays for power generation. The Russian segment of the station uses 28 V low voltage DC from two rotating solar arrays, while the USOS uses 130–180 V DC from the USOS PV array. These arrays are arranged as four wing pairs, with a total production of 75 to 90 kilowatts.

One of the key advantages of using solar arrays is their ability to track the Sun and maximize power generation. This is achieved through the use of gimbals, which allow the arrays to rotate and follow the Sun's movement. However, this also presents a challenge, as the arrays must be designed to withstand the significant aerodynamic drag at the station's relatively low orbital altitude. To address this, the ISS uses a Night Glider mode, where the solar arrays are aligned parallel to the ground at night to reduce drag.

In addition to solar arrays, other methods of power generation are also used in spacecraft. These include nuclear power sources, such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), and fuel cells. Each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of power generation method depends on the specific mission requirements and constraints.

In the next section, we will discuss the power distribution and management systems used in spacecraft, which are responsible for distributing and managing the power generated by these various methods. 





### Section: 3.1 SMAD, sec. 11.4: Power Distribution

#### 3.1b Power Distribution

Power distribution is a critical aspect of spacecraft design, as it involves the management and distribution of power generated by various sources, such as solar arrays, nuclear power sources, and fuel cells. The power distribution system is responsible for ensuring that all components of the spacecraft receive the necessary power to function effectively.

One of the key challenges in power distribution is the management of power consumption. As spacecraft are often equipped with a variety of subsystems and components, each with varying power requirements, it is essential to have a system in place to manage and allocate power efficiently. This is achieved through the use of power distribution units (PDUs), which are responsible for receiving power from the primary power source and distributing it to the various subsystems and components of the spacecraft.

PDUs are designed to handle the power requirements of different subsystems and components, ensuring that each receives the necessary power. They are also equipped with protection circuits to prevent overcurrent and short-circuit conditions, which can damage the spacecraft and its components.

In addition to managing power consumption, PDUs also play a crucial role in power distribution during spacecraft maneuvers. For instance, during a spacecraft's orbit raising phase, the power requirements of the spacecraft's propulsion system increase significantly. PDUs are designed to handle these increased power demands, ensuring that the spacecraft's propulsion system receives the necessary power to perform the maneuver successfully.

Furthermore, PDUs are also responsible for power distribution during spacecraft recharging. As spacecraft often rely on solar arrays for power generation, they must be equipped with recharging capabilities to store power for use during periods of eclipse or when the solar arrays are not in direct sunlight. PDUs play a crucial role in this process, ensuring that power is efficiently distributed to the various components of the spacecraft during recharging.

In conclusion, power distribution is a critical aspect of spacecraft design, and PDUs play a crucial role in managing and distributing power efficiently. As spacecraft technology continues to advance, the design and capabilities of PDUs will also evolve to meet the increasing power requirements of these complex systems.





### Section: 3.1 SMAD, sec. 11.4: Power Storage

Power storage is a critical aspect of spacecraft design, as it involves the management and storage of power generated by various sources, such as solar arrays, nuclear power sources, and fuel cells. The power storage system is responsible for storing excess power generated by the spacecraft's power sources for later use.

One of the key challenges in power storage is the management of power consumption. As spacecraft are often equipped with a variety of subsystems and components, each with varying power requirements, it is essential to have a system in place to manage and allocate power efficiently. This is achieved through the use of power storage units (PSUs), which are responsible for storing excess power generated by the spacecraft's power sources.

PSUs are designed to handle the power requirements of different subsystems and components, ensuring that each receives the necessary power. They are also equipped with protection circuits to prevent overcurrent and short-circuit conditions, which can damage the spacecraft and its components.

In addition to managing power consumption, PSUs also play a crucial role in power storage during spacecraft maneuvers. For instance, during a spacecraft's orbit raising phase, the power requirements of the spacecraft's propulsion system increase significantly. PSUs are designed to handle these increased power demands, ensuring that the spacecraft's propulsion system receives the necessary power to perform the maneuver successfully.

Furthermore, PSUs are also responsible for power storage during spacecraft recharging. As spacecraft often rely on solar arrays for power generation, they must be equipped with recharging capabilities to store power for use during periods of eclipse or when the solar arrays are not in direct sunlight. PSUs are designed to handle these power storage requirements, ensuring that the spacecraft has enough power to operate effectively.

### Introduction

Welcome to Chapter 4 of "Satellite Engineering: A Comprehensive Guide". In this chapter, we will be discussing the crucial aspect of satellite engineering - propulsion. Propulsion is the driving force behind any satellite, enabling it to move and maintain its orbit. Without proper propulsion, a satellite would quickly lose its altitude and eventually fall back to Earth.

In this chapter, we will delve into the various types of propulsion systems used in satellite engineering. We will explore the principles behind these systems, their design considerations, and their applications in different types of satellites. We will also discuss the challenges faced in propulsion systems and the ongoing research and developments in this field.

Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field of satellite engineering, this chapter will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of propulsion systems. It will serve as a valuable resource for anyone looking to gain knowledge about this critical aspect of satellite engineering.

So, let's embark on this journey to explore the fascinating world of satellite propulsion.




### Section: 4.1a Basics of Propulsion

Propulsion is the driving force behind any satellite, enabling it to move and maintain its orbit. In this section, we will discuss the basics of propulsion, including the principles behind propulsion systems, their design considerations, and their applications in different types of satellites.

#### 4.1a.1 Principles of Propulsion

Propulsion systems work on the principle of Newton's third law of motion, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In the context of satellite propulsion, the action is the expulsion of a fluid (usually a gas) from the satellite, and the reaction is the resulting thrust that propels the satellite forward.

The thrust generated by a propulsion system is given by Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object times its acceleration. In the case of satellite propulsion, the mass of the object is the mass of the propellant, and the acceleration is the change in velocity of the propellant.

#### 4.1a.2 Design Considerations

When designing a propulsion system for a satellite, several factors need to be considered. These include the type of propellant, the thrust required, the specific impulse, and the overall efficiency of the system.

The type of propellant used in a propulsion system can greatly affect its performance. Common types of propellants include monopropellants, bipropellants, and solid propellants. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of propellant depends on the specific requirements of the satellite.

The thrust required by a satellite is determined by its mass and the desired change in velocity. The specific impulse, which is a measure of the efficiency of a propulsion system, is also an important consideration. A higher specific impulse means a more efficient system.

Finally, the overall efficiency of a propulsion system is a critical factor. The efficiency of a propulsion system is determined by the ratio of the thrust generated to the mass of the propellant expelled. A more efficient system means less propellant is needed to generate a given amount of thrust, which can greatly reduce the cost and complexity of the satellite.

#### 4.1a.3 Applications in Satellite Engineering

Propulsion systems are used in a variety of satellite applications, including communication satellites, navigation satellites, and scientific satellites. In communication satellites, propulsion systems are used to maintain the satellite's orbit and to adjust its position to provide coverage over a specific area. In navigation satellites, propulsion systems are used to maintain the satellite's orbit and to adjust its position to provide accurate navigation data. In scientific satellites, propulsion systems are used to perform maneuvers for scientific experiments or to deorbit the satellite at the end of its mission.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the different types of propulsion systems used in satellite engineering, including chemical rockets, electric propulsion systems, and ion engines.




### Section: 4.1 SMAD, ch. 17:

#### 4.1b Propulsion Systems

Propulsion systems are the heart of any satellite, providing the necessary thrust to maintain its orbit and perform maneuvers. These systems are designed to operate in the harsh conditions of space, where extreme temperatures, vacuum, and radiation can pose significant challenges.

#### 4.1b.1 Types of Propulsion Systems

There are several types of propulsion systems used in satellite engineering, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. These include chemical rockets, electric propulsion systems, and nuclear propulsion.

Chemical rockets, such as the Saturn V and the Space Shuttle's solid rocket boosters, use a chemical reaction to generate thrust. These rockets are powerful and can provide a large amount of thrust, but they are also expensive and require a significant amount of propellant.

Electric propulsion systems, on the other hand, use electric energy to accelerate ions or plasma to high velocities. These systems are more efficient than chemical rockets, but they are also slower and require more power.

Nuclear propulsion, while still in the experimental stage, offers the potential for extremely high thrust and efficiency. However, it also poses significant safety concerns and is not yet widely used in satellite propulsion.

#### 4.1b.2 Propulsion System Design

The design of a propulsion system is a complex process that involves careful consideration of various factors. These include the type of propellant, the thrust required, the specific impulse, and the overall efficiency of the system.

The type of propellant used in a propulsion system can greatly affect its performance. Common types of propellants include monopropellants, bipropellants, and solid propellants. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of propellant depends on the specific requirements of the satellite.

The thrust required by a satellite is determined by its mass and the desired change in velocity. The specific impulse, which is a measure of the efficiency of a propulsion system, is also an important consideration. A higher specific impulse means a more efficient system.

The overall efficiency of a propulsion system is a critical factor. The efficiency of a propulsion system is determined by the ratio of the thrust generated by the system to the power input. A more efficient system will generate more thrust for a given amount of power.

#### 4.1b.3 Propulsion System Applications

Propulsion systems have a wide range of applications in satellite engineering. They are used to maintain orbit, perform maneuvers, and deorbit satellites at the end of their operational life.

In addition, propulsion systems are also used in spacecraft for deep space missions, such as the Voyager and Pioneer spacecraft. These spacecraft use propulsion systems to escape the gravitational pull of the Earth and reach the outer reaches of the solar system.

#### 4.1b.4 Future Developments in Propulsion Systems

As satellite technology continues to advance, there are ongoing efforts to develop more efficient and powerful propulsion systems. These include the development of advanced electric propulsion systems, such as the Hall effect thruster and the plasma thruster, and the exploration of new propulsion technologies, such as solar electric propulsion and laser propulsion.

In addition, there is also ongoing research into the use of nuclear propulsion for satellite applications. While still in the early stages, this technology could offer the potential for extremely high thrust and efficiency, making it a promising area of research for the future of satellite propulsion.

#### 4.1c Propulsion Techniques

Propulsion techniques are the methods used to generate thrust and propel a satellite in space. These techniques can be broadly categorized into two types: chemical propulsion and electric propulsion.

#### 4.1c.1 Chemical Propulsion

Chemical propulsion is the most commonly used technique for satellite propulsion. It involves the use of a chemical reaction to generate thrust. The most common type of chemical propulsion is the rocket engine, which uses a combination of fuel and oxidizer to produce a high-speed exhaust. The thrust is generated by the difference in momentum between the exhaust and the surrounding medium.

Chemical propulsion is a powerful technique, capable of generating large amounts of thrust. However, it is also expensive and requires a significant amount of propellant. This makes it less suitable for long-term satellite operations.

#### 4.1c.2 Electric Propulsion

Electric propulsion is a more efficient alternative to chemical propulsion. It uses electric energy to accelerate ions or plasma to high velocities, generating thrust. This technique is particularly useful for satellites that require precise control and maneuvering.

Electric propulsion systems can be further categorized into two types: electrothermal and electrostatic. Electrothermal systems, such as the Hall effect thruster, use electric current to heat a gas and generate thrust. Electrostatic systems, such as the ion engine, use electric fields to accelerate ions.

Electric propulsion systems are more efficient than chemical propulsion, but they are also slower. This makes them more suitable for long-term satellite operations, where fuel consumption is a major concern.

#### 4.1c.3 Propulsion Technique Selection

The selection of a propulsion technique depends on the specific requirements of the satellite. For short-term missions with high thrust requirements, chemical propulsion may be the best option. For long-term missions with precise control and fuel efficiency, electric propulsion may be more suitable.

In addition to these two main categories, there are also emerging propulsion techniques, such as solar electric propulsion and nuclear propulsion. These techniques offer the potential for even greater efficiency and thrust, but they also come with their own set of challenges and limitations.

As satellite technology continues to advance, it is likely that new propulsion techniques will be developed, further expanding the options for satellite propulsion.

The extreme temperatures of space can also have a significant impact on satellites. The wide temperature range can cause thermal stress on satellite components, leading to material fatigue and failure. This can reduce the lifespan of a satellite and potentially compromise its mission.

Temperature can also affect the performance of satellite components. For example, the efficiency of solar panels, which are crucial for powering satellites, can decrease at low temperatures. This can lead to power shortages and system failures.

#### 5.1b.3 Atmospheric Effects

The Earth's atmosphere can also pose challenges for satellites. The atmosphere is not uniform, and its density and composition can vary significantly depending on altitude and location. This can affect the performance of satellite systems, particularly those that rely on atmospheric drag for orbital maneuvers.

The atmosphere can also cause signal interference, which can affect satellite communications. This can be particularly problematic for satellites that rely on radio frequency communications for their operations.

In conclusion, the space environment is a harsh and unforgiving place for satellites. Engineers must consider the effects of radiation, temperature, and the atmosphere when designing and operating satellites. By understanding and accounting for these effects, engineers can ensure the successful operation of satellites in the challenging environment of space.





### Section: 5.1c Protection from Space Environment

The harsh conditions of space pose significant challenges to satellite design and operation. However, engineers have developed various strategies to protect satellites from the effects of the space environment.

#### 5.1c.1 Radiation Protection

To mitigate the effects of radiation, satellite designers often employ techniques such as shielding and error correction. Shielding involves using materials that absorb or deflect radiation, such as aluminum or titanium, to protect sensitive components. Error correction algorithms can also be implemented to detect and correct bit flips caused by radiation.

#### 5.1c.2 Temperature Control

To manage temperature effects, satellites often include thermal control systems. These systems can include heaters to warm components at low temperatures and radiators to dissipate heat at high temperatures. Additionally, satellite designers can optimize the satellite's design to minimize thermal stress.

#### 5.1c.3 Atmospheric Protection

To protect against atmospheric effects, satellites can be designed to operate at altitudes where the atmosphere is thinner and less variable. Additionally, satellite designers can incorporate atmospheric models into their software to account for variations in atmospheric density and composition.

#### 5.1c.4 Signal Protection

To protect against signal interference, satellites can be equipped with error correction algorithms and multiple antennas. These techniques can help detect and correct errors caused by signal interference, ensuring reliable communication.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the various types of orbits that satellites can take. Orbits are the paths that satellites follow around a central body, such as the Earth. The type of orbit that a satellite takes depends on its purpose and the characteristics of the central body. There are three main types of orbits: circular, elliptical, and geostationary. Each type has its own unique properties and advantages.

Circular orbits are the simplest type of orbit. In a circular orbit, the satellite travels around the central body at a constant distance. This type of orbit is commonly used for communication satellites, as it allows for a constant distance between the satellite and the Earth's surface.

Elliptical orbits are more complex than circular orbits. In an elliptical orbit, the satellite travels around the central body along an elliptical path. This type of orbit is commonly used for weather satellites, as it allows for a wider coverage area.

Geostationary orbits are the most complex type of orbit. In a geostationary orbit, the satellite remains at a fixed point in the sky above a specific location on the Earth's surface. This type of orbit is commonly used for broadcasting and communication satellites, as it allows for a constant position in the sky.

In this chapter, we will delve deeper into each type of orbit and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. We will also explore the equations and calculations used to determine the properties of these orbits. By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the different types of orbits and their applications in satellite engineering.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the various types of orbits that satellites can take. Orbits are the paths that satellites follow around a central body, such as the Earth. The type of orbit that a satellite takes depends on its purpose and the characteristics of the central body. There are three main types of orbits: circular, elliptical, and geostationary. Each type has its own unique properties and advantages.

Circular orbits are the simplest type of orbit. In a circular orbit, the satellite travels around the central body at a constant distance. This type of orbit is commonly used for communication satellites, as it allows for a constant distance between the satellite and the Earth's surface.

Elliptical orbits are more complex than circular orbits. In an elliptical orbit, the satellite travels around the central body along an elliptical path. This type of orbit is commonly used for weather satellites, as it allows for a wider coverage area.

Geostationary orbits are the most complex type of orbit. In a geostationary orbit, the satellite remains at a fixed point in the sky above a specific location on the Earth's surface. This type of orbit is commonly used for broadcasting and communication satellites, as it allows for a constant position in the sky.

In this chapter, we will delve deeper into each type of orbit and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. We will also explore the equations and calculations used to determine the properties of these orbits. By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the different types of orbits and their applications in satellite engineering.

#### 12.1a Techsat 21 Overview

Techsat 21 is a satellite designed for advanced research and development in the field of satellite engineering. It is a follow-up to the successful Techsat 19 mission and is part of the larger Techsat series of satellites. The primary objective of Techsat 21 is to study and validate advanced technologies and concepts for future satellite missions.

Techsat 21 is a 3-axis stabilized satellite with a prismatic body divided into two hemispheres. Each hemisphere has its own hexagonal base and six trapezoidal sides, giving the satellite an overall structure that resembles a sphere. The satellite measures 600 mm from base to base with a maximum radius of 540 mm. The majority of its surface is covered with GaAs/Ge solar panels, which provide an average of 17 W of power to the satellite. In addition, the satellite also carries Lithium-ion batteries capable of providing 4.8 Ah of energy for operations without direct sunlight.

The internal structure of Techsat 21 is accessible by separating the two "hemispheres" joined by a central hexagon bus. This bus connects all the subsystems of the satellite, including the OBDH (On-Board Data Handling), PDU (Power Distribution Unit), RF communications, and ACS (Attitude Control Subsystem). The OBDH provides all spacecraft control, processing power, and interfacing, based on a DragonBall MC68332 microcontroller with 4 MB of storage capacity, 8 kB PROM, 512 kB EEPROM, and 768 kB of protected RAM. The PDU is responsible for distributing power to the different subsystems, while the RF communications subsystem employs 4 omnidirectional antennas for communication with ground stations. The ACS uses solar cells and a magnetometer to determine the satellite's attitude and provide spin stability.

To keep the weight of the satellite to a minimum, INTA, in cooperation with ESA, developed an experimental replacement for traditional wiring using optical infrared arrays, known as OWLS. This technology was used to exchange data between the different modules of the satellite, reducing the overall weight of the satellite to about 19 kg. The satellite is expected to have a service life of 3 years, but most of its subsystems remained operational for 4 years.

In the next section, we will explore the principles and techniques behind formation flight and minimum energy trajectories for Techsat 21 Earth orbiting clusters. We will also discuss the challenges and considerations involved in implementing these concepts in satellite engineering.

This is achieved by taking advantage of the conservation of angular momentum and the conservation of energy principles.

The minimum energy transfer orbit is an elliptical orbit that touches the two circular orbits at two points, known as the periapsis and apoapsis. The periapsis is the point of closest approach to the first circular orbit, while the apoapsis is the point of farthest approach to the second circular orbit.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the complex and fascinating world of satellite engineering, specifically focusing on the design and implementation of a Visible Geosynchronous Earth Imager (VGEI). This satellite, designed to capture high-resolution images of the Earth's surface, presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities for engineers.

The VGEI is designed to operate in a geosynchronous orbit, a highly elliptical orbit that allows the satellite to remain over the same point on the Earth's surface at all times. This presents a unique set of challenges for trajectory design, as we will explore in this chapter.

We will begin by discussing the basic principles of satellite trajectory design, including the use of Kepler's laws and the two-body problem. We will then move on to more advanced topics, such as the use of orbital maneuvers and the effects of atmospheric drag on satellite trajectories.

Throughout this chapter, we will use the popular Markdown format to present our content, with math equations rendered using the MathJax library. This will allow us to present complex mathematical concepts in a clear and understandable manner.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the principles and techniques used in the design of satellite trajectories for the VGEI. This knowledge will serve as a solid foundation for the rest of the book, as we delve deeper into the various aspects of satellite engineering.




#### 13.1a Geosynchronous Earth Imager

The Visible Geosynchronous Earth Imager (VGEI) is a satellite designed to capture high-resolution images of the Earth's surface. It operates in a geosynchronous orbit, a highly elliptical orbit that allows the satellite to remain over the same point on the Earth's surface at all times. This unique orbit presents a set of challenges and opportunities for trajectory design.

#### 13.1b Trajectory Design for the Visible Geosynchronous Earth Imager

The trajectory design for the VGEI is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of orbital mechanics and satellite dynamics. The satellite's geosynchronous orbit presents a unique set of challenges, including the need for precise orbital maneuvers and the effects of atmospheric drag.

#### 13.1c Orbital Maneuvers for the Visible Geosynchronous Earth Imager

Orbital maneuvers are essential for maintaining the VGEI's geosynchronous orbit. These maneuvers involve adjusting the satellite's velocity and direction to compensate for the effects of atmospheric drag and to maintain the desired orbit. The Hohmann transfer orbit, a type of orbital maneuver, is often used for these purposes.

#### 13.1d Atmospheric Drag and its Effects on the Visible Geosynchronous Earth Imager

Atmospheric drag is a significant factor in the trajectory design for the VGEI. The satellite's high altitude and low orbital inclination make it susceptible to atmospheric drag, which can cause the satellite's orbit to decay over time. This requires regular orbital maneuvers to maintain the desired orbit.

#### 13.1e Spectral Coverage and Resolution of the Visible Geosynchronous Earth Imager

The VGEI uses 128 spectral bands from approximately 353 nm to 1080 nm wavelengths at 5.7 nm spectral resolution. Data from wavelengths less than 400 nm and greater than 900 nm are not recommended for analysis. The sensor has high sensitivity in the blue wavelengths and full coverage of water-penetrating wavelengths.

#### 13.1f Spatial Coverage and Resolution of the Visible Geosynchronous Earth Imager

The VGEI pixels are approximately 90 meters in spatial resolution. Each full scene covers approximately a 42 by 192 km rectangle, varying with altitude and angle. High latitude regions of the earth are not covered. The ISS accomplishes about sixteen 90-minute orbits per day, and the location of the track for orbit moves to the west as earth rotates. The ISS orbit tracks over the same area on the ground about every three days, including nighttime overpasses. However, VGEI imaging was limited to collect only one scene per orbit, resulting in about seven to eight daylight scenes per day, often spatially scattered throughout the world.

#### 13.1g Radiometric Resolution of the Visible Geosynchronous Earth Imager

The VGEI data have a signal-to-noise ratio of greater than 200-to-1 for water-penetrating wavelengths and assuming 5% albedo. The sensor had high sensitivity in the blue wavelengths and full coverage of water-penetrating wavelengths.

#### 13.1h Temporal Coverage and Resolution of the Visible Geosynchronous Earth Imager

The VGEI collected satellite imagery from September 25, 2009, to September 13, 2014. A maximum of eight daylight scenes were collected per day. In any specific coastal region where scenes were imaged, temporal resolution is patchy. For example, over Chesapeake Bay on the United States east coast, 101 scenes were collected over the entire 5-year mission, and 16 scenes were imaged during the calendar year 2012.

#### 13.1i Data Products of the Visible Geosynchronous Earth Imager

The VGEI datasets, like other hyperspectral satellite datasets, are large in size and complex in structure. They require sophisticated processing techniques to extract meaningful information about the Earth's surface. These datasets are essential for a wide range of applications, including environmental monitoring, disaster management, and resource exploration.

#### 13.1c Orbital Maneuvers for the Visible Geosynchronous Earth Imager

The Visible Geosynchronous Earth Imager (VGEI) operates in a highly elliptical orbit, which presents unique challenges for trajectory design. One of the key aspects of trajectory design is the need for precise orbital maneuvers to maintain the satellite's position and orientation.

##### Hohmann Transfer Orbit

The Hohmann Transfer Orbit is a type of orbital maneuver that is often used in satellite trajectory design. Named after Walter Hohmann, who first described it in 1925, this maneuver involves two engine burns that change the satellite's velocity and direction. The first burn moves the satellite from its current orbit to an intermediate orbit, and the second burn moves it from the intermediate orbit to its final orbit.

The Hohmann Transfer Orbit is particularly useful for satellites in highly elliptical orbits, such as the VGEI. By using this maneuver, the satellite can adjust its orbit to compensate for the effects of atmospheric drag and maintain its desired position.

##### Atmospheric Drag and Orbital Decay

Atmospheric drag is a significant factor in the trajectory design for the VGEI. The satellite's high altitude and low orbital inclination make it susceptible to atmospheric drag, which can cause the satellite's orbit to decay over time. This requires regular orbital maneuvers to maintain the desired orbit.

The effects of atmospheric drag can be modeled using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The EKF is a recursive filter that estimates the state of a dynamic system based on noisy measurements. In the context of satellite trajectory design, the EKF can be used to estimate the satellite's position and velocity, and to predict the effects of atmospheric drag on its orbit.

##### Continuous-Time Extended Kalman Filter

The Continuous-Time Extended Kalman Filter (CTEKF) is a generalization of the EKF for continuous-time systems. The CTEKF is particularly useful for satellite trajectory design, as it allows for the prediction of the satellite's position and velocity over time.

The CTEKF operates on the principle of a linearized model of the system, with the system model and measurement model given by:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) \quad \mathbf{w}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr) \\
\mathbf{z}(t) = h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) \quad \mathbf{v}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)
$$

where $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the state vector, $\mathbf{u}(t)$ is the control vector, $\mathbf{w}(t)$ is the process noise, $\mathbf{z}(t)$ is the measurement vector, $\mathbf{v}(t)$ is the measurement noise, $f(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t))$ is the system model, and $h(\mathbf{x}(t))$ is the measurement model. The process noise and measurement noise are assumed to be Gaussian with zero mean and covariance matrices $\mathbf{Q}(t)$ and $\mathbf{R}(t)$, respectively.

The CTEKF also includes a discrete-time update and prediction steps, which allow for the incorporation of new measurements and the prediction of the satellite's state over time. This makes the CTEKF a powerful tool for trajectory design, as it allows for the precise prediction of the satellite's orbit and the adjustment of its trajectory to compensate for the effects of atmospheric drag.

#### 13.1c Imager Operations

The Visible Geosynchronous Earth Imager (VGEI) is a complex satellite system that requires precise trajectory design to maintain its position and orientation. Once the satellite is in its desired orbit, it must undergo a series of operations to ensure its continued functionality.

##### Power Management

The VGEI is powered by a combination of solar panels and batteries. The solar panels provide power during the day, while the batteries are used to power the satellite during the night and during eclipses. The power management system must be carefully designed to ensure that the satellite has enough power to operate its various systems.

The power management system includes a power distribution unit that distributes power to the various systems on the satellite. It also includes a power control unit that monitors the power usage and adjusts the power distribution as needed.

##### Thermal Management

The VGEI operates in a highly elliptical orbit, which exposes it to a wide range of temperatures. The satellite must be equipped with a thermal management system to maintain its temperature within acceptable limits.

The thermal management system includes thermal control coatings on the satellite's surfaces to reflect sunlight and reduce heating. It also includes heaters to warm the satellite during the night and during eclipses.

##### Communication Systems

The VGEI is equipped with a variety of communication systems to transmit data to and from the satellite. These include radio frequency (RF) systems for communication with ground stations, optical communication systems for communication with other satellites, and laser communication systems for high-speed data transmission.

The communication systems must be carefully designed to ensure reliable communication under all operating conditions. This includes designing the systems to operate in the presence of interference and to handle the large amounts of data that the VGEI will generate.

##### Software Systems

The VGEI is equipped with a variety of software systems to control its various systems and to process the data it collects. These include flight software for controlling the satellite's systems, imaging software for processing the satellite's images, and data management software for storing and transmitting the satellite's data.

The software systems must be carefully designed to ensure their reliability and security. This includes designing the systems to be resilient to software failures and to protect the satellite's data from unauthorized access.

##### Maintenance and Upgrades

The VGEI will require regular maintenance and upgrades to ensure its continued functionality. This includes replacing worn-out components, upgrading software systems, and installing new systems.

The maintenance and upgrades must be carefully planned to minimize the impact on the satellite's operations. This includes designing the maintenance and upgrade procedures to be as quick and efficient as possible, and to be able to be performed remotely whenever possible.




### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the concept of formation flight and its application in the design of a Visible Geosynchronous Earth Imager (VGEI). We have discussed the various factors that need to be considered when designing a trajectory for a VGEI, including the orbit type, altitude, and inclination.

On the other hand, a highly elliptical orbit may require less energy but can result in a more variable viewing angle.

Another important aspect to consider is the impact of the VGEI's trajectory on its imaging capabilities. The altitude and inclination of the orbit can greatly affect the coverage area and imaging resolution of the VGEI. Therefore, careful consideration must be given to these factors when designing a trajectory for a VGEI.

In conclusion, the design of a trajectory for a VGEI is a complex and crucial step in the satellite engineering process. It requires a thorough understanding of the various factors at play and careful consideration of the trade-offs involved.

Sensors provide the satellite with information about its surroundings, such as its position, orientation, and the presence of other objects. This information is crucial for tasks such as navigation and avoiding collisions. Sensors also play a role in the development of autonomous systems, as they provide the necessary data for AI to make decisions.

The development of spacecraft autonomy has been driven by the desire to reduce costs and increase efficiency in space missions. With the use of autonomous systems, satellites can perform tasks without human intervention, reducing the need for human resources and decreasing the cost of space missions. Additionally, autonomous systems allow for more complex and ambitious missions to be undertaken, as they can handle tasks that would be impossible for humans to perform.

#### 18.1b Levels of Spacecraft Autonomy

There are three main levels of spacecraft autonomy: teleoperation, supervisory control, and full autonomy. Teleoperation involves human control of the satellite, where all decisions and actions are made by a human operator on the ground. Supervisory control involves a combination of human and computer control, where the satellite is given some level of autonomy but is still monitored and controlled by a human operator. Full autonomy, also known as unmanned operation, involves the satellite operating completely independently without any human intervention.

### Section: 19.1 Introduction to Spacecraft Computer Systems:

Spacecraft computer systems are essential for the successful operation of satellites. These systems are responsible for controlling and managing all the functions of the satellite, including communication, navigation, and other applications. In this section, we will provide an overview of spacecraft computer systems, discussing their types, functions, and challenges.

#### 19.1a Basics of Spacecraft Computer Systems

Spacecraft computer systems are designed to operate in the harsh conditions of space. They must be able to withstand extreme temperatures, radiation, and vacuum, while also being compact and lightweight. To achieve this, spacecraft computer systems are typically designed using specialized hardware and software.

The hardware components of spacecraft computer systems include microprocessors, memory, and input/output devices. These components are designed to operate in the extreme conditions of space, with features such as radiation tolerance and low power consumption. The software components of spacecraft computer systems include operating systems, applications, and communication protocols. These components are designed to handle the specific tasks and functions of the satellite, such as communication and navigation.

One of the key challenges in designing spacecraft computer systems is the limited power and weight constraints of satellites. This requires careful consideration in the selection and design of hardware and software components. Additionally, the harsh conditions of space also pose challenges for the operation of these systems. For example, extreme temperatures can affect the performance of microprocessors, while radiation can cause errors in memory and data storage.

To address these challenges, spacecraft computer systems often employ redundancy and fault tolerance mechanisms. Redundancy ensures that critical functions can still be performed even if one component fails, while fault tolerance mechanisms detect and correct errors in data and operations.

In the next section, we will discuss the different types of spacecraft computer systems, including single-board computers, multi-board systems, and distributed systems. We will also explore the advantages and disadvantages of each type, as well as their applications in satellite engineering.

Comparison of notional NASA missions targeting Jupiter's moon Europa # Nanosat 01

## Body

The satellite has a prismatic body divided in two hemispheres, each with its own hexagonal base and six trapezoidal sides with an overall structure roughly shaped like a sphere. From base to base the satellite measures 600 mm with a maximum radius of 540 mm. Almost all of its surface is covered with GaAs/Ge solar panels in order to power the different systems (17 W by average, 20 W at most) which were glued to aluminum panels anchored to the structure. In addition it also carried Lithium-ion batteries capable of providing 4.8 Ah of energy operations without direct sunlight.

The inside of the Nanosat 01 was accessible by separating both "hemispheres" joined by means of a central hexagon bus connecting all the subsystems. These include: the OBDH (On-Board Data Handling) which provided all spacecraft control, processing power and interfacing (based on a DragonBall MC68332 microcontroller of 4 MB of storage capacity, 8 kB PROM, 512 kB EEPROM, 768 kB of protected RAM), the PDU (Power Distribution Unit), RF communications, the ACS (Attitude Control Subsystem) which employed solar cells and a magnetometer to determine attitude and provide spin stability.

To keep the dead weight to a minimum, INTA, in cooperation with ESA, developed an experimental replacement for traditional wiring using optical infrared arrays, known as OWLS, to exchange data between the different modules. The final weight of the satellite ended up being about 19 kg with a projected service life of 3 years. However most of its subsystems remained operational for 4 years.

### RF communications

The RF communications subsystem employed 4 omnidirectional antennas allocated on the top face. Two digital modems were implemented for experimentation purposes; one using a single DSP chip, the other based on an ASIC design. Communications with the outside were store and forward using UHF band frequencies.
