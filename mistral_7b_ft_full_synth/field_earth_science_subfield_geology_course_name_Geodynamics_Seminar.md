# Title: Geodynamics: Exploring the Dynamics of Earth's Interior":

## Foreward

Welcome to "Geodynamics: Exploring the Dynamics of Earth's Interior". This book aims to delve into the fascinating world of geodynamics, a field that studies the movement and evolution of the Earth's interior. As we explore the dynamics of our planet's interior, we will encounter a myriad of complex processes and phenomena, each with its own unique characteristics and implications.

The study of geodynamics is not just about understanding the Earth's interior. It is also about understanding the Earth as a whole, and how its various components interact with each other. This includes the study of tectonics, which is the focus of this book. Tectonics is the science of plate motions and the deformation of the Earth's lithosphere. It is a field that is constantly evolving, with new discoveries and theories being made on a regular basis.

In this book, we will explore the various aspects of tectonics, including the movement of the Earth's plates, the formation of mountains, and the role of volcanism in shaping the Earth's surface. We will also delve into the concept of plate boundaries, which are the sites of intense geological activity. These boundaries can be classified into three types: convergent boundaries, where one plate is subducted beneath another; divergent boundaries, where new crust is formed; and transform boundaries, where two plates slide past each other horizontally.

As we explore these topics, we will also touch upon the broader implications of tectonics. For instance, we will discuss how tectonic activity can lead to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and how these events can have far-reaching consequences for human societies. We will also touch upon the role of tectonics in the formation of natural resources, such as oil and minerals, and how our understanding of tectonics can help us better manage these resources.

This book is intended for advanced undergraduate students at MIT, but it is also accessible to anyone with a keen interest in geology and geophysics. It is my hope that this book will not only provide a comprehensive overview of tectonics, but also inspire readers to delve deeper into this fascinating field.

As we embark on this journey into the dynamics of Earth's interior, let us remember that geodynamics is not just about understanding the Earth. It is about understanding ourselves, and our place in the grand scheme of things. So, let's explore the dynamics of our planet's interior, and discover the wonders that lie beneath our feet.




### Introduction

The study of the Earth's interior is a vast and complex field, with many different aspects to explore. One of the most intriguing and dynamic areas of study is the interaction between plumes and ridges. This chapter, "Dynamics of Plume-Ridge Interaction," delves into the fascinating world of these two geological phenomena and their interplay.

Plumes and ridges are both significant features of the Earth's surface and interior. Plumes are columns of hot, buoyant material that rise from the core-mantle boundary, while ridges are long, linear features on the ocean floor that are formed by the movement of tectonic plates. The interaction between these two phenomena is a topic of great interest to geologists and geophysicists.

In this chapter, we will explore the dynamics of plume-ridge interaction, examining how these two features influence each other and the Earth's overall geodynamics. We will delve into the theories and models that explain this interaction, and discuss the evidence that supports these theories. We will also look at the implications of plume-ridge interaction for the Earth's future, and the potential impact it could have on our planet's evolution.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the dynamics of plume-ridge interaction, presenting the current state of research in a clear and accessible manner. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or simply a curious reader, we hope that this chapter will deepen your understanding of the Earth's interior and the fascinating processes that occur within it.




### Section: 1.1 Ridge-centered Plumes:

#### 1.1a Plume-Ridge Interaction Mechanisms

The interaction between plumes and ridges is a complex and dynamic process that has been the subject of extensive research. This interaction is primarily driven by the interplay of thermal, gravitational, and viscous forces. 

#### Thermal Forcing

Thermal forcing plays a crucial role in the interaction between plumes and ridges. The plumes, being hot and buoyant, tend to rise towards the surface. As they rise, they encounter the ridge, which acts as a barrier to their upward movement. This leads to a complex interplay of forces, with the plume pushing against the ridge and the ridge resisting the upward movement of the plume. This interaction can lead to the formation of a variety of geological features, including volcanic ridges and seamounts.

The thermal forcing can be quantified using the equation:

$$
F_{thermal} = \rho_p g h_p - \rho_r g h_r
$$

where $\rho_p$ and $\rho_r$ are the densities of the plume and ridge respectively, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h_p$ and $h_r$ are the heights of the plume and ridge respectively.

#### Gravitational Forcing

Gravitational forcing is another important factor in the interaction between plumes and ridges. The gravitational force acts to pull the plume downwards, while the ridge acts as a barrier to this downward movement. This leads to a complex interplay of forces, with the plume pushing against the ridge and the ridge resisting the downward movement of the plume. This interaction can lead to the formation of a variety of geological features, including volcanic ridges and seamounts.

The gravitational forcing can be quantified using the equation:

$$
F_{gravitational} = \rho_p g h_p - \rho_r g h_r
$$

where $\rho_p$ and $\rho_r$ are the densities of the plume and ridge respectively, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h_p$ and $h_r$ are the heights of the plume and ridge respectively.

#### Viscous Forcing

Viscous forcing is also important in the interaction between plumes and ridges. The viscous forces act to resist the movement of the plume and the ridge. This leads to a complex interplay of forces, with the plume pushing against the ridge and the ridge resisting the upward and downward movement of the plume. This interaction can lead to the formation of a variety of geological features, including volcanic ridges and seamounts.

The viscous forcing can be quantified using the equation:

$$
F_{viscous} = \mu \frac{du}{dy}
$$

where $\mu$ is the viscosity, $u$ is the velocity, and $y$ is the vertical coordinate.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the implications of these interaction mechanisms for the Earth's geodynamics.

#### 1.1b Ridge-Plume Interaction Effects

The interaction between plumes and ridges has profound effects on the Earth's geodynamics. These effects can be seen in the formation of various geological features, such as volcanic ridges and seamounts, as well as in the distribution of heat and material within the Earth's interior.

#### Volcanic Ridges and Seamounts

The interaction between plumes and ridges can lead to the formation of volcanic ridges and seamounts. As the plume rises towards the surface, it encounters the ridge, which acts as a barrier to its upward movement. This leads to a complex interplay of forces, with the plume pushing against the ridge and the ridge resisting the upward movement of the plume. This interplay can result in the formation of a volcanic ridge, a linear feature of volcanic origin that rises above the surrounding seafloor.

If the plume is strong enough, it can overcome the resistance of the ridge and continue to rise towards the surface. This can lead to the formation of a seamount, a volcanic structure that rises above the surrounding seafloor. The size and shape of the seamount depend on the strength of the plume and the resistance of the ridge.

#### Distribution of Heat and Material

The interaction between plumes and ridges also affects the distribution of heat and material within the Earth's interior. The plume, being hot and buoyant, tends to rise towards the surface. As it rises, it carries heat and material with it. However, the ridge acts as a barrier to this upward movement, leading to a complex interplay of forces. This interplay can result in the redistribution of heat and material within the Earth's interior, with the plume pushing against the ridge and the ridge resisting the upward movement of the plume.

The distribution of heat and material within the Earth's interior can have significant implications for the Earth's geodynamics. For example, the redistribution of heat can affect the Earth's heat budget, which in turn can influence the Earth's mantle convection and plate tectonics. Similarly, the redistribution of material can affect the Earth's material budget, which can have implications for the Earth's crust and mantle evolution.

In conclusion, the interaction between plumes and ridges plays a crucial role in the Earth's geodynamics. It leads to the formation of various geological features and affects the distribution of heat and material within the Earth's interior. Understanding this interaction is therefore essential for understanding the dynamics of the Earth's interior.

#### 1.1c Ridge-Plume Interaction Case Studies

In this section, we will delve into specific case studies that illustrate the complex dynamics of plume-ridge interaction. These case studies will provide a more concrete understanding of the concepts discussed in the previous sections.

##### Case Study 1: The Hawaiian Islands

The Hawaiian Islands provide a classic example of plume-ridge interaction. The Hawaiian hot spot, located in the Earth's mantle, generates a plume that rises towards the surface. As the plume rises, it encounters the Pacific Plate, which acts as a ridge. The interplay between the plume and the ridge results in the formation of a chain of volcanic islands.

### Section: 1.1 Ridge-centered Plumes:

#### 1.1b Effects of Plume-Ridge Interaction on Plate Tectonics

The interaction between plumes and ridges has profound implications for plate tectonics. The dynamics of plume-ridge interaction can influence the formation of new crust, the movement of tectonic plates, and the distribution of heat within the Earth's mantle.

#### Plate Formation

The interaction between plumes and ridges can lead to the formation of new crust. As a plume rises towards the surface, it encounters a ridge. The interplay of thermal, gravitational, and viscous forces can lead to the formation of a volcanic ridge or seamount. This process can contribute to the formation of new oceanic crust, which is essential for plate tectonics.

#### Plate Movement

The interaction between plumes and ridges can also influence the movement of tectonic plates. The buoyant force exerted by a plume can push against a ridge, leading to the movement of the plate. This can be particularly significant in the case of hotspots, where the plume is associated with a volcanic feature such as a volcano or a chain of volcanic islands. The movement of the plate can be quantified using the equation:

$$
F_{plate} = \rho_p g h_p - \rho_r g h_r
$$

where $\rho_p$ and $\rho_r$ are the densities of the plume and ridge respectively, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h_p$ and $h_r$ are the heights of the plume and ridge respectively.

#### Heat Distribution

The interaction between plumes and ridges can also affect the distribution of heat within the Earth's mantle. As a plume rises towards the surface, it carries heat with it. This heat can be transferred to the ridge, leading to an increase in the temperature of the mantle. This can have implications for the dynamics of the mantle, including the movement of tectonic plates and the formation of new crust.

In conclusion, the interaction between plumes and ridges plays a crucial role in plate tectonics. It influences the formation of new crust, the movement of tectonic plates, and the distribution of heat within the Earth's mantle. Understanding this interaction is therefore essential for understanding the dynamics of the Earth's interior.

As discussed in the previous section, the interaction between plumes and ridges can lead to the formation of volcanic ridges and seamounts. These features are often associated with hotspots and can be significant contributors to the formation of new oceanic crust. The formation of these features can be quantified using the equation:

$$
h = \frac{F_{plate}}{\rho_r g}
$$

where $h$ is the height of the volcanic ridge or seamount, $F_{plate}$ is the buoyant force exerted by the plume, $\rho_r$ is the density of the ridge, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

#### Magnetic Anomalies

The interaction between plumes and ridges can also result in the formation of magnetic anomalies. These anomalies are often associated with the movement of tectonic plates and can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the Earth's mantle. The formation of these anomalies can be quantified using the equation:

$$
A = \frac{F_{plate}}{\mu_0 \sigma_r}
$$

where $A$ is the amplitude of the magnetic anomaly, $F_{plate}$ is the buoyant force exerted by the plume, $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, and $\sigma_r$ is the electrical conductivity of the ridge.

#### Lineaments

Lineaments are linear features that can be observed on the surface of the Earth. These features can be associated with the interaction between plumes and ridges and can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the Earth's interior. The formation of these features can be quantified using the equation:

$$
L = \frac{F_{plume}}{\mu_0 \sigma_r}
$$

where $L$ is the length of the lineament, $F_{plume}$ is the force exerted by the plume, $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, and $\sigma_r$ is the electrical conductivity of the ridge.

In conclusion, the interaction between plumes and ridges can result in a variety of geological features. These features can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the Earth's interior and the processes that shape our planet.

### Introduction

The Earth's mantle is a dynamic and complex system that plays a crucial role in the planet's evolution and current state. It is the layer between the crust and the core, extending from a depth of approximately 80 km to 2,890 km. The mantle is primarily composed of solid rock, but it is also capable of flowing over long periods of time, a process known as mantle convection. This convection is driven by the heat generated by the core and is responsible for the movement of tectonic plates, which in turn shapes the Earth's surface.

In this chapter, we will delve into the dynamics of the mantle, exploring its flow, melting, and dehydration processes. We will begin by discussing the mantle's composition and structure, including the different layers and their properties. We will then move on to the mechanisms of mantle flow, including the role of temperature, pressure, and viscosity. Next, we will explore the process of mantle melting, which is a key factor in the formation of new crust and the recycling of old crust. Finally, we will discuss the dehydration of the mantle, a process that is closely linked to mantle melting and has significant implications for the Earth's water cycle.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of the mantle, including its flow, melting, and dehydration processes. This knowledge will provide a foundation for the subsequent chapters, where we will explore the implications of these processes for the Earth's evolution and current state.




### Subsection: 2.1a Geophysical Signatures of Iceland Mantle Plume

The Iceland mantle plume is a region of intense volcanic activity located in the North Atlantic Ocean. It is one of the most well-studied mantle plumes due to its proximity to land and the availability of geophysical data. The plume is characterized by a large-scale upwelling of hot material from the lower mantle, which is believed to be responsible for the formation of the Iceland hotspot.

#### 2.1a.1 Seismic Anomalies

One of the key geophysical signatures of the Iceland mantle plume is the presence of seismic anomalies. These anomalies are detected by seismic tomography, a technique that uses the speed of seismic waves to map the structure of the Earth's interior. The tomographic images of the Iceland region reveal a large-scale upwelling of hot material beneath the plume, extending from the lower mantle to the upper mantle. This upwelling is characterized by a positive P-wave velocity anomaly, indicating a region of higher temperature and lower density.

The seismic anomalies beneath the Iceland mantle plume are not limited to the plume itself. They also extend to the surrounding regions, forming a large-scale anomaly that covers an area of approximately 1.5 million km$^2$. This anomaly is believed to be the result of the interaction between the plume and the surrounding mantle, leading to the formation of a thermal boundary layer.

#### 2.1a.2 Gravity Anomalies

Another important geophysical signature of the Iceland mantle plume is the presence of gravity anomalies. These anomalies are detected by gravity surveys, which measure the variation in the Earth's gravitational field. The gravity anomalies beneath the Iceland mantle plume are characterized by a positive anomaly, indicating a region of lower density. This anomaly is believed to be the result of the upwelling of hot material from the lower mantle, which is less dense than the surrounding mantle.

The gravity anomalies beneath the Iceland mantle plume are not uniform. They exhibit a spatial and temporal variability, which is believed to be the result of the interaction between the plume and the surrounding mantle. This variability is also reflected in the seismic anomalies, highlighting the complex nature of the plume-mantle interaction.

#### 2.1a.3 Magnetic Anomalies

The Iceland mantle plume also exhibits magnetic anomalies, which are detected by magnetic surveys. These anomalies are believed to be the result of the interaction between the plume and the surrounding mantle, leading to the formation of a magnetic boundary layer. The magnetic anomalies are not uniform and exhibit a spatial and temporal variability, similar to the seismic and gravity anomalies.

The magnetic anomalies beneath the Iceland mantle plume are believed to be the result of the remanent magnetization of the plume material. This remanent magnetization is believed to be the result of the cooling and solidification of the plume material, which occurs at a depth of approximately 650 km. The variability in the magnetic anomalies is believed to be the result of the interaction between the plume and the surrounding mantle, leading to the formation of a complex magnetic structure.

In conclusion, the Iceland mantle plume is characterized by a variety of geophysical signatures, including seismic, gravity, and magnetic anomalies. These signatures provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the plume and its interaction with the surrounding mantle. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex nature of the plume and its role in the dynamics of the Earth's interior.





### Subsection: 2.1b Mantle Flow and Melt Generation beneath Iceland

The Iceland mantle plume is a region of intense volcanic activity located in the North Atlantic Ocean. It is one of the most well-studied mantle plumes due to its proximity to land and the availability of geophysical data. The plume is characterized by a large-scale upwelling of hot material from the lower mantle, which is believed to be responsible for the formation of the Iceland hotspot.

#### 2.1b.1 Mantle Flow beneath Iceland

The mantle flow beneath Iceland is a complex and dynamic process. It is driven by the upwelling of hot material from the lower mantle, which is believed to be the result of a mantle plume. This upwelling creates a thermal boundary layer at the base of the mantle, which is believed to be responsible for the formation of the Iceland hotspot.

The mantle flow beneath Iceland is also influenced by the surrounding regions. The interaction between the plume and the surrounding mantle leads to the formation of a large-scale anomaly that covers an area of approximately 1.5 million km$^2$. This anomaly is believed to be the result of the interaction between the plume and the surrounding mantle, leading to the formation of a thermal boundary layer.

#### 2.1b.2 Melt Generation beneath Iceland

The intense volcanic activity observed at Iceland is believed to be the result of melt generation beneath the mantle plume. This melt generation is driven by the high temperatures and pressures experienced by the mantle material as it rises towards the surface. As the mantle material reaches the lower crust, it undergoes partial melting, leading to the formation of basaltic magmas.

The melt generation beneath Iceland is also influenced by the surrounding regions. The interaction between the plume and the surrounding mantle leads to the formation of a large-scale anomaly that covers an area of approximately 1.5 million km$^2$. This anomaly is believed to be the result of the interaction between the plume and the surrounding mantle, leading to the formation of a thermal boundary layer. This boundary layer is believed to enhance the melt generation beneath Iceland, leading to the intense volcanic activity observed in the region.

#### 2.1b.3 Dehydration beneath Iceland

In addition to melt generation, the mantle flow beneath Iceland also leads to dehydration of the mantle material. As the mantle material rises towards the surface, it undergoes a decrease in pressure, leading to the release of water and other volatile elements. This dehydration process is believed to be responsible for the formation of hydrothermal systems and hydrothermal deposits in the region.

The dehydration beneath Iceland is also influenced by the surrounding regions. The interaction between the plume and the surrounding mantle leads to the formation of a large-scale anomaly that covers an area of approximately 1.5 million km$^2$. This anomaly is believed to be the result of the interaction between the plume and the surrounding mantle, leading to the formation of a thermal boundary layer. This boundary layer is believed to enhance the dehydration process beneath Iceland, leading to the formation of hydrothermal systems and hydrothermal deposits.




### Subsection: 2.1c Dehydration Processes in the Icelandic Mantle

The Iceland mantle plume is not only a region of intense volcanic activity, but also a site of significant dehydration processes. Dehydration is the process by which water is released from a substance, and in the case of the Iceland mantle plume, it is believed to be a result of the interaction between the mantle plume and the surrounding mantle.

#### 2.1c.1 Dehydration Mechanisms in the Icelandic Mantle

The dehydration processes in the Icelandic mantle are believed to be driven by the interaction between the mantle plume and the surrounding mantle. As the plume rises towards the surface, it interacts with the surrounding mantle, leading to the formation of a thermal boundary layer. This layer is believed to be responsible for the release of water from the mantle material.

The dehydration mechanisms in the Icelandic mantle are also influenced by the composition of the mantle material. The mantle material beneath Iceland is believed to be enriched in water, which is believed to be the result of the interaction between the plume and the surrounding mantle. This enrichment in water leads to the formation of a large-scale anomaly that covers an area of approximately 1.5 million km$^2$.

#### 2.1c.2 Implications of Dehydration in the Icelandic Mantle

The dehydration processes in the Icelandic mantle have significant implications for the dynamics of Earth's interior. The release of water from the mantle material can lead to changes in the physical and chemical properties of the mantle, which can in turn affect the flow of mantle material and the generation of melt.

Furthermore, the dehydration processes in the Icelandic mantle can also have implications for the global water cycle. The release of water from the mantle can contribute to the global water budget, which is crucial for understanding the Earth's climate system.

In conclusion, the dehydration processes in the Icelandic mantle are a crucial aspect of mantle flow, melt generation, and the dynamics of Earth's interior. Further research and study are needed to fully understand these processes and their implications for the Earth's interior and the global water cycle.

### Subsection: 2.1d Magmatic Plumbing System of the Iceland Mantle Plume

The Iceland mantle plume is a complex system that involves the interaction of various processes, including mantle flow, melting, and dehydration. One of the key aspects of this system is the magmatic plumbing system, which is responsible for the transport of melt and heat from the mantle to the surface.

#### 2.1d.1 The Role of the Magmatic Plumbing System

The magmatic plumbing system plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the Iceland mantle plume. It is responsible for the transport of melt and heat from the mantle to the surface, which is essential for the formation of volcanic structures and the generation of heat.

The magmatic plumbing system is also responsible for the distribution of heat and melt within the mantle. As the mantle plume rises towards the surface, it interacts with the surrounding mantle, leading to the formation of a thermal boundary layer. This layer is believed to be responsible for the transport of heat and melt within the mantle, which can have significant implications for the dynamics of Earth's interior.

#### 2.1d.2 The Structure of the Magmatic Plumbing System

The magmatic plumbing system of the Iceland mantle plume is believed to be composed of a series of interconnected conduits and chambers. These conduits and chambers are responsible for the transport of melt and heat from the mantle to the surface.

The structure of the magmatic plumbing system is also believed to be influenced by the composition of the mantle material. The mantle material beneath Iceland is believed to be enriched in water, which can affect the viscosity of the mantle and the formation of conduits and chambers.

#### 2.1d.3 Implications of the Magmatic Plumbing System

The magmatic plumbing system of the Iceland mantle plume has significant implications for the dynamics of Earth's interior. The transport of melt and heat from the mantle to the surface is essential for the formation of volcanic structures and the generation of heat.

Furthermore, the structure and composition of the magmatic plumbing system can also affect the dynamics of the mantle plume itself. Changes in the viscosity of the mantle, for example, can affect the speed and direction of the mantle plume, which can have implications for the formation of volcanic structures and the distribution of heat within the mantle.

In conclusion, the magmatic plumbing system of the Iceland mantle plume is a crucial aspect of the dynamics of Earth's interior. Its role in the transport of melt and heat, as well as its structure and composition, can have significant implications for the dynamics of the mantle plume and the formation of volcanic structures.

### Introduction

The Galapagos Islands, located in the Pacific Ocean, are a unique and fascinating destination for geologists and geophysicists. The islands are known for their diverse and complex geology, making them a prime location for studying the dynamics of Earth's interior. In this chapter, we will explore the petrology and geochemistry of the Galapagos, delving into the composition and processes that have shaped these islands over millions of years.

The Galapagos Islands are a result of volcanic activity, with the majority of the islands being formed by shield volcanoes. These volcanoes are characterized by their low-angle, gently sloping sides and large calderas at their summits. The islands are also home to a variety of volcanic features, such as lava domes, lava flows, and tuff cones. The composition of these volcanic rocks provides valuable insights into the processes that have shaped the Galapagos.

In addition to their volcanic features, the Galapagos Islands also have a rich history of geological events. The islands have experienced multiple periods of volcanic activity, with the most recent being the formation of the Alcedo Volcano in the 19th century. The islands have also been affected by plate tectonics, with the Nazca Plate moving over the Galapagos Hotspot, resulting in the formation of the islands.

In this chapter, we will explore the petrology and geochemistry of the Galapagos in more detail, examining the composition and processes that have shaped these islands. We will also discuss the significance of the Galapagos in the study of geodynamics, and how our understanding of these islands can contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of Earth's interior.

### Subsection: 3.1b Geochemical Signatures of the Galapagos Plume

The Galapagos Islands are a unique and fascinating destination for geologists and geophysicists. The islands are known for their diverse and complex geology, making them a prime location for studying the dynamics of Earth's interior. In this section, we will explore the geochemical signatures of the Galapagos Plume, a mantle plume that has played a significant role in the formation and evolution of the Galapagos Islands.

The Galapagos Plume is a mantle plume that has been active for at least the last 10 million years. It is responsible for the formation of the Galapagos Islands, as well as the surrounding seamounts and ridges. The plume is characterized by its high heat flow and chemical anomalies, which have been extensively studied by geologists and geochemists.

One of the most significant geochemical signatures of the Galapagos Plume is its high heat flow. The plume is estimated to have a heat flow of 100-150 mW/m², which is significantly higher than the average heat flow of the Earth's mantle. This high heat flow is a result of the plume's deep origin, which is believed to be from the lower mantle. The plume's high heat flow has been linked to the formation of the Galapagos Islands, as it provides the necessary energy for volcanic activity.

In addition to its high heat flow, the Galapagos Plume also exhibits chemical anomalies that are unique to mantle plumes. These anomalies include high concentrations of elements such as lead, strontium, and neodymium, which are not typically found in high levels in the Earth's mantle. These anomalies have been linked to the mixing of near-surface materials, such as subducted slabs and continental sediments, in the mantle source of the plume.

The geochemical signatures of the Galapagos Plume have been extensively studied, and there are two competing interpretations for their origin. One interpretation suggests that the plume is a result of the mantle's convection, where the plume is a result of the mantle's convection, where the plume is a result of the mantle's convection, where the plume is a result of the mantle's convection, where the plume is a result of the mantle's convection, where the plume is a result of the mantle's convection, where the plume is a result of the

### Subsection: 3.1c Volcanic Eruptions and Magma Composition in the Galapagos

The Galapagos Islands are known for their diverse and complex geology, making them a prime location for studying the dynamics of Earth's interior. In this section, we will explore the volcanic eruptions and magma composition in the Galapagos, which have been extensively studied by geologists and geochemists.

The Galapagos Islands are a result of volcanic activity, and the islands have been continuously active for at least the last 20 million years. The mantle plume beneath the east-ward moving Nazca Plate has given rise to a 3-kilometer-thick platform under the island chain and seamounts. This plume has been responsible for the formation of the Galapagos Islands, as well as the surrounding seamounts and ridges.

The Galapagos Archipelago is characterized by numerous contemporaneous volcanoes, some with plume magma sources, others from the asthenosphere. The GSC caused structural weaknesses in this thin lithosphere leading to eruptions forming the Galapagos Platform. Fernandina and Isabela in particular are aligned along these weaknesses. Lacking a well-defined rift zone, the islands have a high rate of inflation prior to eruption. Sierra Negra on Isabela Island experienced a 240 cm uplift between 1992 and 1998, most recent eruption in 2005, while Fernandina on Fernandina Island indicated an uplift of 90 cm, most recent eruption in 2009. Alcedo on Isabela Island had an uplift of greater than 90 cm, most recent eruption in 1993.

The composition of the magma in the Galapagos Islands is also of great interest to geologists. The magma is primarily basaltic, with some andesitic and dacitic compositions. The composition of the magma is influenced by the mixing of near-surface materials, such as subducted slabs and continental sediments, in the mantle source of the plume. This mixing results in the high heat flow and chemical anomalies that are characteristic of the Galapagos Plume.

In conclusion, the volcanic eruptions and magma composition in the Galapagos Islands are a result of the active mantle plume beneath the Nazca Plate. The high heat flow and chemical anomalies of the plume have been extensively studied and provide valuable insights into the dynamics of Earth's interior.

Seismic tomography is a powerful tool used by geophysicists to study the interior of the Earth. It allows us to create images of the Earth's interior, revealing the structure and composition of the mantle and core. This technique has revolutionized our understanding of the Earth's dynamics and has led to many groundbreaking discoveries.

### Subsection 4.1a: Introduction to Seismic Tomography

Seismic tomography is a non-invasive method of imaging the Earth's interior. It uses seismic waves, which are vibrations that travel through the Earth's interior, to create images of the Earth's structure. These images are then used to study the composition and dynamics of the Earth's interior.

The basic principle behind seismic tomography is the use of seismic waves to measure the velocity of the Earth's interior. Seismic waves travel at different speeds through different materials, and by measuring the speed of these waves, we can determine the composition of the Earth's interior. This is done by sending seismic waves into the Earth's interior and measuring how long it takes for them to return to the surface.

There are two main types of seismic waves used in tomography: P-waves and S-waves. P-waves, or primary waves, are compressional waves that cause the material they travel through to expand and contract. S-waves, or shear waves, are shear waves that cause the material they travel through to move in a circular motion. Both types of waves are used in tomography, but P-waves are more commonly used due to their ability to travel through the Earth's interior.

Surface waves, such as Love waves and Rayleigh waves, are also used in tomography. These waves are generated by the interaction of P-waves and S-waves with the Earth's surface. Love waves, which are transverse waves, and Rayleigh waves, which are longitudinal waves, are used to study the Earth's surface and shallow subsurface.

The use of seismic tomography has led to many groundbreaking discoveries about the Earth's interior. One of the most significant discoveries is the existence of mantle plumes. Mantle plumes are columns of hot, buoyant material that rise from the core-mantle boundary to the Earth's surface. They play a crucial role in the dynamics of the Earth's interior and have been linked to various geological phenomena, such as hotspots and volcanic activity.

### Subsection: 3.1d Geochemical Evolution of the Galapagos Plume

The geochemical evolution of the Galapagos Plume is a complex and ongoing process that has been studied extensively by geochemists. The plume is characterized by high heat flow and chemical anomalies, which are a result of the mixing of near-surface materials in the mantle source of the plume.

The geochemical evolution of the Galapagos Plume can be traced back to the early stages of its formation. The plume is thought to have originated from a mantle hotspot, which is a region of the mantle where heat is concentrated and can cause the mantle to rise towards the surface. As the plume rises, it carries with it a mixture of materials from the mantle and the surface. This mixture is then processed by the plume, resulting in the formation of different types of magma.

The geochemical evolution of the Galapagos Plume is also influenced by the surrounding oceanic and continental environments. The plume is located in the Pacific Ocean, and its evolution is affected by the chemical composition of the surrounding seawater. Additionally, the plume is also influenced by the subduction of oceanic and continental crust, which can introduce new materials into the plume.

The geochemical evolution of the Galapagos Plume can be studied through various techniques, including geochemical analysis of rocks and minerals, as well as geophysical measurements. These studies have revealed that the plume is composed of a mixture of materials, including basaltic magma, sediments, and even fragments of the Earth's mantle.

One of the most significant findings from the geochemical study of the Galapagos Plume is the discovery of a high concentration of iron in the plume. This iron is thought to originate from the subduction of oceanic and continental crust, which introduces iron into the plume. The presence of iron in the plume has important implications for the geochemical evolution of the plume and its potential role in the formation of new oceanic crust.

In conclusion, the geochemical evolution of the Galapagos Plume is a complex and ongoing process that is influenced by various factors, including the mantle hotspot, surrounding environments, and subduction of materials. Further research and study of the plume will continue to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of Earth's interior and the processes that shape our planet.

### Subsection 3.1: Volcanic Petrology of the Galapagos

The Galapagos Islands, located in the Pacific Ocean, are a volcanic archipelago that has been the subject of extensive study by geologists and geochemists. The islands are known for their unique and diverse volcanic activity, which has shaped their geological history and continues to influence their current state.

#### 3.1a Basaltic Volcanism

Basaltic volcanism is a common type of volcanism found in the Galapagos Islands. Basalt is a dark, fine-grained igneous rock that is commonly associated with mid-ocean ridges and oceanic crust. However, in the Galapagos, basaltic volcanism is found on both the oceanic and continental crust, providing valuable insights into the geological processes occurring in the islands.

The basaltic volcanism in the Galapagos is primarily driven by the movement of the Nazca Plate, which is responsible for the formation of the islands. As the plate moves over the Galapagos hotspot, it creates a chain of volcanic islands, with the oldest islands located to the west and the youngest to the east. This east-west trend is also seen in the composition of the basaltic rocks, with the oldest islands having a more enriched composition and the younger islands having a more depleted composition.

The composition of basaltic rocks is influenced by the melting of the mantle, which is affected by the presence of water and other volatiles. In the Galapagos, the presence of water and other volatiles is thought to be responsible for the formation of more evolved basaltic rocks, such as andesite and dacite. These rocks are found in the older islands, where the mantle has had more time to interact with water and volatiles.

The study of basaltic volcanism in the Galapagos has also provided insights into the formation of the Earth's continents. The presence of basaltic rocks on the continental crust of the islands suggests that the continents may have formed through the same process of volcanic activity. This has led to the development of theories about the formation of the continents, including the plate tectonics theory.

In addition to its role in the formation of the Earth's continents, basaltic volcanism in the Galapagos has also played a crucial role in the study of the Earth's interior. The unique composition and structure of the basaltic rocks found in the islands have provided valuable data for understanding the processes occurring in the Earth's mantle and core.

Overall, the study of basaltic volcanism in the Galapagos has greatly contributed to our understanding of the Earth's dynamics and the formation of its continents.

### Subsection: 4.1b Imaging the Iceland Plume using Seismic Tomography

The Iceland Plume, located in the North Atlantic Ocean, is a region of intense geological activity and volcanism. It is believed to be the result of a mantle plume, a column of hot, buoyant material rising from the Earth's core-mantle boundary. The study of this plume has been a topic of great interest to geophysicists and geologists, as it provides valuable insights into the dynamics of the Earth's interior.

Seismic tomography has been a crucial tool in studying the Iceland Plume. By using seismic waves to create images of the Earth's interior, scientists have been able to gain a deeper understanding of the structure and dynamics of the plume. This section will explore the various aspects of seismic tomography and its application in studying the Iceland Plume.

#### The Principles of Seismic Tomography

Seismic tomography is a technique that uses seismic waves to create images of the Earth's interior. These waves are generated by natural events such as earthquakes or man-made sources, and they travel through the Earth's layers at different speeds. By measuring the travel time of these waves, scientists can create a 3D image of the Earth's interior.

The principles behind seismic tomography are based on the concept of seismic anisotropy. Anisotropy refers to the directional dependence of seismic wave velocities. In the Earth's interior, anisotropy can be caused by various factors such as mineral composition, temperature, and pressure. By studying the anisotropy of seismic waves, scientists can gain insights into the physical properties of the Earth's interior.

#### The Equipment and Techniques Used in Seismic Tomography

Seismic tomography requires specialized equipment and techniques to capture and analyze seismic waves. This includes seismometers, which are instruments used to measure ground motion, and seismic recording stations, which are used to collect and store data.

The technique of seismic tomography involves analyzing the travel time of seismic waves. This is done by measuring the time it takes for a wave to travel from a source to a receiver. By comparing the travel time of waves from different sources and receivers, scientists can create a 3D image of the Earth's interior.

#### Interpreting Seismic Tomography Images of the Iceland Plume

The Iceland Plume is a complex region with a variety of geological features. Seismic tomography has been instrumental in providing insights into the structure and dynamics of the plume. By analyzing the anisotropy of seismic waves, scientists have been able to identify regions of high and low velocities, which can indicate the presence of mantle plumes.

One of the most significant findings from seismic tomography of the Iceland Plume is the discovery of a large low-velocity anomaly beneath the plume. This anomaly is believed to be the result of a mantle plume, and its presence has been confirmed by other geophysical data.

In addition to studying the Iceland Plume, seismic tomography has also been used to study other regions of the Earth's interior, such as the Pacific Ring of Fire and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. By combining data from different regions, scientists have been able to create a more comprehensive understanding of the Earth's interior dynamics.

In conclusion, seismic tomography has been a valuable tool in studying the Iceland Plume and other regions of the Earth's interior. By using specialized equipment and techniques, scientists have been able to create 3D images of the Earth's interior and gain insights into the dynamics of the Iceland Plume. Further research and advancements in technology will continue to enhance our understanding of this fascinating region.

# Seismic tomography

## Applications

Seismic tomography can resolve anisotropy, anelasticity, density, and bulk sound velocity. Variations in these parameters may be a result of thermal or chemical differences, which are attributed to processes such as mantle plumes, subducting slabs, and mineral phase changes. Larger scale features that can be imaged with tomography include the high velocities beneath continental shields and low velocities under ocean spreading centers.

### Hotspots

The mantle plume hypothesis proposes that areas of volcanism not readily explained by plate tectonics, called hotspots, are a result of thermal upwelling from as deep as the core-mantle boundary that become diapirs in the crust. This is an actively contested theory, although tomographic images suggest there are anomalies beneath some hotspots. The best imaged of these are large low-shear-velocity provinces, or superplumes, visible on S-wave models of the lower mantle and believed to reflect both thermal and compositional differences.

The Yellowstone hotspot is responsible for volcanism at the Yellowstone Caldera and a series of extinct calderas along the Snake River Plain. The Yellowstone Geodynamic Project sought to image the plume beneath the hotspot. They found a strong low-velocity body from ~30 to 250 km depth beneath Yellowstone, and a weaker anomaly from 250 to 650 km depth which dipped 60° west-northwest. The authors attribute these features to the mantle plume beneath the hotspot being deflected eastward by flow in the upper mantle seen in S-wave models.

The Hawaii hotspot produced the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. Tomographic images show it to be 500 to 600 km wide and up to 2,000 km deep.

## Chapter 5: Mantle Plumes




### Introduction

The study of geodynamics is a vast and complex field that seeks to understand the dynamics of Earth's interior. This includes the study of the geochemical aspects of plumes, which are columns of hot, buoyant material that rise from the core-mantle boundary to the surface. In this chapter, we will explore the basic geochemical aspects of plumes, including their composition, behavior, and role in the Earth's dynamics.

Plumes are a key component of the Earth's interior, playing a crucial role in the movement of heat and material within the planet. They are believed to be responsible for the formation of hotspots, such as the Hawaiian Islands, and are thought to contribute to the formation of mid-ocean ridges. Understanding the geochemical aspects of plumes is therefore essential for understanding the dynamics of the Earth's interior.

In this chapter, we will begin by discussing the composition of plumes, including their chemical and mineralogical makeup. We will then delve into the behavior of plumes, exploring how they interact with the surrounding mantle and crust. Finally, we will examine the role of plumes in the Earth's dynamics, including their impact on plate tectonics and the global heat budget.

Through this exploration of the basic geochemical aspects of plumes, we hope to provide a solid foundation for further study and research in this fascinating field. So let us embark on this journey together, as we delve into the world of geodynamics and the dynamics of Earth's interior.




### Section: 5.1 Geochemical Aspects:

The geochemical aspects of plumes are crucial in understanding the dynamics of Earth's interior. These aspects include the chemical and isotopic composition of basalts found at hotspots, the identification of mantle components, and the role of subducted material in the mantle source.

#### 5.1a Geochemical Signatures of Mantle Plumes

The geochemical signatures of mantle plumes are primarily studied through the analysis of basalts found at hotspots. These basalts, known as ocean island basalts (OIBs), are analyzed for their radiogenic and stable isotope compositions. 

In radiogenic isotope systems, the originally subducted material creates diverging trends, termed mantle components. These identified mantle components include DMM (depleted mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) mantle), HIMU (high U/Pb-ratio mantle), EM1 (enriched mantle 1), EM2 (enriched mantle 2), and FOZO (focus zone). The geochemical signature of these components arises from the mixing of near-surface materials such as subducted slabs and continental sediments in the mantle source.

The interpretation of these mantle components is a topic of ongoing research. Two competing interpretations have been proposed. In the context of mantle plumes, the near-surface material is postulated to have been transported down to the core-mantle boundary by subducted slabs, and to have been transported back up to the surface by plumes. In the context of the Plate hypothesis, subducted material is mostly re-circulated in the shallow mantle and tapped from there by volcanoes.

Stable isotopes like Fe are used to track processes that the uprising material experiences during melting. The processing of oceanic crust, lithosphere, and sediment through a subduction zone decouples the water-soluble trace elements (e.g., K, Rb, Th) from the immobile trace elements (e.g., Ti, Nb, Ta), concentrating the immobile elements in the oceanic slab. Seismic tomography shows that subducted oceanic slabs sink as far as the bottom of the mantle transition zone at 650 km depth. Subduction to greater depths is less certain, but there is evidence that they may sink to mid-lower-mantle depths at about 1,500  km depth.

The source of mantle plumes is postulated to be the core-mantle boundary at 3,000  km depth. Because there is little material transport across this boundary, the geochemical signatures of mantle plumes provide valuable insights into the composition of the core-mantle boundary. This is a crucial aspect of geodynamics, as it helps us understand the dynamics of Earth's interior and the processes that drive plate tectonics.

#### 5.1b Role of Geochemical Aspects in Plume Formation

The geochemical aspects play a significant role in the formation of mantle plumes. The geochemical signatures of mantle plumes, as discussed in the previous section, are primarily influenced by the composition of the mantle source and the processes that the uprising material experiences during melting.

The mantle source of plumes is believed to be the core-mantle boundary at 3,000  km depth. This is supported by the geochemical signatures of mantle plumes, which show a strong correlation with the composition of the core-mantle boundary. The core-mantle boundary is characterized by high temperatures and pressures, which can lead to the melting of the mantle source and the formation of mantle plumes.

The geochemical signatures of mantle plumes also provide insights into the processes that the uprising material experiences during melting. For instance, the presence of high U/Pb-ratio mantle (HIMU) and enriched mantle (EM1 and EM2) components suggests that the uprising material has interacted with near-surface materials such as subducted slabs and continental sediments. This interaction can lead to the formation of mantle plumes, as the uprising material becomes less dense and rises towards the surface.

The role of geochemical aspects in plume formation is not fully understood and is a topic of ongoing research. However, it is clear that the geochemical signatures of mantle plumes provide valuable insights into the dynamics of Earth's interior and the processes that drive plate tectonics.

#### 5.1c Implications of Geochemical Aspects for Plume Dynamics

The geochemical aspects of mantle plumes have significant implications for the dynamics of these plumes. The geochemical signatures of mantle plumes, as discussed in the previous sections, are primarily influenced by the composition of the mantle source and the processes that the uprising material experiences during melting.

The geochemical signatures of mantle plumes can provide insights into the origin and evolution of these plumes. For instance, the presence of high U/Pb-ratio mantle (HIMU) and enriched mantle (EM1 and EM2) components suggests that the uprising material has interacted with near-surface materials such as subducted slabs and continental sediments. This interaction can lead to the formation of mantle plumes, as the uprising material becomes less dense and rises towards the surface.

The geochemical signatures of mantle plumes can also provide insights into the processes that the uprising material experiences during melting. For instance, the presence of high U/Pb-ratio mantle (HIMU) and enriched mantle (EM1 and EM2) components suggests that the uprising material has undergone significant melting and mixing with near-surface materials. This can lead to the formation of complex geochemical signatures, which can be used to trace the path of the uprising material and understand the dynamics of mantle plumes.

The geochemical signatures of mantle plumes can also provide insights into the role of mantle plumes in the global heat budget. The melting of the mantle source and the formation of mantle plumes can contribute to the transfer of heat from the core-mantle boundary to the surface. This can help to balance the global heat budget and understand the dynamics of Earth's interior.

In conclusion, the geochemical aspects of mantle plumes have significant implications for the dynamics of these plumes. They can provide insights into the origin and evolution of these plumes, the processes that the uprising material experiences during melting, and the role of mantle plumes in the global heat budget. Further research in this area can help to deepen our understanding of the dynamics of Earth's interior.

## Chapter: Chapter 6: Plume-Lithosphere Interactions

### Introduction

The Earth's interior is a complex and dynamic system, with various components interacting and influencing each other. One of the most intriguing aspects of this system is the interaction between plumes and the lithosphere. This chapter, "Plume-Lithosphere Interactions," delves into the fascinating world of these interactions, exploring the dynamics and implications of these interactions on the Earth's interior.

Plumes, as we have learned in previous chapters, are columns of hot, buoyant material that rise from the core-mantle boundary. They play a crucial role in the Earth's dynamics, influencing the movement of tectonic plates and the distribution of heat within the Earth. The lithosphere, on the other hand, is the rigid outer shell of the Earth, consisting of the crust and the uppermost mantle. It is the surface layer of the Earth, and its interaction with plumes is a topic of great interest in geodynamics.

In this chapter, we will explore the various aspects of plume-lithosphere interactions, including the mechanisms of interaction, the effects of these interactions on the Earth's surface, and the implications of these interactions for the Earth's long-term evolution. We will also discuss the current theories and models that attempt to explain these interactions, and the ongoing research that seeks to deepen our understanding of these phenomena.

As we delve into the complexities of plume-lithosphere interactions, we will also touch upon the broader implications of these interactions for the Earth's interior dynamics. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of these interactions, shedding light on the intricate interplay between plumes and the lithosphere, and the profound implications of these interactions for the Earth's dynamics.




### Section: 5.1b Trace Element and Isotopic Compositions of Plume-derived Magmas

The trace element and isotopic compositions of plume-derived magmas provide valuable insights into the dynamics of Earth's interior. These compositions are primarily studied through the analysis of basalts found at hotspots, which are known as ocean island basalts (OIBs).

#### 5.1b Trace Element and Isotopic Compositions of Plume-derived Magmas

The trace element and isotopic compositions of plume-derived magmas are analyzed for their radiogenic and stable isotope compositions. In radiogenic isotope systems, the originally subducted material creates diverging trends, termed mantle components. These identified mantle components include DMM (depleted mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) mantle), HIMU (high U/Pb-ratio mantle), EM1 (enriched mantle 1), EM2 (enriched mantle 2), and FOZO (focus zone).

The isotopic composition of plume-derived magmas is also studied. Isotopes like Fe are used to track processes that the uprising material experiences during melting. The processing of oceanic crust, lithosphere, and sediment through a subduction zone decouples the water-soluble trace elements (e.g., K, Rb, Th) from the immobile trace elements (e.g., Ti, Nb, Ta), concentrating the immobile elements in the oceanic slab. Seismic tomography shows that subducted oceanic slabs sink as far as the bottom of the mantle transition zone at 650 km depth. Subduction to greater depths is less certain, but there is evidence that they may sink to mid-lower-mantle depths at about 1,500  km depth.

The source of mantle plumes is postulated to be the core-mantle boundary at 3,000  km depth. Because there is little material transport across this boundary, the trace element and isotopic compositions of plume-derived magmas can provide insights into the composition of the core-mantle boundary. This is a topic of ongoing research, and the interpretation of these compositions is a topic of ongoing debate.

In the context of mantle plumes, the near-surface material is postulated to have been transported down to the core-mantle boundary by subducted slabs, and to have been transported back up to the surface by plumes. This interpretation is supported by the geochemical signatures of plume-derived magmas, which show enrichment in trace elements and isotopes that are associated with subducted slabs.

In the context of the Plate hypothesis, subducted material is mostly re-circulated in the shallow mantle and tapped from there by volcanoes. This interpretation is supported by the geochemical signatures of plume-derived magmas, which show depletion in trace elements and isotopes that are associated with subducted slabs.

The interpretation of these mantle components is a topic of ongoing research. Two competing interpretations have been proposed. In the context of mantle plumes, the near-surface material is postulated to have been transported down to the core-mantle boundary by subducted slabs, and to have been transported back up to the surface by plumes.

### Section: 5.1c Geochemical Constraints on Plume Sources and Mantle Heterogeneities

The geochemical aspects of plumes provide valuable insights into the dynamics of Earth's interior. The chemical and isotopic composition of basalts found at hotspots, known as ocean island basalts (OIBs), are analyzed to understand the sources of mantle plumes and the heterogeneities present in the mantle.

#### 5.1c Geochemical Constraints on Plume Sources and Mantle Heterogeneities

The geochemical signature of mantle plumes is characterized by the presence of mantle components, which are identified through the analysis of radiogenic and stable isotopes in OIBs. These mantle components include DMM (depleted mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) mantle), HIMU (high U/Pb-ratio mantle), EM1 (enriched mantle 1), EM2 (enriched mantle 2), and FOZO (focus zone).

The presence of these mantle components in OIBs is attributed to the mixing of near-surface materials, such as subducted slabs and continental sediments, in the mantle source. This interpretation is supported by the Plate hypothesis, which proposes that subducted material is mostly re-circulated in the shallow mantle and tapped from there by volcanoes.

The geochemical signature of mantle plumes also provides insights into the source of these plumes. The source of mantle plumes is postulated to be the core-mantle boundary at 3,000  km depth. This is supported by the observation that subducted oceanic slabs sink as far as the bottom of the mantle transition zone at 650 km depth, and there is evidence that they may sink to mid-lower-mantle depths at about 1,500  km depth.

However, the interpretation of these geochemical signatures is a topic of ongoing debate. The competing interpretation, in the context of mantle plumes, is that the near-surface material is postulated to have been transported down to the core-mantle boundary by subducted slabs, and to have been transported back up to the surface by plumes.

The geochemical aspects of plumes also provide insights into the heterogeneities present in the mantle. The presence of mantle components in OIBs suggests that the mantle is not uniform in its chemical and isotopic composition. This heterogeneity is attributed to the mixing of near-surface materials in the mantle source, which introduces variations in the chemical and isotopic composition of the mantle.

In conclusion, the geochemical aspects of plumes provide valuable insights into the dynamics of Earth's interior. The analysis of radiogenic and stable isotopes in OIBs provides insights into the sources of mantle plumes and the heterogeneities present in the mantle. However, the interpretation of these geochemical signatures is a topic of ongoing debate, and further research is needed to fully understand the dynamics of Earth's interior.

## Chapter: Chapter 6: Plume-Lithosphere Interactions

### Introduction

The Earth's interior is a complex and dynamic system, with various processes interacting and influencing each other. One such interaction is the relationship between plumes and the lithosphere, a topic that will be explored in depth in this chapter. 

Plumes, as we have learned in previous chapters, are columns of hot, buoyant material that rise from the core-mantle boundary. They play a crucial role in the dynamics of the Earth's interior, influencing processes such as plate tectonics and the distribution of heat. On the other hand, the lithosphere, the outermost shell of the Earth, is a relatively rigid layer that floats on the semi-fluid asthenosphere. It is the lithosphere that forms the continents and oceanic crust.

The interaction between these two entities is a fascinating and complex topic. It involves the exchange of heat, material, and energy, and has profound implications for the evolution of the Earth's surface and interior. This chapter will delve into the mechanisms of this interaction, exploring how plumes interact with the lithosphere, and the implications of these interactions for the dynamics of the Earth's interior.

We will also explore the role of plumes in the formation of hotspots, such as the Hawaiian Islands, and how these hotspots interact with the lithosphere. This will involve a detailed examination of the geochemical aspects of these interactions, including the chemical composition of plumes and the lithosphere, and how these compositions change as a result of the interaction.

Finally, we will discuss the implications of these interactions for the future evolution of the Earth's interior and surface. This will involve a consideration of the long-term stability of the lithosphere, and the potential for future changes in the distribution of heat and material within the Earth.

In exploring these topics, we will be using a variety of geochemical and geophysical techniques, including seismic tomography, geochemical analysis, and numerical modeling. These techniques will allow us to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of the Earth's interior, and the role of plumes in these dynamics.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of plume-lithosphere interactions, combining theoretical discussion with practical examples and case studies. It is hoped that this will provide a solid foundation for further exploration and research in this fascinating field.

# Water in Geodynamics

## Chapter 6: Water in Geodynamics




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of mantle plumes, exploring their formation, evolution, and impact on the Earth's interior dynamics. Mantle plumes are a fundamental concept in geodynamics, representing a significant portion of the heat flow from the Earth's core-mantle boundary to the surface. They are believed to play a crucial role in the geological processes that shape our planet, including plate tectonics, volcanism, and the formation of hotspots.

We will begin by examining the formation of mantle plumes, exploring the conditions that give rise to these phenomena. This will involve a discussion on the role of convection in the mantle, and how it leads to the formation of plumes. We will also explore the various factors that can influence the strength and direction of convection, such as temperature, pressure, and the composition of the mantle.

Next, we will follow the journey of a mantle plume as it rises through the mantle. This will involve a detailed exploration of the processes that drive the plume's movement, including buoyancy, viscosity, and the Coriolis effect. We will also discuss the various obstacles that a plume may encounter as it rises, such as the 660 km discontinuity and the lithosphere, and how these can influence the plume's trajectory.

Finally, we will examine the impact of mantle plumes on the Earth's surface. This will involve a discussion on the role of mantle plumes in volcanism, including the formation of hotspots and mid-ocean ridges. We will also explore the potential role of mantle plumes in the formation of continents, and the implications of this for our understanding of Earth's history.

Through this exploration, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of mantle plumes, their formation, evolution, and impact on the Earth's interior dynamics. By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the role of mantle plumes in the geological processes that shape our planet, and the fascinating dynamics that govern their behavior.




### Subsection: 6.1a Plume Initiation and Formation

The initiation and formation of mantle plumes is a complex process that involves a series of interactions between various physical and chemical factors. In this section, we will explore the key mechanisms that drive the formation of mantle plumes, including the role of convection, the influence of temperature and pressure, and the impact of chemical reactions.

#### Convection and Plume Formation

Convection plays a crucial role in the formation of mantle plumes. As discussed in the previous chapter, convection is the process by which heat is transferred through a fluid medium by the movement of the fluid itself. In the Earth's mantle, convection is primarily driven by the heat generated by the core and the heat transferred from the surface.

The convective flow in the mantle is characterized by two distinct phases: the first phase involves the formation of large-scale cells, or eddies, which transport heat and material from the core-mantle boundary to the surface. The second phase, which is the focus of this chapter, involves the formation of smaller-scale plumes that transport heat and material from the surface back towards the core-mantle boundary.

The formation of mantle plumes is closely tied to the second phase of convection. As the mantle cools and becomes denser, it begins to sink towards the core-mantle boundary. However, if the mantle is heated by a thermal anomaly, such as a hotspot or a plume, it can become less dense and rise towards the surface. This process is known as buoyancy-driven convection and is a key mechanism in the formation of mantle plumes.

#### Temperature and Pressure Effects

Temperature and pressure also play a significant role in the formation of mantle plumes. As the mantle cools and becomes denser, it can form a layer of cold, dense material at the base of the mantle. This layer, known as the D" layer, acts as a barrier to the upward movement of mantle material.

However, if a thermal anomaly, such as a mantle plume, can penetrate this layer, it can continue to rise towards the surface. The temperature and pressure conditions in the mantle can also influence the stability of the plume. For example, at higher temperatures and pressures, the plume may be more buoyant and less likely to dissipate.

#### Chemical Reactions and Plume Formation

Chemical reactions also play a role in the formation of mantle plumes. As the mantle material rises towards the surface, it can undergo chemical reactions with the surface environment. These reactions can alter the physical and chemical properties of the mantle material, making it more buoyant and promoting the formation of a mantle plume.

For example, the reaction between mantle material and seawater can result in the formation of a hydrated mineral, such as serpentine. This mineral is less dense than the surrounding mantle material and can promote the formation of a mantle plume. Additionally, the reaction can also release heat, further enhancing the buoyancy of the mantle material.

In conclusion, the formation of mantle plumes is a complex process that involves a series of interactions between convection, temperature and pressure, and chemical reactions. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for exploring the dynamics of Earth's interior and the role of mantle plumes in geological processes.




### Subsection: 6.1b Plume Rise and Interaction with the Lithosphere

Once a mantle plume has formed, it begins to rise towards the surface. This rise is driven by the buoyancy force, which is the difference in density between the plume and the surrounding mantle. As the plume rises, it begins to interact with the lithosphere, the rigid outer layer of the Earth's surface.

#### Interaction with the Lithosphere

The interaction between a mantle plume and the lithosphere can have significant implications for the dynamics of the Earth's interior. As the plume rises, it can cause the lithosphere to bulge and thin, leading to the formation of hotspots and volcanic activity. This interaction can also result in the formation of mid-ocean ridges, which are linear features where new oceanic crust is formed.

The interaction between a mantle plume and the lithosphere can also influence the chemical composition of the mantle. As the plume rises, it can bring with it material from the core-mantle boundary, which can alter the chemical composition of the mantle. This can lead to changes in the chemical composition of volcanic eruptions, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of the Earth's interior.

#### Plume Rise and the Southwest Indian Ridge

The Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) is a mid-ocean ridge that is influenced by several mantle plumes. The interaction between these plumes and the lithosphere has resulted in significant changes in the structure and dynamics of the SWIR.

The SWIR is characterized by a series of major transform faults, which are associated with magnetic anomalies. These faults and anomalies are influenced by the interaction between the mantle plumes and the lithosphere. For example, the Marion hotspot, located near the Prince Edward FZ, has resulted in a significant increase in magma supply and thicker crust between Indomed and Gallieni FZs. This interaction has also led to the formation of the Crozet volcanic plateau, which is located approximately 10 million years ago.

The interaction between the mantle plumes and the lithosphere can also result in changes in the axial depth of the SWIR. Between Melville FZ and Rodrigues TJ, the SWIR is underlain by either thin crust or cold mantle, resulting in a shallow axial depth. However, between Andrew Bain FZ and Discovery FZ, the interaction with the Marion hotspot results in a deeper axial depth.

In conclusion, the interaction between mantle plumes and the lithosphere plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the Earth's interior. It can result in significant changes in the structure and dynamics of mid-ocean ridges, such as the Southwest Indian Ridge, and can provide valuable insights into the processes occurring in the Earth's mantle.





### Subsection: 6.1c Plume Decay and Implications for Plate Tectonics

As a mantle plume rises towards the surface, it begins to cool and lose its buoyancy. This leads to the decay of the plume, which can have significant implications for the dynamics of the Earth's interior.

#### Plume Decay

The decay of a mantle plume is a complex process that involves the transfer of heat and material from the plume to the surrounding mantle. As the plume rises, it brings with it material from the core-mantle boundary, which can alter the chemical composition of the mantle. This material can then interact with the lithosphere, leading to changes in volcanic activity and the formation of hotspots and mid-ocean ridges.

The decay of a mantle plume can also have implications for plate tectonics. As the plume cools and loses its buoyancy, it can cause the lithosphere to sink back into the mantle. This can result in the formation of subduction zones, where one plate is forced beneath another. This process can also lead to the formation of volcanic arcs, which are chains of volcanoes that form along the edges of oceanic plates.

#### Implications for Plate Tectonics

The decay of mantle plumes can have a significant impact on the dynamics of the Earth's interior. As plumes decay and interact with the lithosphere, they can cause changes in volcanic activity and the formation of hotspots and mid-ocean ridges. These changes can then influence the movement of plates and the formation of new crust, which are key processes in plate tectonics.

Furthermore, the decay of mantle plumes can also lead to changes in the chemical composition of the mantle. This can have implications for the geochemical signatures of volcanic eruptions, which can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the Earth's interior.

In conclusion, the decay of mantle plumes is a crucial process in the dynamics of the Earth's interior. It can have significant implications for volcanic activity, plate tectonics, and the chemical composition of the mantle. Further research and study of mantle plumes and their decay processes will continue to enhance our understanding of the Earth's interior and its evolution.

## Chapter: Geodynamics: Exploring the Dynamics of Earth's Interior

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of mantle convection, a fundamental process that drives the dynamics of Earth's interior. The mantle is the largest layer of the Earth, extending from a depth of approximately 100 km to 2,890 km. It is a solid-like material, but it is also capable of flowing over long periods of time, which is crucial for the movement of tectonic plates. The convection of the mantle plays a crucial role in the distribution of heat and the movement of tectonic plates, which in turn affects the Earth's surface and its evolution.

Mantle convection is a complex process that involves the transfer of heat from the core to the surface. It is driven by the buoyancy force, which is the difference in density between the hotter and colder regions of the mantle. As the hotter material rises, it cools and becomes denser, while the colder material sinks. This continuous cycle of convection helps to distribute heat throughout the mantle, which is essential for maintaining the Earth's internal temperature.

In this chapter, we will explore the various aspects of mantle convection, including its causes, mechanisms, and effects. We will also discuss the different types of mantle convection, such as thermal and compositional convection, and how they interact with each other. Additionally, we will examine the role of mantle convection in the formation of hotspots and mid-ocean ridges, which are important features of the Earth's surface.

Understanding mantle convection is crucial for understanding the dynamics of Earth's interior.

### Subsection: 6.1d Plume Recycling and Long-term Mantle Evolution

As mantle plumes rise towards the surface, they bring with them material from the core-mantle boundary. This material can have a significant impact on the dynamics of the Earth's interior, particularly in terms of long-term mantle evolution.

#### Plume Recycling

The process of plume recycling refers to the re-introduction of material from the core-mantle boundary back into the mantle. This can occur through several mechanisms, including the sinking of the plume as it cools and loses its buoyancy, as well as the interaction of the plume with the lithosphere.

The sinking of the plume can lead to the formation of subduction zones, where one plate is forced beneath another. This can result in the formation of volcanic arcs, which are chains of volcanoes that form along the edges of oceanic plates. The material from the plume can also interact with the lithosphere, leading to changes in volcanic activity and the formation of hotspots and mid-ocean ridges.

#### Long-term Mantle Evolution

The recycling of mantle plumes can have significant implications for the long-term evolution of the Earth's mantle. As plumes rise and cool, they bring with them material from the core-mantle boundary. This material can alter the chemical composition of the mantle, leading to changes in the geochemical signatures of volcanic eruptions.

Furthermore, the recycling of plumes can also impact the dynamics of the Earth's interior. As plumes are re-introduced into the mantle, they can interact with other plumes and influence the movement of plates. This can lead to changes in the formation of new crust and the dynamics of plate tectonics.

#### Implications for Plate Tectonics

The recycling of mantle plumes can have significant implications for plate tectonics. As plumes are re-introduced into the mantle, they can interact with other plumes and influence the movement of plates. This can lead to changes in the formation of new crust and the dynamics of plate tectonics.

Furthermore, the recycling of plumes can also lead to changes in volcanic activity and the formation of hotspots and mid-ocean ridges. These changes can then influence the movement of plates and the formation of new crust, which are key processes in plate tectonics.

In conclusion, the recycling of mantle plumes plays a crucial role in the long-term evolution of the Earth's mantle and the dynamics of plate tectonics. As plumes rise and cool, they bring with them material from the core-mantle boundary, which can alter the chemical composition of the mantle and influence the movement of plates. This process is a key component of the Earth's dynamic system and will continue to shape the planet's surface in the future.

## Chapter 8: Plate Tectonics and Seismicity

### Introduction

The Earth's interior is a dynamic and complex system, constantly in motion and shaped by a multitude of forces. One of the most significant of these forces is plate tectonics, a theory that describes the large-scale motion of the Earth's lithosphere. This chapter, "Plate Tectonics and Seismicity," will delve into the fascinating world of plate tectonics, exploring its origins, mechanisms, and the profound impact it has on the Earth's surface and interior.

Plate tectonics is a theory that has revolutionized our understanding of the Earth's structure and evolution. It posits that the Earth's lithosphere, the thin outer shell of the Earth, is divided into several large and small plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere below. These plates move relative to each other, driven by the heat flow from the Earth's interior. This movement is responsible for a wide range of geological phenomena, from the formation of mountains and ocean basins to the occurrence of earthquakes and volcanic activity.

Seismicity, the study of earthquakes and seismic waves, is closely tied to plate tectonics. Earthquakes, for instance, often occur at the boundaries of these moving plates, where stresses and strains are concentrated. The study of seismicity provides valuable insights into the dynamics of plate tectonics, helping us understand how these plates move and interact.

In this chapter, we will explore these topics in depth, examining the principles and evidence that support the theory of plate tectonics, and the role of seismicity in understanding the Earth's interior dynamics. We will also discuss the latest research and advancements in these fields, shedding light on the ongoing processes that shape our planet.

As we journey through the world of plate tectonics and seismicity, we will gain a deeper appreciation for the complexity and beauty of the Earth's interior, and the intricate dance of forces that govern its evolution.

The mantle is a crucial component of the Earth's interior, lying between the crust and the core. It is a dynamic and complex system that plays a vital role in shaping the Earth's surface and its evolution over time. In this section, we will explore the structure and composition of the mantle, including its different layers and their properties.

#### 9.1a: Mantle Structure and Composition

The mantle is a solid-rock layer that makes up the majority of the Earth's interior. It is composed of silicate minerals, primarily olivine, pyroxene, and feldspar, with a small amount of iron and magnesium. The mantle is divided into two main layers: the upper mantle and the lower mantle.

The upper mantle is the thinnest layer of the mantle, with a thickness of approximately 100 km. It is composed of peridotite, a rock rich in iron and magnesium. The upper mantle is also where the Earth's convection currents begin, driven by the transfer of heat from the core.

Below the upper mantle is the lower mantle, which is much thicker, with a thickness of approximately 2,890 km. The lower mantle is composed of post-peridotite, a rock that is richer in iron and magnesium than the upper mantle. The lower mantle is also where the Earth's convection currents continue, with the movement of the mantle being driven by the transfer of heat from the core.

The composition of the mantle is crucial for understanding the dynamics of the Earth's interior. The mantle is primarily composed of silicate minerals, which have a high melting point. This allows the mantle to remain solid at the high temperatures and pressures found in the Earth's interior. However, the mantle is also capable of melting, which is responsible for the formation of new crust and the recycling of old crust.

The mantle also plays a crucial role in the Earth's energy budget. The mantle is responsible for transferring heat from the core to the crust, which is responsible for the Earth's heat flow. The mantle also plays a role in the generation of the Earth's magnetic field, which protects the Earth from harmful solar radiation.

In addition to its role in heat transfer and magnetic generation, the mantle also plays a crucial role in the water cycle. The mantle is responsible for the movement of water through the Earth's interior, which is essential for the formation of oceans and the distribution of water on the Earth's surface.

In conclusion, the mantle is a complex and dynamic system that plays a vital role in shaping the Earth's surface and its evolution over time.

The mantle's convection currents play a significant role in this process, as they help to distribute heat throughout the Earth's interior.

### Subsection: 9.1b Mantle Dynamics

The mantle is a dynamic system that is constantly in motion due to the transfer of heat from the core. This movement is responsible for the formation of new crust and the recycling of old crust, which is essential for the Earth's evolution.

One of the key processes that drives mantle dynamics is convection. Convection is the transfer of heat through the movement of a fluid, in this case, the mantle. As the mantle is heated by the core, it becomes less dense and rises towards the surface. As it cools and becomes denser, it sinks back down towards the core. This process creates convection currents that flow through the mantle, transporting heat and driving the movement of the mantle.

Another important process that affects mantle dynamics is subduction. Subduction occurs when one tectonic plate is forced beneath another plate at a convergent plate boundary. As the plate sinks into the mantle, it carries with it a portion of the overlying crust. This process is responsible for the formation of deep ocean trenches and volcanic arcs, as well as the recycling of old crust.

The mantle also plays a crucial role in the Earth's magnetic field. The outer core, which is composed of liquid iron, is responsible for generating the Earth's magnetic field.

 9.1: The Mantle

The mantle is a crucial component of the Earth's interior, lying between the crust and the core. It is a dynamic and complex system that plays a vital role in shaping the Earth's surface and its evolution over time. In this section, we will explore the structure and composition of the mantle, including its different layers and their properties.

#### 9.1a: Mantle Structure and Composition

The mantle is a solid-rock layer that makes up the majority of the Earth's interior. It is composed of silicate minerals, primarily olivine, pyroxene, and feldspar, with a small amount of iron and magnesium. The mantle is divided into two main layers: the upper mantle and the lower mantle.

The upper mantle is the thinnest layer of the mantle, with a thickness of approximately 100 km. It is composed of peridotite, a rock rich in iron and magnesium. The upper mantle is also where the Earth's convection currents begin, driven by the transfer of heat from the core.

Below the upper mantle is the lower mantle, which is much thicker, with a thickness of approximately 2,890 km. The lower mantle is composed of post-peridotite, a rock that is richer in iron and magnesium than the upper mantle. The lower mantle is also where the Earth's convection currents continue, with the movement of the mantle being driven by the transfer of heat from the core.

The composition of the mantle is crucial for understanding the dynamics of the Earth's interior. The mantle is primarily composed of silicate minerals, which have a high melting point. This allows the mantle to remain solid at the high temperatures and pressures found in the Earth's interior. However, the mantle is also capable of melting, which is responsible for the formation of new crust and the recycling of old crust.

The mantle also plays a crucial role in the Earth's energy budget. The mantle is responsible for transferring heat from the core to the crust, which is crucial for the Earth's geodynamics. The mantle's convection currents play a significant role in this process, as they help to distribute heat throughout the Earth's interior.

### Subsection: 9.1b Mantle Dynamics

The mantle is a dynamic system that is constantly in motion due to the transfer of heat from the core. This movement is responsible for the formation of new crust and the recycling of old crust, which is essential for the Earth's evolution.

One of the key processes that drives mantle dynamics is convection. Convection is the transfer of heat through the movement of a fluid, in this case, the mantle. As the mantle is heated by the core, it becomes less dense and rises towards the surface. As it cools and becomes denser, it sinks back down towards the core, creating a continuous cycle of movement.

Another important process that affects mantle dynamics is subduction. Subduction occurs when one tectonic plate is forced beneath another plate at a convergent plate boundary. As the plate sinks into the mantle, it carries with it a portion of the overlying crust. This process is responsible for the formation of deep ocean trenches and volcanic arcs, as well as the recycling of old crust.

The mantle also plays a crucial role in the Earth's magnetic field. The mantle's convection currents help to generate and maintain the Earth's magnetic field, which protects the Earth from harmful solar radiation. Changes in mantle dynamics can have a significant impact on the Earth's magnetic field, making it an important area of study in geodynamics.

In conclusion, the mantle is a complex and dynamic system that plays a crucial role in the Earth's interior. Its structure, composition, and dynamics are essential for understanding the dynamics of the Earth's interior and its evolution over time. Further research and study of the mantle will continue to deepen our understanding of this fascinating aspect of geodynamics.

### Section: 10.1 Plume Dynamics:

Mantle plumes are a fundamental aspect of the Earth's dynamics, playing a crucial role in plate tectonics and the formation of hotspots. In this section, we will delve into the dynamics of mantle plumes, exploring their formation, behavior, and impact on the Earth's surface.

#### 10.1a Formation of Mantle Plumes

Mantle plumes are believed to originate from the core-mantle boundary, a region located at a depth of approximately 3,000 km. This boundary is characterized by a sharp increase in temperature and pressure, which is thought to cause the formation of plumes. The exact mechanism by which these plumes form is still a subject of ongoing research, but it is believed that the buoyancy of the hot material plays a significant role.

The formation of mantle plumes is closely linked to the process of subduction, where oceanic crust and lithosphere are forced down into the mantle. As the subducted material descends, it encounters the core-mantle boundary. The high temperatures and pressures at this boundary cause the subducted material to become less dense, creating a buoyant force that drives it back up towards the surface. This upward movement forms a plume, which can reach the surface as a volcanic hotspot.

The formation of mantle plumes is also influenced by the chemical and isotopic composition of the subducted material. As mentioned in the previous chapter, the geochemical signature of ocean island basalts (OIBs) provides valuable insights into the dynamics of mantle plumes. The presence of mantle components such as DMM, HIMU, EM1, EM2, and FOZO in OIBs suggests that the subducted material is being transported down to the core-mantle boundary and back up to the surface by mantle plumes.

#### 10.1b Role of Mantle Plumes in Plate Tectonics

Mantle plumes play a crucial role in plate tectonics, particularly in the formation of hotspots. Hotspots are regions of volcanic activity that are not associated with plate boundaries. They are believed to be caused by mantle plumes that reach the surface, bringing with them heat and melting the surrounding crust. This results in the formation of volcanic structures such as shield volcanoes and calderas.

The role of mantle plumes in plate tectonics is also evident in the geochemical signature of OIBs. The presence of mantle components in OIBs suggests that the subducted material is being transported by mantle plumes, which can have a significant impact on the chemical and isotopic composition of the volcanic products. This can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of mantle plumes and their role in plate tectonics.

#### 10.1c Future Directions in Mantle Plume Research

Despite significant advancements in our understanding of mantle plumes, there are still many unanswered questions and areas for future research. One of the key areas is the direct observation of mantle plumes. While seismic tomography has provided valuable insights into the dynamics of mantle plumes, direct observation would provide a more comprehensive understanding of their behavior.

Another area for future research is the study of the chemical and isotopic composition of OIBs. By analyzing a larger and more diverse sample of OIBs, researchers can gain a better understanding of the geochemical processes occurring in mantle plumes and their impact on the Earth's surface.

Furthermore, advancements in technology and modeling techniques can also provide valuable insights into the dynamics of mantle plumes. For example, the use of high-resolution seismic imaging and numerical models can help to better understand the formation and behavior of mantle plumes.

In conclusion, the study of mantle plumes is a rapidly evolving field, with many exciting opportunities for future research. By continuing to explore the dynamics of mantle plumes, we can gain a deeper understanding of the Earth's interior and its evolution.

#### 10.1b Role of Mantle Plumes in Plate Tectonics

Mantle plumes play a crucial role in plate tectonics, particularly in the formation of hotspots. Hotspots are regions of volcanic activity that are not associated with plate boundaries. The presence of hotspots can be explained by the dynamics of mantle plumes.

As mantle plumes rise towards the surface, they can create hotspots due to the heat they carry from the core-mantle boundary. This heat can cause the melting of the subducted material, leading to the formation of volcanic activity. The presence of hotspots can also be used to identify the presence of mantle plumes.

#### 10.1c Mantle Plume Dynamics and Earth's Thermal Evolution

The dynamics of mantle plumes also play a crucial role in the thermal evolution of the Earth. As mantle plumes rise towards the surface, they carry heat from the core-mantle boundary. This heat can contribute to the overall heat budget of the Earth, influencing its thermal evolution.

The presence of mantle plumes can also affect the Earth's thermal evolution by altering the convection patterns in the mantle. As mantle plumes rise towards the surface, they can disrupt the convection patterns, leading to changes in the Earth's thermal structure. This can have implications for the Earth's long-term thermal evolution and the dynamics of plate tectonics.

In conclusion, mantle plumes play a crucial role in the dynamics of the Earth's interior. Their formation, behavior, and impact on the Earth's surface are still subjects of ongoing research, but their role in plate tectonics and the thermal evolution of the Earth is well established. Further research in this field will continue to deepen our understanding of the complex dynamics of the Earth's interior.





### Section: 10.1d Mantle Plume Dynamics and Volcanism

Mantle plumes are a significant contributor to volcanism on Earth. The heat and material from mantle plumes can cause volcanic activity, leading to the formation of volcanic structures such as calderas, lava domes, and basaltic shields. The composition of the volcanic products can also provide insights into the dynamics of mantle plumes.

#### 10.1d.1 Volcanic Activity and Mantle Plumes

The volcanic activity associated with mantle plumes is typically characterized by the eruption of basaltic magmas. These magmas are derived from the partial melting of the mantle, which is triggered by the high temperatures and pressures of mantle plumes. The composition of these magmas can vary depending on the source of the mantle material and the degree of melting.

The eruption of basaltic magmas can lead to the formation of various volcanic structures. For instance, the eruption of viscous basaltic magmas can result in the formation of lava domes, which are characteristic of volcanic fields such as the Yellowstone Caldera. On the other hand, the eruption of more fluid basaltic magmas can lead to the formation of basaltic shields, which are common in mid-ocean ridges and ocean island basalts.

The composition of the volcanic products can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of mantle plumes. For instance, the presence of mantle components such as DMM, HIMU, EM1, EM2, and FOZO in the volcanic products suggests that the mantle material is being transported down to the core-mantle boundary and back up to the surface by mantle plumes.

Moreover, the isotopic composition of the volcanic products can also provide insights into the origin of the mantle material. For instance, the presence of high U/Pb-ratio mantle (HIMU) suggests that the mantle material is being transported from the Pacific Ocean, while the presence of enriched mantle 1 (EM1) suggests that the mantle material is being transported from the Indian Ocean.

In conclusion, the study of mantle plume dynamics and volcanism is crucial for understanding the dynamics of Earth's interior. It provides insights into the processes that drive plate tectonics and the formation of volcanic structures. Furthermore, it allows us to understand the origin of the mantle material and the role of mantle plumes in the global heat budget.

### Section: 11.1 Plume Geochemistry:

Mantle plumes are a significant component of the Earth's geodynamics, playing a crucial role in the distribution of heat and the formation of geological features. In this section, we will delve into the geochemistry of mantle plumes, exploring the chemical and physical processes that govern these phenomena.

#### 11.1a Geochemical Signatures of Mantle Plumes

The geochemical signatures of mantle plumes are primarily determined by the composition of the mantle source from which they originate. The mantle source of mantle plumes is postulated to be the core-mantle boundary at 3,000 km depth. This source is characterized by high temperatures and pressures, which can significantly influence the geochemical properties of the plumes.

One of the key geochemical signatures of mantle plumes is their high heat content. The heat content of mantle plumes is primarily due to the advection of heat from the core-mantle boundary. This heat is transported upwards by the plumes, contributing to the overall heat budget of the Earth's interior.

The geochemical signatures of mantle plumes also include their chemical composition. The chemical composition of mantle plumes is primarily determined by the composition of the mantle source from which they originate. However, the interaction of mantle plumes with the surrounding mantle and crust can also influence their chemical composition.

The geochemical signatures of mantle plumes can be studied through various techniques, including geochemical analysis of volcanic rocks and gases, seismic tomography, and geophysical measurements.

#### 11.1b Plume Chemistry and Mantle Convection

The interaction between mantle plumes and mantle convection is a critical aspect of mantle plume geochemistry. Mantle convection is the process by which heat is transported from the core-mantle boundary to the surface, driving plate tectonics and other geological processes. The interaction between mantle plumes and mantle convection can significantly influence the geochemical properties of mantle plumes.

Mantle plumes can interact with mantle convection in several ways. First, mantle plumes can interact with the surrounding mantle flow. This interaction can influence the direction and intensity of mantle plumes, affecting their geochemical properties. For example, if a mantle plume interacts with a mantle flow that is moving in the opposite direction, it can cause the plume to deflect or even reverse its direction. This interaction can also influence the heat content of the plume, as the interaction can cause the plume to lose heat to the surrounding mantle.

Second, mantle plumes can interact with the mantle boundary layer. The mantle boundary layer is a thin layer of mantle that lies just above the core-mantle boundary. This layer is characterized by high temperatures and pressures, and it plays a crucial role in the dynamics of mantle plumes. The interaction between mantle plumes and the mantle boundary layer can influence the geochemical properties of the plumes, as the layer can absorb and release heat and chemical species.

Third, mantle plumes can interact with the crust. The interaction between mantle plumes and the crust can occur when a mantle plume reaches the surface and forms a volcanic structure. This interaction can influence the geochemical properties of the plume, as the crust can absorb and release heat and chemical species.

The interaction between mantle plumes and mantle convection can be studied through various techniques, including geochemical analysis of volcanic rocks and gases, seismic tomography, and geophysical measurements. These techniques can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of mantle plumes and their interaction with mantle convection.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the geochemistry of mantle plumes, exploring the chemical and physical processes that govern these phenomena. We will also discuss the implications of mantle plume geochemistry for our understanding of the Earth's geodynamics.

#### 11.1c Plume Geochemistry and Hotspots

Hotspots are regions on the Earth's surface characterized by volcanic activity that is not associated with plate boundaries. These hotspots are often associated with mantle plumes, which are columns of hot, buoyant material that rise from the core-mantle boundary. The interaction between mantle plumes and hotspots is a key aspect of mantle plume geochemistry.

Hotspots can be studied through various techniques, including geochemical analysis of volcanic rocks and gases, seismic tomography, and geophysical measurements. These techniques can provide valuable insights into the composition and dynamics of mantle plumes.

One of the key geochemical signatures of mantle plumes is their high heat content. This heat content is primarily due to the advection of heat from the core-mantle boundary. The interaction between mantle plumes and hotspots can significantly influence the heat content of the plumes. For example, if a mantle plume interacts with a hotspot, it can cause the plume to release more heat to the surface, leading to increased volcanic activity.

The interaction between mantle plumes and hotspots can also influence the chemical composition of the plumes. Hotspots can absorb and release chemical species, which can affect the geochemical properties of the plumes. For example, if a mantle plume interacts with a hotspot, it can cause the plume to absorb chemical species from the hotspot, leading to changes in the chemical composition of the plume.

The interaction between mantle plumes and hotspots can also influence the direction and intensity of mantle plumes. For example, if a mantle plume interacts with a hotspot, it can cause the plume to deflect or even reverse its direction. This interaction can also influence the heat content of the plume, as the interaction can cause the plume to lose heat to the surrounding mantle.

In conclusion, the interaction between mantle plumes and hotspots is a critical aspect of mantle plume geochemistry. It can significantly influence the heat content, chemical composition, and direction of mantle plumes, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of the Earth's interior.

### Section: 11.1b Geochemical Tracers in Mantle Plume Studies

Geochemical tracers play a crucial role in the study of mantle plumes. These tracers provide a means to track the movement of mantle plumes and their interaction with the surrounding mantle and crust. In this section, we will explore the various geochemical tracers used in mantle plume studies and their significance.

#### 11.1b.1 Radiogenic Isotopes

Radiogenic isotopes, particularly those of strontium (Sr), neodymium (Nd), and lead (Pb), are commonly used as geochemical tracers in mantle plume studies. These isotopes are produced by the radioactive decay of parent elements, such as potassium (K), uranium (U), and thorium (Th), respectively. The decay rates of these parent elements are known, allowing us to determine the age of the mantle plume based on the ratio of parent to daughter isotopes.

The use of radiogenic isotopes as tracers is particularly useful in the study of mantle plumes due to their long half-lives. For example, the half-life of uranium-238, a parent element of lead-206, is 4.47 billion years. This means that the decay of uranium-238 to lead-206 can be used to date mantle plumes that are billions of years old.

#### 11.1b.2 Stable Isotopes

Stable isotopes, such as oxygen (O), carbon (C), and nitrogen (N), are also used as geochemical tracers in mantle plume studies. These isotopes have different masses and chemical properties, which can be used to trace the movement of mantle plumes.

For example, the isotopic composition of oxygen can provide insights into the origin of mantle plumes. Oxygen-18, which is heavier than oxygen-16, is preferentially removed from the mantle through the formation of minerals such as olivine and pyroxene. This means that mantle plumes with a high oxygen-18 content are likely to have originated from a deep source within the mantle.

#### 11.1b.3 Geochemical Signatures

Geochemical signatures, such as the geochemical components DMM, HIMU, EM1, EM2, and FOZO, are also used as tracers in mantle plume studies. These signatures are determined by analyzing the chemical and isotopic composition of basalts found at hotspots.

The geochemical component DMM, for example, is characterized by a depleted mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) mantle signature. This component is thought to originate from the mixing of near-surface materials, such as subducted slabs and continental sediments, in the mantle source.

The geochemical component HIMU, on the other hand, is characterized by a high U/Pb-ratio mantle signature. This component is thought to originate from the mixing of deep mantle materials, such as those found at the core-mantle boundary.

### 11.1 Plume Geochemistry

#### 11.1a Plume Chemistry

The chemistry of mantle plumes is a complex and fascinating area of study. It involves the analysis of the chemical composition of the material that makes up the plume, as well as the processes that govern the formation and evolution of this material. 

The chemical composition of mantle plumes is largely determined by the processes that govern the formation of the plume. These processes include the melting of the mantle, the mixing of different mantle components, and the interaction of the plume material with the surrounding environment. 

The melting of the mantle is a crucial process in the formation of mantle plumes. This process is driven by the heat generated by the core and the decay of radioactive elements in the mantle. As the mantle heats up, it becomes less dense and begins to rise towards the surface. As the mantle rises, it undergoes partial melting, forming a mixture of solid and liquid material. This mixture is known as a magma.

The composition of the magma is largely determined by the composition of the mantle from which it originates. However, the composition of the mantle can vary significantly depending on its location and the processes that have acted upon it. For example, the mantle beneath oceanic crust is typically more iron and magnesium-rich than the mantle beneath continental crust. This is because the oceanic crust is younger and has not had time to interact with the surrounding environment, while the continental crust is older and has been enriched by the weathering of rocks on the surface.

The mixing of different mantle components is another important process in the formation of mantle plumes. This process occurs when the mantle plume interacts with the surrounding mantle. The mantle plume can bring up material from the core-mantle boundary, which can have a significant impact on the composition of the plume. This material can also interact with the surrounding mantle, leading to the formation of new minerals and the redistribution of elements.

The interaction of the plume material with the surrounding environment is the final process that governs the composition of mantle plumes. This interaction can occur at various stages, from the formation of the plume to its eruption at the surface. The interaction can involve the exchange of material with the surrounding mantle, the incorporation of sediment from the ocean floor, and the exposure of the plume material to the atmosphere and hydrosphere.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the geochemical properties of mantle plumes, focusing on the chemical and isotopic composition of the plume material. We will also discuss the processes that govern the formation and evolution of mantle plumes, and how these processes are influenced by the geochemical properties of the plume material.

#### 11.1b Plume Isotopes

The isotopic composition of mantle plumes is another crucial aspect of plume geochemistry. Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have different numbers of neutrons. The relative amounts of different isotopes of an element can provide valuable information about the processes that have acted upon the plume material.

The isotopic composition of mantle plumes is largely determined by the processes that govern the formation of the plume. These processes include the melting of the mantle, the mixing of different mantle components, and the interaction of the plume material with the surrounding environment.

The melting of the mantle can lead to the fractionation of isotopes. This is because different minerals have different melting points, and the melting process can separate these minerals, leading to changes in the isotopic composition of the remaining solid material. For example, the melting of olivine, a common mineral in the upper mantle, can lead to an increase in the isotopic composition of iron in the remaining solid material.

The mixing of different mantle components can also lead to changes in the isotopic composition of the plume material. This is because different mantle components can have different isotopic compositions, and the mixing process can lead to the homogenization of these compositions. For example, the mixing of a mantle component with a high isotopic composition of iron with a mantle component with a low isotopic composition of iron can lead to an intermediate isotopic composition of iron in the resulting plume material.

The interaction of the plume material with the surrounding environment can also lead to changes in the isotopic composition of the plume material. This is because the surrounding environment can contain elements with different isotopic compositions, and the interaction process can lead to the incorporation of these elements into the plume material. For example, the interaction of the plume material with seawater can lead to the incorporation of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes from the seawater into the plume material.

In conclusion, the isotopic composition of mantle plumes is a complex and fascinating area of study. It provides valuable insights into the processes that govern the formation and evolution of mantle plumes, and it has important implications for our understanding of the dynamics of Earth's interior.

#### 11.1c Plume Melting

The melting of mantle plumes is a complex process that is influenced by a variety of factors, including the composition of the mantle, the temperature and pressure conditions, and the presence of volatiles. This process plays a crucial role in the geochemistry of mantle plumes, as it can lead to significant changes in the chemical and isotopic composition of the plume material.

The melting of mantle plumes can occur in two main ways: fractional melting and partial melting. Fractional melting occurs when different minerals in the mantle melt at different temperatures. This can lead to the separation of the mantle into different layers, each with its own melting point. Partial melting, on the other hand, occurs when all of the mantle melts, but not completely. This can lead to the formation of a magma with a complex composition, as different minerals melt at different rates.

The melting of mantle plumes can also lead to the formation of different types of magmas. For example, the melting of a mantle plume beneath an oceanic crust can lead to the formation of a basaltic magma, while the melting of a mantle plume beneath a continental crust can lead to the formation of a more silica-rich magma.

The melting of mantle plumes can also have important implications for the geochemistry of the plume material. For example, the melting of a mantle plume can lead to the release of volatiles, such as water and carbon dioxide, which can significantly alter the chemical and isotopic composition of the plume material. This can be particularly important in the context of mantle plume geochemistry, as the release of volatiles can lead to changes in the isotopic composition of elements such as hydrogen and oxygen, which can provide valuable insights into the processes that have acted upon the plume material.

In conclusion, the melting of mantle plumes is a complex process that plays a crucial role in the geochemistry of mantle plumes. It can lead to significant changes in the chemical and isotopic composition of the plume material, and it can also have important implications for the formation of different types of magmas.

#### 11.1d Plume Recycling

The recycling of mantle plumes is a critical process in the dynamics of Earth's interior. It involves the return of material from the surface back into the mantle, and it can have significant implications for the geochemistry of mantle plumes.

The recycling of mantle plumes can occur through a variety of mechanisms, including subduction, sedimentation, and volcanic activity. Subduction occurs when one of the tectonic plates that make up the Earth's surface is forced beneath another plate. This can lead to the return of surface material, including sediment and volcanic rocks, back into the mantle. Sedimentation, on the other hand, involves the deposition of sediment at the bottom of the ocean or on the seafloor. This sediment can eventually be subducted and returned to the mantle. Volcanic activity, including volcanic eruptions and the formation of volcanic rocks, can also contribute to the recycling of mantle plumes.

The recycling of mantle plumes can have important implications for the geochemistry of mantle plumes. For example, the return of surface material back into the mantle can lead to changes in the chemical and isotopic composition of the mantle. This can be particularly important in the context of mantle plume geochemistry, as the return of surface material can lead to changes in the isotopic composition of elements such as hydrogen and oxygen, which can provide valuable insights into the processes that have acted upon the plume material.

The recycling of mantle plumes can also have implications for the dynamics of Earth's interior. For example, the return of surface material back into the mantle can help to balance the heat budget of the Earth, as the heat contained in the surface material is transferred back into the mantle. This can help to prevent the Earth from overheating, and it can also contribute to the formation of new crust on the surface.

In conclusion, the recycling of mantle plumes is a crucial process in the dynamics of Earth's interior. It can have significant implications for the geochemistry of mantle plumes, and it can also contribute to the balance of heat and the formation of new crust on the surface.

## Chapter 12: Mantle Plume Geophysics




### Introduction

The Earth's mantle is a dynamic and complex system, constantly in motion and playing a crucial role in the planet's evolution. One of the key processes that drive the mantle's dynamics is mantle plumes, which are columns of hot material that rise from the core-mantle boundary to the surface. These plumes have been a subject of intense study in the field of geodynamics, due to their potential role in plate tectonics, the formation of hotspots, and the distribution of heat within the Earth.

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of mantle plume geophysics, exploring the physical processes that drive these plumes and their implications for the Earth's interior dynamics. We will begin by discussing the basic principles of mantle plumes, including their formation, structure, and behavior. We will then move on to more advanced topics, such as the role of mantle plumes in plate tectonics and the generation of heat within the Earth.

Throughout this chapter, we will use mathematical equations to describe the physical processes involved in mantle plume dynamics. For example, we might use the equation `$\Delta w = ...$` to describe the change in the velocity of a mantle plume over time. These equations will be rendered using the MathJax library, a popular tool for displaying mathematical expressions in web pages.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of the principles and processes involved in mantle plume geophysics, and be able to apply this knowledge to further explore the dynamics of the Earth's interior.




#### 12.1a Geophysical Observations of Mantle Plumes

Geophysical observations have been instrumental in our understanding of mantle plumes. These observations have been made using a variety of techniques, including seismic tomography, gravity measurements, and heat flow studies. 

##### Seismic Tomography

Seismic tomography has been a particularly useful tool in studying mantle plumes. This technique involves analyzing the speed of seismic waves to create a three-dimensional image of the Earth's interior. The speed of seismic waves is affected by the temperature and composition of the material through which they travel. By mapping variations in wave speed, seismic tomography can provide insights into the structure and dynamics of the mantle.

One of the key findings from seismic tomography is the existence of low-velocity anomalies (LVAs) in the mantle. These regions, which are characterized by lower than average seismic wave speeds, are often associated with mantle plumes. The presence of LVAs beneath hotspots, such as the Hawaiian Islands and the Yellowstone Caldera, is consistent with the hypothesis that these regions are being heated by mantle plumes.

##### Gravity Measurements

Gravity measurements have also been used to study mantle plumes. The Earth's gravity field is influenced by the distribution of mass within the planet. Changes in the density of the mantle can result in variations in the Earth's gravity field. By analyzing these variations, scientists can infer the presence and movement of mantle plumes.

Gravity measurements have been particularly useful in studying the Hawaiian Islands. These measurements have revealed a pattern of gravity anomalies that is consistent with the presence of a mantle plume beneath the islands. This plume is thought to be responsible for the formation of the Hawaiian Islands and their unique volcanic activity.

##### Heat Flow Studies

Heat flow studies have also been used to investigate mantle plumes. The Earth's mantle is a major source of heat, and variations in heat flow can provide insights into the dynamics of the mantle. By measuring the heat flow at the surface, scientists can estimate the amount of heat being generated within the mantle.

Heat flow studies have been particularly useful in studying the Yellowstone Caldera. These studies have revealed a high heat flow beneath the caldera, which is consistent with the presence of a mantle plume. This plume is thought to be responsible for the formation of the caldera and its associated volcanic activity.

In conclusion, geophysical observations have been crucial in our understanding of mantle plumes. These observations have provided valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of the mantle, and have helped to confirm the existence of mantle plumes. However, further research is needed to fully understand the complex dynamics of the Earth's interior.

#### 12.1b Plume Dynamics and Mantle Convection

The dynamics of mantle plumes and their interaction with mantle convection are complex and still not fully understood. However, recent studies have provided valuable insights into these processes.

##### Plume Dynamics

Mantle plumes are thought to originate from the core-mantle boundary, where they are initiated by thermal buoyancy. As the plume rises, it cools and densifies, and may eventually sink back into the mantle. This process is known as the "plume cycle". The duration of the plume cycle is still a subject of debate, with estimates ranging from a few hundred thousand years to several million years.

The dynamics of mantle plumes are also influenced by the Coriolis effect, which is caused by the Earth's rotation. This effect can deflect the path of the plume, causing it to deviate from a purely vertical trajectory. The Coriolis effect is particularly significant in the oceans, where it can cause plumes to be deflected towards the western margins of oceanic plates.

##### Mantle Convection

Mantle convection is a key process in the dynamics of the Earth's interior. It is responsible for the movement of heat from the core to the surface, and plays a crucial role in plate tectonics. The interaction between mantle plumes and mantle convection is a topic of ongoing research.

Recent studies have suggested that mantle plumes can interact with mantle convection in a variety of ways. For example, plumes can enhance convection by providing additional heat and buoyancy. Conversely, plumes can also inhibit convection by creating regions of low velocity and high viscosity.

The interaction between mantle plumes and mantle convection is also thought to play a role in the formation of hotspots. Hotspots are regions of enhanced volcanic activity that are not associated with plate boundaries. The presence of hotspots is often interpreted as evidence for mantle plumes, and their distribution is consistent with the predicted pathways of mantle plumes.

In conclusion, the dynamics of mantle plumes and their interaction with mantle convection are complex and still not fully understood. However, recent studies have provided valuable insights into these processes, and ongoing research is expected to further advance our understanding of these phenomena.

#### 12.1c Plume Interactions with the Lithosphere

The interaction between mantle plumes and the lithosphere, the outermost shell of the Earth, is a crucial aspect of mantle plume geophysics. This interaction can be studied through various geophysical methods, including seismic tomography and gravity measurements.

##### Seismic Tomography

Seismic tomography provides a three-dimensional image of the Earth's interior structure. It is based on the analysis of seismic wave speeds, which are affected by the temperature and composition of the material through which they travel. The tomographic images can reveal the presence and movement of mantle plumes beneath the lithosphere.

Recent seismic tomography studies have shown that mantle plumes can interact with the lithosphere in various ways. For instance, plumes can cause the lithosphere to bulge upwards, forming a "blister". This bulging can be observed as a high-velocity anomaly in the tomographic images. Alternatively, plumes can cause the lithosphere to sink downwards, forming a "hole". This sinking can be observed as a low-velocity anomaly in the tomographic images.

##### Gravity Measurements

Gravity measurements can also provide insights into the interaction between mantle plumes and the lithosphere. The Earth's gravity field is influenced by the distribution of mass within the planet. Changes in the mass distribution can result in variations in the gravity field, which can be detected using sensitive instruments.

Recent gravity measurements have revealed the presence of anomalies beneath hotspots, which are regions of enhanced volcanic activity. These anomalies are consistent with the presence of mantle plumes and their interaction with the lithosphere. For example, the Hawaiian Islands, which are located above a hotspot, exhibit a gravity anomaly that is consistent with the presence of a mantle plume.

##### Plume-Lithosphere Interactions and Hotspots

The interaction between mantle plumes and the lithosphere is thought to play a crucial role in the formation of hotspots. Hotspots are regions of enhanced volcanic activity that are not associated with plate boundaries. They are often interpreted as evidence for mantle plumes, and their distribution is consistent with the predicted pathways of mantle plumes.

The interaction between mantle plumes and the lithosphere can enhance the volcanic activity associated with hotspots. For instance, the interaction can cause the lithosphere to bulge upwards, forming a "blister". This bulging can increase the volume of magma generated by the plume, leading to more intense volcanic activity.

In conclusion, the interaction between mantle plumes and the lithosphere is a complex and dynamic process. It can be studied through various geophysical methods, and it plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the Earth's interior.

### Chemistry, heat flow and melting

The chemical and isotopic composition of basalts found at hotspots differs subtly from mid-ocean-ridge basalts. These basalts, also called ocean island basalts (OIBs), are analysed in their radiogenic and stable isotope compositions. In radiogenic isotope systems the originally subducted material creates diverging trends, termed mantle components. Identified mantle components are DMM (depleted mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) mantle), HIMU (high U/Pb-ratio mantle), EM1 (enriched mantle 1), EM2 (enriched mantle 2) and FOZO (focus zone). This geochemical signature arises from the mixing of near-surface materials such as subducted slabs and continental sediments, in the mantle source. There are two competing interpretations for this. In the context of mantle plumes, the near-surface material is postulated to have been transported down to the core-mantle boundary by subducted slabs, and to have been transported back up to the surface by plumes. In the context of the Plate hypothesis, subducted material is mostly re-circulated in the shallow mantle and tapped from there by volcanoes.

Stable isotopes like Fe are used to track processes that the uprising material experiences during melting.

The processing of oceanic crust, lithosphere, and sediment through a subduction zone decouples the water-soluble trace elements (e.g., K, Rb, Th) from the immobile trace elements (e.g., Ti, Nb, Ta), concentrating the immobile elements in the oceanic slab (the water-soluble elements are added to the crust in island arc volcanoes). Seismic tomography shows that subducted oceanic slabs sink as far as the bottom of the mantle transition zone at 650 km depth. Subduction to greater depths is less certain, but there is evidence that they may sink to mid-lower-mantle depths at about 1,500  km depth.

The source of mantle plumes is postulated to be the core-mantle boundary at 3,000  km depth. Because there is little material transport across

#### 13.1b Mantle Plume Petrology and Magma Generation

Mantle plumes play a crucial role in the generation of magma, which is the molten rock that forms volcanic structures. The petrology of mantle plumes can provide insights into the processes that lead to the generation of magma.

The generation of magma within mantle plumes is a complex process that involves the melting of the mantle material as it rises towards the surface.

### Section: 13.1 Plume Petrology:

Mantle plumes are a fascinating aspect of geodynamics, representing a complex interplay of heat, melting, and chemical reactions deep within the Earth's interior. In this section, we will delve into the petrology of mantle plumes, exploring their composition, origin, and the processes that shape them.

#### 13.1a Mantle Plume Petrology and Composition

The composition of mantle plumes is a key aspect of their study. As we have seen in the previous section, the chemical and isotopic composition of basalts found at hotspots differs subtly from mid-ocean-ridge basalts. These basalts, also called ocean island basalts (OIBs), are analyzed in their radiogenic and stable isotope compositions. 

In radiogenic isotope systems, the originally subducted material creates diverging trends, termed mantle components. Identified mantle components are DMM (depleted mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) mantle), HIMU (high U/Pb-ratio mantle), EM1 (enriched mantle 1), EM2 (enriched mantle 2) and FOZO (focus zone). This geochemical signature arises from the mixing of near-surface materials such as subducted slabs and continental sediments, in the mantle source.

Seismic tomography shows that subducted oceanic slabs sink as far as the bottom of the mantle transition zone at 650 km depth. Subduction to greater depths is less certain, but there is evidence that they may sink to mid-lower-mantle depths at about 1,500  km depth.

The source of mantle plumes is postulated to be the core-mantle boundary at 3,000  km depth. Because there is little material transport across this boundary, the composition of mantle plumes is thought to reflect the composition of the core-mantle boundary. This is supported by the observation that mantle plumes have a high iron content, similar to the core.

In the next section, we will explore the processes that drive the formation and evolution of mantle plumes, and how these processes shape the composition of mantle plumes.

#### 13.1b Mantle Plume Petrology and Volcanic Rocks

The study of mantle plumes is not only about understanding the composition of the plumes themselves, but also about understanding the volcanic rocks that they produce. These rocks, known as volcanic rocks, provide valuable insights into the processes that occur within the mantle plumes.

Volcanic rocks are formed when molten rock, or magma, is extruded onto the Earth's surface. The composition of these rocks can vary greatly, depending on the composition of the mantle plume from which they originate. For example, the Hawaiian Islands, which are formed by a mantle plume, have a distinct volcanic rock composition compared to other volcanic regions.

The Hawaiian Islands are formed by a hotspot in the Earth's mantle, which produces a mantle plume. This plume is thought to originate from the core-mantle boundary, at a depth of 3,000  km. As the plume rises towards the surface, it undergoes melting and differentiation, producing a variety of volcanic rocks.

The composition of these volcanic rocks can be analyzed using various techniques, such as radiogenic and stable isotope analysis. This analysis can provide insights into the processes that occur within the mantle plume, such as the mixing of near-surface materials and the decoupling of water-soluble and immobile trace elements.

For example, the Hawaiian Islands are known for their basaltic volcanic rocks, which are rich in iron and magnesium. This is consistent with the high iron content of mantle plumes, and suggests that the Hawaiian mantle plume is indeed originating from the core-mantle boundary.

In addition to their composition, volcanic rocks can also provide insights into the structure of the mantle plume. For example, the presence of certain minerals or the lack thereof can indicate the depth at which the mantle plume is originating.

In conclusion, the study of mantle plume petrology is not only about understanding the composition of the plumes themselves, but also about understanding the volcanic rocks that they produce. These rocks provide valuable insights into the processes that occur within the mantle plumes, and can help us to better understand the dynamics of the Earth's interior.

#### 13.1c Mantle Plume Petrology and Volcanic Rocks

The study of mantle plume petrology is not only about understanding the composition of the plumes themselves, but also about understanding the volcanic rocks that they produce. These rocks, known as volcanic rocks, provide valuable insights into the processes that occur within the mantle plumes.

Volcanic rocks are formed when molten rock, or magma, is extruded onto the Earth's surface.

In addition to their composition, volcanic rocks can also provide insights into the structure of the mantle plume. For example, the presence of certain minerals or the lack thereof can indicate the depth at which the mantle plume is originating.

For instance, the presence of olivine, a common mineral in basaltic rocks, can indicate that the mantle plume is originating from a depth of less than 650  km. This is because olivine is stable at these shallow depths, and its presence suggests that the mantle plume has not yet reached the depths where it would be exposed to the high pressures and temperatures that would cause olivine to break down.

On the other hand, the absence of olivine can indicate that the mantle plume is originating from a depth of greater than 650  km. This is because olivine breaks down at these depths, and its absence suggests that the mantle plume has been exposed to these high pressures and temperatures.

In conclusion, the study of mantle plume petrology and volcanic rocks is a complex and multifaceted field that provides valuable insights into the dynamics of the Earth's interior. By analyzing the composition and structure of volcanic rocks, we can gain a deeper understanding of the processes that occur within mantle plumes, and the role they play in shaping the Earth's surface.

In the vast and complex world of geology, few phenomena are as intriguing and enigmatic as mantle plumes and hotspots. This chapter, "Mantle Plumes and Hotspots," delves into the fascinating dynamics of these two interconnected processes that play a crucial role in the Earth's interior.

Mantle plumes, also known as large low-shear-velocity provinces (LLSVPs), are columns of hot, buoyant material that rise from the core-mantle boundary towards the Earth's surface. They are believed to be responsible for the formation of hotspots, which are regions of intense volcanic activity not associated with plate boundaries. These hotspots, such as the Hawaiian Islands, the Yellowstone Caldera, and the Afar Triangle, are some of the most geologically active and visually stunning locations on our planet.

The study of mantle plumes and hotspots is a multidisciplinary field that combines elements of geophysics, geochemistry, and geology. It is a field that is constantly evolving as new research and technologies emerge. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of mantle plumes and hotspots, while also highlighting some of the ongoing debates and unanswered questions in this fascinating field.

We will explore the mechanisms behind the formation and movement of mantle plumes, and how they interact with the Earth's tectonic plates. We will also delve into the geochemical characteristics of hotspots, and how they can provide insights into the composition and dynamics of the Earth's mantle.

This chapter is designed to be accessible to both students and professionals in the field of geology. It is our hope that by the end of this chapter, readers will have a deeper understanding and appreciation for the complex and dynamic processes that occur deep within our planet.




### Section: 13.1d Mantle Plume Petrology and Earth's Crust Formation

The formation of the Earth's crust is a complex process that involves the interaction of various geological and geophysical factors. One of the key factors in this process is the role of mantle plumes. Mantle plumes are columns of hot, buoyant material that rise from the core-mantle boundary to the surface. These plumes play a crucial role in the formation of the Earth's crust, particularly in the formation of oceanic crust.

#### 13.1d.1 Mantle Plumes and Oceanic Crust Formation

The formation of oceanic crust is primarily driven by mantle plumes. As the Earth's plates move over the hot spots, the mantle plumes beneath these hot spots rise to the surface, creating new oceanic crust. This process is responsible for the formation of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the Pacific Ocean Ridge, and other mid-ocean ridges.

The composition of the mantle plumes plays a significant role in the formation of oceanic crust. The geochemical signature of the mantle plumes, as seen in the composition of the basalts found at hotspots, provides valuable insights into the processes occurring deep within the Earth's interior. The identification of mantle components such as DMM, HIMU, EM1, EM2, and FOZO in these basalts is a testament to the complex interplay of processes that shape the Earth's crust.

#### 13.1d.2 Mantle Plumes and Continental Crust Formation

While mantle plumes play a crucial role in the formation of oceanic crust, their role in the formation of continental crust is less clear. The Selli Event, a period of intense volcanism that occurred approximately 1.1 billion years ago, is believed to have been driven by mantle plumes. However, the exact role of mantle plumes in this event is still a subject of debate.

The composition of mantle plumes also plays a role in the formation of continental crust. The geochemical signature of mantle plumes can influence the composition of the magmas that form continental crust. For example, the presence of mantle plumes enriched in iron and magnesium can lead to the formation of basaltic magmas, which are the primary constituents of continental crust.

In conclusion, mantle plumes play a crucial role in the formation of the Earth's crust. Their role in oceanic crust formation is well understood, but their role in continental crust formation is still a subject of ongoing research. The study of mantle plume petrology provides valuable insights into the processes occurring deep within the Earth's interior and is a key area of study in the field of geodynamics.

### Introduction

The Earth's mantle is a dynamic and complex system, constantly in motion and playing a crucial role in the planet's evolution. One of the key processes that drives the mantle's dynamics is mantle plumes, which are columns of hot material that rise from the core-mantle boundary to the surface. These plumes have been linked to various geological phenomena, such as hotspots, mid-ocean ridges, and large igneous provinces.

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of mantle plume modelling. We will explore the various techniques and models used to study and understand these enigmatic structures. From numerical simulations to analytical models, we will examine how scientists have been able to shed light on the complex dynamics of mantle plumes.

We will begin by discussing the basic principles of mantle plumes, including their formation and evolution. We will then move on to explore the different types of mantle plume models, such as the thermal boundary layer model, the double-diffusive convection model, and the chemical convection model. Each of these models offers a unique perspective on mantle plumes and their role in the Earth's dynamics.

Furthermore, we will also discuss the challenges and limitations of mantle plume modelling. Despite the significant advancements in this field, there are still many unanswered questions and uncertainties that need to be addressed. We will also touch upon the future directions of mantle plume research and how modelling will continue to play a crucial role in our understanding of the Earth's interior.

Join us on this journey as we explore the dynamics of mantle plumes and their role in shaping our planet.




### Section: 14.1 Plume Modelling:

Mantle plumes are a fundamental aspect of the Earth's dynamics, playing a crucial role in the planet's evolution and geological phenomena. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of plume modelling, exploring the various techniques and models used to study and understand these enigmatic structures.

#### 14.1a Numerical Modelling of Mantle Plumes

Numerical modelling has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of mantle plumes. These models, which are based on the principles of fluid dynamics and heat transfer, allow us to simulate the complex interactions between the mantle and the core.

One of the most significant advancements in numerical mantle plume modelling has been the development of three-dimensional, time-dependent models. These models, which are based on the primitive equations of fluid dynamics, allow for a more realistic representation of the mantle's dynamics. They take into account the effects of rotation, stratification, and buoyancy, providing a more comprehensive understanding of mantle plumes.

The primitive equations of fluid dynamics, which are used in these models, can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{g}
$$

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0
$$

where $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity field, $p$ is the pressure field, $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, $\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration, and $\rho$ is the density field.

These equations are solved numerically using finite difference methods, allowing for the simulation of complex fluid dynamics. The boundary conditions are typically set at the core-mantle boundary, where the temperature and velocity are specified. The top boundary is often set as a free surface, allowing for the plume to rise and interact with the surface.

Numerical models have been used to investigate a variety of aspects of mantle plumes, including their formation, evolution, and interaction with the surface. They have also been used to explore the effects of different parameters, such as viscosity and temperature, on the dynamics of mantle plumes.

Despite their power, numerical models also have their limitations. They rely on simplifications and assumptions, and their accuracy depends on the quality of the input data and the validity of these assumptions. Furthermore, they are computationally intensive, requiring significant computational resources and time.

In the next section, we will explore another important aspect of mantle plume modelling: analytical models. These models, which are based on mathematical equations and principles, provide a different perspective on mantle plumes and their dynamics.

#### 14.1b Analytical Modelling of Mantle Plumes

Analytical modelling of mantle plumes is another important tool in the study of these enigmatic structures. Unlike numerical models, which are based on the principles of fluid dynamics and heat transfer, analytical models are based on mathematical equations and principles. They allow us to derive fundamental insights into the dynamics of mantle plumes, providing a complementary perspective to numerical models.

One of the most significant advancements in analytical mantle plume modelling has been the development of the thermal boundary layer model. This model, which is based on the principles of heat transfer and buoyancy, allows us to understand the formation and evolution of mantle plumes.

The thermal boundary layer model is based on the following assumptions:

1. The mantle is stratified, with a temperature gradient from the core-mantle boundary to the surface.
2. The plume is a thin layer of hot material, with a temperature that is significantly higher than the surrounding mantle.
3. The plume is buoyant, and therefore rises through the mantle.

The dynamics of the plume can be described by the following equations:

$$
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial z}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{\rho_0} \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial T} \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}
$$

where $T$ is the temperature, $z$ is the vertical coordinate, $\alpha$ is the thermal expansion coefficient, $\rho_0$ is the reference density, and $\rho$ is the density.

These equations describe the advection of heat and the vertical motion of the plume. They can be solved analytically, providing insights into the formation and evolution of mantle plumes.

Analytical models have been used to investigate a variety of aspects of mantle plumes, including their formation, evolution, and interaction with the surface. They have also been used to explore the effects of different parameters, such as viscosity and temperature, on the dynamics of mantle plumes.

Despite their power, analytical models also have their limitations. They rely on simplifications and assumptions, and their accuracy depends on the validity of these assumptions. Furthermore, they cannot capture the complex interactions and non-linearities that are present in the mantle. Therefore, they are often used in conjunction with numerical models, providing a comprehensive understanding of mantle plumes.

#### 14.1c Case Studies of Mantle Plumes

In this section, we will explore some case studies of mantle plumes, using both numerical and analytical models. These case studies will provide a deeper understanding of the dynamics of mantle plumes and their role in the Earth's interior.

Numerical models of the Hawaiian hotspot have been used to investigate the dynamics of the mantle plume beneath the Hawaiian Islands. These models have shown that the plume is buoyant and rises through the mantle, forming a thermal boundary layer at the surface. The plume is also highly dynamic, with complex interactions between the plume and the surrounding mantle.

Analytical models of the Hawaiian hotspot have been used to understand the formation and evolution of the mantle plume. These models have shown that the plume is formed by a thermal boundary layer, which is driven by the temperature gradient from the core-mantle boundary to the surface. The plume is also highly sensitive to changes in the temperature gradient and the viscosity of the mantle.

The Iceland hotspot is another well-studied mantle plume. It is responsible for the formation of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a large underwater mountain range that runs along the mid-Atlantic Ocean. The Iceland hotspot has been the subject of numerous numerical and analytical models.

Numerical models of the Iceland hotspot have been used to investigate the dynamics of the mantle plume beneath Iceland.

## Chapter: Chapter 15: Mantle Plume Observations

### Introduction

The Earth's mantle, a layer of solid rock that lies between the crust and the core, is a dynamic and complex system. It is responsible for the movement of tectonic plates, the formation of mountains, and the distribution of heat throughout the planet. In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of mantle plumes, one of the key mechanisms that drive the dynamics of the mantle.

Mantle plumes are columns of hot, buoyant material that rise from the lower mantle to the upper mantle. They are a result of the convective heat transfer within the mantle, and they play a crucial role in the geodynamics of the Earth. The study of mantle plumes is a rapidly evolving field, with new observations and theories being developed every year.

We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of these methods, and the ongoing research aimed at improving our understanding of mantle plumes.

Finally, we will examine the implications of mantle plumes for the geodynamics of the Earth. We will discuss how mantle plumes contribute to the movement of tectonic plates, the formation of hotspots and mid-ocean ridges, and the distribution of heat throughout the mantle. We will also explore the potential role of mantle plumes in the long-term evolution of the Earth.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of mantle plume observations, from the methods used to study them to the insights they provide into the dynamics of the Earth's mantle.

### Section: 14.1 Plume Modelling:

Mantle plumes are a fundamental aspect of the Earth's dynamics, playing a crucial role in the planet's evolution and geological phenomena. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of plume modelling, exploring the various techniques and models used to study and understand these enigmatic structures.

#### 14.1a Numerical Modelling of Mantle Plumes

Numerical modelling has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of mantle plumes. These models, which are based on the principles of fluid dynamics and heat transfer, allow us to simulate the complex interactions between the mantle and the core.

One of the most significant advancements in numerical mantle plume modelling has been the development of three-dimensional, time-dependent models. These models, which are based on the primitive equations of fluid dynamics, allow for a more realistic representation of the mantle's dynamics. They take into account the effects of rotation, stratification, and buoyancy, providing a more comprehensive understanding of mantle plumes.

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{g}
$$

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0
$$

where $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity field, $p$ is the pressure field, $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, $\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration, and $\rho$ is the density field.

These equations are solved numerically using finite difference methods, allowing for the simulation of complex fluid dynamics. The boundary conditions are typically set at the core-mantle boundary, where the temperature and velocity are specified. The top boundary is often set as a free surface, allowing for the plume to rise and interact with the surface.

#### 14.1b Mantle Plume Modelling and Mantle Convection

Mantle plume modelling is not only crucial for understanding the dynamics of mantle plumes but also for understanding mantle convection. Mantle convection is the process by which heat is transferred from the core to the surface of the Earth, driving plate tectonics and other geological phenomena.

The interaction between mantle plumes and mantle convection is a complex and dynamic process. Mantle plumes can either enhance or inhibit mantle convection, depending on their size, strength, and location. For instance, large mantle plumes can disrupt the normal convection patterns, leading to the formation of hotspots and the creation of new crust. On the other hand, small mantle plumes can enhance mantle convection by providing additional heat and buoyancy.

Numerical models of mantle plumes can help us understand these complex interactions. By incorporating the effects of mantle plumes into the primitive equations of fluid dynamics, these models can simulate the dynamics of mantle convection in the presence of mantle plumes. This can provide valuable insights into the role of mantle plumes in the Earth's dynamics and evolution.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the role of mantle plumes in mantle convection and explore some of the key findings from numerical mantle plume models.

#### 14.1c Challenges in Plume Modelling

Despite the significant advancements in numerical mantle plume modelling, there are still several challenges that researchers face. These challenges are primarily due to the complex nature of the mantle and the processes involved in mantle plume dynamics.

One of the main challenges in plume modelling is the accurate representation of the mantle's physical properties. The mantle is a highly heterogeneous medium, with variations in density, viscosity, and thermal conductivity. These variations can significantly affect the dynamics of mantle plumes and the overall convection patterns. However, accurately representing these variations in numerical models is a challenging task due to the lack of detailed knowledge about the mantle's physical properties.

Another challenge is the accurate representation of the boundary conditions at the core-mantle boundary. The core-mantle boundary is a region of intense heat transfer and chemical reactions. The exact nature of these processes is still not fully understood, and therefore, accurately representing them in numerical models is a significant challenge.

The interaction between mantle plumes and mantle convection is another area of challenge. As mentioned earlier, mantle plumes can either enhance or inhibit mantle convection, depending on their size, strength, and location. However, predicting these interactions is a complex task due to the non-linear nature of the fluid dynamics involved.

Finally, the validation of numerical models is a significant challenge. Due to the lack of direct observations of mantle plumes and the core-mantle boundary, it is difficult to validate the results of numerical models. This is a crucial aspect of model development, as it ensures that the models are producing realistic results.

Despite these challenges, numerical mantle plume modelling remains a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of the Earth's interior. Ongoing research and advancements in computational techniques are expected to address these challenges and further enhance our understanding of mantle plumes and mantle convection.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of mantle plumes, exploring their dynamics and their impact on the Earth's interior. Mantle plumes are a crucial component of the Earth's geodynamics, playing a significant role in the movement of heat and the formation of hotspots. 

Mantle plumes are columns of hot, buoyant material that rise from the core-mantle boundary to the Earth's surface.
