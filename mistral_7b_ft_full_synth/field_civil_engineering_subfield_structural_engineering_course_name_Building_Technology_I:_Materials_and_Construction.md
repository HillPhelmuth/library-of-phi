 # Design-based learning

## Results

Positive benefits of the design-based learning approach have been observed, including student-based learning where students (often) identify their project's needs, develop their own ideas, and engage in a larger range of thinking than with the traditional scripted inquiry model. The results from the 2008 study by Mehalik et al. found significant improvement in student performance using the DBL model compared to the scripted model. A 1998 study (Fraser, Fraser & Tobin, 1991) suggest that DBL has the potential to increase students' desire to learn, enhance success in science class, and increase interest in science topics. Students were observed to be engaged in DBL and the lower-achieving students were able to explain concepts at higher levels than previously observed by their teacher. In-depth experience in design activities and creation of meaningful outcomes in technology were observed in terms of the finished product, documentation, and reflection.
Significant benefits of implementing DBL has been observed in the areas of math and science (Darling-Hammond et al., 2008). Research has found that students who participate in learning by design projects have a more systematic understanding of a system's parts and functions that control groups (Hmelo, Holton, & Kolodner, 2000).

A 2000 study (Hmelo, Holton, and Kolodner) found that the design project led to better learning outcomes and included deeper learning than the traditional learning approach. The researchers also noted that the students developed greater understanding of complex systems. The study found that in using DBL, both higher-achieving and lower-achieving students showed strong evidence of progress in learning the targeted concepts, students were able to apply key concepts in their work, and there were positive effects on motivation and sense of ownership over work product by both groups.

### Introduction

Welcome to Chapter 2 of "Building Technology I: Materials and Construction". In this chapter, we will be discussing the foundations of building technology, specifically focusing on the materials and construction techniques used in building foundations.

Foundations are an essential part of any structure, providing a stable and strong base for the rest of the building. They are responsible for distributing the weight of the structure to the ground and preventing any movement or instability. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the materials and construction techniques used in building foundations to ensure the safety and stability of any structure.

In this chapter, we will cover the different types of foundations, including shallow foundations, deep foundations, and piled foundations. We will also discuss the various materials used in building foundations, such as concrete, steel, and wood. Additionally, we will explore the construction techniques used in building foundations, including excavation, formwork, and reinforcement.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the materials and construction techniques used in building foundations. This knowledge will not only help you in your studies but also in your future career as a building technology professional. So let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of building foundations.




### Section: 2.1 Types of Foundations:

Foundations are an essential component of any structure, providing a stable and strong base for the rest of the building. In this section, we will discuss the different types of foundations, including shallow foundations, deep foundations, and piled foundations.

#### 2.1a Shallow Foundations

Shallow foundations, also known as "footings", are commonly used in building construction. They are usually embedded about a meter or so into the soil and are used to support the weight of the structure. One common type of shallow foundation is the spread footing, which consists of strips or pads of concrete (or other materials) that extend below the frost line and transfer the weight from walls and columns to the soil or bedrock.

Another common type of shallow foundation is the slab-on-grade foundation, where the weight of the structure is transferred to the soil through a concrete slab placed at the surface. This type of foundation is commonly used in residential buildings and can be reinforced with mat slabs or post-tensioned slabs. Mat slabs range from 25 cm to several meters thick, depending on the size of the building, while post-tensioned slabs are typically at least 20 cm for houses and thicker for heavier structures.

In addition to traditional shallow foundations, there are also more environmentally friendly options available, such as screw piles. Screw pile installations have extended to residential applications, with many homeowners choosing a screw pile foundation over other options. Some common applications for screw piles include wooden decks, fences, garden houses, pergolas, and carports.

#### 2.1b Deep Foundations

Deep foundations are used to transfer the load of a structure down through the upper weak layer of topsoil to the stronger layer of subsoil below. This type of foundation is commonly used in areas with soft or unstable soil, as it can provide a more stable and secure base for the structure.

There are different types of deep foundations, including impact driven piles, drilled shafts, caissons, screw piles, geo-piers, and earth-stabilized columns. The naming conventions for different types of footings vary between different engineers, but historically, piles were made of wood, later steel, and now reinforced concrete and pre-tensioned concrete.

One type of deep foundation, the monopile foundation, uses a single, generally large-diameter, structural element embedded into the earth to support all the loads of a large above-surface structure. This type of foundation is commonly used in offshore wind turbines and other large structures.

In conclusion, foundations play a crucial role in building construction, providing a stable and strong base for the rest of the structure. Shallow foundations, such as spread footings and slab-on-grade foundations, are commonly used in residential buildings, while deep foundations, such as piles and drilled shafts, are used in areas with soft or unstable soil. With the advancements in technology, more environmentally friendly options, such as screw piles, are also available for building foundations. 





### Section: 2.1 Types of Foundations:

They are also commonly used in areas with soft or unstable soil, as they can provide a more stable and secure base for the building. Piled foundations can be either continuous or discrete, depending on the type of soil and the weight of the structure.

Continuous piled foundations are used when the soil is relatively uniform and the weight of the structure is evenly distributed. They consist of a series of piles that are connected together to form a continuous foundation. This type of foundation is commonly used in areas with soft or unstable soil, as it can provide a more stable and secure base for the building.

Discrete piled foundations, on the other hand, are used when the soil is not uniform or the weight of the structure is not evenly distributed. They consist of individual piles that are spaced apart and connected to the structure at the top. This type of foundation is commonly used in areas with hard or rocky soil, as it can provide a more secure and stable base for the building.

In conclusion, piled foundations are a type of deep foundation that is commonly used in areas with soft or unstable soil. They can also be used in areas with high wind or seismic activity, as they can withstand these forces better than other types of foundations. Piled foundations can be either continuous or discrete, depending on the type of soil and the weight of the structure.

Deep foundations can be either piled or drilled, depending on the type of soil and the weight of the structure.

Piled foundations consist of a series of piles, which are long columns of concrete or steel that are driven into the ground. These piles are then connected to the structure above, providing support and stability. Piled foundations are commonly used in areas with soft or unstable soil, as they can provide a more stable and secure base for the building.

Drilled foundations, on the other hand, involve drilling holes into the ground and filling them with concrete or other materials. These foundations are commonly used in areas with rocky or hard soil, as they can provide a more stable and secure base for the building.

#### 2.1c Special Foundations

In addition to shallow and deep foundations, there are also special foundations that are used for specific purposes. These include:

- Floating foundations: These foundations are used for structures that need to be built on water, such as bridges or offshore platforms. They are designed to float on the water and can be adjusted to compensate for changes in water levels.
- Jacked foundations: These foundations are used for structures that need to be raised or lowered, such as bridges or buildings. They consist of a series of jacks that can be adjusted to lift or lower the structure.
- Combination foundations: These foundations combine elements of both shallow and deep foundations. They are commonly used in areas with varying soil conditions, providing a more stable and secure base for the building.

In conclusion, foundations are an essential component of any structure, providing a stable and strong base for the rest of the building. The type of foundation used depends on the specific needs and requirements of the structure, as well as the type of soil and bedrock present. By understanding the different types of foundations and their purposes, engineers and architects can make informed decisions when designing and constructing buildings.





### Section: 2.2 Foundation Design Principles:

Foundations are an essential component of any structure, providing a stable and strong base for the rest of the building. In this section, we will discuss the principles of foundation design, including load distribution, soil analysis, and structural design.

#### 2.2a Load Distribution

Load distribution is a crucial aspect of foundation design. It refers to the way in which the weight of the structure is distributed onto the foundation. The goal of load distribution is to ensure that the foundation can support the weight of the structure without experiencing excessive stress or deformation.

There are two main types of loads that need to be considered in foundation design: dead loads and live loads. Dead loads are the weight of the structure itself, including the weight of the building materials and any permanent fixtures. Live loads, on the other hand, are temporary loads that can vary in magnitude and location, such as furniture, equipment, and people.

To ensure proper load distribution, engineers use a variety of methods, including structural analysis and computer simulations. Structural analysis involves using mathematical equations and principles to determine the stress and deformation of the foundation under different loading conditions. Computer simulations, on the other hand, use advanced software to model the behavior of the foundation and predict how it will respond to different loads.

In addition to load distribution, engineers also need to consider the type of soil or bedrock that the foundation will be built on. Different types of soil have varying strengths and properties, which can affect the design of the foundation. For example, soft or unstable soil may require a deeper or more reinforced foundation to support the weight of the structure.

#### 2.2b Soil Analysis

Soil analysis is a crucial step in foundation design. It involves studying the physical and chemical properties of the soil or bedrock that the foundation will be built on. This information is used to determine the type of foundation that is needed and the appropriate design parameters.

There are several methods of soil analysis, including laboratory testing, field testing, and remote sensing. Laboratory testing involves taking soil samples and subjecting them to various tests to determine their properties. Field testing, on the other hand, involves taking measurements on the site to assess the soil conditions. Remote sensing uses advanced technology, such as ground-penetrating radar, to gather information about the soil without physically disturbing it.

#### 2.2c Structural Design

Structural design is the process of determining the appropriate design parameters for the foundation. This includes the type of foundation, the size and shape of the foundation, and the materials used. The goal of structural design is to ensure that the foundation can support the weight of the structure without experiencing excessive stress or deformation.

To determine the appropriate design parameters, engineers use a variety of methods, including structural analysis and computer simulations. Structural analysis involves using mathematical equations and principles to determine the stress and deformation of the foundation under different loading conditions. Computer simulations, on the other hand, use advanced software to model the behavior of the foundation and predict how it will respond to different loads.

In addition to structural design, engineers also need to consider the aesthetics and cost of the foundation. The foundation should be visually appealing and within the budget of the project. This may require adjustments to the design parameters or the use of alternative materials.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, foundation design is a complex process that involves considering various factors, including load distribution, soil analysis, and structural design. Engineers use a variety of methods and technologies to ensure that the foundation can support the weight of the structure without experiencing excessive stress or deformation. By understanding these principles, engineers can design foundations that are safe, efficient, and visually appealing.





### Section: 2.2 Foundation Design Principles:

Different types of soil have varying strengths and properties, which can affect the design of the foundation. For example, soft or unstable soil may require a deeper or more reinforced foundation to support the weight of the structure.

#### 2.2b Soil Mechanics

Soil mechanics is a crucial aspect of foundation design. It involves studying the physical and chemical properties of the soil or bedrock that the foundation will be built on. This information is essential in determining the strength and stability of the foundation.

One important concept in soil mechanics is the critical state soil mechanics. This theory is used to analyze the behavior of soils under different loading conditions. It takes into account the effects of stress and strain on the soil, as well as the soil's strength and stiffness.

Another important aspect of soil mechanics is the plane stress and plane strain states of stress. These states are used to describe the stress and strain in a soil or rock under different loading conditions. The plane stress state is used to analyze the behavior of a soil or rock under a single plane of stress, while the plane strain state is used to analyze the behavior under a single plane of strain.

In addition to these states, engineers also need to consider the drained and undrained conditions of a soil or rock. Drained conditions refer to when the soil or rock is able to drain water and air, while undrained conditions refer to when the soil or rock is unable to drain. These conditions can greatly affect the behavior of the soil or rock and must be taken into account in foundation design.

Overall, understanding soil mechanics is crucial in foundation design. It allows engineers to accurately predict the behavior of the soil or rock under different loading conditions and design a foundation that can withstand these conditions. 





### Section: 2.2 Foundation Design Principles:

Foundations are an essential component of any structure, providing a stable and strong base for the rest of the building. In this section, we will discuss the principles of foundation design, including load distribution, soil analysis, and structural design.

Different types of soil have varying strengths and properties, which can affect the design of the foundation. For example, soft or unstable soil may require a deeper or more reinforced foundation to support the weight of the structure.

#### 2.2b Soil Mechanics

Soil mechanics is a crucial aspect of foundation design. It involves studying the physical and chemical properties of the soil or bedrock that the foundation will be built on. This is important because the soil or bedrock can greatly affect the stability and strength of the foundation.

One important concept in soil mechanics is the concept of soil bearing capacity. This refers to the maximum load that the soil or bedrock can support before it fails or deforms. Engineers use this information to determine the appropriate size and type of foundation for a given structure.

Another important aspect of soil mechanics is the study of soil-structure interaction. This refers to the way in which the soil or bedrock interacts with the structure built on top of it. For example, if the soil is soft and unstable, it can cause the structure to sink or shift, which can lead to structural failure.

To study soil-structure interaction, engineers use a variety of techniques, including field testing, laboratory testing, and numerical modeling. Field testing involves taking soil samples and measuring their properties in the field. Laboratory testing involves bringing soil samples into the lab for more detailed analysis. Numerical modeling uses computer simulations to predict how the soil will interact with the structure.

#### 2.2c Safety Factors

In addition to load distribution and soil mechanics, engineers also need to consider safety factors in foundation design. Safety factors are used to account for uncertainties and variations in the design process. They are typically expressed as a ratio of the design load to the actual load.

For example, a safety factor of 2 means that the design load is twice the actual load. This allows for a margin of error and ensures that the foundation can support the structure even if there are variations in the actual load.

Safety factors are also used to account for variations in the soil or bedrock properties. For example, if the soil bearing capacity is estimated to be 1000 pounds per square foot, a safety factor of 2 would mean that the design load is 2000 pounds per square foot. This allows for variations in the actual soil bearing capacity, ensuring that the foundation can support the structure even if the soil is slightly weaker than expected.

In conclusion, safety factors are an important consideration in foundation design. They help account for uncertainties and variations in the design process, ensuring that the foundation can support the structure safely and reliably. 





### Section: 2.3 Foundation Diagrams:

In addition to understanding the principles of foundation design, it is also important for engineers to be able to effectively communicate their designs to others. This is where foundation diagrams come in. Foundation diagrams are visual representations of the foundation design, which can help to illustrate the load distribution, soil mechanics, and structural design of the foundation.

#### 2.3a Foundation Plans

Foundation plans are a type of foundation diagram that provide a detailed view of the foundation design. They are typically drawn to scale and include all the necessary information for constructing the foundation, such as dimensions, materials, and placement of structural elements.

Foundation plans are an essential tool for communicating the design of the foundation to the construction team. They allow the team to understand the layout of the foundation and the placement of structural elements, which is crucial for ensuring the stability and strength of the structure.

In addition to communicating the design, foundation plans also serve as a reference for the construction team. They can be used to verify the accuracy of the construction and to make any necessary adjustments.

Foundation plans are typically created using computer-aided design (CAD) software, which allows for precise and detailed drawings. They can also be used to perform structural analysis and simulations, making them an integral part of the foundation design process.

In conclusion, foundation diagrams, particularly foundation plans, are an essential tool for communicating and constructing foundations. They allow for effective communication of the design and serve as a reference for the construction team. As technology continues to advance, foundation diagrams will only become more sophisticated and essential in the field of building technology.





#### 2.3b Section Drawings

In addition to foundation plans, section drawings are another important type of foundation diagram. These drawings provide a cross-sectional view of the foundation, allowing for a more detailed understanding of the design.

Section drawings are typically used to illustrate the load distribution and soil mechanics of the foundation. They can also be used to showcase the structural design, particularly in cases where the foundation is complex or includes unique features.

Similar to foundation plans, section drawings are also created using CAD software. They are typically drawn to scale and include all the necessary information for constructing the foundation. This includes dimensions, materials, and placement of structural elements.

Section drawings are an essential tool for communicating the design of the foundation to the construction team. They allow for a more detailed understanding of the foundation and can help to identify any potential issues or concerns.

In addition to communicating the design, section drawings also serve as a reference for the construction team. They can be used to verify the accuracy of the construction and to make any necessary adjustments.

Overall, both foundation plans and section drawings are crucial for effectively communicating and constructing foundations. They allow for a more detailed understanding of the design and can help to ensure the stability and strength of the structure. As technology continues to advance, these diagrams will only become more sophisticated and essential in the field of building technology.





#### 2.3c Detail Drawings

In addition to foundation plans and section drawings, detail drawings are another important type of foundation diagram. These drawings provide a more detailed view of specific areas of the foundation, allowing for a closer examination of the design.

Detail drawings are typically used to illustrate the construction of specific elements of the foundation, such as footings, piers, or walls. They can also be used to showcase the connection between different parts of the foundation, such as the connection between a footing and a wall.

#### 2.4a Concrete Foundations

Concrete is a widely used material in the construction of foundations due to its strength, durability, and versatility. It is a composite material made up of cement, water, and aggregates such as sand, gravel, or crushed stone. In this section, we will discuss the properties and applications of concrete in foundations.

##### Properties of Concrete

Concrete is a strong and durable material that is resistant to compression and tensile forces. It is also relatively easy to work with and can be molded into various shapes and sizes. These properties make it an ideal material for foundations, which are subjected to heavy loads and environmental stresses.

One of the key properties of concrete is its compressive strength. This is the ability of concrete to withstand compressive forces without breaking or cracking. The compressive strength of concrete is determined by the type and amount of cement used, as well as the size and shape of the aggregates. The higher the compressive strength, the stronger the concrete will be.

Concrete also has good durability, meaning it can withstand exposure to harsh environmental conditions without deteriorating.

### Section: 3.1 Introduction to Sustainability:

Sustainability is a concept that has gained significant attention in recent years, as the world faces increasing environmental, economic, and social challenges. It is a normative concept, meaning it is based on what people value or find desirable. The 1983 UN Commission on Environment and Development (Brundtland Commission) played a crucial role in shaping our understanding of sustainability today. Their 1987 Brundtland Report, titled "Our Common Future", defined sustainable development as development that "meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs". This definition has been widely adopted and has helped bring the concept of sustainability into the mainstream of policy discussions.

Sustainability is often used interchangeably with the term "sustainable development", which encompasses the environmental, economic, and social dimensions of sustainability. However, it is important to note that sustainability is not just about the environment. It also includes considerations of economic viability and social equity. This is reflected in the Venn diagram of sustainable development, which shows the three constituent parts of sustainability confluencing at the center.

The concept of sustainability is also closely tied to the concept of stewardship and responsible resource management. This means that sustainability is not just about meeting the needs of the present, but also about preserving resources for future generations. It is about balancing the needs of the present with the needs of the future.

In everyday usage, sustainability often focuses on the environmental dimension. However, there are also specific definitions that focus on other aspects of sustainability. For example, the "Oxford Dictionary of English" defines sustainability as "the property of being environmentally sustainable". This highlights the importance of considering the environmental impact of our actions when discussing sustainability.

Some scholars argue that a single specific definition of sustainability may never be possible. However, the concept is still useful and has been applied in various fields, including architecture and construction. In the next section, we will explore the principles and strategies of sustainable design, which aims to create buildings that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout their life-cycle. We will also discuss the importance of considering the entire life-cycle of a building, from its initial design and construction to its eventual deconstruction and reuse or recycling of materials. By incorporating sustainable design principles into our work, we can create buildings that are not only functional and aesthetically pleasing, but also contribute to a healthier and more sustainable future.

The moisture content of wood can greatly affect its strength and durability. Wood with a high moisture content is more prone to decay and insect damage, while wood with a low moisture content is stronger and more resistant to these factors.

##### Equilibrium Moisture Content

Equilibrium moisture content (EMC) is the amount of moisture that wood will reach when in equilibrium with its surrounding environment. This means that the wood will neither gain nor lose moisture, and the moisture content will remain constant. The EMC of wood is affected by factors such as temperature, humidity, and the type of wood.

The EMC of wood is an important consideration when building with wood. If the wood is exposed to a humid environment, it may absorb more moisture and reach a higher EMC, making it more prone to decay and insect damage. On the other hand, if the wood is exposed to a dry environment, it may lose moisture and reach a lower EMC, making it stronger and more durable.

##### Measuring Moisture Content

There are two main methods for measuring the moisture content of wood: the oven-dry method and the electronic moisture meter method.

The oven-dry method, as mentioned earlier, involves drying a wood sample in an oven and comparing its weight before and after drying. This method is accurate but can be time-consuming and requires specialized equipment.

The electronic moisture meter method, on the other hand, is a more convenient and quicker way to measure moisture content. There are two types of moisture meters: pin and pinless. Pin meters require driving two pins into the wood, while pinless meters use electromagnetic signals to measure moisture content. Both methods are accurate and can provide quick results.

In conclusion, understanding the moisture content and equilibrium moisture content of wood is crucial for builders when working with this versatile and renewable building material. By using the appropriate methods for measuring moisture content and understanding the factors that affect it, builders can ensure the strength and durability of their wood structures.

Recently, granite and PVC shields have been introduced as an alternative to traditional termite shields. These shields are installed into tiny brick open spaces where termites can enter the building surrounding the whole perimeter of the property. The termite shield is too thick for the termites to chew and penetrate, forcing them to migrate into the open where they can be more easily eradicated.

The benefits of using these types of materials include their sustainability to the environment, as they have been awarded Environmental Choice Declaration from the Environmental Labelling Association. They are also cheaper than metals and can be coupled with other shield protection systems.

#### Termite Barrier Sealants

One problem with termite shields is the gaps that exist at seams and at openings where steel reinforcing bars penetrate the metal shield. These gaps can be as large as 1/20 inch (1.27 mm), which is large enough for many species of subterranean termites to enter. To address this issue, termite barrier sealants can be used to seal these gaps. These sealants are known to block termites and are essential in making termite shields effective.

In conclusion, termite protection is crucial for preserving wood structures. Termite shields, granite and PVC shields, and termite barrier sealants are some of the most common methods used for termite protection. It is essential to use these methods in conjunction with proper wood preservation techniques to ensure the longevity of wood structures.

### Introduction

Welcome to Chapter 6 of "Building Technology I: Materials and Construction". In this chapter, we will be exploring the concept of Active Statics, a crucial aspect of building technology. Active Statics is a branch of mechanics that deals with the study of forces and their effects on structures. It is a fundamental concept in the field of building technology, as it helps us understand how forces act on a structure and how to design a structure that can withstand these forces.

In this chapter, we will cover various topics related to Active Statics, including the principles of statics, equilibrium, and the analysis of forces. We will also delve into the concept of structural stability and how it is affected by external forces. Additionally, we will explore the role of materials in withstanding these forces and how different materials have different properties that make them suitable for different types of structures.

As we delve deeper into the world of Active Statics, we will also touch upon the concept of structural analysis, which is the process of determining the internal forces and stresses within a structure. This is a crucial aspect of building technology, as it helps us understand how a structure will behave under different loading conditions and make necessary design modifications to ensure its stability.

Throughout this chapter, we will use mathematical equations and principles to explain the concepts of Active Statics. For example, we will use the principle of equilibrium, which states that the sum of all forces acting on a body must be equal to zero for the body to be in a state of equilibrium. This principle can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\sum F = 0
$$

Where $\sum F$ represents the sum of all forces acting on a body.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of Active Statics and its importance in building technology. You will also be able to apply the principles and concepts learned to analyze and design structures that can withstand external forces. So let's dive into the world of Active Statics and explore the fascinating world of building technology.




### Section: 6.1 Forces and Equilibrium:

In this section, we will explore the fundamental principles of forces and equilibrium, which are essential for understanding Active Statics. We will begin by discussing the concept of forces and how they affect structures.

#### 6.1a Force Vectors

In building technology, it is crucial to understand the concept of force vectors. A force vector is a vector quantity that represents the magnitude and direction of a force. It is represented by an arrow, with the length of the arrow representing the magnitude of the force and the direction of the arrow representing the direction of the force.

Force vectors are essential in building technology as they allow us to analyze and understand the effects of forces on structures. By representing forces as vectors, we can easily determine the sum of forces acting on a body and whether it is in a state of equilibrium.

The principle of equilibrium states that the sum of all forces acting on a body must be equal to zero for the body to be in a state of equilibrium. This can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\sum F = 0
$$

Where $\sum F$ represents the sum of all forces acting on a body.

In building technology, we often encounter structures that are subjected to multiple forces. These forces can be in different directions and have different magnitudes. By representing these forces as vectors, we can easily determine the sum of forces and whether the structure is in a state of equilibrium.

For example, let's consider a simple beam that is subjected to two forces, one in the positive x-direction and one in the negative y-direction. The forces can be represented as vectors $F_x$ and $F_y$, respectively. The sum of these forces can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the sum of the squares of the x and y components of a vector is equal to the square of the magnitude of the vector. In this case, the sum of forces can be calculated as:

$$
\sum F = \sqrt{F_x^2 + F_y^2}
$$

If the sum of forces is equal to zero, then the beam is in a state of equilibrium. However, if the sum of forces is not equal to zero, then the beam is not in a state of equilibrium, and we can use the principle of equilibrium to determine the direction and magnitude of the forces that need to be applied to the beam to bring it back into equilibrium.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of equilibrium in more detail and discuss how it is applied in building technology.





### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the principles of active statics and how they apply to building technology. We have learned about the different types of forces that act on structures and how to calculate their effects using vector algebra. We have also discussed the concept of equilibrium and how it is crucial for ensuring the stability and safety of structures. By understanding these principles, we can design and construct buildings that can withstand various external forces and maintain their structural integrity.

### Exercises

#### Exercise 1
Calculate the sum of forces acting on a beam that is subjected to three forces: one in the positive x-direction, one in the negative y-direction, and one in the positive z-direction.

#### Exercise 2
A building is subjected to a wind force of 500 N in the positive x-direction and a snow load of 1000 N in the positive y-direction. Calculate the sum of these forces and determine if the building is in a state of equilibrium.

#### Exercise 3
A bridge is designed to support a maximum load of 1000 N. If the bridge is subjected to a load of 800 N in the positive x-direction and 600 N in the positive y-direction, determine if the bridge is in a state of equilibrium.

#### Exercise 4
A building is designed to withstand a maximum wind force of 1000 N in any direction. If the building is subjected to a wind force of 800 N in the positive x-direction and 600 N in the positive y-direction, determine if the building is in a state of equilibrium.

#### Exercise 5
A beam is subjected to a uniformly distributed load of 500 N/m in the positive x-direction and a point load of 1000 N in the positive y-direction. Calculate the sum of these forces and determine if the beam is in a state of equilibrium.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will be discussing the topic of active dynamics in building technology. This is an important aspect of building design and construction, as it deals with the dynamic behavior of structures under various loading conditions. Active dynamics is a branch of structural engineering that focuses on the study and analysis of the dynamic response of structures to external forces. It is a crucial aspect of building technology, as it helps engineers and designers understand how a structure will behave under different loading conditions and design structures that can withstand these forces.

The study of active dynamics is essential in building technology as it allows engineers and designers to predict the behavior of structures under various loading conditions. This is crucial in ensuring the safety and stability of buildings, especially in areas prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes. By understanding the dynamic behavior of structures, engineers can design and construct buildings that can withstand these forces and remain stable.

In this chapter, we will cover various topics related to active dynamics, including the principles of dynamic analysis, the effects of external forces on structures, and the design of structures to withstand dynamic loads. We will also discuss the different types of dynamic loads that structures can experience, such as wind, earthquakes, and vibrations. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of active dynamics and its importance in building technology.

### Minimization of Gibbs energy

At equilibrium, at a specified temperature and pressure, and with no external forces, the Gibbs free energy "G" is at a minimum:

where μ<sub>j</sub> is the chemical potential of molecular species "j", and "N<sub>j</sub>" is the amount of molecular species "j". It may be expressed in terms of thermodynamic activity as:

where <math>\mu_j^{\ominus}</math> is the chemical potential in the standard state, "R" is the gas constant "T" is the absolute temperature, and "A<sub>j</sub>" is the activity.

For a closed system, no particles may enter or leave, although they may combine in various ways. The total number of atoms of each element will remain constant. This means that the minimization above must be subjected to the constraints:

where "a<sub>ij</sub>" is the number of atoms of element "i" in molecule "j" and "b"<su|b="i"|p=0> is the total number of atoms of element "i", which is a constant, since the system is closed. If there are a total of "k" types of atoms in the system, then there will be "k" such equations. If ions are involved, an additional row is added to the a<sub>ij</sub> matrix specifying the respective charge on each molecule which will sum to zero.

This is a standard problem in optimisation, known as constrained minimisation. The most common method of solving it is using the method of Lagrange multipliers (although other methods may be used).

Define:

where the "λ<sub>i</sub>" are the Lagrange multipliers, one for each element. This allows each of the "N<sub>j</sub>" and "λ<sub>j</sub>" to be treated independently, and it can be shown using the tools of multivariate calculus that the equilibrium condition is given by

### Subsection: 6.2a Truss Analysis

Trusses are a common structural element used in building construction, particularly in roofs and bridges. They are composed of a series of interconnected triangles, which are known for their strength and stability. In this section, we will discuss the analysis of trusses, including the forces acting on them and the methods used to calculate these forces.

#### Truss Analysis Methods

There are several methods for analyzing trusses, including the method of joints, the method of sections, and the slope-deflection method. Each of these methods has its advantages and is used in different situations.

##### Method of Joints

The method of joints is a graphical method used to analyze trusses. It involves drawing a free-body diagram of the entire truss and then breaking it down into smaller sections at the joints. The forces acting on each section are then calculated, and these forces are used to determine the forces acting on the joints.

##### Method of Sections

The method of sections is another graphical method used to analyze trusses. It involves cutting the truss along a section line and drawing a free-body diagram of the section. The forces acting on the section are then calculated, and these forces are used to determine the forces acting on the joints.

##### Slope-Deflection Method

The slope-deflection method is a numerical method used to analyze trusses. It involves dividing the truss into smaller sections and calculating the slope and deflection of each section. These values are then used to determine the forces acting on the joints.

#### Forces in Truss Members

The internal forces in truss members can be calculated using the methods described above. These forces can be either tensile or compressive, depending on the direction of the applied load. The magnitude of these forces can be calculated using the equations of equilibrium and the principles of statics.

#### Example

Consider a simple, statically determinate flat truss with 9 joints and 15 members. External loads are concentrated at the outer joints. Since this is a symmetrical truss with symmetrical vertical loads, the reactive forces at the two support joints are vertical, equal, and half the total load.

The internal forces in the members of the truss can be calculated using the method of joints. The forces in each member can be determined by summing the forces acting on each joint. The results are shown in the table below.

| Member | Force |
|---------|--------|
| AB | 0 |
| AC | 0 |
| AD | 0 |
| AE | 0 |
| AF | 0 |
| BD | 0 |
| BE | 0 |
| BF | 0 |
| CD | 0 |
| CE | 0 |
| CF | 0 |
| DE | 0 |
| DF | 0 |
| EF | 0 |

As can be seen, all the forces in the members are zero, except for the forces in the members connecting the outer joints. These forces are equal and opposite, as expected for a symmetrical truss with symmetrical loads.

#### Conclusion

In this section, we have discussed the analysis of trusses, including the methods used to calculate the internal forces in truss members. Trusses are a common structural element used in building construction, and understanding their behavior under load is crucial for their safe and efficient design.




### Subsection: 6.2b Frame Analysis

Frames are another common structural element used in building construction, particularly in load-bearing walls and columns. They are composed of a series of interconnected rectangles, which are known for their strength and stability. In this section, we will discuss the analysis of frames, including the forces acting on them and the methods used to calculate these forces.

#### Frame Analysis Methods

There are several methods for analyzing frames, including the method of joints, the method of sections, and the slope-deflection method. Each of these methods has its advantages and is used in different situations.

##### Method of Joints

The method of joints is a graphical method used to analyze frames. It involves drawing a free-body diagram of the entire frame and then breaking it down into smaller sections at the joints. The forces acting on each section are then calculated, and these forces are used to determine the forces acting on the joints.

##### Method of Sections

The method of sections is another graphical method used to analyze frames. It involves cutting the frame along a section line and drawing a free-body diagram of the section. The forces acting on the section are then calculated, and these forces are used to determine the forces acting on the joints.

##### Slope-Deflection Method

The slope-deflection method is a numerical method used to analyze frames. It involves dividing the frame into smaller sections and calculating the slope and deflection of each section. These values are then used to determine the forces acting on the joints.

#### Forces in Frame Members

The internal forces in frame members can be calculated using the methods described above. These forces can be either tensile or compressive, depending on the direction of the applied load. The magnitude of these forces can be calculated using the equations of equilibrium and the principles of statics.

#### Example

Consider a simple, statically determinate frame with two columns and a beam. The frame is subjected to a uniformly distributed load on the beam. Using the method of joints, we can analyze the frame and determine the forces acting on each member.




### Subsection: 6.2c Truss and Frame Design

Trusses and frames are essential structural elements in building construction, providing support and stability to the overall structure. In this section, we will discuss the design considerations for trusses and frames, including the types of loads they can carry, the materials used, and the design process.

#### Truss Design Considerations

Trusses are typically used to span longer distances than frames, and they are designed to carry primarily axial loads. The design of a truss involves determining the size and spacing of the members, as well as the connections between them. The design process often involves a combination of analytical calculations and computer simulations.

##### Types of Loads

Trusses are primarily designed to carry axial loads, which are loads that act along the length of the truss. These loads can be either tensile or compressive, depending on their direction. Trusses can also carry bending loads, but these are typically much smaller than the axial loads.

##### Materials Used

The most common materials used for trusses are steel and timber. Steel is a popular choice due to its strength and durability, and it is often used in larger structures. Timber is a more traditional choice, and it is often used in smaller structures or in situations where aesthetics are important.

#### Frame Design Considerations

Frames are typically used in load-bearing walls and columns, and they are designed to carry both axial and bending loads. The design of a frame involves determining the size and spacing of the members, as well as the connections between them. The design process often involves a combination of analytical calculations and computer simulations.

##### Types of Loads

Frames are designed to carry both axial and bending loads. Axial loads act along the length of the frame, while bending loads act perpendicular to the length of the frame. Frames can also carry shear loads, which act parallel to the length of the frame.

##### Materials Used

The most common materials used for frames are steel and concrete. Steel is a popular choice due to its strength and durability, and it is often used in larger structures. Concrete is a more traditional choice, and it is often used in smaller structures or in situations where aesthetics are not as important.

#### Design Process

The design process for trusses and frames typically involves the following steps:

1. Determine the type of load the structure will carry.
2. Select the appropriate material for the structure.
3. Determine the size and spacing of the members.
4. Determine the connections between the members.
5. Perform analytical calculations and computer simulations to verify the design.

In the next section, we will discuss the design of foundations, which are another essential structural element in building construction.




### Subsection: 6.3a Buckling and Slenderness

Buckling is a critical phenomenon in structural engineering that occurs when a structural component suddenly changes shape under load. This can happen due to compression, shear, or a combination of both. In this section, we will discuss the concept of buckling and its relationship to slenderness, as well as the methods used to calculate buckling stress.

#### Buckling and Slenderness

Buckling is a form of mechanical failure that can occur even when the stresses in a structure are well below those needed to cause failure in the material. This is because buckling can lead to significant and unpredictable deformations, which can ultimately result in the complete loss of the member's load-carrying capacity. 

The likelihood of buckling is influenced by the slenderness of a structural component. Slenderness is a dimensionless quantity that describes the ratio of a component's length to its least dimension. The slenderness of a component can significantly affect its buckling behavior. 

#### Calculating Buckling Stress

The critical load at which a column will buckle can be calculated using Euler's critical load formula:

$$
P_{cr} = \frac{\pi^2EI}{(KL)^2}
$$

where $P_{cr}$ is the critical load, $E$ is the modulus of elasticity, $I$ is the moment of inertia, $L$ is the length of the column, and $K$ is the column effective length factor. 

For a pin-ended column, $K = 1$. For a fixed column, $K = 2$. 

Another method for calculating buckling stress is Johnson's parabolic formula:

$$
\sigma_{cr} = \frac{2\pi^2E}{\left(1 + \sqrt{1 + 4\nu(KL/r)^2}\right)^2}
$$

where $\sigma_{cr}$ is the critical stress, $\nu$ is the Poisson's ratio, and $r$ is the radius of gyration. 

#### Slenderness and Buckling

The slenderness of a structural component can significantly affect its buckling behavior. As the slenderness of a component increases, its critical load decreases. This is because a longer and thinner component has a higher likelihood of buckling under a given load. 

In some cases, a component may be designed to buckle under a certain load. This is known as controlled buckling and is often used in the design of lightweight structures. In these cases, the slenderness of the component is carefully controlled to ensure that it buckles at the desired load.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of stability and its relationship to buckling and slenderness.




### Subsection: 6.3b Lateral Stability

Lateral stability is a critical aspect of structural engineering that refers to the ability of a structure to resist lateral loads, such as wind or earthquakes. These loads can cause significant deformations and displacements in a structure, which can lead to failure if not properly accounted for in the design.

#### Lateral Loads

Lateral loads are forces that act perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of a structure. These forces can be caused by various factors, including wind, earthquakes, and even human activities. Lateral loads can cause significant deformations and displacements in a structure, which can lead to failure if not properly accounted for in the design.

#### Lateral Stability and Stiffness

The lateral stability of a structure is influenced by its stiffness. Stiffness is a measure of a structure's resistance to deformation under load. A stiffer structure is less likely to deform under lateral loads, which can help to maintain its stability. The stiffness of a structure can be calculated using the formula:

$$
K = \frac{EA}{L}
$$

where $K$ is the stiffness, $E$ is the modulus of elasticity, $A$ is the cross-sectional area, and $L$ is the length of the structure.

#### Lateral Stability and Damping

In addition to stiffness, the lateral stability of a structure is also influenced by damping. Damping is a measure of a structure's ability to dissipate energy, which can help to reduce the amplitude of vibrations caused by lateral loads. The damping ratio, $\zeta$, is a dimensionless quantity that describes the ratio of the actual damping to the critical damping. The critical damping is the amount of damping required to prevent oscillations in a structure. The damping ratio can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\zeta = \frac{C}{2\sqrt{mK}}
$$

where $C$ is the damping coefficient, $m$ is the mass of the structure, and $K$ is the stiffness.

#### Lateral Stability and Resonance

Resonance is a phenomenon that can occur when a structure is subjected to a lateral load at its natural frequency. At resonance, the amplitude of the vibrations can become very large, which can lead to failure if the structure is not designed to withstand these large deformations. The natural frequency of a structure can be calculated using the formula:

$$
f = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{K}{m}}
$$

where $f$ is the natural frequency, $K$ is the stiffness, and $m$ is the mass of the structure.

#### Lateral Stability and Design

The design of a structure to ensure lateral stability involves considering the effects of lateral loads, stiffness, damping, and resonance. This can be achieved through various methods, including the use of bracing, shear walls, and dampers. The design must also take into account the specific characteristics of the lateral loads, such as their magnitude, direction, and frequency.




### Subsection: 6.3c Structural Bracing

Structural bracing is a critical aspect of structural engineering that refers to the addition of supplementary supports or braces to a structure to increase its stability and resistance to external forces. These braces can be designed to resist specific types of forces, such as lateral loads, and can be used to supplement the primary structural system of a building.

#### Types of Structural Bracing

There are several types of structural bracing that can be used to increase the stability of a structure. These include:

- **Diagonal Bracing**: Diagonal bracing is a common type of bracing used in buildings. It consists of diagonal members that are connected to the primary structural system at one end and to the other members of the bracing system at the other. Diagonal bracing is particularly effective in resisting lateral loads, such as wind or earthquakes.

- **Grid Bracing**: Grid bracing is a type of bracing that is used in frameworks, such as the one considered in the problem statement. It involves adding cross bracing to a square grid to make it into a rigid structure. This type of bracing can be optimally solved using graph theory on the connectivity of bipartite graphs.

- **Braced Frames**: Braced frames are a type of bracing that is commonly used in buildings. They consist of a primary structural system, such as columns and beams, and a secondary bracing system, such as braced frames. The braced frames are connected to the primary system and are designed to resist specific types of forces, such as lateral loads.

#### Structural Bracing and Lateral Stability

Structural bracing can significantly improve the lateral stability of a structure. By adding supplementary supports or braces, the stiffness of the structure can be increased, making it less likely to deform under lateral loads. Additionally, bracing can also increase the damping of a structure, which can help to reduce the amplitude of vibrations caused by lateral loads.

#### Structural Bracing and Resonance

Structural bracing can also help to prevent resonance in a structure. Resonance occurs when a structure is subjected to a force at its natural frequency, causing it to vibrate with large amplitudes. By increasing the stiffness and damping of a structure, bracing can help to prevent resonance and reduce the effects of lateral loads.

#### Structural Bracing and Safety

Structural bracing is an essential aspect of building technology, particularly in areas prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes. By increasing the stability and resistance of a structure, bracing can help to ensure the safety of occupants during these events. However, it is crucial to ensure that the bracing is properly designed and installed to avoid creating weak points in the structure.

#### Structural Load Calculation Example

To illustrate the process of structural load calculation, let's consider a simple example of a one-story building. The building has a rectangular footprint of 20m x 30m and is 8m high. The building is located in a region with a wind speed of 50 km/h and a seismic zone with a peak ground acceleration of 0.25g. The building is made of concrete with a density of 2400 kg/m^3 and a modulus of elasticity of 30 GPa.

Using the code method, we can calculate the dead load as follows:

$$
DL = \rho \cdot g \cdot V
$$

Where:
- DL is the dead load
- $\rho$ is the density of the building material
- g is the acceleration due to gravity
- V is the volume of the building

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$
DL = 2400 \cdot 9.81 \cdot \frac{20 \cdot 30 \cdot 8}{1000} = 492.8 \text{ kN}
$$

The live load can be calculated using the code method as well, taking into account the expected occupancy and furniture load. The wind load can be calculated using the code method or the analytical method, taking into account the wind speed and direction, as well as the shape and orientation of the building. The seismic load can be calculated using the code method or the numerical method, taking into account the seismic zone and the design of the building.

By combining these calculations, we can determine the total structural load for the building and design a structure that can withstand these forces and loads without failure.

## Chapter 8: Foundations

### Introduction

The foundation is the base upon which a structure is built. It is a critical component of any building, providing support, stability, and protection against external forces such as water and wind. This chapter, "Foundations," will delve into the various aspects of foundations, including their types, materials, and construction techniques.

Foundations can be broadly classified into two types: shallow foundations and deep foundations. Shallow foundations are typically used for smaller structures and are constructed directly on the ground. Deep foundations, on the other hand, are used for larger structures and are constructed below the ground surface. The choice between shallow and deep foundations depends on various factors, including the weight of the structure, the type of soil, and the environmental conditions.

The materials used in foundations can vary widely, depending on the type of foundation and the specific requirements of the structure. Common materials include concrete, steel, and stone. Each of these materials has its own unique properties and advantages, and the choice of material depends on a variety of factors, including cost, durability, and environmental impact.

The construction of foundations involves a series of steps, including site preparation, excavation, and the placement of the foundation material. These steps are critical to ensuring the stability and durability of the foundation. The construction process also involves the use of various tools and techniques, such as formwork, reinforcing bars, and concrete pumps.

In this chapter, we will explore these topics in detail, providing a comprehensive understanding of foundations and their role in building technology. Whether you are a student, a professional, or simply someone interested in the field of building technology, this chapter will provide you with the knowledge and understanding you need to navigate the complex world of foundations.
