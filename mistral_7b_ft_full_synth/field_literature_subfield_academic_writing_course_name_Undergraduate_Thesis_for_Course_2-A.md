## Chapter 1:: Introduction to Undergraduate Thesis Writing




### Subsection: 1.3a Setting Realistic Goals

Creating a timeline for proposal work is a crucial step in the undergraduate thesis process. It allows you to effectively manage your time and ensure that you are making progress towards your research and writing goals. In this section, we will discuss the importance of setting realistic goals and how to create a timeline that aligns with these goals.

#### 1.3a Setting Realistic Goals

Setting realistic goals is essential for a successful undergraduate thesis. These goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). This means that they should be clearly defined, have a way to measure progress, be attainable, align with your overall research and writing objectives, and have a deadline for completion.

One way to set realistic goals is by using the SMART goal-setting framework. This framework helps you create clear and achievable goals that will guide your research and writing process. Let's break down each component of SMART:

- Specific: Your goals should be clearly defined and specific. This means avoiding vague or broad goals and instead focusing on specific outcomes or objectives. For example, instead of saying "I want to write a good thesis," a specific goal would be "I want to write a thesis that explores the impact of social loafing on group performance."

- Measurable: Your goals should have a way to measure progress. This allows you to track your progress and determine if you are on track to meet your goals. For example, a measurable goal could be "I want to write at least 500 words per day towards my thesis."

- Achievable: Your goals should be attainable. This means setting goals that are within your capabilities and resources. For example, if you have never conducted research before, it may not be achievable to write a thesis that requires extensive research. Instead, you could set a goal to conduct a smaller-scale study or review existing research.

- Relevant: Your goals should align with your overall research and writing objectives. This means that they should contribute to your thesis topic and help you achieve your overall research and writing goals. For example, if your thesis topic is about social loafing, a relevant goal could be to conduct a study that examines the impact of social loafing on group performance.

- Time-bound: Your goals should have a deadline for completion. This helps you stay accountable and ensures that you are making progress towards your goals. For example, a time-bound goal could be "I want to complete my literature review by the end of this semester."

By setting realistic goals using the SMART framework, you can effectively manage your time and ensure that you are making progress towards your research and writing objectives. In the next section, we will discuss how to create a timeline that aligns with these goals.





### Subsection: 1.3b Prioritizing Tasks

Once you have set realistic goals and created a timeline, it is important to prioritize your tasks. This means identifying which tasks are most important and should be completed first. Prioritizing tasks can help you stay on track and ensure that you are making progress towards your goals.

There are several strategies for prioritizing tasks, but one effective method is the Eisenhower Matrix. This matrix helps you determine the urgency and importance of each task, allowing you to prioritize them accordingly. The matrix is divided into four quadrants, with urgent and important tasks in the top left, non-urgent and important tasks in the top right, urgent but non-important tasks in the bottom left, and non-urgent and non-important tasks in the bottom right.

By using the Eisenhower Matrix, you can identify which tasks should be completed first and which can be put on the backburner. This can help you stay organized and focused on your research and writing goals.

In addition to prioritizing tasks, it is also important to regularly review and adjust your timeline as needed. As you progress through your undergraduate thesis, you may find that certain tasks take longer than expected or unexpected challenges arise. By regularly reviewing your timeline, you can make adjustments and ensure that you are still on track to meet your goals.

In conclusion, creating a timeline for proposal work is a crucial step in the undergraduate thesis process. By setting realistic goals, prioritizing tasks, and regularly reviewing and adjusting your timeline, you can effectively manage your time and ensure that you are making progress towards your research and writing goals.

For example, instead of saying "a significant increase," you could say "a 20% increase." This not only helps to clarify your meaning, but it also adds a sense of precision and objectivity to your writing.

Another strategy for improving clarity is to use headings and subheadings to organize your writing. This helps to break up your text into manageable chunks and makes it easier for readers to follow your arguments or explanations. It also allows for a clearer structure and flow of information.

In addition to clarity, conciseness is also an important aspect of scientific writing. Conciseness refers to the ability to convey information in a clear and succinct manner. One way to improve conciseness is by eliminating unnecessary words or phrases. This can be achieved by carefully reviewing your writing and asking yourself if each word or phrase is necessary for conveying your meaning.

#### 8.3a Evaluating Feedback for Relevance and Validity

Incorporating feedback into your thesis is a crucial step in the research and writing process. However, not all feedback is created equal. Some feedback may be more relevant or valid than others. As such, it is important to evaluate feedback for its relevance and validity before incorporating it into your thesis.

1. **Relevance:** Relevance refers to the extent to which the feedback is applicable to your thesis. Is the feedback related to your research question? Does it help to strengthen your arguments or improve your thesis? If the answer is yes, then the feedback is likely to be relevant.

2. **Validity:** Validity refers to the accuracy and truthfulness of the feedback. Is the feedback based on sound reasoning and evidence? Does it align with your understanding of your thesis? If the answer is yes, then the feedback is likely to be valid.

3. **Bias:** It is important to consider the potential biases of the person providing the feedback. For example, if the person providing feedback has a personal or professional stake in the outcome of your thesis, their feedback may be biased. Be aware of these potential biases and take them into account when evaluating feedback.

4. **Consistency:** If multiple people provide similar feedback, this can be a strong indication of the validity of the feedback. However, if you receive conflicting feedback, you may need to seek additional opinions or do further research to determine which feedback to incorporate.

5. **Expertise:** Consider the expertise of the person providing the feedback. Feedback from someone with expertise in your field is likely to be more valuable than feedback from someone without this expertise.

6. **Timeliness:** The timeliness of the feedback can also be a factor in its relevance and validity. Feedback that is provided too late may not be as useful, especially if it is related to earlier stages of your thesis.

By evaluating feedback for its relevance and validity, you can ensure that you are incorporating the most helpful and accurate feedback into your thesis. This will not only improve the quality of your thesis, but also demonstrate your ability to critically evaluate and incorporate feedback, a valuable skill for any researcher.

#### 8.3b Making Revisions Based on Feedback

After evaluating feedback for its relevance and validity, the next step is to incorporate it into your thesis. This process involves making revisions based on the feedback you have received. Here are some steps to guide you through this process:

2. **Plan Your Revisions:** Before making any revisions, create a plan. This can include outlining the changes you need to make, identifying the sections of your thesis that need to be revised, and setting a timeline for completing these revisions.

3. **Make the Revisions:** Start making the revisions based on your plan. Be sure to address each piece of feedback individually. This will help you ensure that you have fully addressed each comment and that your revisions are cohesive.

4. **Review Your Revisions:** After making the revisions, review your thesis to ensure that the changes have improved the quality of your work. Consider asking a peer or mentor to review your revisions as well.

5. **Document Your Revisions:** Keep track of the feedback you have received and how you have addressed it. This can be helpful for future revisions and for documenting the process of writing your thesis.

6. **Seek Additional Feedback:** After making revisions, it can be helpful to seek additional feedback. This can help you ensure that your revisions have addressed the initial feedback and can also provide new insights or suggestions for further improvement.

This process is not only about informing your advisor about the changes, but also about demonstrating your ability to incorporate feedback and improve your thesis based on this feedback. Here are some steps to guide you through this process:

1. **Prepare a Summary of Changes:** Start by preparing a summary of the changes you have made. This should include a brief description of each change, the feedback that prompted it, and how you have addressed the feedback. This summary will serve as a reference for your advisor and will help them understand the changes you have made.

2. **Schedule a Meeting:** Arrange a meeting with your advisor to discuss the changes. This can be a face-to-face meeting or a virtual meeting, depending on what is most convenient for both of you. The purpose of this meeting is to review the changes, discuss their impact, and get further feedback from your advisor.

3. **Present Your Changes:** During the meeting, present your changes using your summary as a guide. Be prepared to explain why you made each change and how it improves your thesis. Be open to questions and be ready to defend your decisions.

4. **Discuss Further Feedback:** Your advisor may have additional feedback based on the changes you have made. Be open to this feedback and be willing to make further revisions. This is part of the learning process and can help you improve your thesis even more.

5. **Follow Up:** After the meeting, send a follow-up email to your advisor summarizing the main points of the discussion and outlining any further changes you plan to make. This will ensure that both of you are on the same page and will help you stay accountable.

6. **Document the Process:** Keep a record of the changes you have made, the feedback you have received, and the discussions you have had with your advisor. This can be helpful for future revisions and for documenting the process of writing your thesis.

Remember, your advisor is there to support you and help you improve your thesis. Communicating changes effectively is a crucial part of this process. It shows your advisor that you are actively engaged in the process and that you value their feedback.

#### 9.5a Understanding Copyright Laws

Copyright is a legal concept that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights to its use and distribution. These rights include the right to reproduce the work, prepare derivative works, distribute copies, and perform and display the work publicly. Copyright laws are designed to protect the intellectual property of creators and to encourage creativity and innovation.

Copyright laws vary from country to country, but they all aim to achieve the same basic goals. In the United States, for example, copyright is governed by Title 17 of the U.S. Code. This law provides that copyright protection is available for original works of authorship, including literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works. It also provides that copyright protection is automatic and lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years.

In the European Union, copyright is governed by the Copyright Directive, which harmonizes copyright laws across the EU. This directive provides that copyright protection is available for original works of authorship, including literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works. It also provides that copyright protection lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years.

In addition to these general copyright laws, there are also specific laws that protect certain types of works. For example, the Database Right in the United Kingdom and the Right of Database Makers in the European Union provide additional protection for databases. These laws provide that the maker of a database has the exclusive right to extract and reuse its contents.

Understanding copyright laws is crucial for any researcher. It is important to know what is protected by copyright, how long copyright protection lasts, and what rights you have as a creator or user of copyrighted works. It is also important to understand the exceptions to copyright, such as fair use and fair dealing, which allow for the use of copyrighted works in certain circumstances.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of intellectual property and its relationship with copyright.

#### 9.5b Understanding Intellectual Property Rights

Intellectual property rights are a subset of copyright laws that protect certain types of intellectual property, such as inventions, designs, and symbols. These rights are typically granted by the government and provide the creator with exclusive rights to their intellectual property.

In the United States, intellectual property rights are governed by Title 35 of the U.S. Code, which provides for the granting of patents. This law provides that a patent may be granted to any person who invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof. It also provides that the term of a patent is 20 years from the date of filing.

In the European Union, intellectual property rights are governed by the European Patent Convention, which provides for the granting of European patents. This convention provides that a European patent may be granted to any person who invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof. It also provides that the term of a European patent is 20 years from the date of filing.

Understanding intellectual property rights is crucial for any researcher. It is important to know what is protected by intellectual property rights, how long these rights last, and what rights you have as a creator or user of intellectual property. It is also important to understand the exceptions to intellectual property rights, such as fair use and fair dealing, which allow for the use of intellectual property in certain circumstances.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of open access and its relationship with copyright and intellectual property rights.

#### 9.5c Managing Copyright and Intellectual Property

Managing copyright and intellectual property is a critical aspect of research and writing. It involves understanding the legal frameworks surrounding these rights, as well as the practical steps necessary to protect and enforce them.

One of the key aspects of managing copyright and intellectual property is understanding the concept of fair use. Fair use is a legal doctrine that allows for the use of copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright holder, under certain circumstances. These circumstances include criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. Fair use is not a right, but rather a defense against a claim of copyright infringement.

In the United States, the fair use doctrine is codified in Section 107 of the Copyright Act. This section provides that the fair use of a copyrighted work "for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright." It also provides that the following factors should be considered when determining whether a use is fair:

1. The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
4. The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

In the European Union, the fair use doctrine is not explicitly codified, but is recognized in case law. The Court of Justice of the European Union has held that the fair use doctrine is compatible with the Copyright Directive, provided that it does not conflict with the three-step test for limitations and exceptions to copyright.

Another important aspect of managing copyright and intellectual property is understanding the concept of open access. Open access refers to the free, immediate, and online availability of research articles, allowing anyone to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full text of these articles. Open access is typically achieved through the use of open access licenses, such as the Creative Commons licenses.

Understanding and managing copyright and intellectual property is crucial for any researcher. It is important to know what is protected by copyright and intellectual property, how long these rights last, and what rights you have as a creator or user of copyrighted and intellectual property. It is also important to understand the exceptions to copyright and intellectual property, such as fair use and open access, and how to apply these exceptions in your research and writing.

#### 9.6a Understanding Open Access Publishing

Open access publishing is a model of scholarly publishing that allows for the free, immediate, and online availability of research articles. This model is typically achieved through the use of open access licenses, such as the Creative Commons licenses, which allow for the free use and distribution of copyrighted material.

Open access publishing has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential to increase the impact and reach of research. By making research articles freely available, open access publishing can increase the number of citations and the impact factor of a researcher's work. It can also facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing among researchers, leading to more innovative and impactful research.

However, open access publishing also raises important questions about copyright and intellectual property. As mentioned in the previous section, open access is typically achieved through the use of open access licenses, which allow for the free use and distribution of copyrighted material. This can raise concerns about the protection of copyright and intellectual property rights.

For example, consider the case of the "Elsevier boycott", where a group of researchers and institutions boycotted Elsevier, one of the largest academic publishing companies, due to its high subscription fees and restrictive copyright policies. This boycott raised questions about the balance between the rights of researchers to freely share their work and the rights of publishers to protect their intellectual property.

In response to these concerns, some open access publishers have implemented policies that allow authors to retain more rights over their work. For example, the Public Library of Science (PLOS) allows authors to retain the copyright to their work, while still granting PLOS a non-exclusive license to publish and distribute their work.

Understanding open access publishing and its implications for copyright and intellectual property is crucial for any researcher. It is important to consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of open access publishing, as well as the specific policies and licenses of different open access publishers. By doing so, researchers can make informed decisions about how to share and protect their work.

#### 9.6b Understanding Predatory Publishing

Predatory publishing is a form of scholarly publishing that exploits the open access model for financial gain. Predatory publishers often charge high publication fees to authors, while providing little to no editorial or publishing services in return. This can result in low-quality, un-peer-reviewed publications that can damage the reputation of the authors and the scientific community as a whole.

Predatory publishers often use deceptive tactics to attract authors. They may claim to have a high impact factor or to be affiliated with a reputable institution, when in fact they have no such affiliation. They may also offer authors a quick and easy publication process, without the need for a lengthy peer-review process.

One of the key characteristics of predatory publishers is their lack of transparency. They often do not provide information about their editorial board, peer-review process, or publication fees. This lack of transparency can make it difficult for authors to assess the quality and legitimacy of a publisher.

Predatory publishing can have serious implications for the scientific community. It can lead to the proliferation of low-quality, un-peer-reviewed publications, which can undermine the credibility of scientific research. It can also result in the exploitation of authors, who may be charged high publication fees without receiving the promised editorial and publishing services.

Understanding predatory publishing is crucial for any researcher. It is important to be aware of the tactics used by predatory publishers and to take steps to protect yourself and your work. This includes conducting thorough research on a publisher before submitting your work, and being cautious of any publisher that offers a quick and easy publication process without a rigorous peer-review.

#### 9.6c Evaluating Publishers and Journals

Evaluating publishers and journals is a crucial step in the process of publishing your research. It is important to ensure that your work is published in a reputable and trustworthy venue. This not only ensures the quality of your work, but also protects your reputation as a researcher.

There are several factors to consider when evaluating a publisher or journal. These include the publisher's reputation, the journal's impact factor, the quality of the editorial board, and the transparency of the publisher's policies.

The reputation of a publisher is a key factor to consider. Reputable publishers have a track record of publishing high-quality research and are known for their rigorous peer-review process. They also have a strong editorial board, composed of experts in the field, who ensure the quality and relevance of the published work.

The impact factor of a journal is another important consideration. The impact factor is a measure of the average number of citations received by articles published in the journal. It is a reflection of the journal's influence and impact in the scientific community. However, it is important to note that the impact factor should not be the sole criterion for choosing a journal. Many high-quality journals have low impact factors due to their narrow scope or recent launch.

The quality of the editorial board is also a key factor. The editorial board is responsible for the selection and review of articles submitted to the journal. A high-quality editorial board is composed of experts in the field who have a track record of publishing high-impact research.

Transparency is another important consideration. Transparent publishers provide clear and comprehensive information about their policies, processes, and fees. This includes information about their peer-review process, publication fees, and editorial board. Lack of transparency can be a red flag and may indicate a predatory publisher.

In addition to these factors, it is also important to consult with your peers and mentors. They can provide valuable insights and recommendations based on their own experiences.

In conclusion, evaluating publishers and journals is a critical step in the process of publishing your research. It is important to consider the publisher's reputation, the journal's impact factor, the quality of the editorial board, and the transparency of the publisher's policies. By doing so, you can ensure that your work is published in a reputable and trustworthy venue.

#### 9.5b Navigating Intellectual Property Issues in Research

Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce. Intellectual property is protected in law by, for example, patents, copyright and trademarks, which enable people to earn recognition and financial benefit from what they invent or create. By striking the right balance between the interests of innovators and the wider public interest, the IP system aims to foster an environment in which creativity and innovation can flourish.

In the context of research, intellectual property issues can be complex and multifaceted. Researchers often work with a variety of intellectual property, including copyrighted materials, patented technologies, and trademarked brands. Navigating these issues requires a deep understanding of intellectual property laws and regulations, as well as careful planning and decision-making.

One of the key considerations in navigating intellectual property issues in research is understanding the concept of open innovation. Open innovation is a paradigm that assumes that firms can and should use external ideas as well as internal ideas, and internal and external paths to market, as they look to advance their technology. This approach can lead to more innovative solutions, but it also raises important questions about intellectual property rights and ownership.

For example, consider the case of a researcher who is developing a new technology based on a patented invention. If the researcher's work builds directly on the patented invention, they may need to obtain a license from the patent holder. However, if the researcher's work is novel and non-obvious, they may be able to obtain their own patent, which would give them exclusive rights to the technology.

Another important consideration is the concept of collaborative innovation networks (CoINs). CoINs are networks of organizations that collaborate to develop and commercialize new technologies. These networks can be highly effective in driving innovation, but they also raise important questions about intellectual property rights and ownership. For example, if multiple organizations contribute to the development of a new technology, how should the intellectual property rights be divided?

Navigating these and other intellectual property issues in research requires a careful and strategic approach. Researchers should always seek to understand the intellectual property rights and obligations associated with their work, and they should plan ahead to ensure that these issues are addressed in a way that is fair and beneficial to all parties involved.

In the next section, we will explore some practical strategies for navigating intellectual property issues in research.

#### 9.5c Managing Intellectual Property in Research

Managing intellectual property (IP) in research is a critical aspect of the research process. It involves understanding the IP rights and obligations of all parties involved in the research, and taking steps to protect and manage these rights. This is particularly important in the context of collaborative research, where multiple parties may contribute to the development of a new technology or innovation.

One of the key tools for managing IP in research is the use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). NDAs are legal contracts that prevent parties from disclosing confidential information to third parties. They are often used in research collaborations to protect sensitive information, such as proprietary technologies or unpublished research findings.

Another important tool for managing IP in research is the use of open innovation. As discussed in the previous section, open innovation involves using external ideas and paths to market, as well as internal ones. This approach can lead to more innovative solutions, but it also raises important questions about IP rights and ownership. To manage these issues, researchers can use open innovation platforms, which provide a structured environment for managing the IP rights and obligations of all parties involved in the research.

In addition to these tools, researchers can also use IP management software to track and manage their IP assets. This software can help researchers identify and protect their IP rights, and can also assist in the process of licensing and commercialization.

Finally, researchers can also seek the advice of IP professionals, such as patent attorneys or IP consultants, to help them navigate the complexities of IP management in research. These professionals can provide valuable insights and guidance on how to protect and manage IP in a way that is fair and beneficial to all parties involved.

In conclusion, managing IP in research is a complex but crucial aspect of the research process. By understanding the IP rights and obligations of all parties involved, and by using tools and strategies to protect and manage these rights, researchers can ensure that their work is conducted in a way that is fair and beneficial to all parties involved.

#### 9.5c Respecting the Intellectual Property of Others

In the previous section, we discussed the importance of understanding and navigating intellectual property issues in research. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of respecting the intellectual property of others.

Respecting the intellectual property of others is a fundamental principle in academic research. It is based on the understanding that intellectual property, such as copyrighted materials, patented technologies, and trademarked brands, are the result of creative effort and investment. Just as researchers protect their own intellectual property, they must also respect the intellectual property of others.

One of the key ways to respect the intellectual property of others is by adhering to copyright laws. Copyright law is a form of intellectual property law that protects original works of authorship, including literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works. It is important for researchers to understand the scope of copyright protection and to obtain necessary permissions before using copyrighted materials in their research.

In the context of undergraduate research, this can be particularly challenging. Undergraduate researchers often work with a variety of materials, including textbooks, articles, and data sets, which may be copyrighted. It is the responsibility of the researcher to ensure that they have the necessary permissions to use these materials. This can often be achieved by obtaining a license from the copyright holder, or by using materials that are in the public domain or under a Creative Commons license.

Another important aspect of respecting the intellectual property of others is understanding and adhering to database rights. Database rights are a form of intellectual property protection that applies to databases. They are designed to protect the substantial investment that goes into creating a database, and to prevent others from extracting a substantial portion of the database without permission.

In Spain, for example, the "sui generis" protection of databases is governed by the Law 5/1998 of 6 March 1998 incorporating Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the Legal Protection of Databases. This law provides that the maker of a database can prevent a user from extracting a substantial portion of the database, either through a single access or through multiple accesses. This is designed to protect the maker's investment and to ensure that they can continue to earn recognition and financial benefit from their work.

In conclusion, respecting the intellectual property of others is a crucial aspect of academic research. It is based on the principle of fairness and is essential for maintaining the integrity of the research process. By understanding and adhering to copyright laws and database rights, researchers can ensure that they are respecting the intellectual property of others and contributing to a fair and equitable research environment.
