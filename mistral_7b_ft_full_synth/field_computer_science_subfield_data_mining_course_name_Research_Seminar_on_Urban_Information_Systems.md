## Chapter 2: Information Infrastructure and Urban Redevelopment:




### Section: 2.1 Mi Diao:

#### 2.1a Urban Redevelopment Theories

Urban redevelopment is a complex process that involves the revitalization of existing urban areas. It is a crucial aspect of urban planning and development, as it aims to improve the quality of life for residents and attract new businesses and investment. In this section, we will explore the various theories that guide urban redevelopment, including the sector model and the multiple nuclei model.

The sector model, proposed by economist Homer Hoyt in 1939, suggests that a city develops in sectors instead of rings. This theory is a refinement of the concentric model proposed by sociologist Ernest Burgess in 1925. According to the sector model, certain areas of a city are more attractive for various activities, whether by chance or geographic and environmental reasons. As the city grows and these activities flourish and expand outward, they do so in a wedge and become a sector of the city. This theory is supported by the development of Calgary, Alberta, which almost perfectly fits Hoyt's sector model.

On the other hand, the multiple nuclei model, developed by geographers Chauncy Harris and Edward Ullman in 1945, suggests that a city contains more than one center around which activities revolve. Some activities are attracted to particular nodes, while others try to avoid them. This model is useful in understanding the clustering of certain activities in urban areas, such as the development of high-income housing or industrial areas.

Both of these theories have been applied to various urban areas, providing insights into the development patterns and potential for redevelopment. However, it is important to note that these theories are not exhaustive and may not apply to all urban areas. Therefore, it is crucial for urban planners and developers to consider the unique characteristics and needs of each city when approaching urban redevelopment.

#### 2.1b Urban Redevelopment Strategies

In addition to understanding the theories behind urban redevelopment, it is also important to consider the strategies and approaches used to revitalize urban areas. These strategies can range from physical redevelopment, such as building new infrastructure or renovating existing buildings, to social and economic redevelopment, such as promoting community engagement and economic growth.

One strategy that has gained popularity in recent years is the concept of smart cities. Smart cities use technology and data to improve the efficiency and sustainability of urban areas. This can include implementing sensors and data analytics to monitor and manage resources, such as energy and water, as well as using mobile apps and social media to engage with residents and gather feedback. The potential of smart cities in urban redevelopment will be explored in more detail in the next section.

Another strategy is the use of urban information systems. These systems use data and technology to manage and improve urban areas, and can be used in conjunction with other strategies to achieve more comprehensive redevelopment goals. Urban information systems can include a variety of components, such as GIS, remote sensing, and data analytics, and can be used to inform decision-making and track progress in urban redevelopment efforts.

In conclusion, urban redevelopment is a complex and multifaceted process that requires a deep understanding of urban theory and the application of various strategies and approaches. By considering the theories and strategies discussed in this section, urban planners and developers can effectively revitalize urban areas and create more livable and sustainable cities for all residents.

### Subsection: 3.2a Xiongjiu Liao's Approach to Measuring Sprawl

Xiongjiu Liao, a renowned urban planner and researcher, has developed a unique approach to measuring urban sprawl. His approach is based on the concept of "urban sprawl index," which takes into account various factors such as population density, land use, and transportation networks.

#### 3.2a.1 Urban Sprawl Index

The urban sprawl index is a comprehensive measure of urban sprawl that considers both the physical expansion of urban areas and the impact of this expansion on the surrounding environment. It is calculated using a weighted urban proliferation formula, which takes into account the population density, land use, and transportation networks within urban areas.

The formula for the urban sprawl index is as follows:

$$
UPI = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}
$$

where $UPI$ is the urban sprawl index, $w_i$ is the weight assigned to factor $i$, and $x_i$ is the value of factor $i$. The weights are assigned based on the relative importance of each factor in the overall urban sprawl.

#### 3.2a.2 Factors Considered in the Urban Sprawl Index

The urban sprawl index takes into account several factors that contribute to urban sprawl. These include:

- Population density: The higher the population density, the more likely it is that urban sprawl is occurring.
- Land use: The type of land use within urban areas can indicate the extent of urban sprawl. For example, a high proportion of residential land use may suggest urban sprawl.
- Transportation networks: The development of transportation networks, such as highways and railways, can facilitate urban sprawl by making it easier for people to commute to urban areas.

#### 3.2a.3 Application of the Urban Sprawl Index

The urban sprawl index can be applied to measure urban sprawl in different urban areas. By calculating the index for different urban areas, it is possible to compare the extent of urban sprawl in these areas. This can help urban planners and policymakers identify areas where urban sprawl is occurring and take steps to address it.

In conclusion, Xiongjiu Liao's approach to measuring urban sprawl provides a comprehensive and systematic way of understanding and addressing urban sprawl. By considering various factors and using a weighted urban proliferation formula, this approach can provide valuable insights into the extent and impact of urban sprawl in different urban areas.

### Subsection: 5.3a Fazilet Tanrikulu's Approach to GIS in Public Services

Fazilet Tanrikulu, a renowned urban planner and GIS expert, has been instrumental in the application of GIS in public services. Her approach to GIS in public services is based on the principles of spatial contextual awareness and ubiquitous geographic information (UBGI).

#### Spatial Contextual Awareness

Tanrikulu's approach to GIS in public services is heavily influenced by the concept of spatial contextual awareness. She emphasizes the importance of understanding the spatial and geographic aspects of context, which goes beyond just the user's location. This includes other dimensions and their interdependencies, as shown in Figure 2. 

In the context of public services, Tanrikulu argues that GIS applications must be able to operate in a heterogeneous space, which includes different reference systems. This means that a user of a GIS application must be able to seamlessly convert from a Euclidean space (Cartesian Reference Space), to a Linear Reference Space (LRS), to indoor space (to include perhaps the floor, wing, hallway, and room number).

#### Ubiquitous Geographic Information (UBGI)

Tanrikulu's approach to GIS in public services also incorporates the concept of UBGI. UBGI is geographic information which is provided at any time and any place to users or systems through communication devices. This information is based on the context of the user, and includes a set of concepts, practices, and standards for spatial and geographic information and processing for applications accessible for use by the general public.

In the context of public services, UBGI is crucial as it allows for the provision of relevant and timely information to users or systems. This is particularly important in emergency situations, where quick and accurate information can save lives.

#### Ubiquitous Cartography

Tanrikulu's approach to GIS in public services also incorporates the concept of ubiquitous cartography. This is the ability for users to create and use maps in any place and at any time to resolve geospatial problems. This approach is in contrast to the accused elitism of the GIS community in the early 80's when many advocated for separate technology because geospatial information was different and unattainable to common users or systems.

In the context of public services, ubiquitous cartography allows for the creation and use of maps by the average citizen, not just highly trained geographers and cartographers. This democratization of map creation and use can lead to more effective decision-making and problem-solving in public services.

In conclusion, Fazilet Tanrikulu's approach to GIS in public services is based on the principles of spatial contextual awareness, UBGI, and ubiquitous cartography. These principles guide her work in the application of GIS in public services, and have been instrumental in the development of innovative and effective GIS applications in the public sector.

### Version 5.0

Another study using QUIS Version 5.0 was carried out with a local PC User's Group. In order to look at ratings across products, the participants were divided into 4 groups. Each group rated a different product. The products were:
This investigation examined the reliability and discriminability of the questionnaire. In terms of discriminability, the researchers compared the ratings for software that was liked vs. the ratings for the software that was disliked. Lastly, a comparison between a mandatory CLS with that of a voluntarily chosen MDA was made. The researchers found that the overall reliability of QUIS Version 5.0 using Cronbach's alpha was .939.

#### Version 5.5

Even though the QUIS Version 5.0 was a powerful tool for interface evaluation, interface issues limited the utility of the on-line version. Previous versions of the QUIS have been laid out in a very linear fashion, in which one question would be shown on each screen. However, this format is unable to capture the hierarchical nature of the question sets in the QUIS. This in turn limits the continuity between questions. QUIS 5.5 presented related sets of questions on the same screen. This helped improve question continuity within a set and reduced the amount of time subjects would spend navigating between questions.
Users of the QUIS often avoided the on-line version because it failed to record specific user comments about the system. This was not acceptable since these comments are often vital for usability testing. In response to this need, QUIS Version 5.5 collected and stored comments online for each set of questions.
The output format of the QUIS data was also a source of frustration. The original format made analysis confusing and error-prone. QUIS Version 5.5 stores data in a format that could be easily imported into most popular spreadsheet and statistical analysis software.
