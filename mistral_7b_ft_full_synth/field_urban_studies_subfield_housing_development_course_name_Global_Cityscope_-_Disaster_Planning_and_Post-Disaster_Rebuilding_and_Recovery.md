## Foreward

Welcome to "Global Cityscope: Disaster Planning and Post-Disaster Rebuilding and Recovery". This book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of disaster planning and post-disaster rebuilding and recovery, with a focus on the global context. As urban populations continue to grow and climate change impacts become more severe, the need for resilient and sustainable cities has never been more pressing.

The book begins by exploring the concept of urban resilience, a topic that has gained significant academic attention in recent years. We delve into the three primary threats to urban resilience: climate change, natural disasters, and terrorism. We discuss the physical and non-physical aspects of urban planning and design that contribute to resilience, and how these strategies can be adapted to counter these threats.

We then move on to the evolution of urban resilience and the capability of urban systems to adapt to changing conditions. This branch of resilience theory builds on a notion of cities as highly complex adaptive systems, and it is this perspective that informs much of the book. We explore how urban planning can move away from conventional approaches based in geometric plans to an approach informed by network science, which involves less interference in the functioning of cities.

The book also delves into the practical aspects of disaster planning and post-disaster rebuilding and recovery. We discuss the importance of investment decisions that prioritize spending on activities that offer alternatives, and how these decisions need to take into account future risks and uncertainties. We also explore frameworks for disaster risk management, providing practical opportunities for enhancing resilience.

Throughout the book, we draw on a range of disciplines, from urban planning and design to network science and disaster management. We also draw on a variety of case studies from around the world, providing a global perspective on disaster planning and post-disaster rebuilding and recovery.

We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and practitioners interested in the field of disaster planning and post-disaster rebuilding and recovery. We also hope that it will contribute to the ongoing academic and practical discussions about urban resilience and the role of cities in a changing world.

Thank you for joining us on this journey through the global cityscape of disaster planning and post-disaster rebuilding and recovery.

Risk assessment is the first step in the planning process. It involves identifying potential hazards and assessing the likelihood and potential impact of these hazards. This is typically done through the use of risk assessment tools and techniques, such as the Analytic Network Process (ANP) and the Extended Kalman Filter. The ANP, for instance, allows for the consideration of multiple criteria and alternatives, while the Extended Kalman Filter provides a mathematical framework for updating risk assessments in real-time.

#### 3.3a.2 Vulnerability Assessment

Once the risks have been identified and assessed, the next step is to conduct a vulnerability assessment. This involves determining the susceptibility of a system or community to the identified risks. The vulnerability assessment is crucial as it helps to identify the most critical systems and areas that need to be protected or reinforced.

#### 3.3a.3 Response and Recovery Plan Development

The final step in the planning process is the development of response and recovery plans. These plans outline the actions to be taken in response to a disaster and the steps to be taken in the recovery process. The plans should be comprehensive, detailing the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders, the resources required, and the timelines for implementation.

#### 3.3a.4 Challenges in the Planning Process

Despite its importance, the planning process is not without its challenges. These include limited resources and funding, the complexity of the planning process, and the need for collaboration among various stakeholders. Additionally, the planning process must be flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances, which can be challenging to achieve.

### Subsection: 4.5a Defining Community Resilience

Community resilience is a concept that has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in the context of disaster planning and post-disaster recovery. It is a multifaceted concept that encompasses the ability of a community to withstand and recover from adverse events, whether they be natural disasters, economic downturns, or social disruptions. 

#### 4.5a.1 The National Institute of Standards and Technology's Definition

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines community resilience as "the ability of a community to utilize available resources to respond to, withstand, and recover from adverse situations." This definition highlights the importance of both the community's ability to respond to a disaster and its capacity to recover and rebuild in the aftermath. 

#### 4.5a.2 The IPCC's Definition

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines resilience as "the ability of a system, community, or society to maintain essential function, identity, and structure, and to adapt, learn, and grow in response to a changing environment." This definition emphasizes the importance of not only recovering from a disaster, but also adapting and growing in the face of ongoing changes and challenges.

#### 4.5a.3 Resilience in Ecological Systems

The concept of resilience in ecological systems was first introduced by the Canadian ecologist C.S. Holling. Holling defined resilience as the ability of a system to maintain its structure and function in the face of disturbances. This definition has been expanded upon by the IPCC, which considers resilience both in terms of ecosystem recovery as well as the recovery and adaptation of human societies to natural disasters.

#### 4.5a.4 Resilience as a Measure of Success

In the context of disaster planning and post-disaster recovery, resilience can be seen as a measure of success. A community that is able to effectively respond to a disaster and recover in the aftermath can be considered resilient. However, it is important to note that resilience is not a static state, but rather a dynamic process that requires ongoing adaptation and learning.

In the next section, we will explore the various factors that contribute to community resilience and how they can be incorporated into disaster planning and post-disaster recovery efforts.

### Subsection: 4.5b Role of Community Resilience in Disaster Planning

Community resilience plays a crucial role in disaster planning. It is the foundation upon which disaster planning strategies are built, and it is the ultimate goal of these strategies. The role of community resilience in disaster planning can be understood in terms of its three key components: preparedness, response, and recovery.

#### 4.5b.1 Preparedness

Preparedness is the first line of defense in disaster planning. It involves the development of plans and procedures to anticipate and prepare for potential disasters. This includes identifying potential hazards, assessing vulnerabilities, and developing strategies to mitigate these risks. 

Community resilience is essential in this regard. A resilient community is better equipped to identify potential hazards and vulnerabilities, and to develop effective strategies to mitigate these risks. This is because resilience is closely tied to the community's ability to utilize available resources, which includes the resources needed to develop and implement disaster planning strategies.

#### 4.5b.2 Response

The response to a disaster is the immediate action taken to address the impacts of the disaster. This includes search and rescue operations, emergency medical care, and the provision of temporary shelter and food. 

Community resilience is crucial in this phase. A resilient community is better able to respond to a disaster due to its ability to mobilize resources and coordinate efforts. This is particularly important in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, when time is of the essence.

#### 4.5b.3 Recovery

Recovery is the process of rebuilding and restoring the community in the aftermath of a disaster. This includes repairing or rebuilding damaged infrastructure, providing long-term housing solutions, and supporting the psychological and social recovery of the community.

Community resilience is essential in this phase. A resilient community is better able to recover from a disaster due to its ability to adapt and learn from the experience. This includes the ability to identify and implement effective recovery strategies, and to build back better and more resilient than before.

In conclusion, community resilience plays a crucial role in disaster planning. It is the foundation upon which disaster planning strategies are built, and it is the ultimate goal of these strategies. By fostering community resilience, we can better prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters.

### Subsection: 4.6a Principles of Emergency Management

Emergency management is a critical aspect of disaster planning and post-disaster rebuilding and recovery. It involves the coordination of resources and efforts to mitigate the impact of emergencies, whether they are natural disasters, technological failures, or intentional acts of violence. The principles of emergency management guide the actions of rescuers and potential rescuers, helping them to navigate the complex and often unpredictable nature of emergencies.

#### 4.6a.1 Key Emergency Principle

The key principle taught in almost all emergency management systems is the assessment of danger. This principle is core to emergency management as it ensures that rescuers do not become secondary victims of any incident, creating a further emergency that must be dealt with. 

A typical assessment for danger involves observing the surroundings, starting with the cause of the accident and expanding outwards to include any situational hazards and history or secondary information given by witnesses, bystanders, or the emergency services. Once a primary danger assessment has been complete, this should not end the system of checking for danger, but should inform all other parts of the process.

If at any time the risk from any hazard poses a significant danger (as a factor of likelihood and seriousness) to the rescuer, they should consider whether they should approach the scene (or leave the scene if appropriate).

#### 4.6a.2 Emergency Action Principles (EAP)

Emergency action principles are key 'rules' that guide the actions of rescuers and potential rescuers. Because of the inherent nature of emergencies, no two are likely to be the same, so emergency action principles help to guide rescuers at incidents, by sticking to some basic tenets.

The adherence to (and contents of) the principles by would-be rescuers varies widely based on the training the people involved in emergency have received, the support available from emergency services (and the time it takes to arrive) and the emergency itself.

#### 4.6a.3 Emergency Management System

The emergency management system is a structured approach to managing emergencies. It involves the establishment of emergency plans, the training of personnel, the coordination of resources, and the implementation of emergency procedures. The system is designed to ensure that emergencies are effectively managed, minimizing the impact on the community and facilitating post-disaster rebuilding and recovery.

The emergency management system is guided by the principles of emergency management, including the key emergency principle of assessing danger. It also incorporates the principles of emergency action, which guide the actions of rescuers and potential rescuers at the scene of an emergency.

In the next section, we will explore the different modules of the Global Cityscope, which provide a comprehensive framework for disaster planning and post-disaster rebuilding and recovery.




### Subsection: 4.6b Role of Emergency Managers

Emergency managers play a crucial role in the emergency management process. They are responsible for the planning, coordination, and implementation of emergency management activities within their jurisdiction. This includes disaster planning, risk assessment, mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery.

Disaster planning is a critical aspect of emergency management. It involves identifying potential hazards, assessing the risks, and developing strategies to mitigate these risks. Emergency managers are responsible for developing and implementing disaster plans that outline the steps to be taken before, during, and after a disaster. These plans are essential for ensuring that communities are prepared to respond effectively to emergencies.

#### 4.6b.2 Risk Assessment

Risk assessment is a systematic process used to identify and analyze potential hazards and their associated risks. Emergency managers are responsible for conducting risk assessments to determine the likelihood and impact of potential hazards. This information is used to prioritize resources and develop strategies to mitigate these risks.

#### 4.6b.3 Mitigation

Mitigation involves taking proactive measures to reduce the impact of potential hazards. Emergency managers are responsible for implementing mitigation strategies, such as building stronger infrastructure, implementing early warning systems, and conducting public education campaigns. These measures are designed to reduce the likelihood and impact of disasters.

#### 4.6b.4 Preparedness

Preparedness is the process of preparing for an emergency. Emergency managers are responsible for ensuring that communities are prepared to respond to emergencies. This includes conducting training exercises, stockpiling necessary supplies, and developing communication plans.

#### 4.6b.5 Response

The response phase of emergency management involves the immediate actions taken to address an emergency. Emergency managers are responsible for coordinating the response efforts, which may include evacuation, search and rescue, and provision of emergency services.

#### 4.6b.6 Recovery

The recovery phase of emergency management involves the long-term efforts to rebuild and recover from a disaster. Emergency managers are responsible for coordinating these efforts, which may include rebuilding infrastructure, providing long-term housing solutions, and supporting affected communities.

In conclusion, emergency managers play a vital role in the emergency management process. They are responsible for planning, coordinating, and implementing emergency management activities within their jurisdiction.
