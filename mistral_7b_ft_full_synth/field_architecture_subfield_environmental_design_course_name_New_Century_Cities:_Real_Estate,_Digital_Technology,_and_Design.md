### Subsection: 6.1a Understanding the concept of space of flows in new century cities

The concept of "space of flows" is a crucial aspect of understanding the dynamics of new century cities. It is a term coined by Manuel Castells, a renowned sociologist and urban theorist, to describe the emerging spatial organization of our societies. Castells argues that the space of flows is a product of the information age, where the traditional boundaries of time and space are being redefined by the flow of information.

The space of flows is characterized by three key features:

1. **Flow**: The space of flows is a product of the continuous flow of information, goods, and people. This flow is facilitated by digital technology, which allows for instantaneous communication and transportation.

2. **Network**: The space of flows is organized around networks, both physical and virtual. These networks are the backbone of the information age, connecting people, places, and things in a complex web of interdependence.

3. **Complexity**: The space of flows is characterized by a high degree of complexity. The flow of information, goods, and people creates a dynamic and ever-changing landscape, making it difficult to predict or control.

The concept of space of flows has significant implications for urban development. It suggests that the traditional boundaries of cities, as we know them, are being blurred. The space of flows transcends the physical boundaries of cities, creating a new spatial organization that is shaped by the flow of information. This has profound implications for real estate, digital technology, and design.

In the realm of real estate, the space of flows has led to the emergence of new forms of property. Digital technology has enabled the creation of virtual real estate, where property is owned and traded in the virtual world. This has opened up new opportunities for investment and speculation, but it also raises questions about ownership, privacy, and security.

Digital technology has also transformed the way we interact with our cities. The space of flows has given rise to the concept of the "smart city", where digital technology is used to manage and optimize urban systems. This includes everything from traffic control and energy management to waste disposal and public safety. The space of flows has also led to the development of new urban design strategies, such as the "connected city", where digital technology is used to create a more livable and sustainable urban environment.

In conclusion, the concept of space of flows is a fundamental aspect of understanding the dynamics of new century cities. It is a product of the information age, characterized by the continuous flow of information, the organization of networks, and a high degree of complexity. It has profound implications for real estate, digital technology, and design, and it will continue to shape the future of our cities.

## Methodology

Integrated Modification Methodology is based on an iterative process involving the following four major phases:
The first phase, Investigation, is a synthesis-based inquiry into the systemic structure of the urban form. It begins with "Horizontal Investigation" in which the area under study is being dismantled into its morphology-generator elements, namely Urban Built-ups, Urban Voids, Types of Uses, and Links. It follows with "Vertical Investigation" that is a study of integral relationships between the mentioned elements. The output of Vertical Investigation is a set of quantitative descriptions and qualitative illustrations of certain attributes named "Key Categories". In a nutshell they are types of emergence that show how elements come to self-organize or to synchronize their states into forming a new level of organization. Hence in IMM, Key Categories are the result of an emergence process of interaction between elementary parts (Urban Built-ups, Urban Voids, Types of Uses, and Links) to form a synergy able to add value to the combined organization. Key categories are the products of the synergy between elementary parts, a new organization that emerge not (simply as) an additive result of the proprieties of the elementary parts. 
IMM declares that the city's functioning manner is chiefly driven from the Key Categories, hence, they have the most fundamental role in understanding the architecture of the city as a Complex Adaptive System. The Investigation phase concludes with the "Evaluation" step which is basically an examination of the system's performance by referring to a list of verified indicators associated with ecological sustainability. The same indicators are later used in the CAS retrofitting process necessary for the
