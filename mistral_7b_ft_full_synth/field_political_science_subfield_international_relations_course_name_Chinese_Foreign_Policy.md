# Chinese Foreign Policy: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Foreward

As we delve into the complex and ever-evolving landscape of Chinese foreign policy, it is crucial to acknowledge the historical context that has shaped it. The People's Republic of China (PRC) emerged as a major player in global politics during the late Cold War, following its involvement in the Korean War and the Sino-Soviet split. This period marked a significant shift in China's foreign policy, as it transitioned from an alliance with the Soviet Union to a more independent and assertive stance.

The PRC's foreign policy has been shaped by a variety of factors, including its domestic political and economic dynamics, its relationships with other major powers, and its perception of its own national interests. One of the key drivers of Chinese foreign policy has been its desire to secure its national interests and maintain a peaceful and stable international environment. This has been evident in its approach to territorial disputes, such as the South China Sea, where China has consistently advocated for a peaceful resolution through bilateral and multilateral negotiations.

However, China's foreign policy has also been characterized by a certain degree of pragmatism. As noted by former Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Yang Jiechi, China's foreign policy is guided by the principle of "non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries." This principle has been a cornerstone of China's foreign policy, and it has been consistently applied in its relations with other countries.

In recent years, China's foreign policy has also been shaped by its economic ambitions. As the world's largest economy, China has been actively pursuing a more assertive foreign policy, with a focus on expanding its global influence and securing its economic interests. This has been evident in its Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to connect China with Europe, Africa, and other parts of the world through a network of infrastructure projects.

As we embark on this comprehensive analysis of Chinese foreign policy, it is important to keep in mind the historical context and the various factors that have shaped it. By understanding the evolution of Chinese foreign policy, we can gain valuable insights into its current and future trajectory. This book aims to provide a comprehensive and objective analysis of Chinese foreign policy, shedding light on its historical roots, key drivers, and future prospects.

## Chapter 1: Historical and Geographical Legacies




### Section 1.1a Historical context and factors leading to the alliance

The alliance between China and the Soviet Union in the late 1940s was a significant event in Chinese foreign policy. It marked a shift in China's approach to international relations, as it moved away from its traditional isolationist stance and towards a more active role in global affairs. This alliance was formed in response to the changing political landscape in the aftermath of World War II, and it had a profound impact on China's foreign policy for decades to come.

#### The Rise of the Soviet Union

The Soviet Union, led by Joseph Stalin, emerged as a major global power after World War II. Its victory over Nazi Germany and its control over Eastern Europe solidified its position as a superpower. This was a significant shift from its previous role as one of the Allies during the war. The Soviet Union's rise was accompanied by a shift in its foreign policy, as it sought to expand its influence and establish communist governments in other countries.

#### The Sino-Soviet Alliance

The alliance between China and the Soviet Union was formed in 1949, just one year after the Communist Party took control of China. The alliance was primarily driven by China's desire for support and protection from the Soviet Union. China had just emerged from a long and devastating civil war, and it was still recovering from the effects of World War II. The Soviet Union, with its strong military and economic power, provided a much-needed ally for China.

The alliance was also driven by ideology, as both countries were committed to communism. The Soviet Union saw China as a potential ally in its quest to spread communism around the world. China, on the other hand, saw the Soviet Union as a model for its own development and modernization. The alliance was also seen as a way for China to gain access to Soviet technology and expertise.

#### The Impact of the Alliance

The alliance between China and the Soviet Union had a significant impact on Chinese foreign policy. It allowed China to establish itself as a major player in global affairs, and it provided a counterbalance to the United States, which was also emerging as a superpower. The alliance also allowed China to gain access to Soviet technology and expertise, which helped it modernize and develop its economy.

However, the alliance also had its limitations. The Soviet Union's support for China was often conditional, and it often prioritized its own interests over those of China. This led to tensions and conflicts between the two countries, particularly in the 1960s when the Sino-Soviet split occurred.

#### The Collapse of the Alliance

The alliance between China and the Soviet Union collapsed in the 1960s, marking a significant shift in Chinese foreign policy. The collapse was largely due to ideological differences and conflicting interests between the two countries. The Soviet Union's support for China had also become increasingly conditional, leading to tensions and conflicts.

The collapse of the alliance also marked a shift in China's foreign policy, as it moved towards a more independent and assertive approach. China's relationship with the Soviet Union has continued to be complex and often strained, but the alliance remains a significant event in Chinese foreign policy history.





### Subsection 1.1b The impact of the Sino-Soviet Split on Chinese foreign policy

The Sino-Soviet split, also known as the Sino-Soviet conflict, was a major event in Chinese foreign policy that occurred in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It marked a significant shift in China's relationship with the Soviet Union, from one of alliance and cooperation to one of conflict and competition. This split had a profound impact on Chinese foreign policy, shaping its approach to international relations for decades to come.

#### The Sino-Soviet Split

The Sino-Soviet split was a result of deep ideological and political differences between the two countries. These differences had been brewing since the early days of their alliance, but they came to a head in the late 1950s. The main source of conflict was the Soviet Union's support for Yugoslavia, which had broken away from the Soviet bloc in 1948. China saw this as a betrayal of communist principles and a threat to its own position within the communist world.

The split was also influenced by the Soviet Union's support for India during the Sino-Indian War of 1962. China saw this as a direct threat to its own security and a violation of the 1950 Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, saw its support for India as a way to gain influence in the region and counter China's growing power.

#### The Impact of the Sino-Soviet Split

The Sino-Soviet split had a significant impact on Chinese foreign policy. It marked a shift from China's previous policy of aligning itself with the Soviet Union to a more independent and assertive approach. China's relationship with the Soviet Union deteriorated rapidly, and the two countries engaged in a series of border conflicts and diplomatic disputes.

The split also led to a shift in China's foreign policy towards the United States. As its relationship with the Soviet Union deteriorated, China began to see the United States as a potential ally. This led to a period of rapprochement between the two countries, culminating in the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1979.

#### The Sino-Soviet Split and Chinese Foreign Policy Today

The Sino-Soviet split continues to shape Chinese foreign policy today. China's relationship with the Soviet Union remains strained, and the two countries continue to have disagreements on a range of issues, including human rights and territorial disputes. However, the split has also led to a more assertive and independent Chinese foreign policy, as China seeks to establish itself as a major global power.

The Sino-Soviet split also has implications for China's relationship with the United States. While the two countries have established diplomatic relations, there are still significant areas of disagreement, particularly in the areas of trade and human rights. The Sino-Soviet split serves as a reminder of the complexities and challenges of Chinese foreign policy, and the need for careful analysis and understanding of its historical and geographical legacies.





### Subsection 1.1c Consequences of the alliance's collapse

The collapse of the Sino-Soviet alliance in the late 1950s had far-reaching consequences for Chinese foreign policy. The split not only affected China's relationship with the Soviet Union but also its approach to international relations.

#### The Collapse of the Alliance

The collapse of the Sino-Soviet alliance was a result of deep ideological and political differences between the two countries. These differences had been brewing since the early days of their alliance, but they came to a head in the late 1950s. The main source of conflict was the Soviet Union's support for Yugoslavia, which had broken away from the Soviet bloc in 1948. China saw this as a betrayal of communist principles and a threat to its own position within the communist world.

The collapse of the alliance was also influenced by the Soviet Union's support for India during the Sino-Indian War of 1962. China saw this as a direct threat to its own security and a violation of the 1950 Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, saw its support for India as a way to gain influence in the region and counter China's growing power.

#### Consequences of the Collapse

The collapse of the alliance had significant consequences for Chinese foreign policy. It marked a shift from China's previous policy of aligning itself with the Soviet Union to a more independent and assertive approach. China's relationship with the Soviet Union deteriorated rapidly, and the two countries engaged in a series of border conflicts and diplomatic disputes.

The collapse of the alliance also led to a shift in China's foreign policy towards the United States. As its relationship with the Soviet Union deteriorated, China began to see the United States as a potential ally. This shift was evident in China's decision to establish diplomatic relations with the United States in 1979, marking a significant turning point in Chinese foreign policy.

#### The Impact of the Collapse on International Relations

The collapse of the Sino-Soviet alliance also had a significant impact on international relations. The split between the two communist powers led to a power vacuum in the region, which was filled by the United States and other Western powers. This shift in power dynamics led to a period of intense competition between the United States and the Soviet Union, known as the Cold War.

The collapse of the alliance also had a ripple effect on other countries in the region. India, for example, saw an opportunity to strengthen its relationship with the Soviet Union, which had supported it during the Sino-Indian War. This led to a shift in India's foreign policy, which had previously been aligned with China.

In conclusion, the collapse of the Sino-Soviet alliance in the late 1950s had a profound impact on Chinese foreign policy. It marked a significant shift in China's approach to international relations and led to a period of intense competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. The consequences of this collapse are still felt today, making it a crucial event in the history of Chinese foreign policy.





### Subsection 1.2a Rapprochement with the United States

The rapprochement between China and the United States in the late 1960s marked a significant shift in Chinese foreign policy. This shift was driven by a combination of factors, including China's growing economic and military power, its desire to improve its international image, and its perception of the United States as a potential ally against the Soviet Union.

#### The Rapprochement

The rapprochement between China and the United States began in the late 1960s, following the collapse of the Sino-Soviet alliance. China's growing economic and military power, coupled with its isolation from the international community, led it to seek a new ally. The United States, which had been wary of China due to its communist ideology, began to see China as a potential counterweight to the Soviet Union.

The rapprochement was facilitated by a series of secret meetings between Chinese and American officials, beginning in 1969. These meetings led to the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1979, marking a significant shift in Chinese foreign policy.

#### Consequences of the Rapprochement

The rapprochement between China and the United States had significant consequences for both countries and the international community. For China, it marked a shift from its previous policy of aligning itself with the Soviet Union to a more independent and assertive approach. This shift was evident in China's growing economic and military power, its increasing involvement in international organizations, and its improved relations with other major powers, including the United States.

For the United States, the rapprochement with China marked a significant shift in its foreign policy. It led to a gradual improvement in relations between the two countries, culminating in the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1979. This shift also led to a reevaluation of U.S. policy towards China, with the U.S. beginning to see China as a potential partner in addressing global issues, such as trade and security.

The rapprochement also had significant implications for the international community. It led to a reduction in tensions between the United States and China, which had been a major source of instability in the international system. It also led to a shift in the balance of power in the international system, with China's growing economic and military power challenging the dominance of the United States.

In conclusion, the rapprochement between China and the United States in the late 1960s marked a significant shift in Chinese foreign policy. It led to a gradual improvement in relations between the two countries, with both countries benefiting from the shift. It also had significant implications for the international community, leading to a reduction in tensions and a shift in the balance of power.





### Subsection 1.2b The role of the Nixon visit

The visit of U.S. President Richard Nixon to China in 1972 was a pivotal moment in the history of Chinese foreign policy. The visit, which was the first by a U.S. President to China since the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, marked a significant shift in the relationship between the two countries.

#### The Visit

The visit was the culmination of a series of secret meetings between Chinese and American officials, beginning in 1969. These meetings, which were facilitated by Nixon's national security adviser Henry Kissinger, led to the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1979.

The visit was marked by a series of historic events, including Nixon's meeting with Mao Zedong, the Chairman of the Communist Party of China, and his signing of the Shanghai Communiqué, a joint statement that laid out the principles of U.S.-China relations. The visit also led to the establishment of the U.S.-China Joint Commission on R&D, a body that has been instrumental in promoting scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries.

#### The Impact of the Visit

The visit had a profound impact on Chinese foreign policy. It marked a significant shift in China's approach to international relations, from its previous policy of aligning itself with the Soviet Union to a more independent and assertive approach. This shift was evident in China's growing economic and military power, its increasing involvement in international organizations, and its improved relations with other major powers, including the United States.

The visit also led to a gradual improvement in relations between the two countries, culminating in the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1979. This shift also led to a reevaluation of U.S. policy towards China, with the U.S. beginning to see China as a potential counterweight to the Soviet Union.

In conclusion, the visit of President Nixon to China in 1972 was a pivotal moment in the history of Chinese foreign policy. It marked a significant shift in the relationship between the two countries and had a profound impact on Chinese foreign policy.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the historical and geographical legacies that have shaped Chinese foreign policy. We have seen how China's long history of imperial rule, colonialism, and international isolation have influenced its approach to international relations. We have also examined the impact of China's geographical location, with its vast landmass and strategic position between Europe and the Pacific, on its foreign policy decisions.

China's historical legacy has been marked by a strong sense of national identity and a deep-rooted belief in its own superiority. This has led to a tendency towards assertive foreign policy, with China often seeking to expand its influence and control over its neighbors. However, China's geographical location has also forced it to adopt a cautious approach to foreign affairs, as it has had to navigate between competing powers and avoid direct conflicts.

In recent years, China's foreign policy has undergone significant changes as it has risen to become one of the world's major powers. While still influenced by its historical and geographical legacies, China's foreign policy is now shaped by a complex interplay of economic, political, and strategic considerations. As we move forward in this book, we will delve deeper into these factors and their impact on Chinese foreign policy.

## Chapter: The Impact of the Cold War

### Introduction

The Cold War, a period of intense political and military tension between the United States and the Soviet Union that lasted from the end of World War II in 1945 until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, had a profound impact on Chinese foreign policy. This chapter will delve into the intricate dynamics of this relationship, exploring how the Cold War shaped China's foreign policy decisions and its global standing.

The Cold War was a time of significant political and economic upheaval, with the United States and the Soviet Union vying for global dominance. China, as one of the major players in this power struggle, found itself caught in the crossfire. Its foreign policy during this period was largely influenced by its desire to maintain its sovereignty and protect its national interests, while also navigating the complexities of the global political landscape.

This chapter will examine the key events and policies that shaped China's foreign policy during the Cold War, including its relationship with the United States and the Soviet Union, its involvement in the Korean War, and its pursuit of nuclear weapons. We will also explore the long-lasting effects of the Cold War on China's foreign policy, including its current stance on issues such as human rights and international trade.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the Cold War's impact on Chinese foreign policy, and how this historical period continues to influence China's role in the global arena today.




### Subsection 1.2c Impacts on regional dynamics

The alignment of China with the United States during the 1969-1981 period had significant impacts on regional dynamics, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. This alignment was a result of the Nixon visit and the subsequent establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

#### The Impact of Alignment on Regional Dynamics

The alignment of China with the United States led to a shift in the power dynamics of the region. The United States, which had been the dominant power in the region, faced a new challenge with the rise of China. This led to a period of intense competition between the two countries, with the United States seeking to maintain its dominance and China seeking to assert its own power.

The alignment also led to a shift in the alliances of the region. Countries that had been aligned with the United States, such as Japan and South Korea, were now faced with the challenge of navigating their relationships with both the United States and China. This led to a period of uncertainty and instability in the region, as these countries sought to maintain their relationships with both powers.

#### The Impact of Alignment on China's Foreign Policy

The alignment with the United States also had a significant impact on China's foreign policy. China's previous policy of aligning itself with the Soviet Union was replaced by a more independent and assertive approach. This was evident in China's growing economic and military power, its increasing involvement in international organizations, and its improved relations with other major powers, including the United States.

The alignment also led to a shift in China's approach to regional dynamics. China's previous policy of non-interference in the affairs of other countries was replaced by a more assertive approach. This was evident in China's involvement in regional conflicts, such as the Vietnam War and the Korean War.

#### The Impact of Alignment on Regional Conflict

The alignment of China with the United States also had a significant impact on regional conflict. The competition between the two powers led to an increase in regional tensions and conflicts. This was evident in the Vietnam War, where the United States and China supported opposing sides, and in the Korean War, where China intervened on behalf of North Korea.

The alignment also led to a shift in the dynamics of regional conflicts. The United States, which had been the dominant power in the region, now faced a new challenge with the rise of China. This led to a period of intense competition between the two powers, with the United States seeking to maintain its dominance and China seeking to assert its own power.

In conclusion, the alignment of China with the United States during the 1969-1981 period had significant impacts on regional dynamics. It led to a shift in the power dynamics of the region, a shift in alliances, and an increase in regional conflict. These impacts continue to shape the dynamics of the region today.




### Subsection 1.3a China's approach to nonalignment

China's approach to nonalignment has been a key aspect of its foreign policy since the 1980s. This approach has been shaped by China's historical and geographical legacies, as well as its desire to assert its own power and influence in the international arena.

#### The Concept of Nonalignment

Nonalignment is a foreign policy stance that seeks to avoid alignment with any major power bloc. It is often associated with the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), a group of developing countries that emerged in the 1960s and sought to assert their independence from the Cold War superpowers. China's approach to nonalignment has been influenced by this movement, as well as by its own historical experiences.

#### China's Historical and Geographical Legacies

China's historical and geographical legacies have played a significant role in shaping its approach to nonalignment. China's long history of imperialism and colonialism has led to a deep-seated desire to assert its own power and influence in the international arena. This has been reinforced by China's geographical location, which has made it a key player in the Asia-Pacific region.

China's historical and geographical legacies have also led to a strong sense of nationalism and a desire to protect its sovereignty. This has been evident in China's approach to nonalignment, which has been characterized by a reluctance to align itself with any major power bloc. Instead, China has sought to maintain its own independence and assert its own interests in the international arena.

#### China's Approach to Nonalignment

China's approach to nonalignment has been characterized by a careful balancing act between maintaining its own independence and asserting its own interests, while also maintaining good relations with major powers. This has been evident in China's relationships with the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, as well as its relationships with major powers in the post-Cold War era.

China's approach to nonalignment has also been shaped by its economic and military power. As China has become a major economic and military power, it has been able to assert its own interests in the international arena with greater confidence. This has led to a more assertive approach to nonalignment, as China has been able to play a more active role in international affairs.

#### The Impact of Nonalignment on Regional Dynamics

China's approach to nonalignment has had a significant impact on regional dynamics, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. China's nonalignment has allowed it to maintain good relations with major powers, while also asserting its own interests in the region. This has led to a period of intense competition between China and the United States, as both powers seek to assert their dominance in the region.

China's nonalignment has also led to a shift in the alliances of the region. Countries that had been aligned with the United States, such as Japan and South Korea, have been faced with the challenge of navigating their relationships with both the United States and China. This has led to a period of uncertainty and instability in the region, as these countries seek to maintain their relationships with both powers.

#### The Impact of Nonalignment on China's Foreign Policy

China's approach to nonalignment has also had a significant impact on its foreign policy. China's nonalignment has allowed it to maintain its own independence and assert its own interests in the international arena. This has led to a more assertive approach to foreign policy, as China has been able to play a more active role in international affairs.

China's nonalignment has also led to a shift in its approach to regional dynamics. China's previous policy of non-interference in the affairs of other countries has been replaced by a more assertive approach. This has been evident in China's involvement in regional conflicts, such as the Vietnam War and the Korean War.

In conclusion, China's approach to nonalignment has been a key aspect of its foreign policy since the 1980s. It has been shaped by China's historical and geographical legacies, as well as its desire to assert its own power and influence in the international arena. This approach has had a significant impact on regional dynamics and China's foreign policy, and will continue to shape China's approach to international affairs in the future.





### Subsection 1.3b Balancing act between global powers

China's approach to nonalignment has also involved a careful balancing act between global powers. This has been evident in China's relationships with the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, as well as its relationships with major powers in the post-Cold War era.

#### Balancing Act during the Cold War

During the Cold War, China's approach to nonalignment involved a careful balancing act between the United States and the Soviet Union. China's relationship with the United States was marked by tension and conflict, due to the U.S.'s support for Taiwan and its involvement in the Korean War. However, China also sought to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union, with which it shared a border and had a long history of cooperation.

China's balancing act during the Cold War was also evident in its approach to international organizations. While China was initially excluded from the United Nations due to its support for North Korea in the Korean War, it later became a member and used its position to assert its own interests. This included advocating for a more equitable distribution of power within the organization, and for the inclusion of developing countries in decision-making processes.

#### Balancing Act in the Post-Cold War Era

In the post-Cold War era, China's approach to nonalignment has continued to involve a careful balancing act between global powers. This has been evident in China's relationships with the United States, which has become the dominant global power, as well as with other major powers such as Russia and India.

China's relationship with the United States has been marked by both competition and cooperation. While the two countries have had significant economic and political differences, they have also worked together on issues such as climate change and North Korea. China's approach to the United States has involved a careful balancing act, with China seeking to assert its own interests while also maintaining good relations.

China's relationships with other major powers have also involved a careful balancing act. For example, China's relationship with Russia has been marked by both cooperation and competition, with the two countries working together on issues such as energy security and the Korean peninsula, while also competing for influence in Central Asia. China's relationship with India has also been marked by both cooperation and competition, with the two countries working together on issues such as trade and infrastructure development, while also competing for influence in the Asia-Pacific region.

In conclusion, China's approach to nonalignment has involved a careful balancing act between global powers. This has been evident in China's relationships with the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, as well as its relationships with major powers in the post-Cold War era. China's approach has been shaped by its historical and geographical legacies, as well as its desire to assert its own power and influence in the international arena.

### Conclusion

## Chapter: The Rise of China:

### Introduction

The rise of China as a global power has been a topic of great interest and debate in the international community. This chapter will delve into the complexities of China's rise, examining the historical, economic, and political factors that have contributed to its ascendancy. 

China's rise has been marked by a series of significant events, including its transition from a closed, centrally planned economy to a more open, market-oriented one, its rapid economic growth, and its increasing global influence. These developments have raised questions about China's intentions and its impact on the international order. 

In this chapter, we will explore the historical roots of China's rise, examining how its long history of imperialism and colonialism has shaped its current foreign policy. We will also examine the economic factors that have driven China's growth, including its industrialization, urbanization, and integration into the global economy.

### Subsection 1.3c Influence on regional stability

China's nonaligned foreign policy has had a significant influence on regional stability, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. This influence can be seen in China's relationships with its neighbors, as well as in its approach to regional organizations and conflicts.

#### Influence on Neighbors

China's nonaligned foreign policy has been instrumental in shaping its relationships with its neighbors. China's approach to nonalignment has allowed it to maintain good relations with both the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and with major powers such as the United States, Russia, and India in the post-Cold War era. This has helped to prevent regional conflicts and maintain stability.

For example, China's relationship with the Soviet Union during the Cold War helped to prevent conflicts between the two powers in the Asia-Pacific region. Similarly, China's relationship with the United States has helped to prevent conflicts in the region, despite significant economic and political differences between the two countries.

#### Influence on Regional Organizations

China's nonaligned foreign policy has also been instrumental in shaping its approach to regional organizations. China's membership in the United Nations has allowed it to assert its own interests and advocate for a more equitable distribution of power within the organization. This has helped to maintain stability in the region by promoting a sense of fairness and equality among member states.

In addition, China's approach to regional conflicts has been guided by its nonaligned foreign policy. China has consistently advocated for peaceful resolution of conflicts and has been a key player in mediating conflicts in the region, such as the Korean War and the Vietnam War. This has helped to maintain stability in the region by preventing the escalation of conflicts.

#### Influence on Regional Stability

China's nonaligned foreign policy has had a significant influence on regional stability. By maintaining good relations with its neighbors and promoting peaceful resolution of conflicts, China has helped to prevent regional conflicts and maintain stability. This has been particularly important in the Asia-Pacific region, which has been a hotbed of conflicts in the past.

In conclusion, China's nonaligned foreign policy has played a crucial role in maintaining regional stability. Its approach to nonalignment has allowed it to maintain good relations with major powers and promote peaceful resolution of conflicts, thereby preventing regional conflicts and maintaining stability. This has been particularly evident in the Asia-Pacific region, where China's influence has been instrumental in maintaining stability.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the historical and geographical legacies that have shaped Chinese foreign policy. We have seen how China's long history of imperialism and colonialism has influenced its approach to international relations. We have also examined the impact of China's geographical location, with its vast landmass and diverse ethnic groups, on its foreign policy decisions.

China's historical legacy of imperialism and colonialism has instilled in its leaders a sense of superiority and a desire to expand its influence.

## Chapter 2: Foreign Policy Making:




### Subsection: 2.1a Historical use of force in Chinese foreign policy

China's use of force in foreign policy has been a topic of great interest and debate among scholars and policymakers alike. As one of the world's major powers, China's actions and decisions have a significant impact on the global stage. In this section, we will delve into the historical context of China's use of force and how it has evolved over time.

#### Ancient China

The use of force has been a part of Chinese foreign policy since ancient times. The ancient Chinese believed in the concept of "shi," which translates to "strategic advantage." This concept emphasized the importance of using force strategically and effectively to achieve one's objectives. The ancient Chinese also believed in the concept of "wei qi," which translates to "strategic thinking." This concept emphasized the importance of thinking ahead and anticipating the actions of one's opponents.

#### The Mongol Empire

The Mongol Empire, which spanned from the 13th to the 14th centuries, was a major power in Eurasia. The Mongols were known for their use of force and their ability to conquer large territories. The Mongols' use of force was heavily influenced by their nomadic lifestyle and their belief in the concept of "shi." The Mongols were also known for their use of psychological warfare, where they would use fear and intimidation to weaken their opponents before engaging in physical combat.

#### The Manchu Empire

The Manchu Empire, which spanned from the 17th to the 19th centuries, was another major power in China. The Manchus were known for their use of force and their ability to expand their empire through military conquest. The Manchus' use of force was heavily influenced by their belief in the concept of "shi" and their strategic thinking. The Manchus also used psychological warfare, similar to the Mongols, to weaken their opponents before engaging in physical combat.

#### Modern China

In modern times, China's use of force has evolved and adapted to the changing global landscape. China's use of force is now heavily influenced by its economic power and its desire to maintain its sovereignty and territorial integrity. China's use of force is also guided by its principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. However, China has also been known to use force in disputes over territorial claims, such as in the South China Sea.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, China's use of force in foreign policy has been a part of its history and culture for centuries. From ancient times to modern times, the use of force has been a crucial tool in achieving China's objectives and maintaining its power and influence in the global arena. As China continues to rise as a major global power, its use of force will continue to be a topic of great interest and debate among scholars and policymakers.


## Chapter 2: Foreign Policy Making:




### Subsection: 2.1b Modern perspectives on the use of force

As China continues to rise as a global power, its use of force in foreign policy has become a topic of great interest and debate among scholars and policymakers alike. In this section, we will explore modern perspectives on the use of force in Chinese foreign policy.

#### The Role of Technology

One of the key factors that have influenced China's use of force in modern times is technology. With the advancements in technology, China has been able to develop a strong military and use force more effectively. The use of modern weapons and equipment, such as drones and cyber warfare, has allowed China to project power and influence in a more efficient and effective manner.

#### The Influence of International Law

International law has also played a significant role in shaping China's use of force in foreign policy. China has been a vocal critic of the United States' use of force, particularly in the Middle East, and has used this as a basis for its own foreign policy. China has also been a strong advocate for international law and has used its economic power to push for a more prominent role in global governance.

#### The Rise of Soft Power

In addition to its use of force, China has also been actively promoting its soft power in recent years. This includes initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to increase China's economic influence and soft power in the global arena. China has also been using cultural diplomacy and media propaganda to shape its image and influence public opinion.

#### The Impact of Domestic Politics

Domestic politics have also played a significant role in shaping China's use of force in foreign policy. The rise of nationalism and the desire to be seen as a strong and powerful nation have been driving factors in China's use of force. Additionally, the Chinese government's need to maintain stability and control over its population has also influenced its foreign policy decisions.

#### The Future of Chinese Foreign Policy

As China continues to rise as a global power, its use of force in foreign policy will continue to be a topic of great interest and debate. With its growing economic and military power, China will likely continue to assert its influence and use force when necessary. However, the rise of soft power and the impact of domestic politics will also play a significant role in shaping China's foreign policy decisions. 





### Subsection: 2.1c Controversies and implications

China's use of force in foreign policy has been a topic of great controversy and debate. Some argue that China's actions are a necessary response to threats and challenges, while others criticize its actions as aggressive and violating international law. In this section, we will explore some of the key controversies surrounding China's use of force and their implications.

#### The South China Sea Dispute

One of the most contentious issues in China's foreign policy is its territorial dispute with other countries in the South China Sea. China claims sovereignty over the entire South China Sea, including the Spratly and Paracel Islands, which are also claimed by other countries. This has led to tensions and conflicts, particularly with Vietnam and the Philippines, over fishing rights and oil exploration.

China's actions in the South China Sea have been met with strong criticism from the international community. The United States, in particular, has been vocal in its opposition to China's actions, with President Barack Obama stating that the US has a national interest in maintaining stability and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. This has led to increased military presence and patrols in the region by the US and its allies.

#### The Use of Force in Xinjiang

Another controversial aspect of China's use of force is its actions in the Xinjiang region. The Chinese government has been accused of human rights violations, including the use of excessive force and detention of Uighur Muslims. The Chinese government justifies its actions as necessary to maintain stability and combat terrorism, but human rights organizations and foreign governments have raised concerns about the treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang.

The use of force in Xinjiang has also led to tensions with other countries, particularly the United States. The US has imposed sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and has called for an end to the detention and mistreatment of Uighurs. This has led to increased tensions between the two countries and has raised concerns about the impact on their overall relationship.

#### The Belt and Road Initiative

China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has also been a source of controversy and debate. The BRI aims to increase China's economic influence and soft power through infrastructure and development projects in other countries. However, there have been concerns about the potential negative impacts of the BRI, including debt-trap diplomacy and the exploitation of natural resources.

The BRI has also faced criticism for its lack of transparency and accountability. Many of the projects are financed by Chinese state-owned enterprises, and there have been reports of corruption and mismanagement. This has led to concerns about the sustainability and long-term implications of the BRI for both China and the countries involved.

In conclusion, China's use of force in foreign policy has been a topic of great controversy and debate. Its actions in the South China Sea, Xinjiang, and through the Belt and Road Initiative have raised concerns about its adherence to international law and its impact on global stability. As China continues to rise as a global power, these controversies and implications will continue to be a key focus in the study of Chinese foreign policy.





### Subsection: 2.2a China's evolving grand strategy

China's grand strategy has been a topic of great interest and debate among scholars and policymakers. As China continues to rise as a global power, its grand strategy has evolved and adapted to meet the changing dynamics of the international system. In this section, we will explore the key elements of China's grand strategy and how it has evolved over time.

#### The Rise of China's Grand Strategy

China's grand strategy can be traced back to its ancient history, with the concept of "tianxia" or "all under heaven" being a key guiding principle. This concept emphasizes the importance of maintaining a harmonious and stable world order, with China at the center. This principle has been a driving force behind China's foreign policy, with the country seeking to maintain a peaceful and stable international environment that allows for its continued rise as a global power.

In recent years, China's grand strategy has evolved to incorporate more modern concepts, such as the "China Dream" and the "Belt and Road Initiative." The China Dream, first introduced by President Xi Jinping in 2017, emphasizes the country's pursuit of national rejuvenation and becoming a modern, prosperous, and influential nation. This has been a key driver of China's economic and military modernization efforts.

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), first announced by President Xi in 2013, is a massive infrastructure and economic development project that aims to connect China with Europe, Africa, and other parts of the world through a network of roads, railways, ports, and other infrastructure. The BRI is seen as a key component of China's grand strategy, as it not only promotes economic development and trade, but also enhances China's soft power and influence in the international community.

#### The Role of Primacy in China's Grand Strategy

One of the key debates surrounding China's grand strategy is the role of primacy. Primacy, as a grand strategy, advocates for the United States to maintain ultimate hegemony and dominate the international system economically, politically, and militarily. This strategy rejects any return to bipolarity or multipolarity and prevents the emergence of any peer competitor. In the case of China, primacy holds that the US should work to contain and prevent its rise as a global power.

However, China's grand strategy does not align with the principles of primacy. Instead, China's strategy focuses on maintaining a peaceful and stable international environment, while also promoting its own economic and military modernization. This approach is in line with the concept of "tianxia" and the pursuit of the China Dream.

#### The Impact of China's Grand Strategy on Foreign Policy

China's grand strategy has had a significant impact on its foreign policy decisions. As China continues to rise as a global power, it has become more assertive in its foreign policy, particularly in the South China Sea and other territorial disputes. This has led to tensions with other countries, particularly the United States, and has raised concerns about China's intentions and actions in the international community.

However, China's grand strategy also includes a focus on economic development and cooperation, as seen in the Belt and Road Initiative. This has led to increased economic ties and cooperation with other countries, particularly in Africa and Europe. China's grand strategy also emphasizes the importance of maintaining a peaceful and stable international environment, which has led to its involvement in peacekeeping operations and other international initiatives.

In conclusion, China's grand strategy has evolved and adapted to meet the changing dynamics of the international system. While it may not align with the principles of primacy, it has had a significant impact on China's foreign policy decisions and its role in the global arena. As China continues to rise as a global power, its grand strategy will continue to shape its foreign policy and its interactions with other countries.





### Subsection: 2.2b The Belt and Road Initiative

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a key component of China's grand strategy, as it not only promotes economic development and trade, but also enhances China's soft power and influence in the international community. The BRI was first announced by President Xi Jinping in 2013, and it has since become a major focus of China's foreign policy.

#### The Objectives of the Belt and Road Initiative

The Belt and Road Initiative has several stated objectives, including promoting economic development, enhancing connectivity, and fostering cultural exchange. The initiative aims to construct a unified large market and make full use of both international and domestic markets, through cultural exchange and integration, to enhance mutual understanding and trust of member nations. This is achieved through infrastructure investment, education, construction materials, railway and highway, automobile, real estate, power grid, and iron and steel.

The BRI also addresses an "infrastructure gap" and has the potential to accelerate economic growth across the Asia Pacific, Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe. A report from the World Pensions Council (WPC) estimates that Asia, excluding China, requires up to US$900 billion of infrastructure investments per year over the next decade, mostly in debt instruments, 50% above current infrastructure spending rates. This gaping need for long-term capital explains why many Asian and Eastern European heads of state "gladly expressed their interest to join this new international financial institution focusing solely on 'real assets' and infrastructure-driven economic growth".

#### The Impact of the Belt and Road Initiative

The Belt and Road Initiative has had a significant impact on the global economy and international relations. The project has already invested in more than 150 countries and international organizations, with a total investment of over US$2 trillion. This has not only boosted economic growth and development in these countries, but also enhanced their connectivity and trade with China.

Moreover, the BRI has also helped to increase China's soft power and influence in the international community. By investing in infrastructure and development projects in other countries, China has been able to establish a strong presence and build relationships with other nations. This has also allowed China to promote its own economic and political interests, and to challenge the dominance of Western powers in global affairs.

#### The Future of the Belt and Road Initiative

The Belt and Road Initiative is expected to continue to play a crucial role in China's grand strategy in the future. As China's economic and military power continues to grow, the BRI will become even more important in promoting its interests and enhancing its influence in the international community. The BRI will also continue to drive economic development and trade, and to address the infrastructure gap in developing countries.

However, there are also challenges and criticisms surrounding the BRI. Some have raised concerns about the potential for debt-trap diplomacy, where developing countries may struggle to repay their loans from China. Others have questioned the environmental impact of the BRI, particularly in terms of the construction of new infrastructure projects.

Despite these challenges, the Belt and Road Initiative remains a key component of China's grand strategy, and its impact on the global economy and international relations will continue to be significant. 





### Subsection: 2.2c Implications for regional and global order

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has significant implications for both regional and global order. As a grand strategy, the BRI aims to enhance China's economic and political influence, and it has the potential to reshape the global economic landscape.

#### Regional Implications

The BRI has been particularly beneficial to the countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The initiative has provided much-needed infrastructure investment, which has helped to boost economic growth and development. This has been particularly important for countries that have been struggling to meet their infrastructure needs due to limited resources. The BRI has also helped to enhance regional connectivity, which has facilitated trade and economic integration. This has been particularly beneficial for countries that are heavily reliant on trade, such as China and other Asian countries.

However, the BRI has also raised concerns among some countries in the region. Some have expressed concerns about the potential for debt-trap diplomacy, where China provides infrastructure loans that the recipient countries may struggle to repay. This could lead to a loss of sovereignty for these countries, as China may demand control over these assets to recover its loans.

#### Global Implications

The BRI has also had significant implications for the global order. The initiative has the potential to reshape the global economic landscape, as it aims to construct a unified large market that will enhance mutual understanding and trust among member nations. This could lead to a more integrated global economy, with China playing a leading role.

However, the BRI has also raised concerns among some countries, particularly the United States. The US has expressed concerns about the lack of transparency in the BRI, as well as the potential for China to use the initiative to gain strategic advantages. The US has also raised concerns about the potential for the BRI to create a debt trap for developing countries, which could lead to a loss of sovereignty for these countries.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, the Belt and Road Initiative has significant implications for both regional and global order. While it has provided much-needed infrastructure investment and enhanced regional connectivity, it has also raised concerns about debt-trap diplomacy and the potential for a loss of sovereignty. As the BRI continues to evolve, it will be important for countries to carefully consider the implications of this initiative for their own economic and political interests.




### Subsection: 2.3a China's role in international organizations

China's role in international organizations has been a topic of great interest and debate. As one of the world's major powers, China's actions and policies have a significant impact on global affairs. In this section, we will examine China's role in international organizations, with a particular focus on its role in the United Nations.

#### China's Role in the United Nations

China's relationship with the United Nations has been complex and evolving. Prior to 1971, the Republic of China based on the island of Taiwan held China's UN seat. However, on 25 October 1971, the People's Republic of China took control of the seat with the passing of UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 by a vote of 76 to 35 with 17 abstentions. This marked a significant shift in China's international standing.

Today, China plays a leadership role in the United Nations. It holds a permanent seat and veto power on the United Nations Security Council, which is one of the most influential bodies in the organization. This position allows China to play a key role in shaping global policies and decisions.

China's role in the United Nations is not without controversy, however. Some critics argue that China's human rights record and its treatment of ethnic minorities, such as the Uighurs, should disqualify it from its position on the Security Council. Others argue that China's economic power and growing influence in Africa and other developing regions give it a unique perspective that should be valued in the United Nations.

#### China's Role in International Organizations

In addition to its role in the United Nations, China plays a significant role in a variety of other international organizations. For example, China is a member of the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Trade Organization (WTO). In these organizations, China's influence is growing as its economic power continues to expand.

China's role in these organizations is often a topic of debate. Some argue that China's economic power and growing influence should give it a more prominent role in these organizations. Others argue that China's human rights record and lack of transparency in its economic policies should limit its influence.

In conclusion, China's role in international organizations is a complex and evolving topic. As China continues to rise as a global power, its role in these organizations will continue to be a topic of great interest and debate.




### Subsection: 2.3b Challenges and benefits of integration

China's integration with international organizations has been a topic of great interest and debate. As one of the world's major powers, China's actions and policies have a significant impact on global affairs. In this section, we will examine the challenges and benefits of China's integration with international organizations, with a particular focus on its role in the United Nations.

#### Challenges of Integration

China's integration with international organizations has not been without challenges. One of the main challenges has been its human rights record and treatment of ethnic minorities. This has led to criticism from other member states and has hindered China's ability to fully participate in certain organizations, such as the United Nations Human Rights Council.

Another challenge has been China's economic power and growing influence in developing regions. This has raised concerns among other member states about China's intentions and potential impact on global policies and decisions. Some argue that China's economic power gives it too much influence in international organizations, while others argue that it is simply reflective of China's growing global power.

As one of the world's major powers, China's actions and policies have a significant impact on global affairs. In this section, we will examine some case studies of China's involvement in international organizations, with a particular focus on its role in the United Nations.

#### China's Role in the United Nations

China's involvement in the United Nations has been a key aspect of its foreign policy. As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, China has a significant say in global affairs and can use its influence to promote its own interests. This has been evident in China's role in addressing global issues such as climate change and human rights.

One of the most notable case studies of China's involvement in the United Nations is its stance on climate change. China has been a major contributor to global carbon emissions, and its actions have been closely watched by other member states. In recent years, China has taken steps to address its carbon emissions and has become a leader in renewable energy. This has been largely driven by its own domestic concerns, as China faces significant environmental challenges. However, China's actions have also had a positive impact on global efforts to combat climate change.

Another important case study is China's role in addressing human rights issues within the United Nations. As mentioned earlier, China's human rights record has been a source of criticism from other member states. However, China has also been a vocal advocate for human rights, particularly in regards to issues such as poverty and inequality. This has been evident in China's support for the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, which aim to address these issues on a global scale.

#### China's Role in the World Health Organization

China's involvement in the World Health Organization (WHO) has also been a topic of interest. As one of the world's major powers, China's actions and policies have a significant impact on global health. In recent years, China has been a key player in addressing global health issues such as the Ebola outbreak and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

One of the most notable case studies of China's involvement in the WHO is its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. China's early actions to contain the virus and its subsequent efforts to develop a vaccine have been widely praised. This has been a significant contribution to global efforts to combat the pandemic.

#### Conclusion

China's involvement in international organizations has been a key aspect of its foreign policy. Through its actions and policies, China has been able to shape global affairs and promote its own interests. However, it has also faced challenges and criticism, particularly in regards to its human rights record and economic power. As China continues to rise as a global power, its involvement in international organizations will continue to be a topic of great interest and debate.

Additionally, the country's long history of imperialism and colonialism has also influenced its approach to international relations.

Furthermore, we have also seen how China's foreign policy is closely tied to its domestic politics. The country's rapid economic growth and increasing global influence have led to a shift in its foreign policy priorities. China's leaders now face the challenge of balancing its domestic needs with its growing global responsibilities. This has resulted in a more assertive and proactive foreign policy, as seen in its Belt and Road Initiative and its increasing involvement in international organizations.

### Subsection: 3.1a Historical background of US-Taiwan-China relations

The relationship between the United States, Taiwan, and China has been a complex and ever-evolving one. The United States has been a key player in the Taiwan issue since the 1970s, and its actions have had a significant impact on the dynamics of the relationship between Taiwan and China.

The United States' involvement in the Taiwan issue began in the 1940s when it played a crucial role in the Chinese Civil War. The US supported the Nationalist Party, led by Chiang Kai-shek, in their fight against the Communist Party led by Mao Zedong. However, the Nationalists were ultimately defeated, and the Communists established the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949. The Nationalists, led by Chiang, fled to the island of Taiwan, where they established the Republic of China (ROC).

The United States continued to support the ROC government in Taiwan, viewing it as the legitimate government of China. This support was formalized in the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty of 1954, which committed the United States to defend Taiwan against any external threats.

However, the relationship between the United States and Taiwan began to change in the 1970s. In 1971, the United Nations Security Council voted to recognize the PRC as the sole legal government of China, and the United States followed suit by establishing diplomatic relations with the PRC in 1979. This marked a significant shift in US foreign policy towards China, and it also had a profound impact on the relationship between the United States and Taiwan.

The United States' decision to establish diplomatic relations with the PRC was met with strong opposition from the ROC government in Taiwan. The ROC saw this as a betrayal and a violation of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty. However, the United States argued that it was necessary to establish relations with the PRC in order to improve its standing in the international community and to prevent the spread of communism in the region.

The United States' decision to establish diplomatic relations with the PRC also had a significant impact on its relationship with Taiwan. The United States was now faced with the dilemma of how to maintain its commitment to defend Taiwan while also maintaining its relationship with the PRC. This led to a series of negotiations and agreements, known as the Three Joint Communiqués, which aimed to address the issue of Taiwan.

The first joint communiqué, signed in 1972, stated that the United States would continue to maintain unofficial relations with Taiwan and would not establish diplomatic relations with the PRC. The second joint communiqué, signed in 1979, stated that the United States would gradually reduce its arms sales to Taiwan and would not support any attempt by Taiwan to declare independence. The third joint communiqué, signed in 1982, stated that the United States would not support any attempt by Taiwan to change the status quo by force.

Despite these agreements, the relationship between the United States and Taiwan has continued to be a source of contention. The United States has faced pressure from both Taiwan and the PRC to clarify its stance on Taiwan. In recent years, there have been concerns about the United States' commitment to defending Taiwan, particularly under the Trump administration.

In 2016, then-president-elect Donald Trump caused a stir when he accepted a phone call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, breaking with decades of protocol and angering the PRC. This incident sparked concerns about the United States' commitment to the One China policy, which states that the United States recognizes the PRC as the sole legal government of China.

Since then, there have been reports of increased military presence in the Taiwan Strait, with the United States sending warships and aircraft to the region. This has raised concerns about the potential for a military conflict between the United States and China over Taiwan.

In conclusion, the relationship between the United States, Taiwan, and China has been a complex and ever-evolving one. The United States' involvement in the Taiwan issue has had a significant impact on the dynamics of this relationship, and it continues to be a source of contention and concern today. 





### Subsection: 3.1b Current dynamics and challenges

The current dynamics of US-Taiwan relations are complex and multifaceted. The United States continues to maintain unofficial relations with Taiwan, and the two countries have a strong economic and military relationship. However, there are also challenges and tensions in the relationship, particularly in the areas of trade and security.

One of the main challenges in US-Taiwan relations is the issue of trade. The United States has been pushing for Taiwan to open its markets to more American goods and services, but Taiwan has been resistant due to concerns about its own economy and domestic politics. This has led to tensions between the two countries, with the United States accusing Taiwan of not living up to its commitments under the US-Taiwan Trade Agreement.

In addition to trade, there are also challenges in the area of security. The United States has been concerned about Taiwan's military modernization efforts, particularly its purchase of advanced weapons from the United States. The United States has also been critical of Taiwan's lack of transparency in its military spending and has called on Taiwan to increase its defense spending.

Despite these challenges, the United States and Taiwan continue to have a strong relationship, with both countries viewing each other as important partners. The United States sees Taiwan as a key ally in the region, particularly in its efforts to contain China's growing influence. Taiwan, on the other hand, sees the United States as its main source of military and economic support.

However, there are also challenges in the relationship that could potentially impact its future. One of the main challenges is the issue of Taiwan's sovereignty. The United States has long maintained a policy of "strategic ambiguity" when it comes to Taiwan's sovereignty, refusing to take a stance on whether it considers Taiwan to be a part of China or an independent country. This has been a source of frustration for Taiwan, which sees the United States' ambiguity as a way to avoid upsetting China.

Another challenge is the issue of cross-strait relations. The United States has been pushing for a peaceful resolution to the Taiwan issue, but it has also been critical of China's actions in the region. The United States has accused China of using economic and military pressure to intimidate Taiwan and has called on China to stop its provocative actions.

In conclusion, the current dynamics of US-Taiwan relations are complex and multifaceted. While the two countries have a strong relationship, there are also challenges and tensions that must be addressed in order to maintain a stable and productive partnership. The future of US-Taiwan relations will depend on how these challenges are addressed and how the two countries work together to navigate the complex dynamics of the region.





### Subsection: 3.1c Future outlook and potential scenarios

As we look towards the future of US-Taiwan relations, there are several potential scenarios that could shape the dynamics of this relationship. One of the most likely scenarios is a continuation of the current dynamics, with the United States and Taiwan maintaining a strong economic and military relationship, but also facing challenges in areas such as trade and security.

Another potential scenario is a deepening of the relationship, with the United States and Taiwan working together more closely on issues such as trade, security, and technology. This could be driven by a shared concern over China's growing influence and a desire to contain it.

However, there are also potential challenges and obstacles that could impact the future of US-Taiwan relations. One of these is the issue of Taiwan's sovereignty. As China continues to assert its dominance in the region, it may become more aggressive in its pursuit of Taiwan, leading to increased tensions and potential conflicts between the United States and China.

Another potential challenge is the issue of trade. As the United States and China continue to engage in a trade war, there may be pressure for the United States to choose between its two key allies in the region - Taiwan and Japan. This could lead to strains in the US-Taiwan relationship, particularly if the United States is forced to make concessions in its trade relationship with Taiwan.

In addition, there is also the potential for a shift in US foreign policy towards Taiwan. As the United States continues to face challenges and threats from other parts of the world, it may choose to prioritize its relationship with China over its relationship with Taiwan. This could lead to a decrease in US support for Taiwan and a weakening of their relationship.

Overall, the future of US-Taiwan relations is uncertain and will depend on a variety of factors, including the actions of both countries and the broader global political landscape. However, it is clear that this relationship will continue to be a key factor in the dynamics of the Asia-Pacific region and will have significant implications for the future of global politics.





### Subsection: 3.2a Historical context and conflicts

The relationship between China and Japan has been marked by a complex history of conflict and cooperation. The two countries have a long history of trade and cultural exchange, but have also been embroiled in numerous military conflicts. This section will explore the historical context and conflicts that have shaped the relationship between China and Japan.

#### The Sino-Japanese War

One of the most significant conflicts between China and Japan was the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. This war was a result of growing tensions between the two countries over control of Korea and the Liaodong Peninsula. The war was a decisive victory for Japan, which emerged as a major power in the region.

The war had a significant impact on both countries. For China, it marked a major defeat and humiliation, leading to a period of weakness and instability. For Japan, it solidified its position as a dominant power in the region and paved the way for its expansion into Manchuria and Korea.

#### The Second Sino-Japanese War

The Second Sino-Japanese War, also known as the China War, was fought between China and Japan from 1937 to 1945. This war was a result of Japan's expansionist policies in China, particularly in Manchuria. The war was a major conflict, with both sides suffering significant losses.

The war had a profound impact on both countries. For China, it marked a period of intense fighting and destruction, leading to the loss of millions of lives and the occupation of large parts of the country by Japanese forces. For Japan, it was a costly and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to expand its empire in China.

#### The Post-War Relationship

After the Second World War, Japan and China were both undergoing significant changes. Japan was occupied by the United States and undergoing a period of demilitarization and democratization. China, on the other hand, was embroiled in a civil war between the Nationalist and Communist parties.

Despite these differences, the two countries were able to establish a diplomatic relationship in 1972. This marked a significant improvement in their relationship, but tensions and conflicts still remain.

#### Current State of Relations

Today, China and Japan have a complex relationship, with both countries being major economic and military powers. While there have been periods of tension and conflict, the two countries have also been able to work together on issues such as trade and security.

However, there are still lingering issues from their past, particularly over historical events such as the Nanjing Massacre and the Comfort Women issue. These issues continue to strain the relationship between the two countries, but both have been able to maintain a stable and cooperative relationship.

In conclusion, the relationship between China and Japan has been shaped by a long history of conflict and cooperation. While there have been periods of tension and hostility, both countries have been able to establish a stable and cooperative relationship in recent years. The future of this relationship remains uncertain, but it is clear that both countries will continue to play significant roles in the global arena.





### Subsection: 3.2b Economic and cultural ties

The relationship between China and Japan has been shaped not only by historical conflicts, but also by economic and cultural ties. These ties have played a significant role in shaping the dynamics of their relationship and have been a major factor in their cooperation and competition.

#### Economic Ties

China and Japan have a complex economic relationship, with both countries being major trading partners and investors. China is Japan's second-largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $300 billion in 2018. Japan, on the other hand, is China's largest foreign investor, with Japanese companies investing over $100 billion in China.

The economic relationship between China and Japan has been characterized by both competition and cooperation. On one hand, China has been a major competitor for Japan in various industries, particularly in manufacturing and technology. On the other hand, Japan has been a major source of investment and technology for China, helping to drive its economic growth.

#### Cultural Ties

Despite their historical conflicts, China and Japan have also maintained strong cultural ties. Both countries have a deep respect for each other's traditions and cultures, and have been exchanging ideas and knowledge for centuries.

One of the most significant cultural ties between China and Japan is the exchange of martial arts. Both countries have a rich history of martial arts, and have been sharing and learning from each other's techniques for centuries. This exchange has not only contributed to the development of both countries' martial arts, but has also fostered a sense of respect and understanding between them.

#### Cooperation and Competition

The economic and cultural ties between China and Japan have been a major factor in their cooperation and competition. While they have been competitors in various industries, they have also been able to work together on projects such as the High-Speed Rail project in China, which has been a major source of technology and knowledge transfer between the two countries.

However, there have also been instances of competition and tension in their economic relationship. For example, in 2010, there were reports of anti-Japanese sentiment in China, sparked by a territorial dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. This incident highlighted the delicate nature of their economic relationship and the potential for conflicts to arise.

In conclusion, the economic and cultural ties between China and Japan have played a significant role in shaping their relationship. While there have been instances of competition and tension, the overall trend has been one of cooperation and mutual benefit. As both countries continue to grow and develop, these ties will likely play an even more important role in their relationship.

We have also delved into the current state of affairs, including the ongoing tensions and the potential for future conflict.

Through our analysis, we have seen that China's foreign policy towards Taiwan is heavily influenced by its own domestic politics and historical grievances. The Chinese government's desire to reunify with Taiwan is driven by a sense of nationalism and a desire to maintain its sovereignty. However, this desire has been met with resistance from the Taiwanese people, who have their own distinct identity and do not wish to be governed by China.

Despite the ongoing tensions, there have been some positive developments in the relationship between China and Taiwan. The two sides have engaged in economic and cultural exchanges, and there have been efforts to improve communication and build trust. However, there are still significant barriers to a full reconciliation, including the issue of Taiwan's independence and the lack of trust between the two sides.

In conclusion, the relationship between China and Taiwan is a complex and ever-evolving one. It is influenced by a multitude of factors, including history, politics, and economics. As China continues to rise as a global power, it will be important for both sides to find a way to manage their differences and work towards a more stable and cooperative relationship.

### Subsection: 3.2c Maritime disputes and diplomatic maneuvers

The relationship between China and Japan has been marked by not only economic and cultural ties, but also by maritime disputes and diplomatic maneuvers. These disputes have been a major source of tension between the two countries and have been a key factor in shaping their foreign policy towards each other.

#### Maritime Disputes

One of the most significant maritime disputes between China and Japan is the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands issue. These islands, which are administered by Japan but claimed by both China and Taiwan, have been a source of conflict since the 19th century. The dispute has escalated in recent years, with both countries engaging in provocative actions such as sending patrol ships to the islands and arresting each other's citizens for illegal entry.

The Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands issue is not only a matter of territorial sovereignty, but also has significant economic implications. The islands are believed to have rich natural resources, including oil and gas, which have added to the intensity of the dispute.

#### Diplomatic Maneuvers

In response to the maritime disputes, both China and Japan have engaged in various diplomatic maneuvers to manage the conflict. These have included high-level meetings, joint naval exercises, and economic cooperation.

One of the most significant diplomatic maneuvers has been the signing of the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration in 1972, which established diplomatic relations between the two countries. This declaration has been a key factor in managing the conflict and has allowed for cooperation in other areas, such as economic and cultural ties.

#### The Role of the United States

The United States has played a significant role in managing the maritime disputes between China and Japan. As a key ally of both countries, the US has been actively involved in mediating the conflict and has encouraged both sides to engage in dialogue and find a peaceful resolution.

The US has also been a major player in the economic relationship between China and Japan. As the largest trading partner of both countries, the US has been able to exert pressure on both sides to manage their differences and maintain economic cooperation.

In conclusion, the maritime disputes and diplomatic maneuvers between China and Japan have been a significant factor in shaping their foreign policy towards each other. While the two countries have been able to manage the conflict through various diplomatic efforts, the issue remains a source of tension and could potentially escalate in the future.

### Subsection: 4.1a Historical territorial disputes and their impact on foreign policy

China's territorial disputes have been a major factor in shaping its foreign policy, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. These disputes have been ongoing for centuries and have been a source of tension and conflict between China and its neighboring countries.

One of the most well-known territorial disputes in China is the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands dispute. These islands, located in the East China Sea, have been a subject of contention between China, Japan, and Taiwan. The islands have been under Japanese control since the 1895 First Sino-Japanese War, but China claims that they have been a part of its territory since ancient times. This dispute has led to numerous conflicts, including protests, riots, and even military standoffs.

The Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands dispute has had a significant impact on China's foreign policy. China has consistently asserted its sovereignty over the islands and has taken a strong stance in its negotiations with Japan. In 2010, China declared an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) over the East China Sea, which included the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands. This move was seen as a direct challenge to Japan's control of the islands and led to increased tensions between the two countries.

Another territorial dispute that has shaped China's foreign policy is the South China Sea dispute. This dispute involves China, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Brunei, and centers around the ownership of various islands and reefs in the South China Sea. China claims that the South China Sea is its historical territory and has been asserting its sovereignty over the region through various means, including building artificial islands and militarizing the area.

The South China Sea dispute has had a significant impact on China's foreign policy, particularly in its relations with the United States. The US has been a major player in the region, with its military presence and economic influence. China's actions in the South China Sea have been seen as a direct challenge to the US's dominance in the region, leading to increased tensions and conflicts.

In addition to these territorial disputes, China also has ongoing border disputes with India, Nepal, and Bhutan. These disputes have been a source of tension and conflict between the two countries and have been a major factor in shaping China's foreign policy in the region.

Overall, China's territorial disputes have played a significant role in shaping its foreign policy. These disputes have led to increased tensions and conflicts, particularly with neighboring countries, and have been a major factor in China's rise as a global power. As China continues to assert its sovereignty and expand its influence, these territorial disputes will continue to be a major focus of its foreign policy.




### Subsection: 4.1b China's maritime claims in the South China Sea

China's maritime claims in the South China Sea have been a major source of tension and conflict in the region. These claims are based on China's historical and cultural ties to the region, as well as its economic interests.

China's maritime claims in the South China Sea are based on the "nine-dash line," a line that stretches from the Chinese coast to the Spratly Islands and includes the Paracel Islands. This line was first drawn by the Republic of China (Taiwan) in 1947 and was later adopted by the People's Republic of China in 1949. The line is based on China's historical claims to the region, which date back to the Ming dynasty.

However, China's maritime claims have been met with strong opposition from other countries in the region. Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines have also made claims to the South China Sea, leading to overlapping claims and disputes. This has resulted in a complex and contentious situation, with each country asserting its own sovereignty over the region.

The South China Sea is a rich source of natural resources, including oil and natural gas. China's maritime claims have been driven by its desire to secure these resources and expand its economic influence in the region. However, these claims have also been met with resistance from other countries, particularly the United States, which has been a major player in the region.

The South China Sea dispute has had a significant impact on China's foreign policy. China has consistently asserted its sovereignty over the region and has taken a strong stance in its negotiations with other countries. However, its actions have also been met with pushback from other countries, particularly the United States, which has been a major player in the region.

In recent years, China has been actively pursuing a more assertive foreign policy in the South China Sea. This includes building artificial islands, militarizing the region, and increasing its presence through joint military exercises with other countries. These actions have raised concerns among other countries in the region and have led to increased tensions and potential conflicts.

In conclusion, China's maritime claims in the South China Sea have been a major source of tension and conflict in the region. These claims have been driven by China's desire to secure its economic interests and expand its influence in the region. However, they have also been met with strong opposition from other countries, leading to a complex and contentious situation. The South China Sea dispute will continue to be a major focus of China's foreign policy in the years to come.




### Subsection: 4.1c Economic interests and resource competition

China's economic interests and resource competition have played a significant role in shaping its foreign policy, particularly in the South China Sea. As one of the world's largest economies, China has a strong desire to secure access to natural resources and expand its economic influence. This has led to tensions with other countries, particularly in the South China Sea, where China's maritime claims have been met with strong opposition.

China's economic interests in the South China Sea are driven by its need for natural resources, particularly oil and natural gas. The region is home to significant reserves of these resources, making it a crucial area for China's economic development. However, China's economic interests have also been met with resistance from other countries, particularly Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines, which have also made claims to the region.

The competition for resources in the South China Sea has led to a complex and contentious situation, with each country asserting its own sovereignty over the region. This has resulted in overlapping claims and disputes, making it difficult to reach a resolution. The situation has also been complicated by the involvement of other major powers, such as the United States, which has been a major player in the region.

China's economic interests and resource competition have also had a significant impact on its foreign policy. China has consistently asserted its sovereignty over the South China Sea and has taken a strong stance in its negotiations with other countries. However, its actions have also been met with pushback from other countries, particularly the United States, which has been a major player in the region.

In recent years, China has been actively pursuing a more assertive foreign policy in the South China Sea. This includes building artificial islands, militarizing the region, and engaging in aggressive territorial disputes. These actions have been driven by China's economic interests and resource competition, as it seeks to secure its access to natural resources and expand its economic influence in the region.



### Section: 4.2 Regional Engagement and New Diplomacy:

China's regional engagement strategies have been a crucial aspect of its foreign policy, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. As one of the world's largest economies, China has a strong desire to expand its economic influence and secure access to natural resources. This has led to the development of various regional engagement strategies, aimed at promoting economic cooperation and addressing regional issues.

#### 4.2a China's regional engagement strategies

China's regional engagement strategies have been driven by its economic interests and resource competition. The country has been actively pursuing economic integration with its neighboring countries, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. This has been achieved through various initiatives, such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

The RCEP, signed in 2012, aims to promote economic cooperation between China and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. It covers a wide range of issues, including trade, investment, and intellectual property rights. The RCEP has been a crucial tool for China in expanding its economic influence and promoting regional stability.

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), launched in 2013, is another key regional engagement strategy for China. It aims to connect China with Europe, Africa, and other parts of the world through a network of roads, railways, and ports. The BRI has been a major driver of China's economic growth and has also helped to address its resource needs.

China's regional engagement strategies have also been driven by its desire to address regional issues, such as the South China Sea dispute. By promoting economic cooperation and regional stability, China has been able to manage these issues and prevent them from escalating into major conflicts.

#### 4.2b New diplomacy in China's foreign policy

In recent years, China has also been pursuing a new approach to diplomacy, known as "new diplomacy." This approach emphasizes the use of economic and cultural tools to promote China's interests and address regional issues. It also involves a shift towards a more assertive and proactive foreign policy.

One of the key aspects of new diplomacy is China's emphasis on economic cooperation and trade. As one of the world's largest economies, China has been able to use its economic power to gain influence and promote its interests. This has been achieved through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.

Cultural diplomacy has also been a crucial aspect of new diplomacy in China's foreign policy. China has been actively promoting its culture and values through various means, such as Confucius Institutes and cultural exchanges. This has helped to improve its image and gain support from other countries.

#### 4.2c Challenges and criticisms of China's regional engagement strategies

Despite the successes of China's regional engagement strategies, there have been challenges and criticisms. Some critics argue that China's economic influence and resource competition have led to unequal trade relationships and environmental degradation. Others argue that China's assertive foreign policy has caused tensions and conflicts with other countries.

However, China has been actively addressing these challenges and criticisms. It has been working to address issues such as environmental degradation and unequal trade relationships through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. It has also been promoting a more responsible and cooperative approach to regional issues, such as the South China Sea dispute.

In conclusion, China's regional engagement strategies and new diplomacy have been crucial aspects of its foreign policy. By promoting economic cooperation, addressing regional issues, and using cultural diplomacy, China has been able to expand its economic influence and promote regional stability. However, there have also been challenges and criticisms, which China has been actively addressing to improve its foreign policy.





### Subsection: 4.2b Diplomatic initiatives and partnerships

China's regional engagement strategies have also been accompanied by diplomatic initiatives and partnerships. These initiatives have been crucial in promoting economic cooperation and addressing regional issues.

One of the key diplomatic initiatives for China has been the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). Launched in 2015, the AIIB aims to finance infrastructure projects in Asia, with a focus on promoting regional connectivity and economic development. The AIIB has been a major tool for China in promoting its economic interests and expanding its influence in the region.

China has also been actively pursuing partnerships with other countries, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. These partnerships have been driven by economic interests, but also by a desire to address regional issues. For example, China has been working closely with Southeast Asian countries to address the South China Sea dispute through bilateral and multilateral mechanisms.

In addition to its regional partnerships, China has also been pursuing global partnerships, particularly with developing countries. This has been achieved through initiatives such as the China-Africa Cooperation Forum and the China-Latin America Cooperation Forum. These partnerships have been crucial in promoting China's economic interests and expanding its global influence.

Overall, China's diplomatic initiatives and partnerships have been a key aspect of its regional engagement strategies. They have allowed China to promote economic cooperation, address regional issues, and expand its global influence. As China continues to rise as a global power, these initiatives will likely play an even more important role in its foreign policy.


### Conclusion

We have seen how the two countries have been intertwined in a complex web of trade agreements, investments, and economic policies. We have also examined the impact of this relationship on both countries and the global economy.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is the importance of trade and economic relations in shaping the overall relationship between China and the United States. As the two largest economies in the world, their economic interactions have a significant impact on the global economy. The trade imbalance between the two countries has been a major point of contention, with the United States accusing China of unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. However, China has also been a major market for American goods and services, making it a crucial trading partner for the United States.

Furthermore, we have also seen how the economic relationship between China and the United States has been shaped by political factors. The two countries have been engaged in a constant power struggle, with each trying to gain an upper hand in terms of economic influence. This has led to a complex web of economic policies and agreements, with both countries often using economic tools as a means of exerting their power.

### Subsection: 4.2c Implications for regional order and dynamics

China's regional engagement and new diplomacy have had significant implications for the regional order and dynamics in the Asia-Pacific region. As China continues to rise as a global power, its economic and diplomatic strategies have been crucial in shaping the regional landscape.

One of the key implications of China's regional engagement is the increasing economic interdependence between China and other countries in the region. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has been a major driver of this interdependence, with countries like Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar benefiting from increased trade and investment. This has not only boosted their economies, but also strengthened their ties with China.

However, China's economic dominance has also raised concerns among other regional powers, particularly the United States. The US has been closely monitoring China's economic activities and has expressed concerns about its trade practices, such as intellectual property theft and currency manipulation. This has led to tensions between the two countries and has the potential to disrupt the regional order.

In terms of diplomacy, China's new approach has also had a significant impact on the regional dynamics. China's emphasis on non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries has been welcomed by many developing countries, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. This has allowed China to gain influence and expand its sphere of influence, particularly in countries like Cambodia and Laos.

However, China's approach has also been met with criticism from other regional powers, particularly the United States. The US has been critical of China's lack of support for democracy and human rights, and has accused China of using its economic influence to gain political leverage. This has led to tensions between the two countries and has the potential to disrupt the regional order.

In conclusion, China's regional engagement and new diplomacy have had significant implications for the regional order and dynamics in the Asia-Pacific region. As China continues to rise as a global power, its economic and diplomatic strategies will continue to shape the regional landscape and have far-reaching implications for the rest of the world. 


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the complex relationship between China and the United States in terms of trade and economic relations. We have seen how the two countries have been intertwined in a complex web of trade agreements, investments, and economic policies. We have also discussed the challenges and opportunities that arise from this relationship, and how it has shaped the global economic landscape.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is the importance of trade and economic relations in shaping foreign policy. As China continues to rise as a global economic power, the United States has been forced to adapt and adjust its policies to maintain its dominance. This has led to a complex and often contentious relationship between the two countries, with both sides vying for economic advantage.

Another important aspect to consider is the impact of China's economic rise on the rest of the world. As China becomes a major player in the global economy, it has the potential to shape economic policies and trends on a global scale. This has significant implications for other countries, particularly developing nations, who must navigate the complexities of China's economic policies and decisions.

In conclusion, trade and economic relations play a crucial role in shaping foreign policy, and the relationship between China and the United States is a prime example of this. As the two countries continue to navigate their complex economic relationship, it is important for policymakers and analysts to closely monitor and understand the implications of their actions on the global economic landscape.

We have seen how this relationship has been shaped by historical, political, and economic factors, and how it continues to impact the global economy.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is the importance of trade and economic relations in shaping the overall relationship between these two global powers. As we have seen, trade has been a major driver of economic growth for both countries, with the US-China trade relationship accounting for a significant portion of the global economy.

### Subsection: 5.1 Lampton, David M., ed. The Making of Chinese Foreign and Security Policy. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2001. ISBN: 9780804740562.

#### 5.1a Overview of The Making of Chinese Foreign and Security Policy

In his book "The Making of Chinese Foreign and Security Policy," David M. Lampton provides a comprehensive analysis of China's foreign policy, drawing on his extensive experience and expertise in the field. The book aims to shed light on the complex and often misunderstood dynamics of Chinese foreign policy, and to provide a deeper understanding of the country's role in the international arena.

Lampton's book is structured around the concept of "three faces of Chinese power," which he defines as China's economic, military, and ideological power. Each of these faces plays a crucial role in shaping China's foreign policy, and Lampton delves into the intricacies of each in his book.

The book begins with an overview of China's economic power, examining the country's rapid economic growth and its impact on its foreign policy. Lampton argues that China's economic power has allowed it to become a major player in the global economy, and has given it the means to pursue its strategic interests. He also discusses the challenges and opportunities that China's economic power presents for its foreign policy, including the need to balance economic growth with social and environmental concerns.

Next, Lampton delves into China's military power, examining the country's modernization of its armed forces and its growing influence in the Asia-Pacific region. He argues that China's military power has allowed it to assert its territorial claims and to project its influence beyond its borders. However, he also notes that China's military power has been met with resistance from other major powers, particularly the United States, and has raised concerns about its intentions and actions.

Finally, Lampton explores China's ideological power, examining the country's rise as a global ideological power and its promotion of its own brand of socialism. He argues that China's ideological power has allowed it to gain influence in developing countries and to challenge the dominance of Western ideologies. However, he also notes that China's ideological power has been met with criticism and pushback from other major powers, particularly the United States, and has raised questions about its intentions and actions.

Throughout the book, Lampton provides a nuanced and balanced analysis of China's foreign policy, drawing on a wealth of research and personal experience. He also offers insights into the key debates and controversies surrounding China's actions and policies, and discusses the implications for the future of international relations.

In conclusion, "The Making of Chinese Foreign and Security Policy" is a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding China's role in the world. It provides a comprehensive and nuanced analysis of China's foreign policy, and offers insights into the complex dynamics of Chinese power and its impact on the international arena. 

#### 5.1b Key Takeaways from The Making of Chinese Foreign and Security Policy

In his book "The Making of Chinese Foreign and Security Policy," David M. Lampton provides a wealth of insights into the complex dynamics of Chinese foreign policy. Here are some key takeaways from his analysis:

1. China's economic power has allowed it to become a major player in the global economy, and has given it the means to pursue its strategic interests. However, this economic power has also brought challenges, such as the need to balance economic growth with social and environmental concerns.

2. China's military power has allowed it to assert its territorial claims and to project its influence beyond its borders. However, this has also raised concerns among other major powers, particularly the United States, about China's intentions and actions.

3. China's ideological power has allowed it to gain influence in developing countries and to challenge the dominance of Western ideologies. However, this has also been met with criticism and pushback from other major powers, particularly the United States.

4. China's foreign policy is shaped by its "three faces of power": economic, military, and ideological. Each of these faces plays a crucial role, and understanding their interplay is key to understanding Chinese foreign policy.

5. China's foreign policy is also shaped by its domestic politics and ideology. The country's rise as a global power has been accompanied by a shift towards a more assertive and nationalistic foreign policy, reflecting the changing values and aspirations of the Chinese people.

6. China's foreign policy is not static, but evolves in response to changing domestic and international conditions. This makes it crucial for policymakers and scholars to stay abreast of developments in China, and to understand the underlying dynamics driving its foreign policy.

In conclusion, Lampton's book provides a comprehensive and nuanced analysis of Chinese foreign policy, offering valuable insights for anyone interested in understanding China's role in the international arena. It underscores the importance of understanding China's economic, military, and ideological power, as well as its domestic politics and ideology, in order to gain a deeper understanding of its foreign policy.

#### 5.1c Critiques of The Making of Chinese Foreign and Security Policy

While David M. Lampton's book "The Making of Chinese Foreign and Security Policy" provides a comprehensive analysis of Chinese foreign policy, it has not been without criticism. Some of the key critiques of the book are discussed below:

1. **Lack of Critical Analysis:** Some critics argue that the book lacks critical analysis of China's foreign policy. They argue that while Lampton provides a detailed account of China's foreign policy, he does not critically examine the underlying motivations and implications of these policies. This, they argue, makes the book less insightful and less useful for understanding China's foreign policy (Lampton, 2001).

2. **Overemphasis on Economic Power:** Others argue that Lampton overemphasizes the role of economic power in shaping China's foreign policy. They argue that while economic power is undoubtedly important, it is not the sole determinant of China's foreign policy. Other factors, such as ideology, history, and domestic politics, also play a significant role (Lampton, 2001).

3. **Lack of Historical Context:** Some critics argue that the book lacks sufficient historical context. They argue that understanding China's foreign policy requires a deep understanding of its historical context, including its past foreign policies and its relations with other major powers. They argue that Lampton's book does not provide enough of this historical context, making it difficult to fully understand China's current foreign policy (Lampton, 2001).

4. **Lack of Comparative Analysis:** Others argue that the book lacks comparative analysis. They argue that understanding China's foreign policy requires comparing it with the foreign policies of other major powers. This, they argue, would provide a more nuanced understanding of China's foreign policy and its place in the international arena (Lampton, 2001).

5. **Lack of Critical Perspective:** Some critics argue that the book lacks a critical perspective. They argue that Lampton's analysis is too sympathetic to China's perspective, and does not critically examine the implications of China's foreign policy for other major powers and for the international order. They argue that this lack of critical perspective makes the book less useful for understanding China's foreign policy (Lampton, 2001).

Despite these critiques, Lampton's book remains a valuable resource for understanding Chinese foreign policy. It provides a wealth of detailed information and insights, and its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. However, it is important to be aware of these critiques when reading and interpreting the book.




### Subsection: 5.2 Mann, James. About Face: A History of America's Curious Relationship with China, From Nixon to Clinton. New York, NY: Knopf, 1998. ISBN: 9780679450535.

#### 5.2a Overview of About Face: A History of America's Curious Relationship with China, From Nixon to Clinton

In his book "About Face: A History of America's Curious Relationship with China, From Nixon to Clinton," James Mann provides a comprehensive analysis of the United States' foreign policy towards China from the 1970s to the 1990s. The book is structured around the concept of "the China puzzle," a term Mann uses to describe the complex and often contradictory nature of the U.S.-China relationship.

Mann's book begins with an overview of the historical context of U.S.-China relations, tracing the roots of the relationship back to the Cold War era. He then delves into the key events and actors that have shaped the relationship, including Richard Nixon's historic visit to China in 1972, the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, and the Clinton administration's efforts to engage China on issues such as human rights and trade.

One of the key themes of Mann's book is the tension between the U.S.'s desire to engage China as a potential partner and its concerns about China's authoritarian political system and human rights abuses. This tension is exemplified in the book's title, "About Face," which refers to the U.S.'s frequent shifts in policy towards China, from containment to engagement and back again.

Mann also examines the role of ideology in U.S.-China relations, arguing that the U.S.'s Cold War-era view of China as a communist threat has been replaced by a more pragmatic approach focused on economic and security interests. However, he also notes that ideology continues to play a role in the relationship, particularly in the U.S.'s criticism of China's human rights record.

The book also explores the impact of China's rise as a global power on U.S.-China relations, including the U.S.'s efforts to contain China's influence in the Asia-Pacific region and its concerns about China's military modernization. Mann argues that the U.S.'s relationship with China is not just about ideology or power, but also about managing the complex interdependence between the two countries.

In conclusion, Mann's book provides a comprehensive and nuanced analysis of the U.S.'s relationship with China, highlighting the complexities and contradictions that have characterized this relationship over the past several decades. It is a valuable resource for understanding the history and dynamics of U.S.-China relations, and serves as a foundation for further exploration of this important topic.

#### 5.2b Key Takeaways from About Face

In his book "About Face," James Mann presents a comprehensive analysis of the United States' foreign policy towards China from the 1970s to the 1990s. The book provides valuable insights into the complexities and contradictions of the U.S.-China relationship, and offers several key takeaways that are worth considering.

First, Mann emphasizes the importance of historical context in understanding the U.S.-China relationship. He traces the roots of the relationship back to the Cold War era, highlighting the significant events and actors that have shaped the relationship over time. This historical perspective helps to explain the current state of the relationship and provides a foundation for understanding future developments.

Second, Mann underscores the tension between the U.S.'s desire to engage China as a potential partner and its concerns about China's authoritarian political system and human rights abuses. This tension is exemplified in the book's title, "About Face," which refers to the U.S.'s frequent shifts in policy towards China. This tension continues to be a key factor in the U.S.-China relationship today, as the U.S. grapples with how to engage China while also addressing its concerns.

Third, Mann examines the role of ideology in U.S.-China relations. He argues that the U.S.'s Cold War-era view of China as a communist threat has been replaced by a more pragmatic approach focused on economic and security interests. However, he also notes that ideology continues to play a role in the relationship, particularly in the U.S.'s criticism of China's human rights record. This suggests that ideology is not dead in U.S.-China relations, but rather has evolved and adapted over time.

Finally, Mann explores the impact of China's rise as a global power on U.S.-China relations. He highlights the U.S.'s efforts to contain China's influence in the Asia-Pacific region and its concerns about China's military modernization. This underscores the importance of power dynamics in the U.S.-China relationship, and suggests that power will continue to be a key factor in shaping the relationship in the future.

In conclusion, "About Face" provides a valuable and nuanced analysis of the U.S.-China relationship. It highlights the complexities and contradictions of the relationship, and offers several key takeaways that are worth considering. As the U.S. continues to navigate its relationship with China, these insights will be invaluable in understanding the dynamics of this important relationship.

#### 5.2c Critiques of About Face

While "About Face" provides a comprehensive analysis of the United States' foreign policy towards China, it is not without its criticisms. Some of the key critiques of the book are discussed below.

First, some critics argue that Mann's analysis is too focused on the U.S.'s perspective and does not provide enough insight into China's perspective. This is particularly true in the book's early chapters, which primarily focus on the U.S.'s historical relationship with China. While Mann does provide some insight into China's perspective, many readers feel that the book could have provided more depth and nuance in this area.

Second, some critics argue that Mann's analysis is too focused on the U.S.'s concerns and does not provide enough insight into the broader global context. This is particularly true in the book's later chapters, which focus on the U.S.'s engagement with China in the 1990s. While Mann does discuss the broader global context, many readers feel that the book could have provided more analysis of how the U.S.'s relationship with China fits into the broader global power dynamics.

Third, some critics argue that Mann's analysis is too focused on the U.S.'s relationship with China and does not provide enough insight into China's relationships with other countries. This is particularly true in the book's later chapters, which focus on the U.S.'s engagement with China in the 1990s. While Mann does discuss China's relationships with other countries, many readers feel that the book could have provided more depth and nuance in this area.

Finally, some critics argue that Mann's analysis is too focused on the U.S.'s relationship with China and does not provide enough insight into the broader global context. This is particularly true in the book's later chapters, which focus on the U.S.'s engagement with China in the 1990s. While Mann does discuss the broader global context, many readers feel that the book could have provided more analysis of how the U.S.'s relationship with China fits into the broader global power dynamics.

In conclusion, while "About Face" provides a comprehensive analysis of the United States' foreign policy towards China, it is not without its criticisms. These criticisms suggest that while Mann's book provides valuable insights, there are still areas that could be further explored and developed.

### 5.3 Ottosson, Sven. China's Rise and the Challenge to the West: A Historical Perspective. New York, NY: Palgrave Macmillan, 2009. ISBN: 9780230500711.

#### 5.3a Overview of China's Rise and the Challenge to the West

In his book "China's Rise and the Challenge to the West: A Historical Perspective," Sven Ottosson provides a comprehensive analysis of China's rise as a global power and its implications for the West. The book is structured around the concept of "the China challenge," a term Ottosson uses to describe the complex and multifaceted nature of China's rise as a global power.

Ottosson's book begins with an overview of the historical context of China's rise, tracing the roots of China's power back to the 19th century. He then delves into the key events and actors that have shaped China's rise, including the Opium Wars, the Taiping Rebellion, and the modernization efforts of the late Qing dynasty.

One of the key themes of Ottosson's book is the tension between China's rise as a global power and the West's efforts to contain and manage this rise. This tension is exemplified in the book's title, "China's Rise and the Challenge to the West," which underscores the complex and often contentious nature of China's rise.

Ottosson also examines the role of ideology in China's rise, arguing that China's adoption of communism and its subsequent break with the Soviet Union in the 1960s played a crucial role in its rise as a global power. This ideological shift allowed China to distance itself from the Soviet Union and develop its own unique form of communism, which has been a key factor in its rise as a global power.

Finally, Ottosson explores the implications of China's rise for the West, arguing that China's rise poses a significant challenge to the West's dominance in the global arena. He suggests that the West must adapt and evolve in response to China's rise, and that this will require a deep understanding of China's history, culture, and political system.

In conclusion, Ottosson's book provides a comprehensive and nuanced analysis of China's rise as a global power. It highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of China's rise, and underscores the importance of understanding China's historical context and ideological underpinnings in order to effectively engage with it.

#### 5.3c Critiques of China's Rise and the Challenge to the West

While Ottosson's book provides a comprehensive analysis of China's rise as a global power, it is not without its criticisms. Some of the key critiques of the book are discussed below.

1. **Oversimplification of the Historical Context:** While Ottosson emphasizes the importance of understanding the historical context of China's rise, some critics argue that he oversimplifies this context. They argue that his focus on key events and actors does not adequately capture the complex and multifaceted nature of China's rise. They suggest that a more nuanced understanding of China's historical context is necessary to fully grasp its current position in the global arena.

2. **Underestimation of the West's Role in China's Rise:** Ottosson's book suggests that the West's efforts to contain and manage China's rise have been a key factor in shaping China's foreign policy.

3. **Overemphasis on Ideology:** Ottosson argues that China's adoption of communism and its subsequent break with the Soviet Union in the 1960s played a crucial role in its rise as a global power. However, some critics argue that he overemphasizes the role of ideology in China's rise. They suggest that other factors, such as economic development and military modernization, have been more significant in enabling China's rise.

4. **Lack of Proposed Solutions:** Ottosson's book suggests that the West must adapt and evolve in response to China's rise, but it does not provide specific proposed solutions. Some critics argue that this lack of specific solutions makes the book less useful for policymakers and scholars seeking to understand and respond to China's rise.

5. **Failure to Address Contemporary Issues:** Ottosson's book focuses on the historical context of China's rise, but it does not address contemporary issues such as China's territorial disputes in the South China Sea or its human rights record. Some critics argue that these contemporary issues are crucial for understanding China's current position in the global arena and should have been addressed in the book.

In conclusion, while Ottosson's book provides a valuable analysis of China's rise as a global power, it is not without its criticisms. These criticisms suggest that a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of China's rise is necessary to fully grasp its current position in the global arena.

#### 5.3c Critiques of The Search for Modern China

While "The Search for Modern China" provides a comprehensive and insightful analysis of China's modern history, it is not without its criticisms. One of the main critiques of the book is its focus on the Chinese experience and its lack of attention to the broader global context. Spence's book is primarily concerned with China's internal dynamics and its interactions with the outside world, often neglecting the larger global trends and developments that have shaped China's modern history.

Another critique of the book is its reliance on traditional Chinese sources.

This reliance on traditional sources can also lead to a lack of critical analysis and interpretation of these sources, which can hinder the book's overall analysis.

Furthermore, some critics argue that Spence's book overemphasizes the role of foreign influence in China's modern history. While Spence does acknowledge the internal dynamics that have driven China's modernization, he often presents foreign influence as the primary driving force behind China's modern history. This can oversimplify the complex interplay between internal and external factors that have shaped China's modernization.

Finally, some critics argue that Spence's book fails to adequately address the ongoing debates and controversies surrounding China's modern history. The book does not delve into the ongoing debates about the role of Confucianism, Western influence, and other factors in China's modernization. This can limit the book's usefulness for those seeking a more nuanced and critical understanding of China's modern history.

Despite these criticisms, "The Search for Modern China" remains a valuable resource for understanding China's modern history and its impact on foreign policy.
