### Introduction

Electrochemistry is a fundamental branch of chemistry that deals with the study of chemical reactions involving electricity. It is a field that has been extensively studied and applied in various industries, including materials processing. In this chapter, we will explore the principles of equilibrium electrochemistry, which is a crucial aspect of electrochemistry.

Equilibrium electrochemistry is concerned with the study of electrochemical reactions at equilibrium. It is a state where the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate, resulting in no net change in the concentrations of the reactants and products. This state is characterized by the Nernst equation, which relates the electrode potential to the concentrations of the reactants and products.

In this chapter, we will delve into the principles of equilibrium electrochemistry, including the Nernst equation, the concept of electrode potential, and the role of electrochemical reactions in materials processing. We will also explore the applications of equilibrium electrochemistry in various industries, such as electroplating, corrosion prevention, and battery technology.

The study of equilibrium electrochemistry is essential for understanding the behavior of electrochemical systems and predicting their response to changes in conditions. It is also crucial for the design and optimization of electrochemical processes, which are widely used in materials processing. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of equilibrium electrochemistry and its applications in materials processing.




### Section: 1.1 Thermodynamic and Transport Properties of Electrolytes:

Electrolytes are essential components in electrochemical systems, as they provide the necessary ions for electrochemical reactions to occur. In this section, we will explore the thermodynamic and transport properties of electrolytes, which are crucial for understanding their behavior in electrochemical systems.

#### 1.1a Introduction to Thermodynamics

Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with the study of energy and its transformations. In the context of electrochemistry, thermodynamics plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of electrolytes. The thermodynamic properties of electrolytes, such as enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy, are essential for predicting their behavior in electrochemical systems.

The general equation of heat transfer is given by:

$$
\rho d\varepsilon = \rho Tds + \frac{p}{\rho}d\rho
$$

where $\rho$ is the density, $T$ is the temperature, $s$ is the entropy, $p$ is the pressure, and $\varepsilon$ is the internal energy. This equation shows that the change in internal energy of a system is equal to the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system.

The equation for entropy production is given by:

$$
\rho T \frac{Ds}{Dt} = \nabla\cdot(\kappa\nabla T) + \frac{\mu}{2}\left( \frac{\partial v_{i}}{\partial x_{j}} + \frac{\partial v_{j}}{\partial x_{i}} - \frac{2}{3}\delta_{ij}\nabla\cdot \mathbf{v} \right)^{2} + \zeta(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v})^{2}
$$

where $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity, $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$ are the components of the velocity vector, $x_{i}$ and $x_{j}$ are the coordinates, $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta, and $\zeta$ is the second coefficient of viscosity. This equation shows that the rate of entropy production in a system is equal to the heat conduction and viscous forces acting on the system.

In the case where thermal conduction and viscous forces are absent, the equation for entropy production collapses to $Ds/Dt=0$, showing that ideal fluid flow is isentropic. This concept is crucial for understanding the behavior of electrolytes in electrochemical systems, as it allows us to predict the changes in entropy and energy of the system.

#### 1.1b Transport Properties of Electrolytes

In addition to their thermodynamic properties, electrolytes also exhibit transport properties that are essential for their behavior in electrochemical systems. These properties include diffusion, migration, and convection.

Diffusion is the movement of ions from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. This process is driven by the concentration gradient and is described by Fick's laws of diffusion. In electrochemical systems, diffusion plays a crucial role in the transport of ions across the electrode-electrolyte interface.

Migration is the movement of ions in response to an electric field. This process is driven by the electric potential gradient and is described by the Nernst-Planck equation. In electrochemical systems, migration is responsible for the movement of ions towards the electrode, which is essential for electrochemical reactions to occur.

Convection is the movement of ions due to bulk flow of the electrolyte. This process is driven by differences in temperature, pressure, or external forces and is described by the Navier-Stokes equations. In electrochemical systems, convection plays a crucial role in the transport of ions throughout the system.

Understanding the transport properties of electrolytes is essential for predicting their behavior in electrochemical systems. By considering the thermodynamic and transport properties of electrolytes, we can gain a deeper understanding of their role in electrochemical reactions and their impact on the overall system.

### Electrical properties

#### Electrical conductivity

Pure water containing no exogenous ions is an excellent electronic insulator, but not even "deionized" water is completely free of ions. Water undergoes autoionization in the liquid state when two water molecules form one hydroxide anion (<chem|OH|−|>) and one hydronium cation (<chem|H|3|O|+>). Because of autoionization, at ambient temperatures pure liquid water has a similar intrinsic charge carrier concentration to the semiconductor germanium and an intrinsic charge carrier concentration three orders of magnitude greater than the semiconductor silicon, hence, based on charge carrier concentration, water can not be considered to be a completely dielectric material or electrical insulator but to be a limited conductor of ionic charge.

Because water is such a good solvent, it almost always has some solute dissolved in it, often a salt. If water has even a tiny amount of such an impurity, then the ions can carry charges back and forth, allowing the water to conduct electricity far more readily.

It is known that the theoretical maximum electrical resistivity for water is approximately 18.2 MΩ·cm (182 kΩ·m) at 25 °C. This figure agrees well with what is typically seen on reverse osmosis, ultra-filtered and deionized ultra-pure water systems used, for instance, in semiconductor manufacturing plants. A salt or acid contaminant level exceeding even 100 parts per trillion (ppt) in otherwise ultra-pure water begins to noticeably lower its resistivity by up to several kΩ·m.

In pure water, sensitive equipment can detect a very slight electrical conductivity of 0.05501 ± 0.0001 μS/cm at 25.00 °C. Water can also be electrolyzed into oxygen and hydrogen gases but in the absence of dissolved ions this is a very slow process, as very little current is conducted. In ice, the primary charge carriers are protons (see proton conductor). Ice was previously thought to have a small but measurable conductivity, but recent research has shown that ice is an insulator.

The equation for entropy production is given by:

$$
\rho T \frac{Ds}{Dt} = \nabla\cdot(\kappa\nabla T) + \frac{\mu}{2}\left( \frac{\partial v_{i}}{\partial x_{j}} + \frac{\partial v_{j}}{\partial x_{i}} - \frac{2}{3}\delta_{ij}\nabla\cdot \mathbf{v} \right)^{2} + \zeta(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v})^{2}
$$

where $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity, $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$ are the components of the velocity vector, $x_{i}$ and $x_{j}$ are the coordinates, $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta, and $\zeta$ is the second coefficient of viscosity. This equation shows that the rate of entropy production in a system is equal to the heat conduction and viscous forces acting on the system.

In the case where thermal conduction and viscous forces are absent, the equation for entropy production simplifies to:

$$
\rho T \frac{Ds}{Dt} = 0
$$

This equation shows that in an ideal fluid, where there are no thermal conduction or viscous forces, the entropy remains constant. This is known as the principle of entropy conservation.

### Subsection: 1.1c Applications in Electrochemistry

Electrochemistry has a wide range of applications in various fields, including energy storage, corrosion prevention, and environmental remediation. In this section, we will discuss some of the most common applications of electrochemistry.

#### Energy Storage

One of the most significant applications of electrochemistry is in energy storage. Electrochemical cells are used to store and release energy in various forms, such as batteries and fuel cells. These devices use electrochemical reactions to convert chemical energy into electrical energy, which can then be used to power electronic devices.

Batteries, in particular, have become an essential part of our daily lives, powering everything from our smartphones to electric vehicles. The electrochemical properties of the electrolyte play a crucial role in the performance and longevity of these batteries. For example, the electrolyte in a lithium-ion battery must have a high ionic conductivity to allow for efficient charge transfer and a wide electrochemical window to accommodate the potential differences between the anode and cathode.

#### Corrosion Prevention

Another important application of electrochemistry is in corrosion prevention. Corrosion is a significant problem in many industries, causing billions of dollars in damage each year. Electrochemical techniques, such as cathodic protection and anodic protection, are used to prevent corrosion by controlling the electrochemical potential of the material.

Cathodic protection involves applying a sacrificial anode to the structure, which acts as a cathode and attracts corrosive ions away from the structure. Anodic protection, on the other hand, involves applying a voltage to the structure to make it more positive, preventing corrosion. Both techniques rely on the principles of electrochemistry to protect the structure from corrosion.

#### Environmental Remediation

Electrochemistry also plays a crucial role in environmental remediation. Electrochemical processes are used to remove pollutants from water and soil, making it safe for human and animal consumption. These processes involve using electrodes to oxidize or reduce pollutants, making them more soluble and easier to remove.

One example of this is the use of electrochemical treatment to remove heavy metals from contaminated soil. The heavy metals are oxidized and then extracted from the soil using a solvent. This process is more efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional methods, such as chemical leaching, which can be hazardous and ineffective.

In conclusion, electrochemistry has a wide range of applications in various fields, making it an essential area of study for engineers and scientists. By understanding the principles of electrochemistry, we can develop more efficient and sustainable solutions to some of the world's most pressing problems.

### Subsection: 1.2a Introduction to Solution Models

In the previous section, we discussed the Debye-Hückel model, which is a solution model used to describe the behavior of ions in a solution. In this section, we will explore the concept of solution models in more detail and discuss their importance in electrochemistry.

Solution models are mathematical representations of the behavior of ions in a solution. They are essential tools in electrochemistry as they allow us to understand and predict the behavior of ions in a solution. By using solution models, we can calculate important parameters such as ionic strength, activity coefficients, and electrochemical potentials.

One of the most commonly used solution models is the Debye-Hückel model, which we discussed in the previous section. This model is used to describe the behavior of ions in a dilute solution and is based on the assumption that the ions are point charges and do not interact with each other. The model is given by the equation:

$$
\log \left(\frac{C}{C_{\infty}}\right) = -\frac{z^{2}\sqrt{I}}{1 + a\sqrt{I}}
$$

where $C$ is the concentration of the ion, $C_{\infty}$ is the concentration of the ion in the absence of any other ions, $z$ is the charge of the ion, $I$ is the ionic strength of the solution, and $a$ is a constant.

Another important solution model is the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, which is used to describe the behavior of ions in a concentrated solution. This model takes into account the interactions between ions and is given by the equation:

$$
\nabla \cdot \left(\epsilon \nabla \phi\right) = -4\pi \sum_{i} z_{i} C_{i} \delta \left(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_{i}\right)
$$

where $\epsilon$ is the permittivity of the solution, $\phi$ is the electrostatic potential, $z_{i}$ is the charge of the ion, $C_{i}$ is the concentration of the ion, and $\mathbf{r}_{i}$ is the position of the ion.

Solution models are also used to describe the behavior of molecules in a solution. One such model is the Lewis acid-base theory, which is used to describe the behavior of molecules that can act as either an acid or a base. This theory is based on the concept of proton transfer and is given by the equation:

$$
\mathrm{HA} + \mathrm{B} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{A}^{-} + \mathrm{HB}^{+}
$$

where $\mathrm{HA}$ is the acid, $\mathrm{B}$ is the base, $\mathrm{A}^{-}$ is the conjugate base of the acid, and $\mathrm{HB}^{+}$ is the conjugate acid of the base.

In the next section, we will explore the Debye-Hückel model in more detail and discuss its applications in electrochemistry.
