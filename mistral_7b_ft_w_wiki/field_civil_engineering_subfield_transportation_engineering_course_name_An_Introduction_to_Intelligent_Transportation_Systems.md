IT grade(s) refer to an internationally accepted code system for tolerances on linear dimensions. Such code systems may be used to produce interchangeable parts. In engineering, the word "tolerance" refers to a range of allowable dimensions or values. Standard tolerance grades are a group of tolerances for linear sizes characterized by a common identifier. For SI measurements, a system of tolerance grades defined in ISO 286 is frequently used and identified by the letters IT followed by a number specifying how precise the requirements are, relative to the "nominal size" of a part. 

For example, IT14 refers to a group of tolerances used in manufacturing. For a part dimensioned at 10 mm, IT14 allows for up to 0.36 mm of variation in size. As the IT grade number increases, the tolerances increase; similarly, for larger nominal sizes, the standard tolerances increase. For a part dimensioned at 100 mm, IT14 allows for up to 0.87 mm of variation in size.

This level of noise can cause hearing loss if exposed to for extended periods.

Tires also contribute significantly to noise pollution. The rolling resistance of tires generates noise, which can be reduced by optimizing tire pressure and tread design. Aerodynamics also play a role in noise generation, particularly at high speeds. The interaction of air with the vehicle's body and windows can generate noise, which can be reduced by optimizing the vehicle's design.

#### 5.1b.2 ITS and Noise Pollution

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) can help mitigate noise pollution from transportation in several ways. By optimizing traffic flow and reducing congestion, ITS can reduce the amount of time vehicles spend idling, thereby reducing engine noise. Additionally, ITS can also promote more efficient driving behaviors, such as smoother acceleration and deceleration, which can further reduce noise levels.

Furthermore, ITS can also help reduce noise from tires and aerodynamics. By optimizing tire pressure and tread design, ITS can reduce tire noise. Similarly, by optimizing vehicle design, ITS can reduce aerodynamic noise.

In conclusion, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) can play a crucial role in mitigating the environmental impacts of transportation, including air quality and noise pollution. By optimizing traffic flow, promoting efficient driving behaviors, and optimizing vehicle design, ITS can help reduce emissions and noise levels, thereby improving the sustainability of transportation.




### Subsection: 5.1c Energy Consumption and Efficiency

The transportation sector is a significant contributor to energy consumption and carbon emissions. In the United States, transportation accounts for 26% of total energy consumption and 28% of carbon emissions (EIA, 2019). This energy consumption is primarily driven by the need for mobility, with personal vehicles being the primary mode of transportation.

#### 5.1c.1 Energy Consumption in Transportation

The energy consumption in transportation is primarily driven by the combustion of fossil fuels, particularly gasoline and diesel. The efficiency of these fuels is measured in terms of their energy density, which is the amount of energy per unit volume. Gasoline, for instance, has an energy density of approximately 33.4 MJ/L, while diesel has an energy density of approximately 39.6 MJ/L (EIA, 2019).

The energy consumption in transportation can be broken down into two main categories: direct energy consumption and indirect energy consumption. Direct energy consumption refers to the energy required to operate the vehicle, such as the energy required to power the engine and drive the vehicle. Indirect energy consumption, on the other hand, refers to the energy required to produce the fuel, such as the energy required to extract, refine, and distribute the fuel.

#### 5.1c.2 Energy Efficiency in Transportation

Energy efficiency in transportation is a measure of the amount of energy required to move a vehicle a certain distance. It is typically expressed in terms of fuel economy, which is the distance a vehicle can travel on a certain amount of fuel. The fuel economy of a vehicle is influenced by several factors, including the vehicle's design, the type of fuel it uses, and the driving conditions.

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) can play a crucial role in improving energy efficiency in transportation. By optimizing traffic flow and reducing congestion, ITS can reduce the amount of energy required to move a vehicle a certain distance. Additionally, ITS can also promote more efficient driving behaviors, such as smoother acceleration and deceleration, which can further improve energy efficiency.

Furthermore, ITS can also help reduce the indirect energy consumption in transportation. By optimizing the production and distribution of fuel, ITS can reduce the energy required to produce the fuel. This can be achieved through initiatives such as optimizing fuel production processes and promoting the use of alternative fuels.

In conclusion, energy consumption and efficiency are critical considerations in the transportation sector. Intelligent Transportation Systems can play a crucial role in improving energy efficiency and reducing energy consumption, thereby contributing to a more sustainable transportation future.

Air quality monitoring is a key component of environmental monitoring in ITS. It involves the collection and analysis of data about the levels of pollutants in the air, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and carbon monoxide (CO). This data is then used to inform decisions about transportation planning and policy, with the aim of reducing the levels of these pollutants in the air.

For instance, consider a scenario where a city is experiencing high levels of NOx in its air. An ITS system could use data about traffic patterns and vehicle emissions to identify the sources of these emissions. This could involve analyzing data about the types of vehicles on the road, their fuel efficiency, and their driving behaviors. The system could then use this data to inform decisions about transportation planning and policy, such as implementing stricter emissions standards for vehicles, encouraging the use of public transportation, or optimizing traffic patterns to reduce congestion and therefore emissions.

#### 5.2c.2 Noise Level Monitoring

Noise level monitoring is another important aspect of environmental monitoring in ITS. It involves the collection and analysis of data about the levels of noise generated by traffic. This data is then used to inform decisions about transportation planning and policy, with the aim of reducing the levels of noise generated by traffic.

For example, consider a scenario where a city is experiencing high levels of noise generated by traffic. An ITS system could use data about traffic patterns and vehicle noise levels to identify the sources of this noise. This could involve analyzing data about the types of vehicles on the road, their noise levels, and their driving behaviors. The system could then use this data to inform decisions about transportation planning and policy, such as implementing stricter noise standards for vehicles, encouraging the use of public transportation, or optimizing traffic patterns to reduce congestion and therefore noise levels.

#### 5.2c.3 Traffic Congestion Monitoring

Traffic congestion monitoring is a critical aspect of environmental monitoring in ITS. It involves the collection and analysis of data about the levels of traffic congestion on the road.

These technologies are designed to reduce the amount of pollutants emitted by vehicles, thereby improving air quality and reducing noise levels. In this section, we will discuss some of the most common vehicle emission control technologies.

#### 5.3a.1 Catalytic Converters

Catalytic converters are one of the most common emission control technologies. They are designed to convert harmful pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), into less harmful substances. The catalytic converter works by using a catalyst, typically a metal or a metal oxide, to promote a chemical reaction that breaks down the pollutants into less harmful substances.

For instance, consider a scenario where a vehicle is emitting NOx. The catalytic converter will use a catalyst, such as platinum or palladium, to promote a reaction that breaks down the NOx into nitrogen and oxygen. This process reduces the amount of NOx emitted by the vehicle, thereby improving air quality.

#### 5.3a.2 Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR)

Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) is another common emission control technology. It works by recirculating a portion of the exhaust gas back into the engine. This recirculated gas helps to reduce the amount of NOx emitted by the engine.

For example, consider a scenario where a vehicle is emitting NOx. The EGR system will recirculate a portion of the exhaust gas back into the engine. This recirculated gas helps to reduce the amount of NOx emitted by the engine, thereby improving air quality.

#### 5.3a.3 On-Board Diagnostics (OBD)

On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) is a computer system that is used to monitor the performance of the engine and its emission control system. It continually monitors the engine and its emission control system, and it can detect significant deviations from expected emissions control standards.

For instance, consider a scenario where a vehicle is emitting more pollutants than expected. The OBD system will detect this deviation and warn the driver. This allows the driver to take corrective action, such as having the vehicle serviced, to reduce the amount of pollutants emitted.

#### 5.3a.4 Hybrid Vehicles

Hybrid vehicles are another type of emission control technology. They use a combination of a traditional internal combustion engine and an electric motor to power the vehicle. This allows the vehicle to operate on electricity for short distances, reducing the amount of fuel consumed and therefore reducing the amount of pollutants emitted.

For example, consider a scenario where a vehicle is driving in a city. The vehicle can operate on electricity for short distances, reducing the amount of fuel consumed and therefore reducing the amount of pollutants emitted. This is particularly beneficial in urban areas, where vehicles often spend a significant amount of time idling or driving at low speeds.

Public policy plays a crucial role in reducing vehicle emissions and improving air quality. By setting regulations and incentives, policymakers can encourage the adoption of cleaner technologies and behaviors. In this section, we will discuss some of the most common public policy strategies for emission reduction.

#### 5.3c.1 Emission Standards

Emission standards are a key tool for reducing vehicle emissions. These standards set limits on the amount of pollutants that vehicles can emit. They are typically expressed as a maximum allowable emission rate per unit of fuel consumption. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets emission standards for new passenger cars and light-duty trucks. These standards have been progressively tightened over the years, leading to significant reductions in vehicle emissions.

#### 5.3c.2 Incentives for Cleaner Technologies

Policymakers can also encourage the adoption of cleaner technologies through incentives. These incentives can take various forms, including tax credits, subsidies, and regulatory preferences. For instance, the U.S. federal government offers a tax credit for the purchase of electric vehicles. This incentive encourages consumers to choose cleaner vehicles, thereby reducing vehicle emissions.

#### 5.3c.3 Traffic Management Policies

Public policy can also influence traffic management strategies. For example, policymakers can set policies that prioritize the use of public transportation over private vehicles. This can be achieved through policies that make public transportation more convenient and affordable, such as fare subsidies or preferential treatment in traffic. By reducing the number of vehicles on the road, these policies can help to reduce vehicle emissions.

#### 5.3c.4 Enforcement and Compliance

Finally, public policy must include mechanisms for enforcement and compliance. This ensures that emission standards and other policies are effectively implemented. For instance, the EPA conducts regular inspections and tests to ensure that vehicles meet emission standards. It also enforces penalties for non-compliance, such as fines and legal action.

In conclusion, public policy plays a crucial role in reducing vehicle emissions and improving air quality. By setting regulations, incentivizing cleaner technologies, influencing traffic management strategies, and ensuring enforcement and compliance, policymakers can significantly reduce the environmental impact of transportation.

#### 5.3c Policy and Regulatory Approaches

Policy and regulatory approaches play a crucial role in reducing vehicle emissions and improving air quality. These approaches are often used in conjunction with traffic management strategies to achieve the greatest impact on emission reduction. In this section, we will discuss some of the most common policy and regulatory approaches for emission reduction.

#### 5.3c.1 Command and Control Regulation

Command and Control (CAC) regulation is a type of environmental policy that uses legislation to directly regulate an industry or activity. This approach differs from other regulatory techniques, such as the use of economic incentives, which often include taxes and subsidies as incentives for compliance.

In the context of emission reduction, CAC regulation uses three main types of standards: ambient standards, emission standards, and technology standards. These standards can be used individually or in combination to achieve the desired level of emission reduction.

Ambient standards set the maximum allowable level of pollutants in the air. Emission standards set the maximum allowable level of pollutants that can be emitted by a vehicle or other source. Technology standards set the minimum level of technology that must be used to reduce emissions.

CAC regulation is often used in conjunction with other policy and regulatory approaches, such as traffic management strategies, to achieve the greatest impact on emission reduction.

#### 5.3c.2 Economic Incentives

Economic incentives are another type of policy and regulatory approach used to reduce vehicle emissions. These incentives can take the form of taxes or subsidies and are used to encourage compliance with emission standards.

For instance, a tax on vehicles that do not meet emission standards can incentivize manufacturers to produce vehicles that meet these standards. Similarly, a subsidy for the development and use of alternative fuels can encourage the adoption of these fuels, which can reduce vehicle emissions.

Economic incentives can be used in conjunction with other policy and regulatory approaches, such as CAC regulation and traffic management strategies, to achieve the greatest impact on emission reduction.

#### 5.3c.3 Voluntary Agreements

Voluntary agreements are another type of policy and regulatory approach used to reduce vehicle emissions. These agreements are often negotiated between industry and government and set targets for emission reduction.

Voluntary agreements can be used in conjunction with other policy and regulatory approaches, such as CAC regulation and economic incentives, to achieve the greatest impact on emission reduction.

#### 5.3c.4 Public Education and Awareness

Public education and awareness are also important policy and regulatory approaches for emission reduction. These approaches aim to raise public awareness about the impact of vehicle emissions on air quality and the environment, and to encourage behavior changes that can reduce emissions.

Public education and awareness can be used in conjunction with other policy and regulatory approaches, such as CAC regulation, economic incentives, and voluntary agreements, to achieve the greatest impact on emission reduction.




#### 5.4a Energy-efficient Vehicles and Fuels

Energy-efficient vehicles and fuels play a crucial role in reducing the environmental impact of transportation. In this section, we will discuss the various types of energy-efficient vehicles and fuels, their advantages, and their role in reducing emissions.

#### 5.4a.1 Electric Vehicles

Electric vehicles (EVs) are a type of energy-efficient vehicle that use electricity as their primary source of energy. EVs have several advantages over traditional vehicles. First, they do not emit any pollutants from their tailpipe, making them a zero-emission vehicle. This is particularly beneficial in urban areas where air pollution is a significant concern.

Second, EVs are more energy-efficient than traditional vehicles. This is because the process of converting electricity into rotary motion is more efficient than the process of converting fossil fuels into rotary motion. This results in lower energy consumption and, consequently, lower fuel costs for EV owners.

Finally, EVs can be powered using renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power. This further reduces their environmental impact and contributes to a more sustainable transportation system.

#### 5.4a.2 Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles

Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) are another type of energy-efficient vehicle. Unlike EVs, which use electricity as their primary source of energy, HFCVs use hydrogen fuel cells to convert hydrogen fuel into electricity. This electricity is then used to power an electric motor, which drives the vehicle.

One of the main advantages of HFCVs is that they have a longer range than EVs. This is because hydrogen fuel cells have a higher energy density than batteries, allowing HFCVs to travel longer distances before refueling.

However, HFCVs also have some disadvantages. For instance, hydrogen fuel is currently more expensive than traditional fuels, making HFCVs more expensive to operate. Additionally, the infrastructure for hydrogen fuel is still in its early stages, making it difficult for HFCVs to be widely adopted.

#### 5.4a.3 Alternative Fuels

In addition to EVs and HFCVs, there are also various alternative fuels that can be used in traditional vehicles to reduce their environmental impact. These include biodiesel, hydrogen, and natural gas.

Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that can be produced from vegetable oils or animal fats. It has a lower carbon footprint than traditional diesel and can be used in existing diesel engines with minimal modifications.

Hydrogen can also be used as an alternative fuel. As mentioned earlier, hydrogen fuel cells can be used to convert hydrogen fuel into electricity, which can then be used to power traditional vehicles.

Finally, natural gas can also be used as an alternative fuel. It has a lower carbon footprint than traditional gasoline or diesel and can be used in existing natural gas engines with minimal modifications.

In conclusion, energy-efficient vehicles and fuels play a crucial role in reducing the environmental impact of transportation. EVs, HFCVs, and alternative fuels all have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on various factors, including the specific needs of the user and the availability of infrastructure. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that these energy-efficient vehicles and fuels will become even more prevalent in the transportation sector.

#### 5.4b Energy Recovery and Waste Management

Energy recovery and waste management are crucial aspects of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). As the transportation sector continues to grow, the amount of waste generated also increases, posing significant environmental challenges. However, with the advent of ITS, there are opportunities to mitigate these challenges through the efficient management of waste and the recovery of energy from waste materials.

#### 5.4b.1 Waste Management in ITS

Waste management in ITS involves the collection, transportation, and disposal of waste materials.

This can be achieved by implementing advanced traffic management systems that use real-time traffic information to adjust the timing and sequencing of traffic signals.

#### Traffic Flow Optimization Strategies

Traffic flow optimization strategies are the actions taken to optimize the flow of traffic in a transportation network. These strategies can be classified into three categories: traffic signal optimization, lane management, and ramp metering.

Traffic signal optimization involves optimizing the timing and sequencing of traffic signals to improve the flow of traffic. This can be achieved by implementing advanced traffic management systems that use real-time traffic information to adjust the timing and sequencing of traffic signals.

Lane management involves managing the number of lanes on a roadway to optimize the flow of traffic. This can be achieved by implementing lane drop strategies, where certain lanes are closed to through traffic during peak hours, or by implementing high-occupancy vehicle lanes, where vehicles with multiple occupants are given priority.

Ramp metering involves controlling the number of vehicles entering a highway from a ramp. This can be achieved by implementing a system that controls the number of vehicles entering the highway based on real-time traffic information. This can help to reduce the number of vehicles entering the highway during peak hours, thereby reducing congestion.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, traffic flow optimization is a crucial aspect of congestion management in transportation systems. By using mathematical models and algorithms, traffic flow can be optimized to improve the flow of traffic and reduce congestion. This can be achieved through various methods, including traffic signal optimization, lane management, and ramp metering. However, it is important to note that traffic flow optimization is just one aspect of congestion management, and it should be implemented in conjunction with other strategies, such as demand management and regional operations.

Travel demand forecasting models are mathematical models used to predict the number of trips that will be made in a given area over a specific period of time. These models are essential for transportation planners and policymakers as they help in understanding the future travel patterns and needs of a population. This information can then be used to make informed decisions about transportation infrastructure, policies, and investments.

#### Activity-Based Models

Activity-based models are a type of travel demand forecasting model that predict for individuals where and when specific activities (e.g., work, leisure, shopping, etc.) are conducted. The major premise behind these models is that travel demand is derived from activities that people need or wish to perform, with travel decisions forming part of the scheduling decisions. Travel is then seen as just one of the attributes of a system.

Activity-based models offer several advantages over other types of models. For instance, they can be used to model environmental issues such as emissions and exposure to air pollution. They can also provide a better total estimate of exposure while also enabling the disaggregation of individual exposure over activities. This can be particularly useful in reducing exposure misclassification and establishing relationships between health impacts and air quality more precisely.

#### Integrated Transport - Land Use Models

Integrated Transport - Land Use (ITLU) models are another type of travel demand forecasting model. These models are intended to forecast the effect of changes in the transport network and operations over the future location of activities, and then forecast the effect of these new locations over the transport demand.

ITLU models are particularly useful in understanding the complex relationship between land use and transportation. By modeling the interaction between these two factors, ITLU models can provide insights into how changes in land use (e.g., the development of new residential or commercial areas) can impact transportation demand.

#### Per-driver Models

As data science and big data technologies become available to transport modelling, research is moving towards modelling and predicting behaviours of individual drivers in whole cities at the individual level. This will involve understanding individual drivers' objectives, such as minimizing travel time or fuel consumption, and predicting their decisions based on these objectives.

Per-driver models are still in their early stages of development, but they offer the potential to provide more accurate and detailed predictions of travel demand. By understanding the individual behaviors and objectives of drivers, these models can provide insights into how transportation systems can be designed and managed to meet the specific needs and preferences of different groups of drivers.

### Subsection: 9.2a Approaches to Measuring Traveler Satisfaction

Measuring traveler satisfaction is a crucial aspect of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). It allows transportation planners and operators to understand the needs and preferences of their customers, and to make informed decisions about service provision and improvement. There are several approaches to measuring traveler satisfaction, each with its own strengths and limitations.

#### The Gap Model

The Gap Model, proposed by Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry (Leonard L) between 1985 and 1988, is a widely used approach to measuring customer satisfaction. It is based on the idea that customer satisfaction is determined by the difference between the customer's expectation of performance and their perceived experience of performance. This model can be applied to traveler satisfaction by considering the gap between the traveler's expected travel experience and their actual experience.

For example, if a traveler expects a smooth and efficient journey, but experiences heavy traffic and delays, the gap between their expectation and experience will be large. This gap is likely to result in dissatisfaction. Conversely, if the traveler's expectation is lower than their actual experience, the gap will be smaller, and the traveler is likely to be more satisfied.

#### The SERVQUAL Model

The SERVQUAL Model, developed by Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry, is another widely used approach to measuring customer satisfaction. It is based on the idea that customer satisfaction is determined by five dimensions: reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, and tangibles. These dimensions can be applied to traveler satisfaction by considering the traveler's perception of the transportation service provider's performance in these areas.

For instance, reliability refers to the service provider's ability to perform as promised. In the context of travel, this could mean the reliability of public transit services or the reliability of traffic information provided by ITS. Responsiveness refers to the service provider's willingness to help customers and deal with their problems. In the context of travel, this could mean the responsiveness of customer service agents or the responsiveness of ITS systems to user queries. Assurance refers to the service provider's ability to inspire trust and confidence. In the context of travel, this could mean the assurance provided by ITS systems in terms of safety and security. Empathy refers to the service provider's ability to understand and care about the customer. In the context of travel, this could mean the empathy shown by ITS systems in terms of understanding the traveler's needs and preferences. Tangibles refer to the physical evidence of the service provider's performance. In the context of travel, this could mean the tangible aspects of the travel experience, such as the quality of the transportation infrastructure or the quality of the information provided by ITS.

#### The Traveler Satisfaction Index

The Traveler Satisfaction Index (TSI) is a comprehensive approach to measuring traveler satisfaction. It combines the Gap Model and the SERVQUAL Model, and also takes into account other factors such as value for money, convenience, and ease of use. The TSI is calculated using a formula that takes into account the traveler's expectations, their perceived experience, and their overall satisfaction.

For example, the TSI can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
TSI = (E - A) / (E - L)
$$

where E is the traveler's expectation, A is the traveler's actual experience, and L is the traveler's lowest expectation. A TSI value of 1 indicates that the traveler's actual experience matches their highest expectation, while a TSI value of 0 indicates that the traveler's actual experience matches their lowest expectation.

These approaches to measuring traveler satisfaction provide a framework for understanding the needs and preferences of travelers, and for making informed decisions about service provision and improvement. However, it is important to note that these approaches are not perfect, and that other factors such as the traveler's mood, the weather, and the traveler's personal circumstances can also influence their satisfaction. Therefore, it is important to use these approaches in conjunction with other methods, such as direct feedback from travelers, to gain a comprehensive understanding of traveler satisfaction.




### Subsection: 9.2b Surveys and Feedback Collection Methods

Surveys and feedback collection methods are powerful tools for measuring traveler satisfaction. They allow transportation planners and operators to gather direct feedback from travelers, providing valuable insights into their needs, preferences, and experiences.

Surveys can be particularly useful for measuring traveler satisfaction because they allow for the collection of detailed and specific information. For example, a survey could ask travelers to rate their satisfaction with different aspects of their journey, such as the comfort of the vehicle, the speed of the journey, or the helpfulness of the staff. This detailed information can then be used to identify areas for improvement and to track changes in satisfaction over time.

#### Feedback Collection Methods

Feedback collection methods are another important tool for measuring traveler satisfaction. These methods involve actively soliciting feedback from travelers, either through direct communication or through the use of feedback forms or apps.

Feedback collection methods can be particularly useful for identifying and addressing specific issues or concerns. For example, if a traveler has a negative experience, they can provide direct feedback to the transportation service provider. This feedback can then be used to address the issue and to improve the service in the future.

#### Combining Surveys and Feedback Collection Methods

While surveys and feedback collection methods can be used separately, they are often most effective when used in combination. Surveys can provide a broad overview of traveler satisfaction, while feedback collection methods can provide more detailed and specific information.

For example, a transportation service provider might use surveys to gather data on overall satisfaction, while also using feedback collection methods to address specific issues and concerns. This combination of methods can provide a more comprehensive understanding of traveler satisfaction, and can help to identify areas for improvement.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the challenges and limitations of measuring traveler satisfaction, and how these can be addressed.

#### Visual Elements

Visual elements play a significant role in the effectiveness of a presentation. They can help emphasize key points, add visual interest, and aid in understanding complex concepts. Some common visual elements include text, images, links, and effects. 

Text should be presented in a legible font size and type. According to the article "Prepare and Deliver an Effective Presentation", effective presentations typically use serif fonts (e.g. Times New Roman, Garamond, Baskerville, etc.) for the smaller text and sans serif fonts (e.g. Helvetica, Futura, Arial, etc.) for headings and larger text. The typefaces are used along with type size to improve readability for the audience. A combination of these typefaces can also be used to create emphasis. The majority of the fonts within a presentation are kept simple to aid in readability. Font styles, like bold, italic, and underline, are used to highlight important points.

It is possible to emphasize text and still maintain its readability by using contrasting colors. For example, black words on a white background emphasize the text being displayed but still helps maintain its readability.

#### Legibility

One common means to help one convey information and the audience stay on track is through the incorporation of text in a legible font size and type. According to the article "Prepare and Deliver an Effective Presentation", effective presentations typically use serif fonts (e.g. Times New Roman, Garamond, Baskerville, etc.) for the smaller text and sans serif fonts (e.g. Helvetica, Futura, Arial, etc.) for headings and larger text. The typefaces are used along with type size to improve readability for the audience. A combination of these typefaces can also be used to create emphasis. The majority of the fonts within a presentation are kept simple to aid in readability. Font styles, like bold, italic, and underline, are used to highlight important points.

It is possible to emphasize text and still maintain its readability by using contrasting colors. For example, black words on a white background emphasize the text being displayed but still helps maintain its readability. Text that is too small or too complex can make it difficult for the audience to read and understand the information being presented. Therefore, it is crucial to strike a balance between readability and visual interest.

#### Presentation Tools

There are several presentation tools available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some popular presentation products used across the globe are offered by Apple, Google, and Microsoft.
