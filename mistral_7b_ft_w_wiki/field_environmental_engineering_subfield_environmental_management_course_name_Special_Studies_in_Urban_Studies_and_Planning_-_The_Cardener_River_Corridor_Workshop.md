### Subsection: 1.1b History of Urban Planning

The history of urban planning is as old as the history of cities themselves. The earliest known urban sites, such as those in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Indus Valley, provide evidence of planned cities. These cities were laid out according to fixed plans, with distinct areas for residential, commercial, and religious purposes.

#### Pre-Classical and Classical Periods

The pre-Classical and Classical periods saw a number of cities laid out according to fixed plans, though many tended to develop organically. Designed cities were characteristic of the Minoan, Mesopotamian, Harrapan, and Egyptian civilisations of the third millennium BC. The first recorded description of urban planning appears in the Epic of Gilgamesh, where the hero is instructed to "Go up on to the wall of Uruk and walk around. Inspect the foundation platform and scrutinise the brickwork. Testify that its bricks are baked bricks, And that the Seven Counsellors must have laid its foundations."

#### Indus Valley Civilisation

The Indus Valley civilisation, which flourished in modern-day northwestern India and Pakistan, provides some of the earliest and most well-preserved examples of planned cities. The streets of these cities were paved and laid out at right angles in a grid pattern, with a hierarchy of streets from major boulevards to residential alleys. Archaeological evidence suggests that many Harrapan houses were laid out to protect from noise and to enhance residential privacy; many also had their own water supply and drainage system.

The Indus Valley civilisation also provides evidence of a complex urban society, with distinct areas for residential, commercial, and religious purposes. The cities were also well-planned in terms of infrastructure, with evidence of a sophisticated system of roads, canals, and irrigation.

#### Modern Urban Planning

Modern urban planning has its roots in the Enlightenment period, when thinkers such as Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis and Christopher Polhem began to develop theories of urban planning based on scientific principles. These theories were further developed in the 19th and 20th centuries, with the rise of industrialization and the need for more efficient and organized cities.

Today, urban planning continues to be guided by principles of sustainability, equity, and resilience. However, the challenges of creating livable, sustainable, and resilient cities have become more complex, with issues such as climate change, gentrification, and social inequality adding new layers of complexity to the field.

In the next section, we will explore the principles and strategies of urban planning in more detail, and how they can be applied to the Cardener River Corridor.
