### Section: 1.1 Bisection Method:

The bisection method is a simple and effective root finding algorithm that is often used as a starting point for more advanced methods. It is based on the principle of dividing an interval in half and checking which half contains the root. This process is repeated until the interval becomes small enough to approximate the root with a desired level of accuracy.

#### 1.1a Introduction to Bisection Method

The bisection method is a root finding algorithm that is based on the principle of dividing an interval in half and checking which half contains the root. It is a simple and effective method that is often used as a starting point for more advanced methods.

The bisection method works by repeatedly dividing an interval in half and checking which half contains the root. This process is repeated until the interval becomes small enough to approximate the root with a desired level of accuracy. The algorithm terminates when the interval becomes smaller than a predefined tolerance value.

The bisection method is guaranteed to converge to a root, but its convergence rate is relatively slow. This means that it may require a large number of iterations to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, the bisection method is robust and can handle non-differentiable and discontinuous functions, making it a valuable tool in numerical analysis.

In the next section, we will discuss the bisection method in more detail and provide a step-by-step guide on how to implement it. We will also discuss the concept of convergence and how to measure the accuracy of the bisection method.

#### 1.1b Process of Bisection Method

The bisection method is a simple and effective root finding algorithm that is based on the principle of dividing an interval in half and checking which half contains the root. The process of the bisection method can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Start with an interval [a, b] where the function f(x) changes sign. This means that f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs, indicating that the root lies somewhere between a and b.

2. Calculate the midpoint of the interval, c = (a + b)/2.

3. Evaluate the function at the midpoint, f(c). If f(c) has the same sign as f(a), then the root lies in the interval [c, b]. Otherwise, the root lies in the interval [a, c].

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the interval becomes smaller than a predefined tolerance value. The tolerance value is a small positive number that represents the desired level of accuracy.

The bisection method is guaranteed to converge to a root, but its convergence rate is relatively slow. This means that it may require a large number of iterations to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, the bisection method is robust and can handle non-differentiable and discontinuous functions, making it a valuable tool in numerical analysis.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of convergence and how to measure the accuracy of the bisection method. We will also provide a step-by-step guide on how to implement the bisection method in a computer program.

#### 1.1c Applications of Bisection Method

The bisection method is a powerful tool in numerical analysis and has a wide range of applications. In this section, we will discuss some of the common applications of the bisection method.

1. Solving Equations: The bisection method is commonly used to solve equations that cannot be solved analytically. By repeatedly dividing an interval in half and checking which half contains the root, the bisection method can approximate the root of a function with a desired level of accuracy.

2. Finding Extrema: The bisection method can also be used to find the extrema of a function. By repeatedly dividing an interval in half and checking which half contains the root, the bisection method can approximate the extrema of a function with a desired level of accuracy.

3. Solving Inequalities: The bisection method can be used to solve inequalities. By repeatedly dividing an interval in half and checking which half contains the root, the bisection method can approximate the solution set of an inequality with a desired level of accuracy.

4. Numerical Integration: The bisection method can be used for numerical integration. By repeatedly dividing an interval in half and evaluating the function at the midpoint, the bisection method can approximate the integral of a function with a desired level of accuracy.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of convergence and how to measure the accuracy of the bisection method. We will also provide a step-by-step guide on how to implement the bisection method in a computer program.




#### 1.1b Algorithm of Bisection Method

The bisection method is a simple and effective root finding algorithm that is based on the principle of dividing an interval in half and checking which half contains the root. The algorithm of the bisection method can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Start with an interval [a, b] where the function f(x) changes sign. This means that f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs.

2. Calculate the midpoint of the interval, c = (a + b) / 2.

3. If f(c) has the same sign as f(a), then the root must lie in the interval [c, b]. Otherwise, the root must lie in the interval [a, c].

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the interval becomes smaller than a predefined tolerance value.

The bisection method is guaranteed to converge to a root, but its convergence rate is relatively slow. This means that it may require a large number of iterations to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, the bisection method is robust and can handle non-differentiable and discontinuous functions, making it a valuable tool in numerical analysis.

In the next section, we will discuss the bisection method in more detail and provide a step-by-step guide on how to implement it. We will also discuss the concept of convergence and how to measure the accuracy of the bisection method.

#### 1.1c Convergence and Accuracy of Bisection Method

The bisection method is a powerful tool for finding the roots of equations, but it is important to understand its convergence and accuracy. The bisection method is guaranteed to converge to a root, but its convergence rate is relatively slow. This means that it may require a large number of iterations to reach a desired level of accuracy.

The convergence of the bisection method can be analyzed using the concept of bisection sequences. A bisection sequence is a sequence of intervals that are repeatedly halved until a desired level of accuracy is reached. The bisection method uses a bisection sequence to find the root of an equation.

The accuracy of the bisection method can be measured using the concept of error. The error of an approximation is the difference between the approximation and the true value. In the case of the bisection method, the error is the difference between the root of the equation and the midpoint of the current interval.

The error of the bisection method can be bounded using the concept of the bisection error. The bisection error is the maximum error that can occur during the bisection process. It is given by the formula:

$$
\text{Bisection Error} = \frac{\text{Initial Interval Size}}{2^k}
$$

where k is the number of bisections required to reach a desired level of accuracy.

The bisection error can be reduced by increasing the number of bisections. However, this also increases the number of iterations required to reach a desired level of accuracy. Therefore, it is important to strike a balance between the number of bisections and the desired level of accuracy.

In the next section, we will discuss some modifications of the bisection method that can improve its convergence rate and accuracy. These modifications include the use of the Remez algorithm and the concept of the characteristic bisection method.

##### Remez Algorithm

The bisection method can also be used in conjunction with the Remez algorithm. The Remez algorithm is a numerical method for finding the best approximation of a function by a polynomial of a given degree. The bisection method can be used to find the roots of the error function in the Remez algorithm, which can help improve the accuracy of the approximation.

##### Characteristic Bisection Method

The characteristic bisection method is a modification of the bisection method that uses only the signs of a function in different points. This method can be used to solve problems involving functions from R^d to R^d, where d ≥ 2. The characteristic bisection method can be particularly useful in problems where the function is not differentiable or has discontinuities.
