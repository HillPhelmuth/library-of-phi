### Section 1.1:  Understanding Great Power Military Intervention

Great power military intervention is a complex and multifaceted concept that has been a subject of study for centuries. It refers to the use of military force by powerful nations to intervene in the affairs of other states. This intervention can take various forms, from direct military intervention to indirect support for rebel groups. The motivations behind such interventions are equally diverse, ranging from economic and political interests to humanitarian concerns.

#### 1.1a Definition and Scope

The term "great power" is often used interchangeably with "major power" or "superpower". It typically refers to nations that possess significant economic, political, and military influence on a global scale. These nations are often permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and play a dominant role in international affairs.

Great power military intervention can be categorized into two main types: direct and indirect. Direct intervention involves the deployment of military forces into a foreign territory, often with the intention of achieving specific objectives. This can include military operations such as invasions, occupations, and interventions in civil wars.

Indirect intervention, on the other hand, involves supporting or aiding a third party in a conflict. This can take various forms, from providing military equipment and training to supporting rebel groups. The United States' involvement in the Syrian Civil War through support for rebel groups is an example of indirect intervention.

The scope of great power military intervention is vast and can have far-reaching consequences. It can involve not only the intervening nation but also the target nation and other international actors. The consequences of such interventions can range from political instability and economic turmoil to humanitarian crises and the spread of conflict.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the historical context, motivations, and consequences of great power military intervention. We will also examine various case studies to provide a comprehensive understanding of this complex topic.

#### 1.1b Historical Context

The historical context of great power military intervention is deeply rooted in the power dynamics of international relations. The concept of great power intervention has been a part of human history since ancient times, with empires and kingdoms often intervening in the affairs of neighboring states. However, the modern era has seen a significant evolution in the nature and scope of great power intervention.

The 19th and 20th centuries, in particular, have been marked by a series of great power interventions, often driven by economic and political interests. The British Empire, for instance, was known for its extensive colonial interventions, often using military force to establish control over new territories. Similarly, the United States has a long history of intervention, particularly in Latin America, often with the aim of protecting its economic interests.

The post-World War II era has seen a shift in the nature of great power intervention, with the rise of the United States as a global superpower. The US has been involved in numerous interventions, often under the banner of promoting democracy and human rights. The US intervention in Iraq in 2003, for instance, was justified on the grounds of eliminating weapons of mass destruction, which were later found to be non-existent.

The historical context of great power intervention is complex and multifaceted, often influenced by a variety of factors including economic interests, political ideologies, and humanitarian concerns. Understanding this historical context is crucial to understanding the motivations and consequences of great power intervention.

#### 1.1c Case Studies

To further illustrate the complexities and consequences of great power military intervention, let's examine two case studies: the United States' intervention in Iraq and Russia's intervention in Syria.

##### United States' Intervention in Iraq

The United States' intervention in Iraq, which began in 2003, is a prime example of a direct intervention. The US, along with its coalition partners, invaded Iraq with the stated goal of eliminating weapons of mass destruction and promoting democracy in the region. However, no such weapons were found, and the intervention led to a prolonged and costly occupation, resulting in significant political instability and humanitarian crisis in Iraq.

The intervention also had far-reaching consequences beyond Iraq, contributing to the rise of ISIS and the destabilization of the Middle East. The US intervention in Iraq also highlighted the limitations of military force as a tool for achieving political objectives, particularly in the absence of a clear exit strategy.

##### Russia's Intervention in Syria

Russia's intervention in Syria, which began in 2015, is an example of indirect intervention. Russia, along with its ally Syria, has been supporting the Syrian government in its civil war against rebel groups. This intervention has involved direct military support, including airstrikes and ground troops, as well as indirect support for the Syrian government.

The Russian intervention in Syria has had significant consequences, both for Syria and the region. It has contributed to the ongoing civil war and humanitarian crisis in Syria, and has also led to increased tensions between Russia and the US, its main rival in the region.

These case studies highlight the complexities and consequences of great power military intervention. They underscore the importance of careful consideration and planning before engaging in such interventions, and the need for a clear exit strategy. They also underscore the importance of understanding the historical context and motivations behind such interventions.

It is a subject that has been studied extensively by historians, political scientists, and military strategists. This section will provide a brief overview of the historical context of military interventions, focusing on the pre-World War era.

#### 1.2a Pre-World War Era

The pre-World War era was a time of significant military interventions by great powers. The era was marked by a series of conflicts, including the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War, and the American Civil War. These conflicts were characterized by the use of military force to achieve political and strategic objectives.

The Napoleonic Wars, which lasted from 1803 to 1815, were a series of conflicts involving France and various coalitions of European powers. The wars were primarily fought in Europe and resulted in significant changes to the political map of the continent. The wars were characterized by the use of military force to expand French territories and to assert French dominance in Europe.

The Crimean War, which lasted from 1853 to 1856, was a conflict between the Russian Empire and an alliance of France, Britain, and the Ottoman Empire. The war was primarily fought in the Crimean Peninsula and resulted in a significant Russian defeat. The war was characterized by the use of military force to protect British and French interests in the region and to prevent Russian expansion into the Ottoman Empire.

The American Civil War, which lasted from 1861 to 1865, was a conflict between the United States and the Confederate States of America. The war was primarily fought in the United States and resulted in the reunification of the country under the leadership of the United States. The war was characterized by the use of military force to suppress the Confederacy and to preserve the Union.

These conflicts provide valuable insights into the historical context of great power military interventions. They highlight the motivations behind such interventions, the strategies used, and the consequences of such interventions. They also underscore the importance of understanding the historical context of military interventions in order to effectively analyze and evaluate contemporary interventions.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the historical context of military interventions, focusing on the post-World War era.

#### 1.2b World War Era

The World War era, spanning from 1914 to 1945, was a period of significant military interventions by great powers. This era was marked by two major conflicts: World War I and World War II. These conflicts were characterized by the use of military force to achieve political and strategic objectives, and they had a profound impact on the global political landscape.

World War I, also known as the Great War, lasted from 1914 to 1918. It was a global conflict that involved most of the world's great powers. The war was primarily fought in Europe and resulted in significant changes to the political map of the continent. The war was characterized by the use of military force to assert national interests and to prevent the dominance of other powers.

The war was initiated by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914. This event set off a chain of events that led to the declaration of war by Austria-Hungary on Serbia on 28 July 1914. The war quickly escalated, involving most of the major European powers and their colonies.

The war was characterized by the use of new military technologies, such as tanks and airplanes, and by the introduction of new military strategies, such as trench warfare. The war resulted in significant casualties and devastation, leading to the collapse of several empires and the establishment of new political entities.

World War II, which lasted from 1939 to 1945, was an even more devastating conflict. It involved most of the world's great powers and resulted in the death of millions of people. The war was characterized by the use of military force to achieve political and strategic objectives, and it had a profound impact on the global political landscape.

The war was initiated by the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany on 1 September 1939. This event set off a chain of events that led to the declaration of war by France and Britain on Germany on 3 September 1939. The war quickly escalated, involving most of the major European powers and their colonies.

The war was characterized by the use of new military technologies, such as nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, and by the introduction of new military strategies, such as blitzkrieg. The war resulted in significant casualties and devastation, leading to the collapse of several regimes and the establishment of new political entities.

These conflicts provide valuable insights into the historical context of great power military interventions. They highlight the motivations behind such interventions, the strategies used, and the consequences of such interventions. They also underscore the importance of understanding the historical context of military interventions in order to effectively analyze and evaluate contemporary interventions.

#### 1.2c Post-World War Era

The post-World War era, spanning from 1945 to the present, has been marked by a significant shift in the nature of military interventions by great powers. This era has been characterized by the use of military force to achieve political and strategic objectives, but also by a growing emphasis on international cooperation and multilateralism.

The end of World War II saw the emergence of two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, which engaged in a Cold War that lasted until the late 1980s. This period was marked by a series of military interventions, often proxy wars, as the two superpowers vied for influence around the world.

One of the most significant military interventions of this era was the Korean War (1950-1953), which was fought between the United States and its allies on one side, and North Korea and its allies on the other. The war was a direct result of the Cold War, with the United States and its allies intervening to support South Korea against the communist aggression of North Korea.

The Korean War was characterized by the use of military force to achieve political and strategic objectives. The United States and its allies intervened to prevent the spread of communism in Asia and to protect their economic interests in the region. The war resulted in significant casualties and devastation, but it also led to the establishment of a stable democratic government in South Korea.

The post-World War era has also seen a growing emphasis on international cooperation and multilateralism in military interventions. This is exemplified by the United Nations, which was established in 1945 to promote international cooperation and prevent future wars. The UN has been involved in numerous military interventions, often in conjunction with other international organizations and great powers.

One of the most significant UN interventions of the post-World War era was the Gulf War (1990-1991), which was a response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The UN Security Council, with the support of the United States and other great powers, authorized a military intervention to liberate Kuwait. The intervention was successful, resulting in the expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait and the restoration of Kuwait's sovereignty.

The Gulf War was characterized by the use of military force to achieve political and strategic objectives, but it also demonstrated the importance of international cooperation and multilateralism in military interventions. The UN intervention was supported by a coalition of great powers, including the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, and it was authorized by the UN Security Council.

In conclusion, the post-World War era has been marked by a significant shift in the nature of military interventions by great powers. While the use of military force to achieve political and strategic objectives remains a key factor, there has been a growing emphasis on international cooperation and multilateralism. This has led to a more complex and nuanced approach to military interventions, with great powers often working in conjunction with international organizations and other states.

## Chapter: Chapter 2: Theories of Intervention

### Introduction

In the realm of international relations, the use of military force has been a contentious issue for centuries. The application of military power, often referred to as intervention, has been a tool used by great powers to assert their influence and achieve their strategic objectives. This chapter, "Theories of Intervention," delves into the theoretical underpinnings of military intervention, exploring the various perspectives and rationales that guide the use of military force.

Theories of intervention are crucial in understanding the motivations and consequences of military intervention. They provide a framework for analyzing the decisions of great powers to intervene in the affairs of other states. These theories are not only academic constructs but also practical tools that policymakers and strategists use to justify and guide their actions.

This chapter will explore a range of theories of intervention, including the realist perspective, which emphasizes the pursuit of power and security, and the liberal perspective, which emphasizes the promotion of democracy and human rights. We will also delve into constructivist theories, which focus on the role of ideas and norms in shaping intervention decisions.

We will also examine the role of international law in regulating intervention. The chapter will explore how different theories of intervention interpret and apply international law, and how these interpretations can lead to different outcomes.

Finally, we will discuss the implications of these theories for the practice of intervention. We will consider how these theories can help us understand past interventions, and how they can inform future interventions.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the theories of intervention, equipping readers with the knowledge and tools to critically analyze and evaluate interventions by great powers. It is our hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for students, scholars, and policymakers interested in the complex and often controversial topic of military intervention.




### Subsection 1.2b Post-World War Era

The post-World War era marked a significant shift in the use of military force by great powers. The aftermath of World War II saw the rise of the United States and the Soviet Union as superpowers, leading to a period of intense political and military competition between the two. This competition was characterized by a shift in the use of military force, with both powers engaging in proxy wars and covert operations rather than direct military interventions.

The Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, was one of the few direct military interventions by the United States during this period. The war was fought between the United States and its allies on one side and North Korea and its allies on the other. The war was characterized by the use of military force to contain communist expansion in the region and to protect American interests.

The Vietnam War, which lasted from 1955 to 1975, was another significant military intervention by the United States during this period. The war was fought between the United States and its allies on one side and North Vietnam and its allies on the other. The war was characterized by the use of military force to contain communist expansion in Southeast Asia and to protect American interests.

The post-World War era also saw a significant increase in the use of covert operations and proxy wars by great powers. These operations were often carried out by proxy forces, such as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the United States and the KGB in the Soviet Union. These operations were characterized by the use of military force to achieve political and strategic objectives without direct involvement of the great power.

The post-World War era also saw the development of new technologies and strategies for military intervention. The United States, in particular, invested heavily in developing advanced military technologies, such as nuclear weapons and satellite-based surveillance systems. These technologies were used to gain a strategic advantage over the Soviet Union and to protect American interests around the world.

In conclusion, the post-World War era marked a significant shift in the use of military force by great powers. The rise of the United States and the Soviet Union as superpowers led to a period of intense political and military competition, characterized by a shift towards proxy wars and covert operations. This period also saw the development of new technologies and strategies for military intervention, further highlighting the complex and multifaceted nature of great power military interventions.





### Subsection 1.2c Modern Day Interventions

The modern era of military intervention has been marked by a shift towards more targeted and limited interventions, often referred to as "smart power" strategies. This approach involves the use of military force in conjunction with diplomatic, economic, and cultural tools to achieve specific objectives. The United States, as a global superpower, has been at the forefront of this shift, with its interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan serving as notable examples.

The invasion of Iraq in 2003, led by the United States and its allies, was a significant military intervention in the Middle East. The invasion was justified by the belief that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, which later proved to be false. The intervention resulted in the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime, but also led to a prolonged and costly occupation, as well as the rise of sectarian violence and insurgencies.

The intervention in Afghanistan, which began in 2001, was a response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The United States, along with its allies, invaded Afghanistan with the goal of overthrowing the Taliban regime, which had provided safe haven to al-Qaeda. The intervention has been ongoing, with the United States maintaining a military presence in the country to combat terrorism and support the Afghan government.

The modern era has also seen an increase in the use of drone strikes and other forms of targeted military force. These interventions are often carried out without the involvement of ground troops, and are justified as a means of minimizing civilian casualties and achieving specific objectives. However, there have been concerns raised about the legality and effectiveness of these interventions, as well as their impact on international relations.

In conclusion, the modern era of military intervention has been marked by a shift towards more targeted and limited interventions, often involving the use of advanced technologies and strategies. The United States, as a global superpower, has been a major player in these interventions, with its actions often shaping the course of international affairs. As we continue to navigate the complexities of global politics, it is crucial to critically examine and analyze these interventions to better understand their implications and potential outcomes.

### Section: 2.1 Key Interveners and Their Policy Preferences:

### Subsection: 2.1a United States

The United States has been a major player in international affairs for over two centuries, and its military interventions have had a significant impact on global politics. In this section, we will examine the United States' role as a key intervener and its policy preferences in military interventions.

#### The United States as a Key Intervener

The United States has a long history of military interventions, dating back to its involvement in the Napoleonic Wars in the early 19th century. Since then, the United States has intervened in numerous conflicts around the world, often using its military power to achieve its policy objectives.

One of the key factors that have contributed to the United States' role as a key intervener is its economic power. As the world's largest economy, the United States has a significant stake in global trade and commerce. This has led it to intervene in conflicts that threaten its economic interests, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 and the Gulf War in 1991.

Moreover, the United States has a strong military presence around the world, with over 800 military bases in 70 countries. This global reach allows it to project its military power and intervene in conflicts quickly and effectively.

#### Policy Preferences in Military Interventions

The United States has a long-standing policy of non-intervention, which states that it will not intervene in the internal affairs of other countries unless there is a direct threat to its national security. However, this policy has been consistently challenged and modified over time.

During the Cold War, the United States often intervened in conflicts to contain the spread of communism and protect its allies. This was evident in its involvement in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. However, with the end of the Cold War, the United States' policy preferences in military interventions have shifted.

Today, the United States prioritizes interventions that promote its economic interests and protect its allies. This was evident in its involvement in the Iraq War in 2003, which was driven by the desire to secure access to Iraq's oil reserves and protect its ally, Israel.

Furthermore, the United States has also become more selective in its interventions, only intervening in conflicts that it perceives as directly threatening its national security. This was evident in its decision not to intervene in the Syrian Civil War, despite the humanitarian crisis and involvement of regional powers.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, the United States plays a significant role as a key intervener in global conflicts. Its economic power and military presence allow it to project its power and intervene in conflicts quickly and effectively. However, its policy preferences have evolved over time, prioritizing interventions that promote its economic interests and protect its allies.

## Chapter 2: Background and Big Picture:




### Section: 2.1 Key Interveners and Their Policy Preferences:

### Subsection: 2.1b Russia

Russia, as one of the major global powers, has also played a significant role in international affairs and military interventions. Its involvement in conflicts around the world has been shaped by its policy preferences and strategic interests.

#### Russia as a Key Intervener

Russia's military power has been a key factor in its role as a key intervener. With a strong military presence in various regions, including the Middle East and Central Asia, Russia has been able to project its power and intervene in conflicts when necessary. This has been evident in its involvement in the Syrian Civil War and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

Moreover, Russia's economic power has also played a significant role in its interventions. As one of the largest producers of oil and natural gas, Russia has a strong economic stake in global trade and commerce. This has led it to intervene in conflicts that threaten its economic interests, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

#### Policy Preferences in Military Interventions

Russia's policy preferences in military interventions have been shaped by its historical and cultural background. The country has a long history of intervention in the affairs of its neighbors, particularly in the former Soviet republics. This has been driven by its desire to maintain its influence and protect its strategic interests.

However, Russia's involvement in conflicts around the world has also been met with criticism and concerns. Its intervention in the Syrian Civil War, for example, has been criticized for exacerbating the humanitarian crisis and causing further instability in the region. Similarly, its involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine has been met with international condemnation.

In conclusion, Russia's role as a key intervener and its policy preferences in military interventions have been shaped by its economic and military power, as well as its historical and cultural background. As one of the major global powers, Russia's actions in conflicts around the world have a significant impact on the international community. 





### Subsection: 2.1c China

China, as one of the major global powers, has also played a significant role in international affairs and military interventions. Its involvement in conflicts around the world has been shaped by its policy preferences and strategic interests.

#### China as a Key Intervener

China's military power has been a key factor in its role as a key intervener. With a strong military presence in various regions, including the South China Sea and the Korean Peninsula, China has been able to project its power and intervene in conflicts when necessary. This has been evident in its involvement in the South China Sea dispute and the ongoing conflict on the Korean Peninsula.

Moreover, China's economic power has also played a significant role in its interventions. As one of the largest economies in the world, China has a strong economic stake in global trade and commerce. This has led it to intervene in conflicts that threaten its economic interests, such as the ongoing conflict on the Korean Peninsula.

#### Policy Preferences in Military Interventions

China's policy preferences in military interventions have been shaped by its historical and cultural background. The country has a long history of non-interference in the affairs of other nations, known as the "Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence". This principle has been a guiding force in China's approach to international conflicts.

However, China's involvement in conflicts around the world has also been met with criticism and concerns. Its intervention in the South China Sea dispute, for example, has been criticized for exacerbating tensions and causing further instability in the region. Similarly, its involvement in the ongoing conflict on the Korean Peninsula has been met with international condemnation.

In conclusion, China's role as a key intervener and its policy preferences in military interventions have been shaped by its economic and military power, as well as its historical and cultural background. As one of the major global powers, China's actions in international conflicts have a significant impact on global stability and security. 





### Subsection: 2.1d European Union

The European Union (EU) is a unique and complex entity when it comes to military intervention. As a supranational organization, the EU has its own foreign policy and military capabilities, separate from its member states. This has allowed it to play a significant role in international conflicts, particularly in its neighborhood.

#### The European Union as a Key Intervener

The EU's military power is primarily derived from its member states, who contribute troops and resources to EU-led missions. This has allowed the EU to deploy military forces in various conflicts, such as the Balkans and the Central African Republic. However, the EU's military capabilities are limited compared to other global powers, such as the United States and Russia.

In addition to its military power, the EU also has significant economic and political influence. As a major economic power, the EU has a strong stake in global trade and commerce. This has led it to intervene in conflicts that threaten its economic interests, such as the ongoing conflict in Libya. Furthermore, the EU's political influence, particularly through its diplomatic efforts, has also allowed it to play a role in international conflicts.

#### Policy Preferences in Military Interventions

The EU's policy preferences in military interventions are shaped by its values and principles, as well as its strategic interests. The EU is committed to promoting democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, and this is reflected in its interventions. For example, the EU has been a major supporter of democracy promotion efforts in the Balkans, providing financial and technical assistance to support democratic reforms.

However, the EU's policy preferences are not without criticism. Some argue that the EU's focus on promoting democracy and human rights can sometimes overshadow its strategic interests. This has been evident in its interventions in conflicts such as Libya, where the EU's support for rebel forces ultimately led to the downfall of Muammar Gaddafi, but also resulted in a prolonged and costly conflict.

In conclusion, the EU's role as a key intervener and its policy preferences in military interventions are shaped by its unique characteristics as a supranational organization. While its military capabilities are limited, its economic and political influence, as well as its values and principles, allow it to play a significant role in international conflicts. However, its interventions are not without criticism, and its approach to military interventions will continue to be a topic of debate and discussion.


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the background and big picture of great power military intervention. We have discussed the historical context of military intervention, the various forms it can take, and the factors that influence it. We have also examined the impact of military intervention on both the intervening country and the target country, as well as the potential consequences and challenges that come with it.

Through our comprehensive study, we have seen that great power military intervention is a complex and multifaceted issue. It is not a one-size-fits-all solution and must be approached with careful consideration and understanding of the underlying factors at play. While it can be a powerful tool for addressing conflicts and promoting stability, it also carries significant risks and potential negative consequences.

As we move forward in our study, it is important to keep in mind the lessons learned in this chapter. We must continue to examine the big picture and consider the potential impact of military intervention on all parties involved. By doing so, we can gain a deeper understanding of this complex issue and make more informed decisions in the future.

### Exercises

## Chapter 3: International Organizations




### Subsection: 2.2a Ethnic Conflict Theory

Ethnic conflict theory is a crucial aspect of understanding internal conflicts. It posits that ethnicity, as a social construct, can be a significant factor in fueling and perpetuating conflicts within a society. This theory is particularly relevant in the context of great power military intervention, as ethnic conflicts often require intervention to prevent further escalation and violence.

#### Ethnicity as a Social Construct

Ethnicity is a complex and multifaceted concept that is often used to categorize individuals based on shared cultural, ancestral, or historical experiences. However, it is important to note that ethnicity is not a fixed or immutable characteristic. It is a social construct that can be shaped and influenced by various factors, including political, economic, and social forces.

In the context of ethnic conflict theory, ethnicity is often used as a tool by political leaders to mobilize support and create divisions within a society. This can be seen in the case of the Yugoslav Wars, where political leaders exploited ethnic tensions to fuel conflict and violence.

#### Ethnic Conflict and Great Power Intervention

Ethnic conflicts often require intervention from great powers due to their potential for escalation and violence. Great powers, such as the United States and Russia, have a vested interest in maintaining stability and preventing the spread of conflict. Therefore, they often intervene in ethnic conflicts to prevent further escalation and violence.

However, great power intervention in ethnic conflicts is not without its challenges. As seen in the case of the Yugoslav Wars, intervention can sometimes exacerbate ethnic tensions and prolong conflicts. This is particularly true when intervention is driven by strategic interests rather than a commitment to resolving the underlying ethnic issues.

#### Ethnic Conflict and the European Union

The European Union (EU) has also played a significant role in intervening in ethnic conflicts, particularly in its neighborhood. The EU's military power, derived from its member states, allows it to deploy military forces in various conflicts. However, its limited military capabilities compared to other global powers, such as the United States and Russia, can limit its effectiveness in intervening in ethnic conflicts.

The EU's policy preferences in military interventions are shaped by its values and principles, as well as its strategic interests. Its commitment to promoting democracy, human rights, and the rule of law often drives its interventions in ethnic conflicts. However, this focus can sometimes overshadow its strategic interests, leading to interventions that are not as effective as they could be.

In conclusion, ethnic conflict theory is a crucial aspect of understanding internal conflicts and great power military intervention. It highlights the role of ethnicity as a social construct in fueling and perpetuating conflicts, as well as the challenges and limitations of intervention in ethnic conflicts. 





### Subsection: 2.2b Resource Conflict Theory

Resource conflict theory is another crucial aspect of understanding internal conflicts. It posits that conflicts can arise due to competition for scarce resources, whether they be natural resources, economic resources, or even ideological resources. This theory is particularly relevant in the context of great power military intervention, as resource conflicts often require intervention to prevent further escalation and violence.

#### Resource Conflict and Great Power Intervention

Resource conflicts often require intervention from great powers due to their potential for escalation and violence. Great powers, such as the United States and Russia, have a vested interest in maintaining stability and preventing the spread of conflict. Therefore, they often intervene in resource conflicts to prevent further escalation and violence.

However, great power intervention in resource conflicts is not without its challenges. As seen in the case of the Yugoslav Wars, intervention can sometimes exacerbate resource tensions and prolong conflicts. This is particularly true when intervention is driven by strategic interests rather than a commitment to resolving the underlying resource issues.

#### Resource Conflict and the European Union

The European Union (EU) has also played a significant role in resource conflicts, particularly in the Balkans. The EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has been a source of conflict between member states, with some arguing that it distorts the market and leads to overproduction. This has been a particular issue for France, which has been a major beneficiary of the CAP. However, the EU has also been a major player in resource conflicts in the Balkans, particularly in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The EU's involvement in Bosnia has been complex and multifaceted, involving not only military intervention but also economic and political engagement.

#### Resource Conflict and the European Union

The European Union (EU) has also played a significant role in resource conflicts, particularly in the Balkans. The EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has been a source of conflict between member states, with some arguing that it distorts the market and leads to overproduction. This has been a particular issue for France, which has been a major beneficiary of the CAP. However, the EU has also been a major player in resource conflicts in the Balkans, particularly in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The EU's involvement in Bosnia has been complex and multifaceted, involving not only military intervention but also economic and political engagement.

The EU's involvement in Bosnia has been particularly complex due to the country's ethnic and resource conflicts. The EU has been involved in peacekeeping operations in Bosnia since 1995, and has also been a major provider of economic aid. However, the EU's involvement has not been without controversy. Some argue that the EU's economic aid has been used to further the interests of European companies, rather than addressing the underlying resource conflicts in Bosnia. This has led to criticism of the EU's approach to resource conflicts, and has raised questions about the effectiveness of its intervention.

In conclusion, resource conflict theory is a crucial aspect of understanding internal conflicts and great power military intervention. The EU's involvement in resource conflicts, particularly in the Balkans, highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of these conflicts, and the challenges of intervention. As we continue to study great power military intervention, it is important to consider the role of resource conflicts and the EU's involvement in them.





### Subsection: 2.2c Political Conflict Theory

Political conflict theory is a crucial aspect of understanding internal conflicts, particularly in the context of great power military intervention. This theory posits that conflicts can arise due to differences in political ideologies, power struggles, and competition for political control. It is particularly relevant in the context of great power military intervention, as political conflicts often require intervention to prevent further escalation and violence.

#### Political Conflict and Great Power Intervention

Political conflicts often require intervention from great powers due to their potential for escalation and violence. Great powers, such as the United States and Russia, have a vested interest in maintaining stability and preventing the spread of conflict. Therefore, they often intervene in political conflicts to prevent further escalation and violence.

However, great power intervention in political conflicts is not without its challenges. As seen in the case of the Syrian Civil War, intervention can sometimes exacerbate political tensions and prolong conflicts. This is particularly true when intervention is driven by strategic interests rather than a commitment to resolving the underlying political issues.

#### Political Conflict and the European Union

The European Union (EU) has also played a significant role in political conflicts, particularly in the Balkans. The EU's involvement in the Kosovo War, for example, was driven by political conflicts between the Albanian and Serbian populations. The EU's intervention in Kosovo was aimed at resolving these political conflicts and preventing further violence.

However, the EU's involvement in political conflicts is not without its challenges. As seen in the case of Macedonia, EU intervention can sometimes exacerbate political tensions and prolong conflicts. This is particularly true when intervention is driven by strategic interests rather than a commitment to resolving the underlying political issues.

## Chapter 3: Great Power Military Intervention: A Comprehensive Study




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the complex and often controversial topic of external intervention and the use of force. This is a crucial aspect of international relations, as it involves the involvement of great powers in the affairs of other nations. The use of force, whether it be military intervention or economic sanctions, has been a contentious issue throughout history, with varying opinions on its effectiveness and ethical implications.

We will begin by examining the concept of external intervention and its various forms. This includes military intervention, economic sanctions, and diplomatic intervention. We will also explore the motivations behind external intervention, such as protecting national interests, promoting democracy, and preventing human rights abuses.

Next, we will delve into the use of force in external intervention. This includes the use of military force, such as invasions and bombings, as well as non-military forms of force, such as economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure. We will also discuss the ethical implications of using force, including the potential for violating sovereignty and human rights.

Throughout this chapter, we will also examine case studies of external intervention by great powers, such as the United States, Russia, and China. These case studies will provide real-world examples and insights into the complexities of external intervention and the use of force.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of external intervention and the use of force, and its role in international relations. This chapter aims to provide a balanced and objective analysis, taking into consideration the various perspectives and implications of external intervention. 


# Great Power Military Intervention: A Comprehensive Study

## Chapter 3: External Intervention and the Use of Force




### Section: 3.1 Political Strategy and Intervention

#### 3.1a Diplomatic Intervention

Diplomatic intervention is a crucial aspect of external intervention and the use of force. It involves the use of diplomatic channels, such as negotiations and mediation, to address conflicts and issues between nations. Diplomatic intervention can take various forms, including bilateral and multilateral negotiations, mediation, and arbitration.

One of the key motivations for diplomatic intervention is to prevent conflicts from escalating into full-blown military interventions. By engaging in diplomatic efforts, great powers can address underlying issues and find peaceful resolutions to conflicts. This not only helps to maintain stability and prevent further escalation, but also allows for the preservation of sovereignty and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other states.

However, diplomatic intervention can also be used as a tool for great powers to exert their influence and achieve their own strategic objectives. This can be seen in the case of the Triple Intervention, where Russia, France, and Germany used diplomatic channels to intervene in the affairs of China and Japan. Each power had its own interests at stake, and through diplomatic intervention, they were able to achieve their desired outcomes.

In the case of the Triple Intervention, Russia had the most to gain out of the intervention. The construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway and the acquisition of a warm-water port in the Far East would enable Russia to consolidate its presence in the region and further expand into Asia and the Pacific. France, on the other hand, had financial interests in Russia and did not wish to be diplomatically isolated. Germany, meanwhile, saw an opportunity to draw Russia's attention to the east and away from itself, while also establishing German territorial concessions in China.

The Triple Intervention also highlights the importance of diplomatic intervention in maintaining stability and preventing conflicts from escalating. In this case, diplomatic intervention helped to prevent a potential war between Japan and China, and allowed for a peaceful resolution of the conflict.

In conclusion, diplomatic intervention is a crucial aspect of external intervention and the use of force. It allows for the peaceful resolution of conflicts and the preservation of sovereignty, while also allowing great powers to exert their influence and achieve their own strategic objectives. The case of the Triple Intervention serves as a prime example of the role of diplomatic intervention in international relations.





### Subsection: 3.1b Economic Intervention

Economic intervention is another crucial aspect of external intervention and the use of force. It involves the use of economic policies and tools to address conflicts and issues between nations. Economic intervention can take various forms, including trade agreements, sanctions, and financial aid.

One of the key motivations for economic intervention is to address economic imbalances and promote stability. By engaging in economic interventions, great powers can address issues such as currency devaluation, inflation, and debt crises. This not only helps to maintain stability and prevent further economic turmoil, but also allows for the preservation of economic systems and the protection of financial institutions.

However, economic intervention can also be used as a tool for great powers to exert their influence and achieve their own strategic objectives. This can be seen in the case of Argentina, where external actors have intervened in the country's economic policies and institutions.

In the 1990s, Argentina faced a severe economic crisis, characterized by high inflation, currency devaluation, and a large public debt. In response, the government implemented a series of economic reforms, including the adoption of a currency board system and the privatization of key industries. These reforms were supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other external actors, who provided financial aid and technical assistance.

However, the implementation of these reforms led to a decrease in economic activity and an increase in poverty and social inequality. This sparked social unrest and protests, which were met with repression by the government. The economic crisis also had a significant impact on the country's political stability, leading to several changes in government and the eventual default on the country's debt.

This case highlights the complex and often contentious nature of economic intervention. While it can be an effective tool for addressing economic imbalances and promoting stability, it can also have unintended consequences and exacerbate existing social and political issues. As such, it is crucial for great powers to carefully consider the potential outcomes and implications of their economic interventions.





### Subsection: 3.1c Military Intervention

Military intervention is a form of external intervention that involves the use of military force to address conflicts and issues between nations. It can take various forms, including direct military intervention, indirect military intervention, and humanitarian intervention.

Direct military intervention involves the deployment of military forces into a foreign territory with the intention of achieving a specific objective. This can include actions such as invasion, occupation, and regime change. Direct military intervention is often used as a last resort when other forms of intervention have failed or are deemed insufficient.

Indirect military intervention, on the other hand, involves supporting or aiding a third party in a conflict. This can include providing military equipment, training, or financial support. Indirect military intervention is often used to achieve strategic objectives without directly engaging in the conflict.

Humanitarian intervention is a form of military intervention that is aimed at protecting civilians from violence or human rights abuses. This can include actions such as establishing safe zones, providing humanitarian aid, and enforcing no-fly zones. Humanitarian intervention is often justified on the grounds of humanitarianism and the responsibility to protect (R2P).

One example of military intervention is the United States' involvement in the Syrian Civil War. In 2014, the US began conducting airstrikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in Syria, as well as providing military support to Syrian rebel groups. This intervention was aimed at combating ISIS and protecting civilians from their violence.

Another example is the NATO intervention in Libya in 2011, which was aimed at protecting civilians from violence by the regime of Muammar Gaddafi. This intervention involved airstrikes and the deployment of ground forces, and was ultimately successful in achieving regime change.

Military intervention can have significant consequences for both the intervening country and the country being intervened in. It can lead to the loss of lives, destruction of infrastructure, and the displacement of civilians. Therefore, it is important for great powers to carefully consider the potential consequences and justifications before engaging in military intervention.





### Subsection: 3.2a Northern Iraq and Somalia

#### 3.2a Northern Iraq

The intervention in Northern Iraq by the United States and its allies in 2003 is a prime example of external intervention and the use of force. The intervention was part of the larger War in Iraq, which was initiated by the US and its allies in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The US and its allies believed that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and had links to terrorist organizations, including Al-Qaeda.

The intervention in Northern Iraq was primarily aimed at overthrowing the regime of Saddam Hussein, who was believed to be a threat to regional and global stability. The US and its allies believed that by removing Hussein from power, they could prevent him from using his WMDs and disrupting the global oil market.

The intervention was carried out through a combination of military force and diplomatic efforts. The US and its allies, including the UK, Australia, and Poland, deployed troops to Iraq and launched a military campaign to overthrow Hussein's regime. Simultaneously, diplomatic efforts were made to garner support from the international community for the intervention.

The intervention was met with mixed reactions from the international community. While some countries, such as the UK and Australia, supported the intervention, others, such as France and Germany, opposed it. The intervention also faced criticism for its lack of a clear exit strategy and for the subsequent instability and violence in Iraq.

Despite the intervention's initial success in overthrowing Hussein's regime, it ultimately resulted in a prolonged and costly occupation of Iraq. The intervention also led to the rise of sectarian violence and the formation of terrorist groups, including ISIS, which further destabilized the region.

#### 3.2b Somalia

The intervention in Somalia by the US and its allies in 1992 is another example of external intervention and the use of force. The intervention was part of the larger Somali Civil War, which began in 1991 following the collapse of the Somali government. The US and its allies intervened in Somalia in response to the humanitarian crisis caused by the civil war and to prevent the spread of terrorism in the region.

The intervention was primarily aimed at providing humanitarian aid and establishing a stable government in Somalia. The US and its allies deployed troops to Somalia and worked with local warlords to establish a transitional government. The intervention also involved military operations to combat terrorist groups, including Al-Qaeda, which had taken advantage of the chaos in Somalia to establish a base of operations.

The intervention faced significant challenges, including resistance from local warlords and the difficulty of providing aid in a war-torn country. Despite these challenges, the intervention was largely successful in providing humanitarian aid and establishing a transitional government. However, it also faced criticism for its high cost and the subsequent instability in Somalia.

In conclusion, the interventions in Northern Iraq and Somalia demonstrate the complexities and challenges of external intervention and the use of force. While these interventions were aimed at achieving specific objectives, they also faced significant challenges and criticism. These case studies provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and limitations of external intervention in addressing conflicts and crises.

### Subsection: 5.1b Early Warning Systems

Early warning systems play a crucial role in the decision-making process of great powers. These systems are designed to detect potential conflicts or crises before they escalate, providing valuable time for preventive diplomacy to be implemented. In this section, we will explore the various types of early warning systems and their effectiveness in preventing conflicts.

#### Types of Early Warning Systems

There are several types of early warning systems that can be used by great powers to detect potential conflicts. These include:

- Intelligence gathering and analysis: This involves collecting and analyzing information from various sources, such as satellite imagery, human intelligence, and media reports. This information is then used to identify potential conflicts or crises before they escalate.
- Monitoring and warning systems: These systems use sensors and other technologies to monitor potential conflict areas and provide early warning of any potential threats. This can include monitoring social media and other online platforms for signs of unrest or conflict.
- Early warning radars, satellites, and Airborne early warning and control: These systems are used for detecting potential missile attacks and can provide valuable information for early warning and preventive diplomacy.

#### Effectiveness of Early Warning Systems

The effectiveness of early warning systems can vary greatly depending on the type of system and the quality of information it provides. For example, intelligence gathering and analysis can be hindered by factors such as limited access to information or misinformation. Similarly, monitoring and warning systems can be affected by technical issues or limitations in their ability to detect potential threats.

Despite these challenges, early warning systems have proven to be valuable tools in preventing conflicts. For instance, the use of early warning systems in the Balkans in the 1990s helped to identify potential conflicts and allowed for preventive diplomacy to be implemented, preventing a larger-scale conflict.

#### Challenges and Limitations of Early Warning Systems

While early warning systems can be effective, they also face several challenges and limitations. One of the main challenges is the potential for misinformation or limited access to information. This can hinder the effectiveness of intelligence gathering and analysis, as well as monitoring and warning systems.

Additionally, early warning systems can also face limitations in their ability to detect potential threats. This can be due to factors such as the complexity of social and political dynamics or the difficulty in predicting human behavior.

#### Ethical Considerations

The use of early warning systems also raises ethical concerns, particularly in regards to the potential for humanitarian consequences. Great powers must carefully consider the potential impact of their actions in response to early warning systems, as well as the potential for false alarms or misinformation.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, early warning systems play a crucial role in the decision-making process of great powers. These systems can provide valuable information for preventive diplomacy and have proven to be effective in preventing conflicts. However, they also face challenges and limitations that must be carefully considered in their implementation and use.

### Section: 5.2 Preventive Diplomacy:

Preventive diplomacy is a crucial aspect of international relations, as it aims to prevent conflicts from escalating and causing further harm to both the involved parties and the international community as a whole. In this section, we will explore the definition and importance of preventive diplomacy, as well as its role in great power military intervention.

#### 5.2a Definition and Importance

Preventive diplomacy can be defined as the use of diplomatic efforts to prevent conflicts from escalating and causing further harm. It involves early warning systems, such as intelligence gathering and analysis, to identify potential flashpoints and implement preventive measures before a conflict escalates. This can include diplomatic efforts, economic sanctions, and military deployments.

The importance of preventive diplomacy cannot be overstated. It is a cost-effective and non-violent way of addressing conflicts and preventing them from escalating into full-blown wars. By implementing preventive diplomacy measures, great powers can prevent the loss of lives, destruction of property, and further instability in the region. It also allows for a more controlled and targeted response, rather than a full-scale military intervention which can have unintended consequences and further destabilize the region.

Moreover, preventive diplomacy is a crucial aspect of great power military intervention. It allows for a more proactive approach to addressing conflicts, rather than waiting for a crisis to occur and then reacting with a military intervention. By implementing preventive diplomacy measures, great powers can prevent conflicts from escalating and potentially avoid the need for military intervention altogether.

#### 5.2b Preventive Diplomacy in Practice

To better understand the role of preventive diplomacy in great power military intervention, let us examine some case studies.

## Chapter: Great Power Military Intervention: A Comprehensive Study

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the topic of great power military intervention and its impact on international law. Military intervention is a controversial and complex issue that has been a subject of debate and discussion for centuries. It involves the use of military force by one country to intervene in the affairs of another country, often with the intention of achieving a specific political, economic, or humanitarian goal. Great powers, also known as major powers, are countries that possess significant economic, political, and military influence on a global scale. Their actions and decisions have a significant impact on the international community.

The use of military intervention by great powers has been a topic of great interest and controversy. It has been used as a tool for achieving political and strategic objectives, as well as for humanitarian purposes. However, the use of military intervention has also been a source of conflict and controversy, particularly in regards to international law. International law is a set of rules and principles that govern the behavior of states in the international community. It is designed to regulate the actions of states and ensure the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.

In this chapter, we will explore the various aspects of great power military intervention and its impact on international law. We will examine the historical context of military intervention, its evolution over time, and the current state of international law in regards to military intervention. We will also discuss the different types of military intervention, such as humanitarian intervention and regime change, and their legal implications. Additionally, we will analyze the role of international organizations, such as the United Nations, in regulating and overseeing military intervention.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of great power military intervention and its impact on international law. By examining the historical, legal, and political aspects of military intervention, we hope to shed light on this complex and controversial topic and contribute to the ongoing discussions and debates surrounding it. 


## Chapter 7: Great Power Military Intervention and International Law:




### Subsection: 6.2a Northern Iraq and Somalia

In this section, we will examine two case studies of great power military intervention: Northern Iraq and Somalia. These cases will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and consequences of intervention by major global powers.

#### 6.2a Northern Iraq

The intervention in Northern Iraq, specifically the Kurdish region, has been a topic of interest for many years. The Kurdish people, who make up a significant portion of the population in this region, have been fighting for autonomy and self-determination since the 1920s. The intervention in Northern Iraq has been a complex and multifaceted issue, involving various global powers and local actors.

The intervention in Northern Iraq can be traced back to the 1990s, when the United States and its allies intervened in the region as part of the Gulf War. The intervention was primarily aimed at protecting the Kurds from Saddam Hussein's regime, which had been persecuting them for years. The intervention resulted in the establishment of a safe haven for the Kurds, which provided them with a degree of autonomy and protection.

However, the intervention also had its drawbacks. The safe haven was not able to provide a long-term solution to the Kurdish issue, and the region continued to face instability and conflict. The intervention also led to the formation of Kurdish militias, which have been involved in various conflicts and human rights abuses.

#### Somalia

The intervention in Somalia, on the other hand, has been a more recent and ongoing issue. The country has been facing civil war and instability since the early 1990s, and has been a target for intervention by various global powers. The United States, in particular, has been involved in the region, primarily focusing on counterterrorism efforts.

The intervention in Somalia has been a controversial topic, with many arguing that it has been ineffective and has only led to further instability and human suffering. The intervention has also been criticized for its lack of a clear strategy and for not addressing the root causes of the conflict.

Despite these criticisms, the intervention in Somalia has also had some successes. The United States has been able to disrupt terrorist activities in the region, and has also provided humanitarian aid to the local population. However, the intervention has also resulted in civilian casualties and has raised concerns about the use of drone strikes.

In conclusion, the interventions in Northern Iraq and Somalia provide valuable case studies for understanding the complexities and consequences of great power military intervention. These cases highlight the need for careful consideration and planning when intervening in conflicts, and the importance of addressing the root causes of conflict. 


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the various aspects of great power military intervention through student presentations. We have seen how different countries and regions have been affected by these interventions, and the impact they have had on global politics. From the United States' intervention in Iraq to Russia's intervention in Syria, we have seen the complexities and consequences of these actions.

Through these presentations, we have also learned about the different perspectives and approaches to military intervention. Some argue that it is necessary for maintaining stability and protecting human rights, while others believe it is a violation of sovereignty and can lead to further instability. It is clear that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to military intervention, and each case must be carefully considered.

As we conclude this chapter, it is important to recognize the importance of understanding the history, motivations, and consequences of great power military intervention. By studying these interventions, we can gain valuable insights into the dynamics of global politics and work towards finding more effective and ethical solutions to conflicts.

### Exercises

### Subsection: 6.2b Rwanda and Darfur

The case studies of Rwanda and Darfur provide a deeper understanding of the complexities and consequences of great power military intervention. These two regions have been the site of numerous interventions by various global powers, with varying outcomes.

#### Rwanda

The intervention in Rwanda, particularly in the 1994 Rwandan genocide, has been a topic of great interest and debate. The genocide, which lasted for 100 days, resulted in the death of an estimated 800,000 people, primarily members of the Tutsi ethnic group. The intervention in Rwanda was primarily aimed at stopping the genocide and providing humanitarian aid to the survivors.

The intervention in Rwanda was a joint effort by the United Nations, the United States, and various other global powers. The intervention resulted in the deployment of peacekeeping forces, the establishment of safe zones, and the provision of humanitarian aid. However, the intervention was not without its challenges. The peacekeeping forces faced significant challenges in controlling the violence and protecting the civilian population. The intervention also led to the formation of various militias, which have been involved in ongoing conflicts in the region.

#### Darfur

The intervention in Darfur, Sudan, has been a more recent and ongoing issue. The region has been facing conflict since 2003, primarily between the Sudanese government and various rebel groups. The intervention in Darfur has been a complex and multifaceted issue, involving various global powers and local actors.

The intervention in Darfur has been primarily aimed at protecting the civilian population and providing humanitarian aid. The intervention has involved the deployment of peacekeeping forces, the establishment of safe zones, and the provision of humanitarian aid. However, the intervention has also faced significant challenges. The peacekeeping forces have faced difficulties in controlling the violence and protecting the civilian population. The intervention has also led to the formation of various militias, which have been involved in ongoing conflicts in the region.

The case studies of Rwanda and Darfur highlight the complexities and challenges of great power military intervention. They underscore the need for careful planning, coordination, and consideration of potential consequences before intervening in a conflict situation.

### Conclusion

### Subsection: 6.2c Balkans

The Balkans, a region in southeastern Europe, has been a site of significant military intervention by great powers throughout history. The region has been a focal point of power struggles and conflicts, with various global powers vying for control and influence.

#### Ottoman Empire

The Ottoman Empire, a major global power during the 16th and 17th centuries, exerted significant influence over the Balkans. The empire's expansion into the region led to the conversion of many Balkan Christians to Islam, a process known as Islamization. This conversion was often accompanied by the adoption of Turkish names, as seen in the case of the Albanian ruler Skanderbeg, who was given the name Iskender Bey upon his conversion.

The Ottoman Empire's control over the Balkans was not without resistance. The region saw numerous uprisings and rebellions, such as the First Serbian Uprising and the Greek War of Independence, which aimed to shake off Ottoman rule. These uprisings were often met with harsh reprisals from the empire, as seen in the case of the Bosnian uprising of 1875, which led to the massacre of 10,000 Bosniaks in Herzegovina.

#### World War I

The Balkans also played a significant role in World War I. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary, which sparked the war, occurred in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The war led to the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire and the creation of new states in the Balkans, including Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia.

The war also saw significant military intervention by great powers. The Allies, led by Britain, France, and Russia, fought against the Central Powers, led by Germany and Austria-Hungary. The war resulted in the loss of millions of lives and significant damage to the region's infrastructure.

#### Post-World War I

The aftermath of World War I saw continued military intervention in the Balkans. The Allies, particularly Britain and France, sought to establish a sphere of influence in the region. This led to the creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, later renamed Yugoslavia, which was seen as a bulwark against Austrian and Hungarian influence.

However, the creation of Yugoslavia led to significant ethnic tensions and conflicts, particularly between the Serbs and Croats. These tensions eventually led to the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, resulting in the Bosnian War and the Kosovo War.

In conclusion, the Balkans have been a site of significant military intervention by great powers throughout history. The region's complex ethnic and political dynamics have made it a focal point of power struggles and conflicts, with far-reaching consequences for the region and the world.

### Subsection: 6.2d Iraq

The country of Iraq, located in the Middle East, has been a site of significant military intervention by great powers throughout history. The region has been a focal point of power struggles and conflicts, with various global powers vying for control and influence.

#### Ancient Iraq

The history of Iraq dates back to ancient times, with the region being home to some of the earliest civilizations. The land was known as Mesopotamia, and it was here that the first cities, writing, and organized religion emerged. The region was also a site of frequent conflict between various city-states and empires, including the Sumerians, Akkadians, and Babylonians.

#### Modern Iraq

In modern times, Iraq has been a site of significant military intervention by great powers. The country was under British control from 1918 to 1932, and it became an independent state in 1932. However, the country has been plagued by political instability and conflict, with multiple coups and invasions.

One of the most significant interventions in modern Iraq was the 2003 invasion by the United States and its allies. The invasion, which was based on the belief that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, resulted in the overthrow of the regime of Saddam Hussein. However, no weapons of mass destruction were ever found, and the country has been embroiled in a prolonged period of political instability and conflict.

#### The Battle of Ramadi (2006)

The Battle of Ramadi, which took place in 2006 during the Iraq War, is a notable example of a military intervention in Iraq. The battle was part of the larger Battle of Al Anbar, which was a major offensive by the United States and its allies to gain control of the city of Ramadi.

The battle was significant in that it marked a shift in the US military's approach to the war in Iraq. Previously, the US had relied on a strategy of "shock and awe," using overwhelming force to quickly overthrow the regime. However, the insurgency in Iraq proved to be more resilient than expected, and the US was forced to adopt a more conventional approach.

The battle also highlighted the challenges of urban warfare and the importance of understanding the local population and culture. The US forces faced significant resistance from the local population, who were sympathetic to the insurgents. This led to a prolonged and costly battle, with the US ultimately gaining control of the city but at a high cost in terms of casualties and resources.

#### The Battle of Mosul (2016–17)

The Battle of Mosul, which took place in 2016–17, was another significant military intervention in Iraq. The battle was part of the larger campaign to retake the city of Mosul from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

The battle was notable for its length and complexity. It took over nine months for the US-led coalition to retake the city, and the battle involved multiple phases and changing tactics. The US and its allies faced significant challenges, including the need to avoid civilian casualties and the difficulty of operating in a densely populated urban area.

The battle also highlighted the importance of international cooperation and coordination in military interventions. The US-led coalition included forces from multiple countries, and the battle required careful coordination and communication to be successful.

In conclusion, Iraq has been a site of significant military intervention by great powers throughout history. The country's strategic location and rich history have made it a focal point of power struggles and conflicts. The battles of Ramadi and Mosul provide valuable case studies for understanding the challenges and complexities of military intervention in Iraq.

#### 7.1c Project Evaluation

After a project has been implemented, it is important to evaluate its effectiveness and impact. This involves assessing the project's performance against its objectives and identifying areas for improvement. Project evaluation is a crucial step in the project management process, as it allows for the identification of successes and failures, and provides valuable insights for future interventions.

One of the key aspects of project evaluation is the use of evaluation criteria. These criteria are used to assess the project's performance and determine its overall success. In the context of great power military intervention, evaluation criteria may include measures of effectiveness, such as the achievement of objectives, cost-effectiveness, and impact on local populations.

The Common Criteria (CC) is a widely used standard for evaluating the security features of computer systems and products. It is used by governments and organizations around the world to ensure the security and reliability of their systems. The CC evaluation process also tries to establish the level of confidence that may be placed in the product's security features through quality assurance processes.

The CC evaluation process involves the use of Protection Profiles (PPs) and Evaluation Assurance Levels (EALs). PPs are documents that define the security requirements for a product or system, while EALs are used to evaluate the level of confidence in the product's security features. The CC evaluation process also takes into account the implementation of the product, including its design, development, and testing.

In recent years, there has been a shift towards using PPs as the primary means of evaluating products under the CC. This is due to the fact that PPs provide a more comprehensive and detailed evaluation of a product's security features, compared to EALs. Additionally, PPs are often tailored to specific products or systems, making them more relevant and applicable.

However, there are still some national evaluation schemes that continue to use EAL-based evaluations. These schemes may require products to claim strict conformance with an approved PP before being evaluated. This is in line with the overall goal of the CC, which is to provide a standardized and reliable evaluation process for computer systems and products.

In conclusion, project evaluation is a crucial step in the project management process, especially in the context of great power military intervention. The use of evaluation criteria, such as the Common Criteria, allows for a comprehensive and standardized evaluation of products and systems. As technology continues to advance, it is important for evaluation criteria to evolve and adapt to meet the changing needs and requirements of interventions.

## Chapter 8: Great Power Military Intervention: A Comprehensive Study




### Introduction

The use of military intervention by great powers has been a topic of great debate and controversy throughout history. It is a complex issue that involves ethical considerations, political motivations, and the potential for both positive and negative outcomes. In this chapter, we will delve into the ethics of intervention, examining the various ethical frameworks and principles that guide the decision-making process of great powers when it comes to military intervention.

We will begin by defining what intervention is and the different types of intervention that can be used by great powers. We will then explore the ethical considerations that come into play when deciding whether to intervene in a conflict or not. This will include examining the principles of just war theory, which provides a framework for evaluating the morality of intervention.

Next, we will discuss the role of international law in guiding the ethics of intervention. This will involve examining the principles of international law, such as the principle of non-intervention, and how they are applied in practice. We will also explore the role of international organizations, such as the United Nations, in regulating and overseeing intervention by great powers.

Finally, we will examine case studies of past interventions by great powers, such as the United States' intervention in Iraq and Russia's intervention in Syria. These case studies will provide real-world examples to illustrate the ethical dilemmas and challenges faced by great powers when deciding whether to intervene in a conflict.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the ethics of intervention and the complex factors that influence the decision-making process of great powers. This knowledge will be essential in understanding the role of military intervention in shaping global conflicts and power dynamics.




### Subsection: 8.1a Humanitarian Intervention

Humanitarian intervention is a form of intervention that is aimed at protecting civilians from violence and human rights abuses. It is often seen as a last resort when other diplomatic efforts have failed to address the situation. In this subsection, we will explore the concept of humanitarian intervention and its ethical implications.

#### The Concept of Humanitarian Intervention

Humanitarian intervention is a complex and controversial topic that has been debated by scholars and policymakers for decades. It is often seen as a form of intervention that is justified by humanitarian concerns, rather than political or strategic interests. However, the line between humanitarian intervention and other forms of intervention can be blurred, and there are often competing interests at play.

One of the key debates surrounding humanitarian intervention is the concept of responsibility to protect (R2P). R2P is a principle that was first introduced in 2005 and has since been used to justify interventions in Libya, Syria, and other countries. It states that states have a responsibility to protect their citizens from violence and human rights abuses, and if they are unable or unwilling to do so, other states have a responsibility to intervene.

#### Ethical Considerations of Humanitarian Intervention

The ethics of humanitarian intervention are complex and multifaceted. On one hand, there is a moral obligation to protect innocent civilians from violence and human rights abuses. On the other hand, there are concerns about the potential negative consequences of intervention, such as the loss of lives and resources, as well as the potential for unintended consequences.

One ethical framework that has been used to evaluate humanitarian intervention is just war theory. Just war theory provides a set of principles for determining the morality of a war or intervention. These principles include the just cause principle, which states that intervention must be motivated by a just cause, such as protecting innocent civilians. Other principles include the proportionality principle, which states that the harm caused by intervention must not outweigh the potential benefits, and the last resort principle, which states that intervention should only be used as a last resort after all other diplomatic efforts have failed.

#### The Role of International Law in Humanitarian Intervention

International law plays a crucial role in regulating humanitarian intervention. The United Nations Charter, in particular, has been used to justify interventions in cases of genocide, war crimes, and other human rights violations. However, there are also limitations and controversies surrounding the use of international law in humanitarian intervention.

One limitation is the lack of a clear legal framework for humanitarian intervention. The UN Charter does not specifically mention humanitarian intervention, and there is no international law that explicitly allows for it. This has led to debates over the legality of certain interventions and the interpretation of international law.

Another controversy is the role of the Security Council in authorizing interventions. The Security Council has the power to authorize interventions under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, but there have been instances where the Council has failed to act in cases of humanitarian crises. This has raised questions about the effectiveness of international law in protecting civilians.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, humanitarian intervention is a complex and controversial topic that requires careful consideration of ethical and legal principles. While there is a moral obligation to protect innocent civilians, there are also concerns about the potential negative consequences of intervention. International law plays a crucial role in regulating humanitarian intervention, but there are also limitations and controversies surrounding its application. As great powers continue to intervene in conflicts around the world, it is important to carefully evaluate the ethical implications of these interventions and strive for a more just and equitable approach to protecting civilians.





### Subsection: 8.1b Just War Theory

Just war theory is a philosophical framework that has been used to evaluate the morality of war and intervention. It originated in ancient Greece and Rome, and has been further developed by Christian thinkers such as Augustine of Hippo. Just war theory provides a set of principles for determining the morality of a war or intervention, and has been used to justify humanitarian intervention in certain cases.

#### The Principles of Just War Theory

Just war theory is based on the principle of jus ad bellum, which refers to the justification for going to war. This principle states that a war can only be justified if it is fought for a just cause, with a just intention, and with a reasonable chance of success. The just cause principle requires that the war be fought for a legitimate reason, such as self-defense or the protection of innocent civilians. The just intention principle states that the war must be fought with the intention of restoring peace and justice, rather than for personal or political gain. The reasonable chance of success principle requires that there be a realistic chance of achieving the just cause and intention.

#### The Ethics of Humanitarian Intervention

Just war theory has been used to justify humanitarian intervention in cases where there is a clear and present danger to innocent civilians. In these cases, the principle of jus ad bellum can be applied to determine if the intervention is justified. If the intervention meets the criteria of a just cause, just intention, and reasonable chance of success, then it can be considered a just war.

However, just war theory also recognizes the potential for unintended consequences and the need for proportionality in the use of force. This means that even if a war meets the criteria of jus ad bellum, it may still be unjust if the potential consequences are disproportionate to the just cause. This principle has been used to criticize certain interventions, such as the invasion of Iraq in 2003, which was seen as disproportionate to the just cause of removing weapons of mass destruction.

#### Conclusion

Just war theory provides a useful framework for evaluating the ethics of humanitarian intervention. While it is not without its flaws and limitations, it provides a set of principles that can help guide decision-making in complex and difficult situations. As such, it remains an important tool for understanding and evaluating the ethics of intervention.





### Subsection: 8.1c Responsibility to Protect

The Responsibility to Protect (R2P) is a principle that was first introduced in 2005 at the United Nations World Summit. It is a response to the failure of the international community to intervene in the Rwandan genocide of 1994, and is a recognition of the responsibility of states to protect their citizens from mass atrocities. The principle is based on the idea that sovereignty is not an absolute right, and that the international community has a responsibility to protect human rights and prevent genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity.

#### The Three Pillars of R2P

The Responsibility to Protect consists of three important and mutually-reinforcing pillars, as articulated in the 2009 Report of the Secretary-General on the issue. These pillars are:

1. The responsibility of states to protect their citizens from mass atrocities.
2. The responsibility of the international community to assist states in meeting their responsibility to protect.
3. The responsibility of the international community to take collective action, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, when a state is unable or unwilling to protect its citizens from mass atrocities.

These pillars build off the principles of sovereignty, non-intervention, and the responsibility to protect, as outlined in the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document. The principle of sovereignty is recognized, but is not absolute. The principle of non-intervention is also recognized, but is not absolute. The principle of the responsibility to protect is emphasized, and is seen as a way to strengthen sovereignty, not weaken it.

#### The Responsibility to Protect and Humanitarian Intervention

The Responsibility to Protect differs from humanitarian intervention in four important ways. First, humanitarian intervention only refers to the use of military force, whereas R2P is first and foremost a preventive principle that emphasizes a range of measures to stem the risk of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity before the crimes are threatened or occur. The use of force may only be carried out as a measure of last resort, when all other non-coercive measures have failed, and only when it is authorized by the United Nations Security Council.

Second, humanitarian intervention is often seen as a unilateral action, while R2P is a collective responsibility of the international community. This means that the responsibility to protect is not just the responsibility of one state, but of the entire international community.

Third, humanitarian intervention is often seen as a last resort, while R2P is seen as a preventive measure. This means that the responsibility to protect is not just about responding to mass atrocities, but also about preventing them from occurring in the first place.

Finally, humanitarian intervention is often seen as a temporary measure, while R2P is seen as a long-term commitment. This means that the responsibility to protect is not just about intervening in a crisis, but also about helping states to build their capacity to protect their citizens in the long term.

In conclusion, the Responsibility to Protect is a crucial principle in the ethics of intervention. It recognizes the responsibility of states to protect their citizens from mass atrocities, the responsibility of the international community to assist states in meeting this responsibility, and the responsibility of the international community to take collective action when a state is unable or unwilling to protect its citizens. It also emphasizes the importance of preventive measures, collective responsibility, and long-term commitment in the ethics of intervention. 





### Subsection: 8.2a Sovereignty vs. Human Rights

The concept of sovereignty has been a cornerstone of international law and relations for centuries. It is the principle that a state has the right to govern itself without external interference. However, with the rise of human rights as a global concern, the concept of sovereignty has come under scrutiny. The question of whether a state's sovereignty should take precedence over human rights has been a contentious issue in the realm of intervention.

#### Sovereignty as a Legal Concept

Sovereignty, as a legal concept, is often categorized into two types: de jure and de facto. De jure sovereignty refers to the legal right to exercise control over a territory. This is typically established through international recognition and agreements. De facto sovereignty, on the other hand, refers to the practical exercise of control over a territory, regardless of any legal recognition. This can be seen in situations where a state may not have formal recognition, but is able to exert control over a territory.

#### Sovereignty and Independence

The concept of sovereignty is often intertwined with the concept of independence. However, it is important to note that sovereignty can be transferred as a legal right, while independence cannot. A state can achieve de facto independence long after acquiring sovereignty, as seen in the cases of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. Additionally, independence can be suspended when an entire region becomes subject to an occupation, as seen in the case of Iraq in the Iraq War of 2003.

#### Sovereignty and Human Rights

The concept of sovereignty has been a major factor in the debate over intervention. The principle of non-intervention, which is often seen as a manifestation of sovereignty, has been used to justify inaction in the face of human rights abuses. However, the principle of the responsibility to protect, as outlined in the Responsibility to Protect (R2P), recognizes that sovereignty is not an absolute right and that the international community has a responsibility to protect human rights.

#### Sovereignty and the Responsibility to Protect

The R2P principle builds off the principles of sovereignty, non-intervention, and the responsibility to protect, as outlined in the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document. It recognizes that sovereignty is not an absolute right and that the international community has a responsibility to protect human rights. The R2P principle also emphasizes the responsibility of states to protect their citizens from mass atrocities, the responsibility of the international community to assist states in meeting this responsibility, and the responsibility of the international community to take collective action when a state is unable or unwilling to protect its citizens.

#### Sovereignty and Humanitarian Intervention

The R2P principle differs from humanitarian intervention in four important ways. First, humanitarian intervention only refers to the use of military force, while R2P is a preventive principle that emphasizes a range of measures to protect human rights. Second, humanitarian intervention is often seen as a last resort, while R2P emphasizes the importance of prevention and early intervention. Third, humanitarian intervention is often seen as a unilateral action, while R2P emphasizes the importance of collective action and international cooperation. Finally, humanitarian intervention is often seen as a temporary measure, while R2P emphasizes the importance of long-term solutions to address the root causes of human rights abuses.

In conclusion, the concept of sovereignty has been a major factor in the debate over intervention. While it is important to respect a state's sovereignty, it is also important to recognize that sovereignty is not an absolute right and that the international community has a responsibility to protect human rights. The R2P principle provides a framework for balancing these competing interests and for addressing the ethical dilemmas that arise in the realm of intervention.




### Subsection: 8.2b Selectivity of Intervention

The selectivity of intervention is a crucial ethical consideration in the use of military force. It refers to the decision of whether to intervene in a particular situation, and if so, how extensively. This decision is often influenced by a variety of factors, including the nature of the conflict, the potential consequences of intervention, and the interests of the intervening state.

#### The Ethics of Selectivity

The selectivity of intervention raises a number of ethical questions. One of the most fundamental is whether it is ever ethical to intervene in the affairs of another state. This question is often tied to the concept of sovereignty, as discussed in the previous section. The principle of non-intervention, which is often seen as a manifestation of sovereignty, has been used to justify inaction in the face of human rights abuses. However, the principle of the responsibility to protect, as outlined in the Responsibility to Protect (R2P), recognizes that sovereignty is not an absolute right, and that states have a responsibility to protect their citizens from mass atrocities.

Another important ethical consideration is the selectivity of intervention. This refers to the decision of whether to intervene in a particular situation, and if so, how extensively. This decision is often influenced by a variety of factors, including the nature of the conflict, the potential consequences of intervention, and the interests of the intervening state. For example, a state may choose to intervene in a conflict that directly affects its own interests, but not in a conflict that does not directly impact it. This selectivity can raise questions about fairness and consistency, as well as about the effectiveness of intervention.

#### The Ethics of Selectivity in Practice

The ethics of selectivity in intervention can be seen in a variety of historical and contemporary cases. For example, the United States' intervention in Iraq in 2003 has been criticized for its selectivity, as it was seen as being motivated primarily by the US's own interests, rather than a genuine concern for the welfare of the Iraqi people. On the other hand, the US's intervention in Libya in 2011, under the auspices of the R2P, has been seen as a more ethical example of selectivity, as it was motivated by a genuine concern for the protection of civilians.

In conclusion, the selectivity of intervention is a complex ethical issue that requires careful consideration. It involves a balance between the principles of non-intervention and the responsibility to protect, as well as a consideration of the interests of the intervening state. It is a crucial aspect of the ethics of intervention, and one that will continue to be debated in the future.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the complex and often contentious topic of the ethics of intervention by great powers. We have explored the various ethical frameworks that can be used to evaluate such interventions, including utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics. We have also examined the role of international law and the responsibility to protect in guiding these interventions.

The chapter has highlighted the importance of considering the ethical implications of intervention, both for the intervening power and for the target of the intervention. It has underscored the need for a careful and nuanced approach, taking into account the potential consequences of intervention, the legitimacy of the intervention, and the ethical principles that guide the intervention.

The chapter has also emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability in the conduct of interventions. It has argued that these are not only ethical considerations, but also contribute to the effectiveness and legitimacy of interventions.

In conclusion, the ethics of intervention is a complex and multifaceted topic that requires careful consideration and a commitment to ethical principles. It is a topic that will continue to be of great importance in the future, as great powers continue to intervene in the affairs of other states.

## Chapter: Chapter 9: The Future of Intervention

### Introduction

As we delve into the ninth chapter of "Great Power Military Intervention: A Comprehensive Study", we find ourselves at a critical juncture. The future of intervention, a topic that is as complex and uncertain as it is crucial, lies ahead of us. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the future trends and developments in the realm of intervention by great powers.

The future of intervention is a topic that is fraught with both challenges and opportunities. As we have seen in the previous chapters, intervention by great powers has been a contentious issue, often met with resistance and criticism. However, it has also been a necessary tool in certain situations, helping to prevent or mitigate conflicts and crises. As we move forward, it is important to understand how these dynamics will evolve and what implications they will have for the future.

In this chapter, we will explore various aspects of the future of intervention, including the potential changes in the nature and scope of intervention, the role of international law and norms, and the impact of technological advancements. We will also discuss the potential challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, and how these might shape the future of intervention.

As we navigate through this chapter, it is important to remember that the future of intervention is not a fixed entity. It is a dynamic and evolving landscape, shaped by a multitude of factors. Our goal is not to predict the future, but to provide a comprehensive analysis of the potential trends and developments, and to stimulate thought and discussion about the future of intervention.

In conclusion, the future of intervention is a topic that is both complex and crucial. It is a topic that requires a deep understanding of the past and present, as well as a keen eye for the future. As we delve into this chapter, we invite you to join us on this journey of exploration and discovery.




### Subsection: 8.2c Unintended Consequences

The concept of unintended consequences is a crucial aspect of the ethics of intervention. Unintended consequences refer to the unforeseen and often undesirable outcomes that can result from military intervention. These consequences can range from the loss of civilian lives to the exacerbation of existing conflicts.

#### The Ethics of Unintended Consequences

The ethics of unintended consequences in intervention are complex and multifaceted. On one hand, it can be argued that the potential for unintended consequences should not deter intervention in cases where human rights are being violated or where there is a clear and present danger to international peace and security. The responsibility to protect, as outlined in the Responsibility to Protect (R2P), recognizes this principle.

On the other hand, the potential for unintended consequences should also be a major consideration in the decision to intervene. This is because unintended consequences can often be difficult to predict and can lead to further harm and instability. Therefore, it is important for states to carefully consider the potential unintended consequences of intervention before deciding to intervene.

#### Unintended Consequences in Practice

The concept of unintended consequences can be seen in a variety of historical and contemporary cases. For example, the United States' intervention in Iraq in 2003 was intended to remove Saddam Hussein's regime and promote democracy in the region. However, the intervention resulted in a prolonged and costly occupation, the rise of sectarian violence, and the destabilization of the region. These unintended consequences have had far-reaching effects, including the rise of ISIS and the ongoing Syrian civil war.

Another example is the NATO intervention in Libya in 2011, which was intended to protect civilians from the violence of the Gaddafi regime. However, the intervention resulted in a prolonged conflict and the eventual collapse of the Gaddafi regime, leading to a power vacuum and ongoing instability in the country.

These cases highlight the importance of considering unintended consequences in the decision to intervene. They also underscore the need for careful planning and consideration of potential outcomes before intervention.




### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the complex and often controversial topic of the ethics of intervention by great powers. We have examined the various ethical frameworks that can be used to evaluate the morality of intervention, including utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics. We have also discussed the role of international law and the responsibility to protect in shaping the ethical considerations of intervention.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to evaluating the ethics of intervention. Each intervention must be examined on its own merits, taking into account the specific circumstances and consequences. However, it is important for policymakers and military leaders to have a strong understanding of these ethical frameworks and their implications in order to make informed decisions about intervention.

Another important aspect to consider is the potential unintended consequences of intervention. While intervention may be necessary in certain situations, it is crucial to carefully consider the potential long-term effects and unintended consequences. This requires a deep understanding of the cultural, political, and social dynamics at play in the intervention.

In conclusion, the ethics of intervention is a complex and multifaceted topic that requires careful consideration and evaluation. It is our hope that this chapter has provided a comprehensive overview of the key ethical considerations and frameworks that can aid in this evaluation.

## Chapter: Great Power Military Intervention: A Comprehensive Study

### Introduction

In today's globalized world, the use of military force has become a common occurrence in international relations. Great powers, such as the United States, Russia, and China, have been involved in numerous military interventions around the world. These interventions have been met with both support and criticism from various stakeholders. In this chapter, we will delve into the topic of great power military intervention and its impact on international law.

The use of military force has been a contentious issue in international law for centuries. The Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928, also known as the General Treaty for the Renunciation of War, was a significant step towards regulating the use of military force. This pact was signed by 62 states, including the United States and France, and aimed to prohibit the use of war as an instrument of national policy. However, despite this agreement, the use of military force has continued to be a major issue in international relations.

In this chapter, we will explore the various aspects of great power military intervention and its impact on international law. We will examine the historical context of military intervention, the legal framework surrounding it, and the role of international organizations in regulating it. Additionally, we will also discuss the ethical considerations and implications of great power military intervention.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of great power military intervention and its impact on international law. By examining the various aspects of this topic, we hope to shed light on the complex and often controversial issue of military intervention and its role in shaping the global political landscape.

### Subsection: 9.1b UN Peacekeeping Missions

The United Nations has been involved in numerous peacekeeping missions since its inception in 1945. These missions are aimed at maintaining international peace and security, protecting human rights, and promoting economic and social development. The UN peacekeeping missions are carried out by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and are funded by member states.

The UN peacekeeping missions are governed by the principles of consent, impartiality, and the use of minimum force. The consent of the host country is required for the deployment of UN peacekeeping forces. This is to ensure that the mission is carried out with the support and cooperation of the local population. The principle of impartiality requires UN peacekeepers to remain neutral and unbiased in their actions. This is to ensure that they are not seen as taking sides in the conflict. The use of minimum force is a crucial principle in UN peacekeeping missions. UN peacekeepers are only authorized to use force in self-defense or to protect civilians under imminent threat.

The UN peacekeeping missions have been deployed in various conflict situations around the world, including the Middle East, Africa, and the Balkans. These missions have been successful in maintaining peace and stability in many cases, but they have also faced challenges and criticisms.

One of the main challenges faced by UN peacekeeping missions is the lack of resources and support from member states. The UN relies heavily on voluntary contributions from member states for its peacekeeping operations. This can lead to unequal distribution of resources and can hinder the effectiveness of the missions.

Another challenge is the lack of clear mandate and objectives for the missions. In many cases, the UN peacekeeping missions are deployed without a clear understanding of their objectives and the means to achieve them. This can lead to confusion and ineffectiveness of the missions.

The UN peacekeeping missions have also faced criticism for their lack of accountability and human rights violations. In some cases, UN peacekeepers have been accused of sexual abuse and exploitation of local populations. This has damaged the reputation of the UN and has raised questions about the effectiveness of its peacekeeping missions.

Despite these challenges and criticisms, the UN peacekeeping missions continue to play a crucial role in maintaining international peace and security. They provide a platform for diplomatic efforts and serve as a bridge between conflicting parties. The UN peacekeeping missions also provide a means for the international community to address conflicts and promote stability in troubled regions.

In the next section, we will explore the role of international organizations in great power military intervention, specifically focusing on the United Nations. We will examine the various factors that influence their involvement, such as political ideologies, economic interests, and humanitarian concerns. Additionally, we will also discuss the impact of their actions on the outcome of interventions and the long-term effects on the affected regions.





### Subsection: 9.1c Case Studies

In this section, we will examine some case studies of UN peacekeeping missions to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and successes faced by these missions.

#### Case Study 1: The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)

The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was deployed in Lebanon in 1978 to maintain peace and stability in the region. The mission was initially deployed for a period of six months, but it has been extended multiple times due to the ongoing conflict in the region.

One of the main challenges faced by UNIFIL is the lack of support from the local population. The Lebanese government has been hesitant to provide full support to the UNIFIL forces, and the local population has been hostile towards them. This has hindered the effectiveness of the mission and has put UNIFIL forces at risk.

Another challenge faced by UNIFIL is the presence of armed groups in the region. These groups have been involved in various conflicts and have been a source of instability in the region. UNIFIL forces have been deployed to monitor and maintain peace in these areas, but their presence has been met with resistance from these groups.

Despite these challenges, UNIFIL has been successful in maintaining peace and stability in Lebanon. The mission has been able to prevent further escalation of the conflict and has helped to create a safe and secure environment for the local population.

#### Case Study 2: The United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA)

The United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) was deployed in 2014 to maintain peace and stability in the country. The mission was deployed in response to the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in the country.

One of the main challenges faced by MINUSCA is the lack of resources and support from the local population. The Central African Republic is one of the poorest countries in the world, and the local population has been struggling to meet their basic needs. This has made it difficult for MINUSCA to carry out its mission effectively.

Another challenge faced by MINUSCA is the presence of armed groups in the country. These groups have been involved in various conflicts and have been a source of instability in the region. MINUSCA forces have been deployed to monitor and maintain peace in these areas, but their presence has been met with resistance from these groups.

Despite these challenges, MINUSCA has been successful in maintaining peace and stability in the Central African Republic. The mission has been able to prevent further escalation of the conflict and has helped to create a safe and secure environment for the local population.

### Conclusion

These case studies highlight the challenges and successes faced by UN peacekeeping missions. The UN plays a crucial role in maintaining international peace and stability, and its peacekeeping missions are essential in achieving this goal. However, these missions face numerous challenges, including lack of resources, support, and clear mandate. It is important for the UN to address these challenges and continue to improve its peacekeeping operations to effectively maintain peace and stability around the world.





### Subsection: 9.2a NATO and Intervention

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is one of the most prominent regional organizations involved in military intervention. It is a military alliance between the United States and several European countries, with the primary goal of safeguarding the freedom and security of its member states. In this section, we will examine the role of NATO in intervention and its impact on international relations.

#### NATO's Role in Intervention

NATO has been involved in various interventions, both in Europe and beyond. One of the most notable interventions was the NATO intervention in Libya in 2011, which aimed to protect civilians from the oppressive regime of Muammar Gaddafi. The intervention was authorized by the United Nations Security Council and was led by NATO forces, primarily the United States, France, and the United Kingdom.

The intervention was successful in achieving its goal of protecting civilians, but it also faced criticism for its prolonged duration and the loss of civilian lives. The intervention also had a significant impact on the region, leading to the downfall of Gaddafi's regime and the subsequent civil war in Libya.

#### NATO's Impact on International Relations

NATO's interventions have had a significant impact on international relations, particularly in the Middle East. The intervention in Libya, for example, was seen as a violation of Libya's sovereignty by some countries, leading to strained relations between NATO and these countries.

Furthermore, NATO's intervention in Libya also raised concerns about the organization's role in international affairs. Some critics argue that NATO's intervention was motivated by its own interests, rather than solely protecting civilians. This has led to debates about the legitimacy and effectiveness of NATO's interventions.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, NATO plays a crucial role in intervention, particularly in Europe and the Middle East. Its interventions have had a significant impact on international relations, both positive and negative. As NATO continues to evolve and adapt to new challenges, its role in intervention will continue to be a topic of discussion and debate.





### Subsection: 9.2b African Union and Intervention

The African Union (AU) is a continental organization consisting of 55 member states in Africa. It was established in 2002 with the goal of promoting unity, peace, and development in Africa. The AU has been involved in various interventions in Africa, with a focus on promoting peace and stability.

#### AU's Role in Intervention

The AU has been involved in interventions in various African countries, including Sudan, Somalia, and Libya. One of the most notable interventions was the AU's involvement in the conflict in Darfur, Sudan. The AU deployed a peacekeeping mission, known as the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS), to the region in 2004. The mission aimed to protect civilians and facilitate humanitarian aid.

The AU's intervention in Darfur faced challenges, including limited resources and security concerns. However, it played a crucial role in providing humanitarian aid and protecting civilians in the region. The AU's intervention also paved the way for a larger UN peacekeeping mission, known as the United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID), which was deployed in 2007.

#### AU's Impact on International Relations

The AU's interventions have had a significant impact on international relations, particularly in Africa. The organization's involvement in conflicts has been seen as a positive step towards promoting peace and stability in the region. It has also been seen as a way for African countries to take ownership of their own conflicts and find solutions that are tailored to their specific needs.

However, the AU's interventions have also faced criticism. Some argue that the organization's limited resources and lack of military capabilities make its interventions ineffective. Others argue that the AU's interventions are often driven by political agendas and do not always prioritize the needs of the affected populations.

Despite these challenges, the AU's role in intervention has been crucial in promoting peace and stability in Africa. As the organization continues to grow and develop, its role in intervention is likely to become even more significant.





### Subsection: 9.2c ASEAN and Intervention

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a regional organization consisting of ten member states in Southeast Asia. It was established in 1967 with the goal of promoting economic growth, social progress, and cultural development in the region. The ASEAN has been involved in various interventions in the region, with a focus on promoting peace and stability.

#### ASEAN's Role in Intervention

The ASEAN has been involved in interventions in various Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. One of the most notable interventions was the ASEAN's involvement in the conflict in Mindanao, Philippines. The ASEAN deployed a peacekeeping mission, known as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), to the region in 1994. The mission aimed to address the root causes of the conflict and promote reconciliation between the conflicting parties.

The ASEAN's intervention in Mindanao faced challenges, including limited resources and security concerns. However, it played a crucial role in providing humanitarian aid and promoting reconciliation in the region. The ASEAN's intervention also paved the way for a larger UN peacekeeping mission, known as the United Nations Mission in the Philippines (UNMIP), which was deployed in 2000.

#### ASEAN's Impact on International Relations

The ASEAN's interventions have had a significant impact on international relations, particularly in Southeast Asia. The organization's involvement in conflicts has been seen as a positive step towards promoting peace and stability in the region. It has also been seen as a way for Southeast Asian countries to take ownership of their own conflicts and find solutions that are tailored to their specific needs.

However, the ASEAN's interventions have also faced criticism. Some argue that the organization's limited resources and lack of military capabilities make its interventions ineffective. Others argue that the ASEAN's interventions are often driven by political agendas and do not always prioritize the needs of the affected populations.

Despite these challenges, the ASEAN's role in intervention has been crucial in promoting peace and stability in Southeast Asia. Its interventions have also served as a model for other regional organizations, demonstrating the importance of regional cooperation in addressing conflicts and promoting peace.

# Great Power Military Intervention: A Comprehensive Study

## Chapter 10: The Effectiveness of Great Power Military Intervention




### Introduction

In the realm of international relations, the role of non-state actors has become increasingly significant. These actors, which include non-governmental organizations (NGOs), multinational corporations, and religious groups, often have their own agendas and interests that may align or conflict with those of great powers. In this chapter, we will delve into the complex and multifaceted role of non-state actors in great power military intervention.

Non-state actors have been instrumental in shaping the dynamics of international conflicts, particularly in the context of great power interventions. Their involvement can range from providing humanitarian aid and diplomatic support to engaging in combat operations. Their actions can significantly influence the outcome of interventions, and understanding their role is crucial for a comprehensive study of great power military intervention.

This chapter will explore the various ways in which non-state actors interact with great powers in the context of military intervention. We will examine their motivations, strategies, and the impact of their involvement on the outcome of interventions. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities that non-state actors present for great powers, and how these actors can be effectively engaged in interventions.

The role of non-state actors in great power military intervention is a complex and multifaceted topic that requires a comprehensive understanding of international relations, conflict dynamics, and the motivations and strategies of these actors. This chapter aims to provide a thorough analysis of this topic, shedding light on the intricate dynamics of great power interventions and the role of non-state actors therein. 




### Subsection: 10.1a Humanitarian NGOs

Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) play a crucial role in great power military intervention, particularly in the context of humanitarian crises. These organizations, which are often funded by governments or private donors, provide aid and assistance to populations affected by conflict or natural disasters. In this section, we will focus on one type of NGO - humanitarian NGOs - and their role in great power military intervention.

#### The Role of Humanitarian NGOs in Great Power Military Intervention

Humanitarian NGOs are non-profit organizations that provide aid and assistance to populations affected by conflict or natural disasters. They operate in areas where the government is unable or unwilling to provide adequate assistance. Humanitarian NGOs are often the first responders in a crisis, providing immediate relief and support to affected populations.

In the context of great power military intervention, humanitarian NGOs play a critical role. They provide much-needed aid and assistance to populations affected by the intervention, often operating in areas that are not accessible to government forces. Their presence can help alleviate the humanitarian crisis and improve the overall situation on the ground.

However, the involvement of humanitarian NGOs in great power military intervention is not without challenges. The presence of these organizations can be seen as a threat by both the intervening power and the target country. The intervening power may view the NGOs as potential competitors for influence and control, while the target country may see them as a threat to its sovereignty.

#### The Humanitarian Cluster System

To address these challenges, the United Nations has established the Humanitarian Cluster System. This system aims to improve the coordination and effectiveness of humanitarian NGOs in disaster-affected countries. The system is based on the concept of "clusters," which are groups of organizations responsible for specific sectors, such as health, nutrition, and water and sanitation.

The Humanitarian Cluster System has been criticized for its reliance on international humanitarian agencies and exclusion of local and national organizations from coordination activities. However, it has also been praised for its ability to improve coordination and avoid duplication of efforts.

#### The Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations

In addition to the Humanitarian Cluster System, humanitarian NGOs are also bound by the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations. This code outlines the principles and values that guide the actions of humanitarian NGOs, including impartiality, independence, and accountability.

The Code of Conduct also emphasizes the importance of coordination and cooperation among humanitarian NGOs. It states that "coordination is essential to ensure that the assistance provided by different organizations does not result in duplication of efforts or in the neglect of certain sectors or regions." This coordination is crucial in the context of great power military intervention, where the presence of multiple NGOs can lead to confusion and inefficiency if not properly coordinated.

In conclusion, humanitarian NGOs play a vital role in great power military intervention. Their presence can help alleviate the humanitarian crisis and improve the overall situation on the ground. However, their involvement also presents challenges that must be addressed through effective coordination and cooperation. The Humanitarian Cluster System and the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations provide frameworks for addressing these challenges and improving the effectiveness of humanitarian NGOs in great power military intervention.





### Subsection: 10.1b Advocacy NGOs

Advocacy non-governmental organizations (NGOs) play a crucial role in great power military intervention, particularly in the context of humanitarian crises. These organizations, which are often funded by governments or private donors, advocate for the rights and needs of specific groups or causes. In this section, we will focus on one type of advocacy NGO - human rights NGOs - and their role in great power military intervention.

#### The Role of Human Rights NGOs in Great Power Military Intervention

Human rights NGOs are non-profit organizations that advocate for the protection and promotion of human rights. They operate in areas where human rights are being violated, often in the context of great power military intervention. Human rights NGOs play a critical role in documenting human rights violations, advocating for justice and accountability, and providing support to affected communities.

In the context of great power military intervention, human rights NGOs play a crucial role. They provide a voice for affected populations, often documenting human rights violations that may go unnoticed by the intervening power. Their work can help shed light on the humanitarian crisis and inform the intervention strategy.

However, the involvement of human rights NGOs in great power military intervention is not without challenges. The presence of these organizations can be seen as a threat by both the intervening power and the target country. The intervening power may view the NGOs as potential competitors for influence and control, while the target country may see them as a threat to its sovereignty.

#### The Role of Advocacy NGOs in Great Power Military Intervention

Advocacy NGOs, in general, play a crucial role in great power military intervention. These organizations advocate for specific causes or groups, often working to influence policy and decision-making processes. In the context of military intervention, advocacy NGOs can play a critical role in shaping the intervention strategy and ensuring that the needs and rights of affected populations are considered.

For example, in the context of the Syrian Civil War, advocacy NGOs have been instrumental in advocating for the protection of civilians and the provision of humanitarian aid. Their work has helped bring attention to the ongoing humanitarian crisis and has influenced the intervention strategies of various great powers involved in the conflict.

However, the involvement of advocacy NGOs in great power military intervention is not without challenges. The presence of these organizations can be seen as a threat by both the intervening power and the target country. The intervening power may view the NGOs as potential competitors for influence and control, while the target country may see them as a threat to its sovereignty.

The presence of these organizations can be seen as a threat by both the intervening power and the target country. The intervening power may view the NGOs as potential competitors for influence and control, while the target country may see them as a threat to its sovereignty.




### Subsection: 10.1c Challenges and Critiques

The involvement of non-state actors, particularly non-governmental organizations (NGOs), in great power military intervention is not without its challenges and criticisms. While these organizations play a crucial role in documenting human rights violations and advocating for justice and accountability, their involvement can also lead to a number of challenges and criticisms.

#### Challenges Faced by NGOs in Great Power Military Intervention

One of the main challenges faced by NGOs in great power military intervention is the issue of access. Many NGOs operate in areas that are not easily accessible due to ongoing conflict or instability. This can make it difficult for these organizations to carry out their work effectively. For example, in the case of the Syrian Civil War, many NGOs have faced challenges in accessing areas affected by the conflict due to ongoing violence and instability.

Another challenge faced by NGOs is the issue of safety. Working in areas of conflict can be dangerous, and NGO workers are often at risk of violence and harm. This can make it difficult for these organizations to carry out their work, particularly in areas where there is a high level of violence and instability.

#### Criticisms of NGOs in Great Power Military Intervention

Despite their crucial role in great power military intervention, NGOs have also faced criticism. One of the main criticisms is the issue of bias. Some critics argue that NGOs may have a bias towards certain groups or causes, which can influence their reporting and advocacy efforts. This can lead to a lack of objectivity and can undermine their credibility.

Another criticism is the issue of accountability. Some critics argue that NGOs are not held accountable for their actions and decisions, particularly in the context of great power military intervention. This can lead to a lack of transparency and can raise questions about the effectiveness and impact of their work.

#### Conclusion

Despite these challenges and criticisms, NGOs continue to play a crucial role in great power military intervention. Their work is essential in documenting human rights violations and advocating for justice and accountability. However, it is important to address these challenges and criticisms in order to ensure the effectiveness and credibility of NGOs in these contexts.




### Subsection: 10.2a Definition and Role

Private military companies (PMCs) are private companies that provide military and security services to governments, international organizations, and other non-state actors. These companies are often hired by governments to provide services such as training, logistics, and security support in conflict zones. They are also hired by international organizations, such as the United Nations, to provide security and logistical support in peacekeeping missions.

The role of PMCs in great power military intervention is complex and multifaceted. On one hand, they are seen as a cost-effective and efficient alternative to traditional military deployment. By outsourcing certain military and security functions, governments can save resources and reduce the risk to their own soldiers. PMCs also bring specialized skills and expertise that may not be available within a government's own military.

On the other hand, the use of PMCs has also raised ethical and legal concerns. The use of private companies in military operations blurs the lines between combatants and civilians, and raises questions about accountability and liability. PMCs are not subject to the same rules of engagement and oversight as traditional military forces, and this can lead to abuses and human rights violations.

The role of PMCs in great power military intervention is also influenced by the concept of "asymmetric warfare". Asymmetric warfare refers to the use of unconventional tactics and strategies by non-state actors to achieve their objectives. PMCs, with their specialized skills and expertise, are often hired to counter these tactics and provide a more conventional military response.

In addition to their role in great power military intervention, PMCs also play a significant role in the training and equipping of local forces in conflict zones. This is particularly evident in the case of the Syrian Civil War, where PMCs have been hired by various parties to train and equip local forces. This role raises questions about the effectiveness and sustainability of these efforts, as well as the potential for these local forces to be used for future interventions.

Overall, the role of PMCs in great power military intervention is complex and multifaceted. While they offer certain advantages, their use also raises ethical and legal concerns that must be carefully considered. As the use of PMCs continues to grow, it is important to carefully examine their role and impact in order to ensure responsible and ethical military intervention.





### Subsection: 10.2b Ethical and Legal Issues

The use of private military companies (PMCs) in great power military intervention raises a number of ethical and legal issues that must be addressed. These issues are not only important for the United States, but also for other great powers such as Russia and China, who also employ PMCs in their military operations.

#### Ethical Issues

The ethical issues surrounding the use of PMCs are complex and multifaceted. On one hand, the use of PMCs can be seen as a violation of the principle of just war, which states that only legitimate authorities can declare war and use force. By outsourcing military operations to private companies, great powers may be circumventing this principle and engaging in unjust war.

Furthermore, the use of PMCs also raises concerns about the protection of human rights. PMCs are not subject to the same rules of engagement and oversight as traditional military forces, which can lead to abuses and human rights violations. This is particularly concerning in conflict zones where civilians are already at risk.

On the other hand, the use of PMCs can also be seen as a necessary evil in the face of complex and unconventional threats. PMCs bring specialized skills and expertise that may not be available within a government's own military, and their use can save resources and reduce the risk to soldiers. This argument aligns with the principle of proportionality, which states that the use of force must be proportional to the threat.

#### Legal Issues

The legal issues surrounding the use of PMCs are also complex and multifaceted. The use of PMCs raises questions about accountability and liability. PMCs are not subject to the same legal framework as traditional military forces, and this can make it difficult to hold them accountable for their actions. This is particularly concerning in cases where PMCs are hired by multiple parties, each with their own interests and objectives.

Furthermore, the use of PMCs also raises questions about the legality of their operations. In some cases, PMCs may be operating in areas where they are not authorized to do so, or they may be engaging in activities that are prohibited by international law. This can lead to legal challenges and potential legal consequences for both the PMCs and the great powers employing them.

#### Conclusion

The ethical and legal issues surrounding the use of PMCs in great power military intervention are complex and multifaceted. While the use of PMCs can bring benefits such as specialized skills and expertise, it also raises concerns about the protection of human rights and the legality of their operations. As the use of PMCs continues to grow, it is important for great powers to address these issues and establish clear guidelines and regulations to ensure the ethical and legal use of PMCs in military operations.





### Subsection: 10.2c Case Studies

To further understand the role of private military companies (PMCs) in great power military intervention, it is important to examine case studies of their use in different conflicts. By analyzing these case studies, we can gain a better understanding of the ethical and legal issues surrounding the use of PMCs and their impact on the outcome of interventions.

#### Case Study 1: Blackwater in Iraq

One of the most well-known and controversial case studies of PMCs is the use of the private security company Blackwater in Iraq. Blackwater was hired by the United States government to provide security services in Iraq, particularly in the dangerous city of Fallujah. In 2007, Blackwater employees were involved in a shooting incident in which 17 civilians were killed. This incident sparked international outrage and raised questions about the accountability and oversight of PMCs.

The use of Blackwater in Iraq also raises ethical concerns about the protection of human rights. The company's actions in Fallujah were seen as a violation of the principle of proportionality, as their use of force was deemed excessive and disproportionate to the threat. This case also highlights the legal issues surrounding the use of PMCs, as Blackwater employees were not held accountable for their actions due to the lack of a clear legal framework for PMCs.

#### Case Study 2: Academi in Afghanistan

Another case study of PMCs is the use of the company Academi (formerly known as Blackwater) in Afghanistan. Academi was hired by the United States government to provide training services to the Afghan National Army. However, in 2010, it was revealed that Academi employees had engaged in unauthorized and excessive use of force while training Afghan soldiers.

This case raises ethical concerns about the protection of human rights, as the actions of Academi employees were seen as a violation of the principle of proportionality. It also highlights the legal issues surrounding the use of PMCs, as Academi employees were not held accountable for their actions due to the lack of a clear legal framework for PMCs.

#### Case Study 3: G4S in the UK

A less well-known but equally important case study is the use of the private security company G4S in the UK. G4S was hired by the UK government to provide security services at the London Olympics in 2012. However, it was revealed that G4S had failed to properly train and vet their employees, leading to security breaches and concerns about the safety of athletes and visitors.

This case raises ethical concerns about the protection of human rights, as the actions of G4S employees were seen as a violation of the principle of proportionality. It also highlights the legal issues surrounding the use of PMCs, as G4S was not held accountable for their actions due to the lack of a clear legal framework for PMCs.

### Conclusion

These case studies demonstrate the complex and multifaceted nature of the role of PMCs in great power military intervention. They highlight the ethical and legal issues surrounding the use of PMCs and the need for a clear legal framework to regulate their actions. As great powers continue to rely on PMCs in their military operations, it is crucial to address these issues and ensure the protection of human rights and the accountability of PMCs.


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the role of non-state actors in great power military intervention. We have seen how these actors, such as private military companies and non-governmental organizations, play a significant role in shaping the outcome of interventions. We have also discussed the challenges and opportunities that come with their involvement, and the ethical considerations that must be taken into account.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is the importance of understanding the motivations and interests of non-state actors in any intervention. Their actions and decisions can have a significant impact on the success or failure of a military intervention, and it is crucial for policymakers and military leaders to consider their role in the planning and execution of interventions.

Furthermore, we have also highlighted the need for transparency and accountability in the use of non-state actors in military interventions. The lack of regulations and oversight can lead to abuses and violations of human rights, which can have long-lasting consequences. It is essential for great powers to establish clear guidelines and regulations for the use of non-state actors in interventions, and to hold them accountable for their actions.

In conclusion, the role of non-state actors in great power military intervention is complex and multifaceted. Their involvement can bring both challenges and opportunities, and it is crucial for policymakers and military leaders to carefully consider their role in interventions. By understanding their motivations and establishing clear guidelines and regulations, we can ensure that interventions are carried out in a responsible and ethical manner.

## Chapter 11: The Role of International Organizations




### Introduction

The media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion and understanding of great power military intervention. In this chapter, we will explore the complex relationship between the media and intervention, examining how the media influences public perception and how intervention is portrayed in the media. We will also discuss the role of the media in shaping public opinion and policy-making, and the ethical considerations surrounding media coverage of intervention.

The media has the power to shape public opinion and understanding of intervention through its coverage of conflicts and interventions. The media can influence how conflicts are perceived, how interventions are portrayed, and how the public understands the motivations and consequences of intervention. This can have a significant impact on public support for intervention and can even influence policy-making decisions.

One of the key ethical considerations surrounding media coverage of intervention is the potential for bias. The media has a responsibility to provide accurate and unbiased information, but this can be challenging in the context of intervention. The media must navigate complex and often conflicting interests, including those of the intervening power, the target country, and the international community. This can lead to biased coverage, which can have serious consequences for public understanding and support for intervention.

In this chapter, we will also explore the role of the media in shaping public opinion and policy-making. The media has the power to influence public opinion through its coverage of intervention, and this can have a significant impact on policy-making decisions. We will examine how the media can shape public opinion and how this can influence the decisions of policymakers.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the media and intervention. By examining the various aspects of this relationship, we can gain a deeper understanding of the role of the media in shaping public opinion and policy-making surrounding intervention. 


# Great Power Military Intervention: A Comprehensive Study

## Chapter 11: The Media and Intervention




### Subsection: 11.1a Media and Public Opinion

The media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion and understanding of great power military intervention. In this section, we will explore the complex relationship between the media and public opinion, examining how the media influences public perception and how intervention is portrayed in the media.

#### The Media as a Tool of Intervention

The media is often used as a tool by great powers to shape public opinion and support for intervention. This can be seen in the case of the United States, which has a long history of using media propaganda to justify its interventions. For example, during the Vietnam War, the US government used media propaganda to portray the war as a necessary fight against communism, despite the fact that the war was largely unpopular among the American public.

In more recent years, the US has continued to use media propaganda to justify its interventions, particularly in the Middle East. The US government has been accused of manipulating media coverage to portray its interventions as necessary and successful, while downplaying or ignoring negative aspects such as civilian casualties and human rights violations.

#### The Role of Media in Shaping Public Opinion

The media has the power to shape public opinion through its coverage of intervention. The media can influence how conflicts are perceived, how interventions are portrayed, and how the public understands the motivations and consequences of intervention. This can have a significant impact on public support for intervention and can even influence policy-making decisions.

For example, during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the US media played a crucial role in shaping public opinion. The media coverage of the invasion was heavily biased in favor of the US government, with many news outlets repeating US government propaganda without critical analysis. This led to a significant increase in public support for the invasion, which ultimately resulted in the US invading Iraq.

#### Ethical Considerations in Media Coverage of Intervention

The media has a responsibility to provide accurate and unbiased information, but this can be challenging in the context of intervention. The media must navigate complex and often conflicting interests, including those of the intervening power, the target country, and the international community. This can lead to biased coverage, which can have serious consequences for public understanding and support for intervention.

One of the key ethical considerations surrounding media coverage of intervention is the potential for bias. The media has a responsibility to provide accurate and unbiased information, but this can be challenging in the context of intervention. The media must navigate complex and often conflicting interests, including those of the intervening power, the target country, and the international community. This can lead to biased coverage, which can have serious consequences for public understanding and support for intervention.

In addition to bias, there are also ethical considerations surrounding the use of media propaganda by great powers. The use of media propaganda to justify intervention can be seen as a violation of media ethics, as it involves manipulating public opinion for political gain. This can have long-lasting effects on public trust in the media and can lead to a distorted understanding of intervention.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion and understanding of great power military intervention. The media can be used as a tool by great powers to shape public opinion and support for intervention, and its coverage of intervention can have a significant impact on public support for intervention. However, there are also ethical considerations surrounding media coverage of intervention, including the potential for bias and the use of media propaganda. It is important for the media to maintain its responsibility to provide accurate and unbiased information in the context of intervention.





### Subsection: 11.1b Media and Policy Making

The media plays a crucial role in shaping policy-making decisions related to great power military intervention. In this section, we will explore the complex relationship between the media and policy-making, examining how the media influences policy decisions and how intervention is portrayed in the media.

#### The Media as a Tool of Policy-Making

The media is often used as a tool by great powers to shape public opinion and support for intervention. This can be seen in the case of the United States, which has a long history of using media propaganda to justify its interventions. For example, during the Vietnam War, the US government used media propaganda to portray the war as a necessary fight against communism, despite the fact that the war was largely unpopular among the American public.

In more recent years, the US has continued to use media propaganda to justify its interventions, particularly in the Middle East. The US government has been accused of manipulating media coverage to portray its interventions as necessary and successful, while downplaying or ignoring negative aspects such as civilian casualties and human rights violations.

#### The Role of Media in Shaping Policy-Making

The media has the power to shape policy-making decisions through its coverage of intervention. The media can influence how conflicts are perceived, how interventions are portrayed, and how the public understands the motivations and consequences of intervention. This can have a significant impact on policy decisions, as policymakers are often influenced by public opinion and media coverage.

For example, during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the US media played a crucial role in shaping public opinion and ultimately influencing policy decisions. The media coverage of the invasion was heavily biased in favor of the US government, with many news outlets repeating US government propaganda without critical analysis. This led to a significant increase in public support for the invasion, which ultimately influenced the decision to invade.

#### The Media as a Source of Information for Policy-Making

In addition to shaping public opinion, the media also serves as a source of information for policy-making decisions. Policymakers often rely on media coverage and reports to gather information about conflicts and interventions. This can be problematic, as the media may not always provide accurate or unbiased information, leading to misinformed policy decisions.

Furthermore, the media can also influence policy decisions by setting the agenda for what is considered important and newsworthy. This can be seen in the case of the Syrian Civil War, where the media's focus on the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government influenced the US government's decision to intervene militarily.

In conclusion, the media plays a crucial role in shaping policy decisions related to great power military intervention. Its ability to shape public opinion, influence policy decisions, and serve as a source of information makes it a powerful tool for great powers seeking to justify their interventions. However, the media's role in intervention also raises important questions about the accuracy and objectivity of media coverage and its impact on policy decisions. 





### Section: 11.1c Case Studies

In this section, we will examine specific case studies of great power military intervention and how the media played a role in shaping public opinion and policy decisions.

#### The 2003 Invasion of Iraq

As mentioned in the previous section, the media played a crucial role in shaping public opinion and policy decisions during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The US media's biased coverage of the invasion, which largely repeated US government propaganda, led to a significant portion of the American public supporting the invasion. This support was crucial in justifying the US government's decision to intervene in Iraq.

However, as the invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq continued, the media's coverage shifted. As more information became available, the media began to report on the negative consequences of the intervention, such as civilian casualties and the lack of weapons of mass destruction. This shift in coverage led to a decline in public support for the intervention and ultimately influenced policy decisions, as the US government faced increasing pressure to withdraw its troops from Iraq.

#### The 2011 Intervention in Libya

The media also played a significant role in shaping public opinion and policy decisions during the 2011 intervention in Libya. The US media's coverage of the intervention was largely positive, with many news outlets portraying the intervention as a necessary and successful effort to protect civilians from the oppressive regime of Muammar Gaddafi.

However, as the intervention continued, the media's coverage began to shift. Reports of civilian casualties and the destruction of Libyan infrastructure began to emerge, leading to a decline in public support for the intervention. This shift in coverage ultimately influenced policy decisions, as the US government faced increasing pressure to end the intervention.

#### Conclusion

These case studies demonstrate the power of the media in shaping public opinion and policy decisions related to great power military intervention. The media's coverage of intervention can have a significant impact on how conflicts are perceived and how interventions are portrayed, ultimately influencing policy decisions and the outcome of interventions. As such, it is crucial for policymakers to carefully consider the role of the media in shaping public opinion and policy decisions related to intervention.


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the role of the media in great power military intervention. We have seen how the media can shape public opinion and influence the decision-making process of great powers. We have also discussed the ethical implications of media coverage of military intervention and the responsibility of the media in reporting on such events.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is the power of the media in shaping public opinion. The media has the ability to frame the narrative and influence how the public perceives military intervention. This can have a significant impact on the success or failure of intervention efforts. It is important for policymakers and military leaders to be aware of this and to carefully consider the information they release to the media.

Another important aspect to consider is the ethical responsibility of the media in reporting on military intervention. The media has a duty to report accurately and objectively, but there is also a responsibility to consider the potential consequences of their coverage. This is especially true in cases where the media may be influencing public opinion and potentially hindering intervention efforts.

In conclusion, the media plays a crucial role in great power military intervention. It has the power to shape public opinion and influence the success or failure of intervention efforts. It is important for policymakers and military leaders to carefully consider the media's role and for the media to uphold its ethical responsibility in reporting on such events.

### Subsection: 11.2a Media Bias

Media bias is a pervasive issue in the United States, with claims of bias being made by both liberal and conservative media critics. The lines between commentary and journalism have become increasingly blurred, leading to concerns about the objectivity and credibility of mainstream media outlets.

#### Liberal Bias

The claim of liberal bias in the media dates back to the 1964 presidential campaign of Senator Barry Goldwater, a conservative. Since then, numerous books and studies have addressed the question of political bias in the American media. According to the "Encyclopædia Britannica", "conservative media critics often claim that U.S. media skews toward the political left".

A study conducted by Lars Willnat and David H. Weaver, professors of journalism at Indiana University, found that 38.8% of US journalists identify as "leaning left" (28.1% identify as Democrats), 12.9% identify as "leaning right" (7.1% as Republicans), and 43.8% as "middle of the road" (50.2% as independents). This study also noted a decline in the fraction of Democratic journalists since 1971 and down 8 percentage points since 2002.

#### Conservative Bias

While liberal bias is often the focus of media critiques, there are also claims of conservative bias in the media. Some conservative media critics argue that the media is biased towards the political right, with Fox News being a prime example. However, studies have shown that Fox News is not as biased as other cable news networks, such as MSNBC and CNN.

#### Fake News and Propaganda

The emergence of the problem of "fake news" and propaganda has combined with the Trump-driven hostility towards journalists to make the focus of this article even more timely. The rise of social media and the internet has made it easier for fake news and propaganda to spread, blurring the lines between fact and fiction. This has led to concerns about the credibility of the media and the impact it has on public opinion and policy decisions.

#### Impact of Media Bias on Intervention

Media bias can have a significant impact on great power military intervention. Biased coverage can shape public opinion and influence policy decisions, as seen in the case studies of the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the 2011 intervention in Libya. It is crucial for policymakers to be aware of media bias and to consider it when making decisions about intervention.

In the next section, we will explore the role of the media in shaping public opinion and policy decisions during specific interventions.





### Subsection: 11.2b Media and Propaganda

The media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion and understanding of intervention by great powers. However, the media is not immune to propaganda and manipulation, which can significantly impact its coverage of intervention. In this section, we will explore the relationship between the media and propaganda, and how it affects our understanding of intervention.

#### Propaganda and Media Coverage

Propaganda is the use of media to influence public opinion and shape perceptions. It is often used by governments and other powerful entities to promote their agendas and justify their actions. In the context of intervention, propaganda can be used to justify military intervention, demonize the enemy, and create support for the intervention.

The media, particularly television, has been a primary tool for propaganda during interventions. The use of television in the Gulf War of 1991 is a prime example. The US government used television to broadcast live footage of the war, creating a sense of immediacy and urgency. This coverage was heavily censored and manipulated, with the US military controlling what footage was shown and how it was presented. This propaganda helped to create public support for the intervention and justify the use of military force.

#### Media Critiques and Challenges

The use of propaganda in media coverage of intervention has been a subject of criticism and challenge. Media critics argue that the media's role in promoting propaganda undermines its credibility and integrity. They argue that the media should be a source of unbiased information, not a tool for propaganda.

In response to these criticisms, some media outlets have implemented policies to prevent propaganda from influencing their coverage. For example, the BBC has a policy of "due impartiality," which requires it to provide a balanced and unbiased perspective on controversial issues. However, critics argue that these policies are not always effective, and propaganda still finds its way into media coverage.

#### The Role of Social Media

The rise of social media has also changed the way propaganda is disseminated and consumed. Social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, have become important sources of information for many people. However, these platforms are also vulnerable to propaganda and misinformation, which can be difficult to fact-check and correct.

The use of social media in intervention has been a subject of concern, particularly in the context of the Arab Spring. Social media platforms were used to organize protests and mobilize support for intervention, but they were also used to spread propaganda and misinformation. This has raised questions about the role of social media in shaping public opinion and understanding of intervention.

In conclusion, the media and propaganda have a complex and intertwined relationship. The media is a powerful tool for propaganda, but it also faces criticism and challenges for its role in promoting propaganda. The rise of social media has added a new layer to this relationship, further complicating the role of the media in intervention. As we continue to rely on the media for information about intervention, it is crucial to critically examine its coverage and understand the role of propaganda in shaping our understanding of intervention.


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the role of the media in great power military intervention. We have seen how the media can shape public opinion and influence the decision-making process of great powers. We have also discussed the ethical implications of media coverage of intervention and the responsibility of the media in reporting on such events.

The media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion and influencing the decision-making process of great powers. Its coverage of intervention can shape public perception of the intervention and its effectiveness. However, the media also has a responsibility to report accurately and ethically on these events. This includes providing context and avoiding sensationalism, which can distort the truth and mislead the public.

Furthermore, we have seen how the media can be used as a tool by great powers to justify their interventions. This raises ethical concerns about the manipulation of public opinion and the potential for media to be used as a propaganda tool. It is important for the media to maintain its independence and objectivity in reporting on intervention.

In conclusion, the media plays a crucial role in great power military intervention. Its coverage can shape public opinion and influence the decision-making process of great powers. However, it is important for the media to maintain its objectivity and ethical standards in reporting on these events.

### Subsection: 11.2c Media Literacy

Media literacy is a crucial aspect of understanding and critically analyzing media coverage of intervention. It is the ability to access, analyze, and create media messages, and to use the power of information and communication to make a difference in the world. Media literacy education is the process used to advance media literacy competencies, and it is intended to promote awareness of media influence and create an active stance towards both consuming and creating media.

#### Media Literacy and Intervention

Media literacy plays a significant role in how we understand and interpret media coverage of intervention. It provides the tools to critically analyze media messages and understand the underlying agendas and biases. For instance, media literacy can help us identify the author, purpose, and point of view of a media message, examine construction techniques and genres, and detect propaganda, censorship, and bias in news and public affairs programming.

Moreover, media literacy can help us understand the structural features of media, such as media ownership and the reasons for propaganda, censorship, and bias. This understanding can help us critically evaluate media coverage of intervention and form our own opinions.

#### Media Literacy Education

Media literacy education is an essential component of media literacy. It uses an inquiry-based pedagogic model that encourages people to ask questions about what they watch, hear, and read. This model promotes active learning and critical thinking, which are essential for understanding media coverage of intervention.

Media literacy education provides tools to help people develop receptive media capability to critically analyze messages, offers opportunities for learners to broaden their experience of media, and helps them develop generative media capability to increase creative skills in making their own media messages.

In conclusion, media literacy is a crucial aspect of understanding and critically analyzing media coverage of intervention. It provides the tools to understand the underlying agendas and biases in media messages, and it is essential for forming our own opinions about intervention. Media literacy education is a key component of media literacy, and it is crucial for promoting media literacy competencies.

### Conclusion

The media plays a pivotal role in shaping public opinion and understanding of intervention by great powers. It is a powerful tool that can influence how the public perceives and responds to intervention efforts. The media can be a source of information, a platform for propaganda, or a tool for manipulation. It can also be a catalyst for public support or opposition to intervention. 

The media's role in intervention is complex and multifaceted. It can both inform and mislead, inspire and discourage, unite and divide. The media's influence on intervention is not always direct or intentional. It can be shaped by a variety of factors, including the nature of the intervention, the context in which it occurs, and the way it is presented in the media. 

The media's role in intervention is also subject to various challenges and critiques. These include concerns about bias, censorship, and the manipulation of information. There are also debates about the media's responsibility to report accurately and objectively, and about the public's right to know. 

Despite these challenges and critiques, the media remains a crucial component of intervention by great powers. It is a vital source of information and a powerful influence on public opinion. Understanding the media's role in intervention is therefore essential for anyone seeking to influence or understand intervention efforts.

# Great Power Military Intervention: A Comprehensive Study

## Chapter 12: The Role of Public Opinion in Intervention




### Introduction

The aftermath of intervention is a critical aspect of great power military intervention that often goes unnoticed. It is the period following the intervention, where the effects of the intervention are observed and evaluated. This chapter aims to delve into the complexities of the aftermath of intervention, exploring the various factors that influence it and the implications it holds for future interventions.

The aftermath of intervention is not a static entity, but rather a dynamic process that evolves over time. It is influenced by a multitude of factors, including the nature of the intervention, the context of the intervention, and the reactions of the intervened state and the international community. Understanding these factors and how they interact is crucial to comprehending the aftermath of intervention.

This chapter will also explore the implications of the aftermath of intervention for future interventions. The lessons learned from past interventions can inform future interventions, helping to mitigate potential negative outcomes and maximize positive outcomes. However, the aftermath of intervention is not always clear-cut, and there are often complex and nuanced implications that must be considered.

In the following sections, we will delve into the various aspects of the aftermath of intervention, providing a comprehensive study that will shed light on this often overlooked but crucial aspect of great power military intervention.




#### 12.1a Nation Building

The aftermath of intervention often involves a complex process of nation building, a term that encompasses the efforts to establish or reestablish a functioning state in a post-conflict situation. This process is often fraught with challenges and complexities, and it is influenced by a multitude of factors, including the nature of the intervention, the context of the intervention, and the reactions of the intervened state and the international community.

Nation building is not a linear process, but rather a dynamic one that evolves over time. It involves a range of activities, including the establishment of democratic institutions, the promotion of human rights, the reconstruction of infrastructure, and the provision of basic services to the population. The success of nation building efforts is often measured by the ability of the intervened state to establish a stable and functioning state, capable of providing security, justice, and economic opportunities to its citizens.

However, the process of nation building is not without its challenges. It often involves navigating complex political, social, and economic dynamics, and it requires a deep understanding of the local context. Moreover, it often involves a significant commitment of resources and personnel, and it can be a lengthy process.

The aftermath of intervention also involves a range of other activities, including the disarmament and demobilization of armed groups, the promotion of reconciliation and peacebuilding, and the provision of humanitarian aid. These activities are often interconnected and mutually reinforcing, and they are crucial to the overall success of the intervention.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the process of nation building, exploring its various aspects and implications. We will also examine the role of different actors in the process, including the intervening state, the intervened state, and the international community. Finally, we will discuss the lessons learned from past interventions and their implications for future interventions.




#### 12.1b Peacebuilding

The aftermath of intervention often involves a complex process of peacebuilding, a term that encompasses the efforts to establish or reestablish a peaceful and stable environment in a post-conflict situation. This process is often fraught with challenges and complexities, and it is influenced by a multitude of factors, including the nature of the intervention, the context of the intervention, and the reactions of the intervened state and the international community.

Peacebuilding is not a linear process, but rather a dynamic one that evolves over time. It involves a range of activities, including the promotion of reconciliation and dialogue, the establishment of democratic institutions, the promotion of human rights, the reconstruction of infrastructure, and the provision of basic services to the population. The success of peacebuilding efforts is often measured by the ability of the intervened state to establish a stable and peaceful environment, capable of providing security, justice, and economic opportunities to its citizens.

However, the process of peacebuilding is not without its challenges. It often involves navigating complex political, social, and economic dynamics, and it requires a deep understanding of the local context. Moreover, it often involves a significant commitment of resources and personnel, and it can be a lengthy process.

The aftermath of intervention also involves a range of other activities, including the disarmament and demobilization of armed groups, the promotion of reconciliation and peacebuilding, and the provision of humanitarian aid. These activities are often interconnected and mutually reinforcing, and they are crucial to the overall success of the intervention.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the process of peacebuilding, exploring its various aspects and implications. We will also examine the role of different actors in the process, including the intervening state, the intervened state, and the international community.

#### 12.1b Peacebuilding

The process of peacebuilding is a complex and multifaceted one, requiring a deep understanding of the local context and a commitment to long-term stability. It involves a range of activities, including the promotion of reconciliation and dialogue, the establishment of democratic institutions, the promotion of human rights, the reconstruction of infrastructure, and the provision of basic services to the population.

One of the key aspects of peacebuilding is the concept of "justpeace", as proposed by John Paul Lederach. Justpeace refers to a state of affairs where all three types of violence - direct, structural, and cultural - are absent. Direct violence refers to immediate harm inflicted on a given subject or group, while structural violence refers to the ways that systems and institutions in society cause, reinforce, or perpetuate direct violence. Cultural violence, on the other hand, refers to aspects of culture that can be used to justify or legitimize direct or structural violence.

The concept of justpeace is particularly relevant in the aftermath of intervention, as it provides a framework for addressing the root causes of conflict and promoting long-term stability. By addressing all three types of violence, justpeace aims to create a sustainable and peaceful environment that is resilient to future conflicts.

However, achieving justpeace is not without its challenges. It requires a comprehensive and coordinated effort from all stakeholders, including the intervening state, the intervened state, and the international community. It also requires a deep understanding of the local context and a commitment to long-term stability.

In the next section, we will explore the role of different actors in the process of peacebuilding, including the intervening state, the intervened state, and the international community. We will also examine the challenges and opportunities associated with each of these actors, and how they can work together to promote justpeace in the aftermath of intervention.

#### 12.1c Case Studies

In this section, we will delve into specific case studies to further illustrate the complexities and challenges of post-intervention reconstruction. These case studies will provide concrete examples of the concepts and theories discussed in the previous sections.

##### Case Study 1: The United States Intervention in Iraq

The United States intervention in Iraq, which began in 2003, provides a stark example of the challenges of post-intervention reconstruction. The intervention was initially justified by the belief that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, a belief that was later found to be false. The intervention led to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime, but it also resulted in a protracted and costly occupation, with significant human and financial costs.

The post-intervention reconstruction efforts in Iraq were marked by numerous challenges. The country's infrastructure was severely damaged, and the security situation was unstable, with ongoing insurgent attacks and sectarian violence. The reconstruction efforts were also hindered by corruption and mismanagement, as well as by the lack of a clear strategy or plan.

The intervention in Iraq also highlighted the importance of understanding the local context in post-intervention reconstruction. The intervention was criticized for its lack of understanding of Iraq's history, culture, and political dynamics, which contributed to the difficulties of the reconstruction efforts.

##### Case Study 2: The European Union's Intervention in Kosovo

The European Union's intervention in Kosovo, which began in 1999, provides another example of post-intervention reconstruction. The intervention was aimed at ending the Kosovo War and promoting stability in the region.

The post-intervention reconstruction efforts in Kosovo faced significant challenges, including the need to rebuild infrastructure damaged during the war, the need to address the legacy of the conflict, and the need to promote reconciliation and dialogue among different ethnic groups.

The intervention in Kosovo also highlighted the importance of coordination and cooperation among different actors in post-intervention reconstruction. The European Union's intervention was part of a broader international effort, involving the United Nations, NATO, and other organizations. This coordination was crucial for the success of the reconstruction efforts.

In the next section, we will explore the role of different actors in post-intervention reconstruction, including the intervening state, the intervened state, and the international community. We will also examine the challenges and opportunities associated with each of these actors, and how they can work together to promote successful post-intervention reconstruction.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the aftermath of intervention is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires careful analysis and understanding. The chapter has provided a comprehensive study of the various aspects of intervention, including the political, economic, and social implications. It has also highlighted the importance of understanding the context in which intervention takes place, as well as the potential long-term effects of such actions.

The chapter has also emphasized the need for careful planning and consideration of the potential consequences of intervention.

## Chapter: Chapter 13: The Future of Intervention

### Introduction

The future of intervention is a topic of great interest and importance in the field of international relations. As we delve into the thirteenth chapter of this book, "The Future of Intervention," we will explore the potential trajectories and implications of intervention in the years to come. This chapter will not only provide a comprehensive study of the future of intervention but also offer insights into the potential challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

Intervention, as a concept, has been a subject of debate and discussion for centuries. It has been used as a tool by powerful nations to exert their influence and achieve their strategic objectives. However, with the rapid changes in the global political landscape, the future of intervention is likely to be shaped by a variety of factors, including technological advancements, changing power dynamics, and evolving international norms.

In this chapter, we will examine these factors and their potential impact on the future of intervention. We will also explore the role of international organizations and the potential for multilateral interventions. Furthermore, we will discuss the ethical considerations surrounding intervention and the potential for more responsible and accountable interventions in the future.

As we navigate through this chapter, it is important to keep in mind that the future of intervention is not set in stone. It is a dynamic and complex topic that requires careful analysis and consideration. By the end of this chapter, readers should have a better understanding of the potential future of intervention and the role it will play in shaping the global political landscape.




#### 12.1c Case Studies

In this section, we will delve into specific case studies that illustrate the complexities and challenges of post-intervention reconstruction. These case studies will provide a more concrete understanding of the theoretical concepts discussed in the previous sections.

##### Case Study 1: Iraq

The intervention in Iraq, which began in 2003, provides a stark example of the challenges of post-intervention reconstruction. The intervention was aimed at disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction, which were later found to be non-existent. The intervention led to a protracted conflict, significant human and material losses, and a deep political and social crisis in the country.

The post-intervention reconstruction efforts in Iraq have been marked by a range of challenges, including sectarian violence, political instability, and economic difficulties. The reconstruction efforts have also been criticized for their lack of effectiveness and their high cost. Despite significant efforts and investments, Iraq continues to face significant challenges, including high levels of violence and political instability.

##### Case Study 2: Libya

The intervention in Libya, which began in 2011, provides another example of the complexities of post-intervention reconstruction. The intervention was aimed at protecting civilians from violence by the regime of Muammar Gaddafi. The intervention led to the overthrow of Gaddafi, but it also resulted in a protracted conflict and a deep political and social crisis in the country.

The post-intervention reconstruction efforts in Libya have been marked by a range of challenges, including political instability, economic difficulties, and ongoing violence. The reconstruction efforts have also been complicated by the presence of multiple armed groups and the ongoing conflict between these groups. Despite significant efforts and investments, Libya continues to face significant challenges, including ongoing violence and political instability.

These case studies illustrate the complexities and challenges of post-intervention reconstruction. They highlight the need for a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the aftermath of intervention, and they underscore the importance of careful planning and execution of post-intervention reconstruction efforts.




#### 12.2a Defining Success

Defining success after intervention is a complex and multifaceted task. It is not merely about achieving the stated objectives of the intervention, but also about the long-term stability and development of the affected country. As we have seen in the previous section, the aftermath of intervention is often marked by a range of challenges and complexities. Therefore, evaluating the success of intervention requires a comprehensive understanding of these challenges and a careful consideration of the various factors that contribute to success.

In the context of business and leadership, Malcolm Gladwell's book "Outliers: The Story of Success" suggests that the notion of the self-made man is a myth. Success, according to Gladwell, is often due to one's circumstances, rather than one's inborn talent. This perspective can be applied to the evaluation of intervention success. Just as entrepreneurs like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos have been successful due to their circumstances, the success of intervention can be attributed to the circumstances in which it is carried out. These circumstances include the nature of the intervention, the context in which it is carried out, and the response of the affected country.

Andrew Likierman, former Dean of London Business School, argues that success is a relative rather than an absolute term. Success needs to be measured against stated objectives and against the achievements of relevant peers. This perspective can be applied to the evaluation of intervention success. Just as business success is relative, the success of intervention can be evaluated relative to other interventions in similar contexts.

However, it is important to note that success does not come easily. It requires consistent hard work and dedication to one's goals. In many success stories, there are countless hardships and failures before success is finally achieved. This is also true of intervention. The aftermath of intervention is often marked by significant challenges and complexities, which require consistent hard work and dedication to address.

In the next section, we will delve into specific case studies that illustrate the complexities and challenges of post-intervention reconstruction. These case studies will provide a more concrete understanding of the theoretical concepts discussed in this section.

#### 12.2b Measuring Success

Measuring the success of intervention is a critical step in evaluating its effectiveness. This process involves assessing the extent to which the intervention has achieved its stated objectives and contributed to the long-term stability and development of the affected country. 

One way to measure success is through the lens of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs provide a comprehensive framework for assessing the success of interventions, as they encompass a wide range of development issues, including poverty, hunger, health, education, gender equality, and more. By evaluating the progress made towards these goals, we can gain a clearer picture of the success of intervention.

For instance, the SDG 1 aims to end poverty in all its forms. If an intervention has contributed to a significant reduction in poverty levels in the affected country, it can be considered a success. Similarly, SDG 2 aims to end hunger, and SDG 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. If an intervention has contributed to improvements in these areas, it can be considered a success.

However, it is important to note that the SDGs are not the only measure of success. Other factors, such as the stability of the affected country, the response of the local population, and the long-term impact of the intervention, also need to be considered.

In the context of business and leadership, the success of intervention can be compared to the success of entrepreneurs like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos. Just as these entrepreneurs have been successful due to their circumstances, the success of intervention can be attributed to the circumstances in which it is carried out. These circumstances include the nature of the intervention, the context in which it is carried out, and the response of the affected country.

In conclusion, measuring the success of intervention is a complex task that requires a comprehensive understanding of the intervention, the context in which it is carried out, and the response of the affected country. By using a multifaceted approach, we can gain a more accurate picture of the success of intervention.

#### 12.2c Case Studies

In this section, we will delve into specific case studies that illustrate the complexities and nuances of evaluating intervention success. These case studies will provide concrete examples of how the theoretical concepts discussed in the previous sections are applied in real-world scenarios.

##### Case Study 1: The Intervention in Iraq

The intervention in Iraq, which began in 2003, provides a compelling case study of the challenges of evaluating intervention success. The intervention was aimed at disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction, which were later found to be non-existent. Despite this, the intervention was considered a success by some due to the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime and the establishment of a democratic government. However, the intervention has been criticized for its high human and financial costs, as well as the ongoing political instability in Iraq.

##### Case Study 2: The Intervention in Libya

The intervention in Libya, which began in 2011, offers another perspective on intervention success. The intervention was aimed at protecting civilians from violence by the regime of Muammar Gaddafi. The intervention was successful in achieving this objective, leading to the overthrow of Gaddafi's regime. However, the aftermath of the intervention has been marked by ongoing political instability and violence, calling into question the long-term success of the intervention.

##### Case Study 3: The Intervention in Sierra Leone

The intervention in Sierra Leone, which began in 2000, provides a contrasting example of intervention success. The intervention was aimed at ending the country's civil war and establishing a stable democratic government. The intervention was successful in achieving these objectives, leading to a significant reduction in violence and the establishment of a democratic government. However, the intervention has been criticized for its high human and financial costs, as well as the ongoing challenges of rebuilding the country.

These case studies illustrate the complexities and nuances of evaluating intervention success. They highlight the importance of considering a wide range of factors, including the stated objectives of the intervention, the response of the local population, the long-term stability of the affected country, and the human and financial costs of the intervention. They also underscore the importance of a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the intervention context, as well as the need for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of intervention outcomes.




#### 12.2b Measuring Success

Measuring the success of intervention is a critical step in evaluating its effectiveness. This process involves assessing the extent to which the intervention has achieved its stated objectives and contributed to the long-term stability and development of the affected country. 

One approach to measuring success is through the use of self-efficacy scales. As discussed in the previous section, self-efficacy is an individual's belief and confidence in their ability to achieve a certain task. In the context of intervention, self-efficacy can be used to measure the confidence of the affected country in its ability to manage its own affairs and achieve its own objectives. 

The Technological Self-Efficacy (TSE) scale, for instance, can be used to measure the self-efficacy of the affected country in the context of technological advancements. This scale, developed by McDonald and Siegall, consists of five items that are rated on a likert scale. The scores from these items are then averaged to provide a measure of the country's technological self-efficacy. 

Another approach to measuring success is through the use of the Gifted Rating Scales. These scales, now in their third edition, provide a comprehensive assessment of giftedness in individuals. While these scales were originally developed for use with children, they can also be adapted for use with countries. The Gifted Rating Scales can be used to assess the giftedness of a country, which can be a key indicator of its potential for success.

In addition to these scales, success can also be measured through the use of the Self-Directed Learning Readiness (SDLR) scale. This scale, developed by Hiemstra and Blumenfeld, measures an individual's readiness for self-directed learning. In the context of intervention, this scale can be used to measure the readiness of the affected country for self-directed development.

Finally, success can be measured through the use of the Self-Efficacy for Organizational Change (SEOC) scale. This scale, developed by Bandura, measures an individual's belief in their ability to effect change within an organization. In the context of intervention, this scale can be used to measure the belief of the affected country in its ability to effect change within its own society.

In conclusion, measuring the success of intervention is a complex task that requires a multifaceted approach. By using a combination of self-efficacy scales, giftedness assessments, and readiness measures, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the success of intervention.

#### 12.2c Case Studies

In this section, we will delve into specific case studies to further illustrate the complexities of evaluating intervention success. These case studies will provide real-world examples of interventions by great powers and the subsequent aftermath.

##### Case Study 1: The United States' Intervention in Iraq

The United States' intervention in Iraq, which began in 2003, provides a compelling case study of intervention success. The intervention was primarily aimed at disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, which were believed to pose a threat to regional and global security. However, no such weapons were found, leading to questions about the effectiveness of the intervention.

In terms of self-efficacy, the intervention can be seen as a failure. The Iraqi government's belief in its ability to manage its own affairs was severely undermined by the intervention, leading to a prolonged period of instability and conflict. The country's technological self-efficacy, as measured by the TSE scale, also declined significantly during this period.

The Gifted Rating Scales can be used to assess the giftedness of a country, and in the case of Iraq, the intervention can be seen as a hindrance to the country's giftedness. The intervention disrupted the country's educational system, leading to a decline in academic performance and intellectual development.

The SDLR scale can be used to measure a country's readiness for self-directed learning. The intervention in Iraq can be seen as a barrier to the country's readiness for self-directed development, as it disrupted the country's social and economic structures, making it difficult for the country to take charge of its own development.

Finally, the SEOC scale can be used to measure a country's belief in its ability to effect change within its own society. The intervention in Iraq can be seen as a failure in this regard, as it did not lead to significant societal change.

##### Case Study 2: The European Union's Intervention in Greece

The European Union's intervention in Greece, which began in 2010, provides another interesting case study of intervention success. The intervention was primarily aimed at addressing Greece's debt crisis and ensuring the country's financial stability.

In terms of self-efficacy, the intervention can be seen as a success. The Greek government's belief in its ability to manage its own affairs was strengthened by the intervention, leading to a period of relative stability. The country's technological self-efficacy, as measured by the TSE scale, also increased during this period.

The Gifted Rating Scales can be used to assess the giftedness of a country, and in the case of Greece, the intervention can be seen as a boost to the country's giftedness. The intervention provided the country with much-needed financial support, leading to an improvement in the country's economic performance and intellectual development.

The SDLR scale can be used to measure a country's readiness for self-directed learning. The intervention in Greece can be seen as a success in this regard, as it provided the country with the resources and support needed to take charge of its own development.

Finally, the SEOC scale can be used to measure a country's belief in its ability to effect change within its own society. The intervention in Greece can be seen as a success in this regard, as it led to significant societal change, including reforms in the country's financial and economic systems.




#### 12.2c Case Studies

In this section, we will examine several case studies that provide a more detailed understanding of the aftermath of intervention. These case studies will allow us to apply the concepts and theories discussed in the previous sections to real-world scenarios, providing a more nuanced understanding of the complexities of intervention and its aftermath.

##### Case Study 1: The United States Intervention in Iraq

The United States intervention in Iraq, which began in 2003, provides a compelling case study of the aftermath of intervention. The intervention was aimed at removing the regime of Saddam Hussein, who was believed to possess weapons of mass destruction. However, these weapons were never found, and the intervention led to a protracted and costly occupation.

The intervention resulted in significant changes in Iraq's political landscape. The overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime led to the establishment of a new government, which was initially led by Ayad Allawi, a secular Shia politician. However, the intervention also led to a power struggle between various factions, including Shia, Sunni, and Kurdish groups, which resulted in a high level of political instability.

The intervention also had a significant impact on Iraq's economy. The country's oil industry, which was nationalized under Saddam Hussein's regime, was privatized as part of the intervention. This led to increased foreign investment, but also raised concerns about the exploitation of Iraq's resources.

The intervention also had a profound impact on Iraq's social fabric. The overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime led to a power vacuum, which was filled by various militias and sectarian groups. This resulted in a surge in sectarian violence, which further exacerbated the country's political instability.

In terms of self-efficacy, the intervention had a mixed impact on Iraq. On one hand, the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime increased the country's technological self-efficacy, as it allowed for greater access to technology and foreign investment. On the other hand, the political instability and sectarian violence reduced the country's self-efficacy, as it undermined its ability to manage its own affairs.

##### Case Study 2: The European Union Intervention in Greece

The European Union intervention in Greece, which began in 2010, provides another interesting case study of the aftermath of intervention. The intervention was aimed at addressing Greece's debt crisis, which was exacerbated by the global financial crisis of 2008.

The intervention resulted in significant changes in Greece's economic landscape. The EU imposed strict austerity measures, which led to a significant reduction in public spending and a rise in taxes. This helped to reduce Greece's debt, but also led to a sharp decline in living standards and a rise in unemployment.

The intervention also had a profound impact on Greece's political landscape. The austerity measures led to widespread protests and social unrest, which resulted in a shift towards more extreme political parties. This led to a political crisis, which was only resolved through the formation of a coalition government.

In terms of self-efficacy, the intervention had a mixed impact on Greece. On one hand, the austerity measures increased Greece's self-efficacy, as they helped to address the country's debt crisis. On the other hand, the social unrest and political crisis reduced Greece's self-efficacy, as it undermined the country's ability to manage its own affairs.

These case studies highlight the complexities of the aftermath of intervention. They show that interventions can have far-reaching impacts, not only on the affected country, but also on the intervening country and the international community. They also underscore the importance of careful planning and consideration of the potential aftermath of intervention.

### Section: 13.1 Emerging Trends:

As we look towards the future of intervention by great powers, it is important to consider the emerging trends that may shape the way intervention is carried out. These trends include advancements in technology, changes in global power dynamics, and the increasing importance of non-state actors.

#### 13.1a Advancements in Technology

Advancements in technology have always played a significant role in military intervention. From the development of new weapons and tactics to the use of intelligence and surveillance, technology has been a crucial tool for great powers in their interventions. As we move forward, it is likely that technology will continue to play a key role in intervention, but in new and unexpected ways.

One emerging trend in technology is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in military operations. AI has the potential to revolutionize the way great powers intervene in conflicts, by analyzing large amounts of data and making decisions in real-time. This could greatly enhance the effectiveness of intervention, but it also raises ethical concerns and the potential for unintended consequences.

Another emerging trend is the use of cyber warfare. With the increasing reliance on technology in all aspects of society, cyber warfare has become a crucial tool for great powers in intervention. Cyber attacks can disrupt communication, disrupt critical infrastructure, and even manipulate public opinion. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that cyber warfare will become an even more important aspect of intervention.

#### 13.1b Changes in Global Power Dynamics

As we look towards the future, it is important to consider the changing dynamics of global power. The rise of new powers, such as China and India, and the decline of traditional great powers, such as the United States and Russia, will have a significant impact on intervention.

China, in particular, is expected to play a larger role in intervention in the future. With its growing economic and military power, China is likely to become a major player in global conflicts. This could lead to a shift in the balance of power and potentially change the way intervention is carried out.

#### 13.1c Role of Non-State Actors

The role of non-state actors, such as terrorist organizations and private military contractors, is also expected to increase in the future of intervention. These actors have already played a significant role in conflicts in the Middle East and Africa, and their influence is likely to continue to grow.

The use of private military contractors, in particular, raises ethical concerns and the potential for privatization of war. As great powers continue to outsource their military operations, the role of non-state actors will only become more prominent.

### Subsection: 13.1b Climate Change and Intervention

Climate change is another emerging trend that is expected to have a significant impact on intervention in the future. The effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and changes in ecosystems, will create new challenges for intervention efforts.

One potential consequence of climate change is the increased frequency and severity of natural disasters, such as hurricanes and floods. These disasters can disrupt military operations and create humanitarian crises, requiring intervention from great powers.

Climate change is also expected to have a significant impact on ecosystems, leading to the spread of invasive species and the loss of biodiversity. This could have implications for intervention efforts, as changes in ecosystems can affect the effectiveness of military operations and the well-being of local populations.

In addition to these direct impacts, climate change is also expected to exacerbate existing conflicts and create new ones. As resources become scarcer and environmental conditions worsen, tensions between countries and communities will likely increase, leading to the need for intervention.

As we continue to grapple with the effects of climate change, it is crucial that we consider its potential impact on intervention by great powers. By understanding and addressing the emerging trends of climate change, technology, and global power dynamics, we can better prepare for the future of intervention and work towards a more sustainable and peaceful world.

# Great Power Military Intervention: A Comprehensive Study

## Chapter 14: Intervention and Its Impact




### Section: 13.1c Global Power Shifts

As we continue to look towards the future, it is important to consider the ongoing global power shifts that are occurring. These shifts are not only impacting the traditional great powers, but also the emerging powers such as Turkey, Poland, and Japan.

Turkey, with its strong military and economic influence, is expected to continue expanding its sphere of influence into the Arab world and Russia. This will likely lead to increased intervention in these regions, as Turkey competes with other powers for influence.

Japan, on the other hand, is expected to become a major power in the Pacific region. With its growing military strength and economic influence, Japan will be able to project power across East Asia. This will likely lead to increased intervention in the region, as Japan competes with other powers for influence.

Poland, with its strong military alliance and economic influence, is also expected to become a major power. With its expanding influence into what was formerly European Russia, Poland will likely be involved in interventions in this region.

These global power shifts will have a significant impact on intervention in the future. As new powers emerge and traditional powers decline, the dynamics of intervention will continue to evolve. It is important for policymakers and scholars to closely monitor these shifts and their potential implications for intervention.





### Section: 13.2 Debates and Controversies:

#### 13.2a Intervention vs. Non-Intervention

The debate over intervention versus non-intervention has been a long-standing one in the field of international relations. Intervention refers to the involvement of one state in the affairs of another state, while non-intervention refers to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other states. This debate has been particularly relevant in the context of great power military intervention, as these interventions often involve the use of force and have significant implications for both the intervening state and the state being intervened in.

One of the key arguments in favor of intervention is the responsibility to protect (R2P). This principle, which was first introduced in 2005, allows for intervention in cases where there is a responsibility to protect civilians from mass atrocities. This principle has been used to justify interventions in Libya, Syria, and other countries where there have been reports of human rights violations. However, the implementation of R2P has been controversial, with some arguing that it has been used selectively and has led to unintended consequences.

On the other hand, proponents of non-intervention argue that intervention can lead to a violation of sovereignty and can have unintended consequences. They also argue that intervention can be used as a tool for imperialism and neo-colonialism, as seen in the historical context of European colonization and intervention in Africa. Additionally, non-interventionists argue that intervention can lead to a power imbalance, as the intervening state may have a stronger military and economic power, giving them an unfair advantage in the intervention.

The debate over intervention versus non-intervention is complex and multifaceted. It is important for policymakers and scholars to consider the potential implications and consequences of both intervention and non-intervention in order to make informed decisions. As we continue to see great power military interventions in the future, it is crucial to have a nuanced understanding of this debate and its implications for global politics.





### Subsection: 13.2b Human Rights vs. National Interests

The debate over human rights versus national interests is a crucial aspect of great power military intervention. This debate is often framed as a conflict between the responsibility of a state to protect its own citizens and the responsibility of a state to uphold international human rights laws.

On one hand, proponents of human rights argue that a state's responsibility to protect its own citizens should not take precedence over its responsibility to uphold international human rights laws. They argue that a state's actions, such as military intervention, should be guided by the principles of human rights and should not be used as a tool to further its own national interests. This perspective is often supported by the principle of R2P, which emphasizes the responsibility of states to protect civilians from mass atrocities.

On the other hand, proponents of national interests argue that a state's responsibility to protect its own citizens should take precedence over its responsibility to uphold international human rights laws. They argue that a state's actions, such as military intervention, should be guided by its own national interests and should not be constrained by international laws and norms. This perspective is often supported by the concept of sovereignty, which emphasizes a state's right to govern itself without interference from external powers.

The debate over human rights versus national interests is complex and multifaceted. It is important for policymakers and scholars to consider the potential implications and consequences of both perspectives in order to make informed decisions about military intervention.

### Subsection: 13.2c Future of Intervention

As we look towards the future, it is important to consider the potential impact of great power military intervention on global politics. The future of intervention will be shaped by a variety of factors, including technological advancements, changes in international law and norms, and shifts in global power dynamics.

One potential future scenario is the increased use of technology in military intervention. With advancements in technology, such as artificial intelligence and autonomous weapons, the role of human soldiers in military intervention may become obsolete. This could lead to a shift in the way great powers intervene in conflicts, with a greater emphasis on technology and less on traditional military tactics.

Another potential future scenario is the evolution of international law and norms surrounding military intervention. As global power dynamics continue to shift, there may be a reevaluation of existing laws and norms related to intervention. This could lead to a more permissive or restrictive approach to intervention, depending on the perspectives of the dominant global powers.

Finally, the future of intervention will also be shaped by changes in global power dynamics. As new powers emerge and existing powers decline, the dynamics of intervention may also change. This could lead to a shift in the types of conflicts that are intervened in, as well as the methods and motivations behind intervention.

In conclusion, the future of intervention is uncertain and will be shaped by a variety of factors. It is important for policymakers and scholars to continue studying and analyzing intervention in order to better understand its potential impact on global politics. By examining the past and present of intervention, we can gain valuable insights into the future and work towards a more peaceful and just world.


### Conclusion

We have discussed the potential challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, as well as the potential impact of intervention on both the intervening country and the target country. We have also examined the role of international law and organizations in regulating intervention, and the importance of considering human rights and ethical considerations in intervention decisions.

As we have seen, intervention is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration and planning. It is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and each intervention must be approached with a unique set of factors in mind. However, by understanding the history and current state of intervention, as well as the potential future developments, we can better prepare for and navigate these complex situations.

In conclusion, intervention will continue to be a crucial aspect of international relations, and it is important for policymakers and scholars to continue studying and analyzing it. By doing so, we can gain a deeper understanding of its potential benefits and drawbacks, and work towards more effective and ethical interventions in the future.

### Subsection: 13.2c Unilateral vs. Multilateral Intervention

The future of intervention will also be shaped by the ongoing debate over unilateral versus multilateral intervention. Unilateral intervention refers to the use of military force by a single state without the consent or support of other states. Multilateral intervention, on the other hand, involves the use of military force by multiple states with the consent and support of all parties involved.

Proponents of unilateral intervention argue that it allows for quicker and more decisive action, as there is no need to negotiate or coordinate with other states. They also argue that it allows for a state to protect its own national interests without being hindered by the interests of other states. However, critics of unilateral intervention argue that it can lead to a lack of legitimacy and support from the international community, as well as potential backlash and retaliation from other states.

Proponents of multilateral intervention argue that it allows for a more comprehensive and coordinated approach to intervention, with the involvement of multiple states and perspectives. They also argue that it can provide a stronger basis for legitimacy and support from the international community. However, critics of multilateral intervention argue that it can be slow and cumbersome, as well as difficult to coordinate and enforce among multiple states.

As we look towards the future, it is important to consider the potential implications and consequences of both unilateral and multilateral intervention. The future of intervention will also be shaped by advancements in technology, such as the development of autonomous weapons and artificial intelligence, which could potentially impact the effectiveness and ethics of intervention. Additionally, the changing global power dynamics and the rise of new powers, such as China and India, will also play a role in shaping the future of intervention.

In conclusion, the future of intervention is complex and uncertain, but it is important for policymakers and scholars to continue studying and debating the various aspects of intervention in order to make informed decisions and shape the future of intervention in a responsible and ethical manner.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the future of intervention by great powers. We have discussed the potential challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, as well as the potential impact of intervention on both the intervening state and the state being intervened in. We have also examined the role of international law and organizations in regulating and guiding intervention efforts.

As we have seen, intervention is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration and planning. It is not a one-size-fits-all solution and must be approached with caution and sensitivity. The future of intervention will continue to be shaped by a variety of factors, including technological advancements, changes in global power dynamics, and evolving international norms and laws.

It is our hope that this comprehensive study has provided readers with a deeper understanding of intervention and its potential implications.

## Chapter: Chapter 14: Conclusion

### Introduction

As we come to the end of our comprehensive study on great power military intervention, it is important to reflect on the key findings and insights gained throughout this book. In this chapter, we will summarize the main themes and arguments presented in each chapter, highlighting the most significant contributions and implications for future research.

Throughout this book, we have explored the complex and multifaceted nature of great power military intervention. We have examined the historical context, motivations, and consequences of intervention by major global powers, including the United States, Russia, and China. We have also delved into the various forms of intervention, such as direct military intervention, economic sanctions, and diplomatic intervention.

One of the key themes that emerged from our study is the importance of understanding the underlying motivations and interests of great powers when it comes to intervention. We have seen how these motivations can range from protecting national security and promoting democracy to pursuing economic interests and expanding influence. It is crucial for policymakers and scholars to carefully consider these motivations when analyzing and evaluating intervention strategies.

Another important aspect of our study is the recognition of the potential consequences and unintended effects of intervention. We have seen how intervention can have both positive and negative outcomes, and how these outcomes can be difficult to predict and control.

## Chapter 14: Future of Intervention




### Introduction

The Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, has been a complex and devastating conflict that has involved multiple actors and interventions. The intervention in Syria by great powers has been a topic of great interest and debate among scholars and policymakers. In this chapter, we will delve into a comprehensive study of the intervention in Syria by great powers, examining the various factors that influenced their decisions to intervene and the consequences of their actions.

The intervention in Syria has been a highly controversial topic, with different perspectives and opinions being expressed by various stakeholders. Some argue that the intervention was necessary to protect human rights and prevent further atrocities, while others argue that it was a violation of sovereignty and led to further instability and violence. This chapter aims to provide a balanced and objective analysis of the intervention, taking into account all perspectives and evidence.

We will begin by providing a brief overview of the Syrian Civil War and the key players involved. This will include a discussion of the historical and political context that led to the outbreak of the war and the various actors who have been involved in the conflict. We will then delve into the specific interventions by great powers, including the United States, Russia, and Turkey, and the reasons behind their decisions to intervene.

Next, we will examine the consequences of these interventions, both in terms of the conflict itself and the broader regional and global implications. This will include a discussion of the humanitarian crisis, the spread of extremism, and the impact on neighboring countries and international relations.

Finally, we will conclude with a critical analysis of the intervention in Syria, discussing the lessons learned and the implications for future interventions by great powers.

### Subsection: 14.1a Historical Context

The intervention in Syria by great powers is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires a thorough understanding of the historical context. The roots of the conflict can be traced back to the early 20th century, when the Ottoman Empire, which had controlled the region for centuries, began to decline. This led to a power vacuum that was filled by various European powers, including France, Britain, and Russia.

The Syrian region was particularly important to these powers due to its strategic location and natural resources. France, in particular, had a strong interest in the region and established a mandate over Syria in 1920. However, this led to tensions with the local population, who saw the French as foreign occupiers. In response, the Syrian National Movement was formed, which aimed to achieve independence from French rule.

The French responded with repression, leading to a series of uprisings and rebellions. This ultimately led to the Syrian independence in 1946, but the country faced ongoing political instability and coups. In 1970, Hafez al-Assad seized power in a coup and established a dictatorship that lasted until his death in 2000. His son, Bashar al-Assad, succeeded him and continued the authoritarian rule.

Under the Assad regime, Syria became increasingly isolated from the international community due to its support for terrorist organizations and human rights abuses. This led to international efforts to intervene and address the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the country. However, these efforts were met with resistance from Russia, which saw Syria as a key ally in the region.

The intervention in Syria by great powers, particularly the United States, Russia, and Turkey, has been a topic of great interest and debate. The US intervention was primarily focused on combating ISIS and supporting rebel groups, while Russia and Turkey supported the Assad regime. This intervention has had significant consequences for the region, including the ongoing civil war and the displacement of millions of people.

In the next section, we will delve into the specific interventions by these great powers and the reasons behind their decisions to intervene. We will also examine the consequences of these interventions and the lessons learned for future interventions by great powers.




### Section: 14.1b The Syrian Civil War

The Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, has been a complex and ongoing conflict that has involved various factions and external powers. The war has been marked by violence, human rights abuses, and a devastating humanitarian crisis.

The conflict began in March 2011, when political protests turned violent in response to the Syrian government's response to the Arab Spring. The protests were sparked by the arrest and torture of a group of teenagers who had painted anti-government graffiti on a wall in the city of Daraa. This event, known as the Daraa uprising, led to widespread protests and demonstrations across the country, calling for political reform and an end to the Assad regime.

The Syrian government's response to the protests was brutal, with security forces using violence and torture to suppress the demonstrations. This led to the formation of armed opposition groups, who took up arms to fight against the government. The conflict quickly escalated, with the government using its superior military and financial resources to gain the upper hand.

The Syrian Civil War has been marked by numerous human rights abuses, including the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government and its allies. In April 2014, Bellingcat, a non-profit organization that uses open source and social media investigation, published evidence of chemical weapons being used on Syrian civilians, including children. This evidence was collected and analyzed from video footage and images posted on social media platforms.

The use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Civil War has been a major concern for the international community. In response to the evidence presented by Bellingcat, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 2118, which called for the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. However, the resolution was not fully implemented, and there have been numerous reports of chemical weapons being used by the Syrian government and its allies since then.

The Syrian Civil War has also been marked by the involvement of external powers. The United States, Russia, and Turkey have all been involved in the conflict, with the US and Turkey supporting rebel groups and Russia supporting the Assad regime. This intervention has had significant consequences for the conflict, with the involvement of these powers complicating the situation and prolonging the war.

In conclusion, the Syrian Civil War has been a complex and ongoing conflict that has had a profound impact on the country and its people. The involvement of external powers and the use of chemical weapons have added further layers of complexity to the conflict, making it a crucial case study for understanding great power military intervention. 




### Section: 14.1c International Response

The international response to the Syrian Civil War has been complex and multifaceted. The conflict has been a major focus of international attention, with various countries and organizations providing aid and support to the Syrian people. However, the response has also been marked by controversy and criticism, particularly in regards to the use of military intervention.

#### International Aid and Support

In response to the humanitarian crisis caused by the Syrian Civil War, the international community has provided significant aid and support to the Syrian people. This includes food, shelter, and medical assistance, as well as support for refugees who have fled the country. The United Nations and various non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have been instrumental in providing this aid.

The United Nations has been particularly active in its response to the Syrian Civil War. In 2014, the UN launched the Syria Crisis Response Plan, which aimed to provide aid to over 8 million people affected by the conflict. This plan was updated in 2015 to address the ongoing needs of the Syrian people. The UN has also been working to address the root causes of the conflict, including political instability and economic inequality.

#### Military Intervention

The use of military intervention in the Syrian Civil War has been a contentious issue. The Syrian government, with the support of its allies, has used military force to suppress the rebellion. This has resulted in significant civilian casualties and the destruction of infrastructure. In response, some countries have provided military support to the rebel groups, with the goal of overthrowing the Assad regime.

The United States, for example, has been providing military aid to the Syrian rebels since 2014. This aid includes training and equipment, as well as airstrikes targeting ISIS and other terrorist groups. However, there have been concerns about the effectiveness and potential unintended consequences of this intervention.

#### International Law and Human Rights

The Syrian Civil War has also raised important questions about international law and human rights. The use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government and its allies, as well as reports of human rights abuses by all parties involved, have been major concerns for the international community.

In response to these concerns, the United Nations has been working to hold those responsible for these violations accountable. The UN has established several commissions of inquiry to investigate human rights abuses in Syria, and has also referred the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.

#### Conclusion

The international response to the Syrian Civil War has been complex and multifaceted. While the international community has provided significant aid and support to the Syrian people, the use of military intervention has been a contentious issue. Moving forward, it will be important for the international community to continue providing aid and support, while also addressing the root causes of the conflict and holding those responsible for human rights abuses accountable.

### Conclusion

The intervention in Syria by great powers has been a complex and controversial topic. The conflict has been ongoing since 2011 and has involved multiple actors, including the Syrian government, rebel groups, and foreign powers. The intervention by great powers, such as the United States, Russia, and Turkey, has had a significant impact on the conflict and the country as a whole.

One of the key findings of this case study is the importance of international law and norms in guiding great power intervention. The intervention in Syria has been heavily influenced by international law, particularly the principle of non-intervention. This principle, as outlined in the United Nations Charter, prohibits states from intervening in the internal affairs of another state. However, there have been exceptions to this principle, such as in cases of humanitarian intervention or when a state poses a threat to international peace and security.

The intervention in Syria has also highlighted the role of great powers in shaping international norms and laws. The actions of great powers, such as the United States and Russia, have had a significant impact on the interpretation and application of international law.

### Subsection: 15.1a Historical Context

The intervention in Afghanistan by great powers is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires a deep understanding of the historical context. The country has been a site of conflict and conquest for centuries, with various empires and powers vying for control. This historical context has shaped the country's political landscape and its relationship with the international community.

#### Ancient and Medieval History

Afghanistan has been inhabited since ancient times, with evidence of human settlement dating back to the Stone Age. The country was part of the Persian Empire, the Macedonian Empire, and the Roman Empire. The rise of Islam in the 7th century led to the conversion of the majority of the population, and the country became a center of Islamic scholarship and culture.

#### Modern History

In the 19th and 20th centuries, Afghanistan was caught in the power struggle between the British and Russian empires. The British, who controlled India, saw Afghanistan as a buffer state to protect their interests in the region. The Russians, on the other hand, saw it as a potential ally in their expansionist plans. This led to a series of wars and interventions, with the British ultimately gaining control of the country.

#### Soviet Intervention

The Soviet Union, seeking to maintain its influence in the region, intervened in Afghanistan in 1979. The intervention was part of their larger strategy to contain the influence of the United States and its allies in the region. The Soviets supported the communist government in Kabul, which was facing insurgencies from Islamic fundamentalist groups. The intervention was met with strong resistance from the Afghan people, who saw it as a foreign invasion. The Soviets ultimately withdrew in 1989, leaving behind a devastated country and a power vacuum that led to further conflict and intervention.

#### U.S. Intervention

The United States, along with other Western powers, saw the Soviet intervention as an opportunity to weaken their Cold War rival. They provided support to the Mujahideen, the Islamic fundamentalist groups fighting the Soviets. This support included weapons, training, and funding, which ultimately led to the Soviet withdrawal. However, the U.S. intervention also had unintended consequences, as it helped to fuel the rise of extremist groups such as the Taliban.

#### Current Conflict

The intervention in Afghanistan by great powers has continued into the present day. The U.S. and its allies have been involved in the country since 2001, when they invaded in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The intervention has been marked by a complex and often contentious relationship between the U.S. and the Afghan government, as well as ongoing conflict with the Taliban and other insurgent groups.

In conclusion, the intervention in Afghanistan by great powers is a complex issue with a long history. The country's historical context, including its ancient and medieval history, as well as its modern history of intervention by various empires and powers, has shaped the country's political landscape and its relationship with the international community. Understanding this historical context is crucial for understanding the current conflict and the ongoing intervention efforts.





### Subsection: 15.1b The Afghan Conflict

The Afghan conflict, also known as the War in Afghanistan, has been a major focus of international intervention since the 1970s. The conflict has been marked by various interventions by great powers, including the Soviet Union, the United States, and more recently, the United States and its NATO allies.

#### The Soviet-Afghan War

The Soviet-Afghan War, which lasted from 1979 to 1989, was a major intervention by the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. The Soviets, seeking to maintain their influence in the region, intervened to support the communist government in Kabul, which was facing insurgencies from Islamic fundamentalist groups. The war was marked by a series of Soviet offensives and counter-offensives, with the Soviets ultimately withdrawing in 1989, leaving behind a devastated country and a power vacuum that led to further conflict and intervention.

#### The United States Intervention

The United States, along with other Western powers, saw the Soviet intervention as an opportunity to contain the influence of the Soviet Union in the region. The U.S. provided support to the Mujahideen, the Islamic fundamentalist groups fighting against the Soviets, in the form of weapons and training. This support was part of the U.S.'s larger strategy to contain the Soviet Union and its influence in the region. The U.S. intervention was marked by a series of covert operations, including the provision of weapons and training to the Mujahideen, as well as the use of air power to support the Mujahideen and disrupt Soviet operations.

#### The Post-Soviet Conflict

The withdrawal of the Soviet Union in 1989 left behind a power vacuum in Afghanistan, which led to further conflict and intervention. The Mujahideen, who had been fighting against the Soviets, turned on each other, leading to a series of civil wars. The Taliban, a fundamentalist Islamic group, rose to power in the 1990s, imposing a strict interpretation of Islamic law and gaining control of most of the country. The Taliban's rule was marked by human rights abuses and the suppression of women's rights.

#### The United States Intervention (2001-2021)

In response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the United States, along with its NATO allies, intervened in Afghanistan in 2001. The intervention was aimed at overthrowing the Taliban, who were believed to be harboring al-Qaeda, the terrorist group responsible for the 9/11 attacks. The intervention was marked by a series of military operations, including the invasion of Afghanistan, the overthrow of the Taliban, and the establishment of a new government.

The intervention has been marked by a long and complex conflict, with the Taliban regaining control of large parts of the country and the U.S. and its NATO allies facing challenges in establishing a stable and secure Afghanistan. The intervention has also been marked by controversies, including the use of drone strikes and the treatment of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.

#### The Post-Intervention Conflict

The U.S. intervention in Afghanistan has been followed by a complex and ongoing conflict. The Taliban, despite being overthrown in 2001, have regained control of large parts of the country and have continued to carry out attacks against the U.S. and its NATO allies. The U.S. and its allies have faced challenges in establishing a stable and secure Afghanistan, with the conflict continuing to this day.

### Conclusion

The Afghan conflict has been a major focus of international intervention since the 1970s. The various interventions by great powers, including the Soviet Union, the United States, and more recently, the United States and its NATO allies, have had a profound impact on the country and its people. The conflict continues to this day, with the U.S. and its allies facing challenges in establishing a stable and secure Afghanistan.





### Subsection: 15.1c International Response

The intervention in Afghanistan has been a major focus of international intervention since the 1970s. The conflict has been marked by various interventions by great powers, including the Soviet Union, the United States, and more recently, the United States and its NATO allies.

#### The International Community's Response

The international community has been closely monitoring the situation in Afghanistan since the Soviet intervention. The United Nations, in particular, has been actively involved in the conflict, providing humanitarian aid and facilitating peace talks between the various factions involved in the conflict. The UN has also been instrumental in coordinating international aid and assistance to Afghanistan, particularly in the aftermath of the U.S. intervention.

#### The NATO Intervention

In the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the United States, with the support of its NATO allies, intervened in Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban regime, which was harboring al-Qaeda, the terrorist group responsible for the attacks. The NATO intervention, known as Operation Enduring Freedom, was initially successful in overthrowing the Taliban regime, but the conflict has continued for over two decades, with the Taliban regaining control of large parts of the country in recent years.

#### The International Community's Role in the Post-Intervention Period

The international community has played a crucial role in the post-intervention period in Afghanistan. The U.S. and its NATO allies have provided significant financial and military assistance to the Afghan government, but the conflict has continued, with the Taliban regaining control of large parts of the country. The international community has also been involved in efforts to facilitate peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban, with the aim of ending the conflict and establishing a stable and secure Afghanistan.

#### The Role of International Organizations

International organizations, such as the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and the International Red Cross, have been actively involved in providing humanitarian aid and assistance to the Afghan people, particularly in the aftermath of the U.S. intervention. These organizations have also been instrumental in coordinating international aid and assistance to Afghanistan, working closely with the Afghan government and other international actors.

#### The Role of International Law

International law has played a crucial role in the intervention in Afghanistan. The U.S. intervention was justified under the principle of self-defense, as the U.S. argued that the Taliban regime was harboring al-Qaeda, which had carried out the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The intervention was also supported by the principle of humanitarian intervention, as the U.S. argued that the Taliban regime was committing human rights violations against the Afghan people. The intervention has raised important questions about the scope and limits of international law, particularly in the context of counterterrorism efforts.

#### The Role of International Communication and Coordination

The intervention in Afghanistan has highlighted the importance of international communication and coordination in responding to a complex conflict situation. The U.S. intervention, in particular, has been criticized for its lack of coordination with other international actors, leading to a prolonged and costly conflict. The Atlantic Storm exercise, conducted by the U.S. government in 2001, highlighted the need for better international communication and coordination in responding to a bioterrorist attack. These lessons are particularly relevant in the context of the intervention in Afghanistan, where better coordination between international actors could have led to a more effective and sustainable intervention.




### Subsection: 15.2a Actors and Interests

The U.S. has also been involved in efforts to stabilize the country and establish a democratic government. However, the U.S. intervention has been marked by significant challenges, including the ongoing conflict and the resurgence of the Taliban.

#### The Soviet Union

The Soviet Union was another major actor in the intervention in Afghanistan. The Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan in the 1980s, with the aim of supporting the communist government in Kabul and suppressing the Mujahideen, a group of Islamic fundamentalists who were fighting against the Soviet-backed government. The Soviet intervention resulted in a decade-long conflict, which ultimately led to the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989.

#### The Taliban

The Taliban, a fundamentalist Islamic group, has been a key actor in the intervention in Afghanistan. The Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 1996, following the withdrawal of the Soviet forces. The Taliban regime was characterized by human rights abuses and the suppression of women's rights. The Taliban's rule ended with the U.S. intervention in 2001, but the group has continued to operate as an insurgent force, challenging the Afghan government and the international forces.

#### The Afghan Government

The Afghan government, led by President Ashraf Ghani, has been a key actor in the intervention in Afghanistan. The Afghan government has been instrumental in efforts to stabilize the country and establish a democratic government. However, the government has faced significant challenges, including the ongoing conflict and the resurgence of the Taliban.

The Soviet Union employed conventional warfare in its intervention in Afghanistan. The Soviet forces engaged in a full-scale invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, with the aim of supporting the communist government in Kabul and suppressing the Mujahideen. The Soviet forces employed a variety of conventional tactics, including artillery and air strikes, in their efforts to combat the Mujahideen. However, the Soviet intervention resulted in a decade-long conflict, which ultimately led to the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989.

#### The Taliban: Guerrilla Warfare

The Taliban has employed guerrilla warfare in its intervention in Afghanistan. The Taliban's tactics have included hit-and-run attacks, ambushes, and the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). These tactics have been instrumental in the Taliban's ability to resist the U.S. and Afghan government forces, and have contributed to the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan.

#### The Afghan Government: Counterinsurgency

The Afghan government, led by President Ashraf Ghani, has employed counterinsurgency strategies and tactics in its efforts to stabilize the country and combat the Taliban.

#### The United States: Strategic Conquest

The United States has employed a strategy of strategic conquest in its intervention in Afghanistan. This strategy involves the use of military force to gain control of key areas and resources, with the ultimate goal of achieving strategic objectives. In the case of Afghanistan, the U.S. has used this strategy to overthrow the Taliban regime and establish a democratic government. However, the U.S. has faced significant challenges in implementing this strategy, including the ongoing conflict and the resurgence of the Taliban.

#### The Soviet Union: Strategic Defense

The Soviet Union employed a strategy of strategic defense in its intervention in Afghanistan. This strategy involves the use of military force to defend against external threats and protect key areas and resources. In the case of Afghanistan, the Soviet Union used this strategy to defend its interests in the region and support the communist government in Kabul. However, the Soviet Union ultimately failed to achieve its objectives due to the resilience of the Mujahideen and the support they received from the U.S. and other Western powers.

#### The Taliban: Guerrilla Warfare

The Taliban has employed a strategy of guerrilla warfare in its resistance to the U.S. intervention in Afghanistan. This strategy involves the use of small, mobile, and often hidden combatants to engage in hit-and-run tactics against a larger, more conventional enemy. The Taliban has used this strategy to great effect, managing to resist the U.S. and NATO forces for over a decade despite being significantly outnumbered and outgunned.

#### The Afghan Government: Stabilization and Reconstruction

The Afghan government, led by President Ashraf Ghani, has employed a strategy of stabilization and reconstruction in its efforts to rebuild the country after the intervention. This strategy involves the use of diplomatic, economic, and social measures to stabilize the country and rebuild its infrastructure. However, the Afghan government has faced significant challenges in implementing this strategy, including ongoing security concerns and corruption.

### Conclusion

### Subsection: 15.2c Outcomes and Impacts

The intervention in Afghanistan has had far-reaching outcomes and impacts, both for the country itself and for the international community. These outcomes and impacts have been shaped by the strategies and tactics employed by the different actors involved, as well as by the unique characteristics of the Afghan context.

#### The United States: Partial Success

The U.S. intervention in Afghanistan has been largely successful in achieving its strategic objectives. The U.S. has been able to overthrow the Taliban regime and establish a democratic government, albeit one that continues to face significant challenges. However, the U.S. has also faced significant setbacks, including the ongoing conflict and the resurgence of the Taliban. The U.S. intervention has also had significant humanitarian impacts, with thousands of civilian casualties and millions of displaced people.

#### The Soviet Union: Failure

The Soviet Union's intervention in Afghanistan was a resounding failure. Despite employing a strategy of strategic defense, the Soviet Union was unable to defend its interests in the region and support the communist government in Kabul.

### Subsection: 16.1a Historical Context

The intervention in Libya by great powers is a complex and multifaceted topic that requires a comprehensive study to fully understand its implications. This chapter will delve into the various aspects of this intervention, examining the motivations, strategies, and outcomes of the involved powers. 

The intervention in Libya is a recent event, occurring in the early 21st century. It was a significant event in the history of international relations, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa region. The intervention was led by a coalition of great powers, including the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, who intervened in Libya to protect civilians from the oppressive regime of Muammar Gaddafi.

#### 16.1a Historical Context

The intervention in Libya was not an isolated event, but rather part of a larger historical context of great power intervention in the region. The region has been a site of intense competition and intervention by great powers for centuries. The Ottoman Empire, for instance, controlled much of the region until the early 20th century. The British and French empires also had significant influence in the region, particularly in Egypt and Algeria.

In the 20th century, the region became a site of intense Cold War competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. The US supported authoritarian regimes in the region, often at the expense of democracy and human rights. This support was often driven by strategic interests, such as access to oil and the containment of Soviet influence.

The intervention in Libya can be seen as a continuation of this historical pattern of great power intervention. The US, France, and the UK intervened in Libya not only to protect civilians, but also to protect their strategic interests in the region. These interests included access to Libya's oil reserves and the desire to prevent a humanitarian crisis that could lead to a refugee crisis and further instability in the region.

The intervention also occurred in the context of the Arab Spring, a series of pro-democracy protests and uprisings that swept across the Middle East and North Africa in 2011. The intervention in Libya was part of the international community's response to these protests, which aimed to protect civilians and support the transition to democracy.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the historical context of the intervention, examining the specific events and factors that led to the intervention. We will also examine the motivations and strategies of the intervening powers, as well as the outcomes of the intervention.




### Subsection: 16.1b The Libyan Conflict

The Libyan conflict, also known as the First Libyan Civil War, was a significant event that led to the intervention by great powers. The conflict began in February 2011, when protests against the regime of Muammar Gaddafi erupted across the country. These protests were part of the larger Arab Spring, a series of pro-democracy uprisings that swept across the Middle East and North Africa.

#### 16.1b The Libyan Conflict

The Libyan conflict was marked by a rapid escalation of violence. By the end of February, Gaddafi's government had lost control of a significant part of Libya, including the major cities of Misrata and Benghazi, and the important harbours at Ra's Lanuf and Brega. The government's forces, however, were able to push the rebels back and eventually reach Benghazi and Misrata. This led to an increase in the intensity of fighting and in the number of casualties, as warned by the president of the ICRC Jakob Kellenberger.

The conflict also saw the involvement of foreign military intervention. On 11 March, the Libyan Air Force was running out of quality jet fuel, and the government tried to bribe Maltese Air Force officials in order to buy fuel. This led to a multi-state coalition beginning a military intervention in Libya to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, which was taken in response to events then occurring during the conflict.

The intervention was initially largely led by the United States, with US forces and one British submarine firing cruise missiles. The Royal Canadian Air Force, French Air Force, United States Air Force, and British Royal Air Force undertaking sorties across Libya and a naval blockade by the Royal Navy. The effort was initially largely led by the United States. NATO took command of the intervention on 31 March, with the support of 17 states.

The intervention in Libya was a significant event in the history of international relations, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa region. It was a complex and multifaceted topic that required a comprehensive study to fully understand its implications. This chapter will delve into the various aspects of this intervention, examining the motivations, strategies, and outcomes of the involved powers.

### Conclusion

The intervention in Libya by great powers is a complex and multifaceted topic that requires a comprehensive study to fully understand its implications. This chapter has provided a detailed analysis of the intervention, examining the various factors that led to the intervention, the strategies employed, and the outcomes achieved. The intervention in Libya serves as a case study that highlights the complexities and challenges of great power military intervention.

The intervention in Libya was a significant event in the history of international relations. It was a response to the popular uprising against the regime of Muammar Gaddafi, which had been in power for over 40 years. The intervention was a joint effort by several great powers, including the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, who used military force to protect civilians and support the rebels.

The intervention in Libya was a success in terms of achieving its immediate objectives. The rebels were able to overthrow Gaddafi's regime, and the intervention prevented a humanitarian crisis. However, the intervention also had significant drawbacks. It was a costly operation, both in terms of human lives and financial resources. The intervention also led to a power vacuum in Libya, which has resulted in ongoing political instability and violence.

In conclusion, the intervention in Libya is a crucial case study for understanding great power military intervention. It highlights the complexities and challenges of such interventions, and the need for careful consideration of the potential outcomes and consequences.

### Introduction

The intervention in Syria is a complex and multifaceted topic that has been a subject of intense debate and analysis in the international community. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive study of the intervention, examining the various aspects of the conflict and the role of great powers in the region.

The intervention in Syria began in 2011 as part of the Arab Spring, a series of pro-democracy uprisings that swept across the Middle East. The conflict has since evolved into a complex civil war, involving multiple factions and external powers. The intervention by great powers, including the United States, Russia, and Turkey, has further complicated the situation, with each power pursuing their own interests and strategies.

This chapter will delve into the historical context of the conflict, examining the events that led to the intervention. It will also explore the various actors involved in the conflict, including the Syrian government, rebel groups, and external powers.

### Subsection: 16.1c International Response

The international response to the conflict in Libya was swift and multifaceted. The conflict, which began as a domestic issue, quickly escalated into a regional and then global concern. The international community, particularly the United Nations, played a crucial role in responding to the crisis.

#### 16.1c International Response

The United Nations Security Council, in response to the escalating violence and humanitarian crisis in Libya, passed Resolution 1973 on 17 March 2011. This resolution, sponsored by the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, called for an immediate ceasefire, the withdrawal of government forces from urban areas, and the establishment of a no-fly zone over Libya. The resolution also authorized the use of "all necessary means" to protect civilians and enforce the no-fly zone.

The international response was not limited to the United Nations. Several countries, including the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, began military operations in Libya. These operations were primarily aimed at enforcing the no-fly zone and protecting civilians. The United States, for instance, launched a series of airstrikes targeting Gaddafi's forces. France also conducted airstrikes and deployed ground troops to support the rebels.

The international response was not without controversy. Some critics argued that the intervention was a violation of Libya's sovereignty and that it was motivated by the desire to protect Western interests in the region. However, supporters of the intervention argued that it was necessary to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and to uphold international humanitarian law.

The international response to the conflict in Libya highlights the complexities and challenges of international intervention. It underscores the importance of international cooperation and coordination in responding to crises. It also raises important questions about the role of international organizations, such as the United Nations, in these situations.




### Subsection: 16.2a Actors and Interests

The intervention in Libya was a complex affair involving a multitude of actors with diverse interests. These actors ranged from regional powers to international organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Each of these actors had their own reasons for intervening in the conflict, which often overlapped and sometimes conflicted with those of other actors.

#### 16.2a Actors and Interests

One of the primary actors in the intervention was the United States. The US had a vested interest in the region due to its significant oil reserves and its strategic location between Europe and Africa. The US also had a history of intervention in Libya, having supported the rebels during the Libyan Civil War in 2011. The US intervention was primarily motivated by its desire to protect its economic and strategic interests, as well as its commitment to promoting democracy and human rights.

Another key actor was France. France, like the US, had significant economic interests in Libya, particularly in the oil sector. However, France also had a historical connection to Libya, having been one of the colonial powers in the region. This historical connection, combined with its economic interests, motivated France to intervene in the conflict. France's intervention was also driven by its desire to protect its citizens, many of whom were expatriates living in Libya.

The United Kingdom was another major actor in the intervention. Like the US and France, the UK had significant economic interests in Libya, particularly in the oil sector. The UK also had a historical connection to Libya, having been one of the colonial powers in the region. However, the UK's intervention was also driven by its commitment to international law and its desire to uphold the principles of the United Nations.

In addition to these regional powers, international organizations and NGOs also played a significant role in the intervention. The United Nations, for instance, played a crucial role in coordinating the international response to the conflict. The UN Security Council's passage of Resolution 1973, which authorized the use of "all necessary means" to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly zone, was a key factor in the international intervention.

NGOs, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), also played a crucial role in the intervention. These organizations provided humanitarian aid to the affected population and advocated for the protection of civilians. Their work was crucial in mitigating the humanitarian crisis caused by the conflict.

In conclusion, the intervention in Libya was a complex affair involving a multitude of actors with diverse interests. These actors, each with their own motivations and interests, worked together to address the crisis in Libya. Their collective efforts resulted in a complex and multifaceted intervention that had significant implications for the region and the international community.




### Subsection: 16.2b Strategies and Tactics

The intervention in Libya was a complex operation that required a multitude of strategies and tactics to achieve its objectives. These strategies and tactics were employed by the various actors involved in the intervention, each with their own unique approaches and goals.

#### 16.2b Strategies and Tactics

The United States, France, and the United Kingdom employed a combination of diplomatic, economic, and military strategies in their intervention in Libya. Diplomatically, they worked to garner international support for their intervention, particularly from the United Nations Security Council. Economically, they applied pressure on Libya through sanctions and the threat of further economic measures. Militarily, they conducted airstrikes and provided support to the rebels on the ground.

The US, in particular, employed a strategy of "leading from behind," where it provided support and guidance to the rebels, but did not commit significant ground forces. This strategy was driven by its desire to avoid a prolonged and costly intervention, as well as to minimize its own casualties.

France, on the other hand, employed a more direct approach, committing ground forces and conducting airstrikes. This was driven by its historical connection to Libya and its desire to protect its citizens and economic interests.

The United Kingdom also employed a combination of diplomatic, economic, and military strategies. Diplomatically, it worked to garner international support for the intervention. Economically, it applied pressure on Libya through sanctions and the threat of further economic measures. Militarily, it conducted airstrikes and provided support to the rebels on the ground.

In addition to these strategies, the intervention also involved a range of tactics, including the use of precision airstrikes, the provision of training and equipment to the rebels, and the implementation of a no-fly zone to protect civilians.

The intervention in Libya also involved a range of tactics, including the use of precision airstrikes, the provision of training and equipment to the rebels, and the implementation of a no-fly zone to protect civilians. These tactics were employed in conjunction with the overall strategies of the various actors involved, and were constantly adapted and adjusted as the situation on the ground evolved.

In conclusion, the intervention in Libya was a complex operation that required a multitude of strategies and tactics to achieve its objectives. The various actors involved employed a range of approaches, each with their own unique goals and motivations. The success of the intervention ultimately depended on the effectiveness of these strategies and tactics, as well as the cooperation and coordination between the various actors involved.

### Conclusion

### Introduction

The intervention in Kosovo is a significant case study in the realm of great power military intervention. It serves as a prime example of the complexities and challenges faced by great powers when intervening in the affairs of another state. This chapter will delve into the various aspects of this intervention, providing a comprehensive analysis of the events leading up to it, the actions taken during the intervention, and the aftermath of the intervention.

The intervention in Kosovo was a multifaceted operation, involving not only military action but also diplomatic efforts, humanitarian aid, and peacekeeping operations. It was a pivotal moment in the history of international relations, testing the limits of international law and the effectiveness of international organizations. The intervention also raised important questions about the role of great powers in global conflicts and the ethical considerations of military intervention.

This chapter will explore these issues in depth, providing a detailed examination of the intervention in Kosovo. It will draw on a wide range of sources, including primary documents, scholarly articles, and firsthand accounts, to provide a balanced and nuanced understanding of this complex event. The aim is to provide a comprehensive study that will shed light on the dynamics of great power military intervention and its implications for global politics.




### Section: 17.1 Background:

The intervention in Kosovo was a significant event in the early 1990s, marking a turning point in the Balkans and the broader international community's approach to conflict resolution. This section will provide a historical context for the intervention, setting the stage for a more detailed analysis in the subsequent sections.

#### 17.1a Historical Context

The roots of the conflict in Kosovo can be traced back to the 14th century, when the region was part of the Byzantine Empire. However, the events leading up to the intervention in the 1990s were largely shaped by the aftermath of World War II and the subsequent breakup of Yugoslavia.

In the aftermath of World War II, the region was under communist rule, with Tito's Yugoslavia emerging as a socialist federation. However, upon Tito's death in 1980, the country began to unravel, with ethnic tensions and nationalist movements gaining momentum. The Albanian population in Kosovo, which had been suppressed under Tito's regime, began to demand greater autonomy and rights.

The situation deteriorated further in the 1980s, with the rise of Slobodan Milošević and his Serbian nationalist regime. Milošević's policies, which aimed to consolidate power and suppress ethnic Albanian separatism, led to increased tensions and violence in Kosovo. The Albanian population, which made up a majority in Kosovo, faced discrimination and violence at the hands of the Serbian-dominated security forces.

The situation in Kosovo came to a head in the early 1990s, with the Albanian population rising up against Serbian rule. The conflict quickly escalated, with both sides committing human rights violations and atrocities. The Serbian forces, under Milošević's command, carried out a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Albanian population, resulting in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people.

The international community, particularly the United States and NATO, became increasingly concerned about the situation in Kosovo. The conflict was seen as a threat to regional stability and a potential source of further instability and conflict. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1199, calling for a ceasefire and negotiations between the Serbian government and the KLA. However, these efforts were largely unsuccessful, and the conflict continued to escalate.

The failure of diplomatic efforts led to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) deciding to intervene militarily in Kosovo. This marked the first time in its history that NATO had launched an offensive without the approval of the United Nations Security Council. The intervention was aimed at protecting the Albanian population from further violence and pressuring the Serbian government to accept a negotiated settlement.

The intervention in Kosovo was a significant event in the history of international relations. It marked a shift in the international community's approach to conflict resolution, with the use of military force becoming a more prominent tool. The intervention also raised important questions about the role of international organizations, such as NATO and the United Nations, in conflict situations.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the events leading up to the intervention, the military operations, and the aftermath of the intervention. We will also examine the various factors that influenced the decision to intervene, including political, economic, and humanitarian considerations.

#### 17.1b International Response

The international response to the conflict in Kosovo was multifaceted and complex. It involved a range of actors, including the United Nations, NATO, and various European and non-European states. The response was shaped by a variety of factors, including the nature of the conflict, the perceived threat to regional stability, and the political and economic interests of the international community.

The United Nations, as the primary international organization responsible for maintaining international peace and security, played a crucial role in the response to the conflict in Kosovo. The UN Security Council passed several resolutions related to the conflict, including Resolution 1199, which called for a ceasefire and negotiations between the Serbian government and the KLA. However, these efforts were largely unsuccessful due to the intransigence of the Serbian government and the ongoing violence in Kosovo.

NATO, as the primary military alliance of the United States and its European allies, also played a significant role in the response to the conflict. In response to the failure of diplomatic efforts, NATO decided to intervene militarily in Kosovo. This marked the first time in its history that NATO had launched an offensive without the approval of the United Nations Security Council. The NATO intervention was aimed at protecting the Albanian population from further violence and pressuring the Serbian government to accept a negotiated settlement.

The NATO intervention was supported by various European and non-European states. The United States, as the dominant power in NATO, played a leading role in the intervention. Other key contributors included the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. The intervention was also supported by various non-NATO states, including Russia and China.

The international response to the conflict in Kosovo was not without controversy. Some critics argued that the intervention was a violation of international law, as it was launched without the approval of the United Nations Security Council. Others argued that the intervention was necessary to prevent further violence and protect the Albanian population.

Despite these controversies, the international response to the conflict in Kosovo set a precedent for future interventions. It demonstrated the growing role of international organizations, such as NATO, in conflict resolution and the increasing willingness of the international community to use military force to address security threats.

In the next section, we will examine the specific military operations carried out by NATO during the intervention in Kosovo.

#### 17.1c Lessons Learned

The intervention in Kosovo provides valuable lessons for future interventions by great powers. These lessons can be broadly categorized into three areas: strategic planning, international cooperation, and humanitarian considerations.

##### Strategic Planning

The intervention in Kosovo highlighted the importance of strategic planning in military interventions. The failure of diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict underscored the need for a well-conceived and executed military strategy. The NATO intervention, while ultimately successful, was marked by initial setbacks and difficulties due to a lack of clear strategic objectives and planning. This experience underscores the importance of thorough strategic planning, including clear objectives, timelines, and contingency plans, in future interventions[^1^].

##### International Cooperation

The intervention in Kosovo also underscored the importance of international cooperation in military interventions. The involvement of various international actors, including the United Nations, NATO, and various European and non-European states, demonstrated the complexity of modern interventions. The intervention also highlighted the importance of coordination and cooperation among these actors to achieve common objectives. This experience underscores the need for effective communication, coordination, and cooperation among international actors in future interventions[^2^].

##### Humanitarian Considerations

Finally, the intervention in Kosovo highlighted the importance of humanitarian considerations in military interventions. The intervention was primarily aimed at protecting the Albanian population from further violence. This experience underscores the importance of humanitarian considerations in the planning and execution of interventions. It also highlights the need for effective humanitarian aid and support for affected populations during and after interventions[^3^].

In conclusion, the intervention in Kosovo provides valuable lessons for future interventions by great powers. These lessons underscore the importance of strategic planning, international cooperation, and humanitarian considerations in military interventions. They also highlight the need for effective communication, coordination, and cooperation among international actors, as well as the importance of humanitarian considerations in the planning and execution of interventions.

The Albanian population, which made up a majority in Kosovo, faced discrimination and violence at the hands of the Serbian-dominated security forces.

The Albanian population in Kosovo had been suppressed under Tito's regime, but their demands for greater autonomy and rights began to gain momentum in the 1980s. This led to increased tensions and violence, as the Serbian-dominated security forces cracked down on Albanian separatism. The situation deteriorated further in the 1990s, with the rise of Slobodan Milošević and his Serbian nationalist regime. Milošević's policies aimed to consolidate power and suppress ethnic Albanian separatism, leading to increased violence and human rights violations against the Albanian population in Kosovo.

#### 17.1b The Kosovo Conflict

The Kosovo conflict, also known as the Kosovo War, began in 1998 and lasted until 1999. It was a result of the long-standing ethnic tensions and nationalist movements in the region. The conflict was primarily between the Albanian population, who made up a majority in Kosovo, and the Serbian-dominated security forces.

The conflict began when the Albanian population in Kosovo, who had been demanding greater autonomy and rights, rose up against Serbian rule. The Serbian security forces responded with violence and human rights violations, leading to a full-blown conflict. The conflict quickly escalated, with both sides committing human rights violations and atrocities. The Serbian forces, under Milošević's command, carried out a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Albanian population, resulting in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people.

The conflict also had international implications, as it was seen as a threat to regional stability and the potential for further escalation. The international community, particularly the United States and NATO, became increasingly concerned about the situation in Kosovo and the potential for further violence and instability in the region.

#### 17.1c International Response

The international response to the conflict in Kosovo was complex and multifaceted. The United States and NATO, in particular, played a significant role in the response. The US had a vested interest in the region, as it was seen as a potential source of instability and a threat to regional stability. NATO, as a security alliance, also had a responsibility to protect its member states and maintain regional stability.

The US and NATO initially attempted to resolve the conflict through diplomatic means, but these efforts were unsuccessful. As the conflict continued to escalate, the US and NATO began to consider military intervention as a last resort. This decision was made in part due to the failure of diplomatic efforts and the potential for further violence and instability in the region.

The US and NATO also faced pressure from the international community, particularly from European countries, to intervene in the conflict. The European Union, for example, passed a resolution calling for a ceasefire and negotiations between the Serbian government and the KLA. The US and NATO, however, were hesitant to intervene due to concerns about the potential for a prolonged and costly conflict.

In the end, the US and NATO decided to intervene in the conflict, with the goal of protecting the Albanian population and maintaining regional stability. This decision was made in part due to the failure of diplomatic efforts and the potential for further violence and instability in the region. The US and NATO also faced pressure from the international community, particularly from European countries, to intervene in the conflict.

The intervention in Kosovo was a significant event in the early 1990s, marking a turning point in the Balkans and the broader international community's approach to conflict resolution. It also set the stage for future interventions by great powers in conflicts around the world. 





#### 17.1c International Response

The intervention in Kosovo was a significant event in the early 1990s, marking a turning point in the Balkans and the broader international community's approach to conflict resolution. The international response to the crisis was shaped by a variety of factors, including the historical context of the region, the actions of key international actors, and the evolving nature of international law and norms.

##### United Nations Security Council Resolution 1170

The United Nations Security Council played a crucial role in the international response to the crisis in Kosovo. In 1998, the Security Council passed Resolution 1170, which welcomed the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Africa and emphasized the need for a comprehensive response to the challenges facing the continent. The resolution also established a working group to review the recommendations in the report and consider ways of implementing them.

The resolution highlighted the responsibility of African leaders in regional conflicts and economic failures, and the dangers of foreign intervention. It also stressed the need for close cooperation between the Security Council and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in conflict prevention. This resolution set the stage for the international community's response to the crisis in Kosovo, which was characterized by a focus on comprehensive solutions and close cooperation between international actors.

NATO, under the leadership of Secretary General Javier Solana, also played a significant role in the intervention, providing military support and coordinating efforts with other international actors.

The intervention in Kosovo also marked a significant evolution in international law and norms. The intervention was justified under the principle of humanitarian intervention, which allows for intervention in a sovereign state to protect human rights and prevent humanitarian crises. This principle has been a subject of debate and evolution in international law, with the intervention in Kosovo serving as a key case study in its application.

In conclusion, the international response to the crisis in Kosovo was shaped by a variety of factors, including the historical context of the region, the actions of key international actors, and the evolving nature of international law and norms. The intervention in Kosovo marked a significant turning point in the Balkans and the broader international community's approach to conflict resolution, setting the stage for future interventions and shaping the evolution of international law and norms.




#### 17.2a Actors and Interests

The intervention in Kosovo was a complex affair, involving a multitude of actors with varying interests. These actors ranged from local ethnic groups to international organizations and states. Each of these actors had their own interests and motivations, which shaped their actions and responses to the crisis.

##### Ethnic Groups in Kosovo

The ethnic groups in Kosovo, particularly the Albanian and Serbian populations, played a significant role in the intervention. The Albanian population, which constitutes a majority in Kosovo, had been seeking greater autonomy and rights within Yugoslavia. The Serbian population, on the other hand, saw Kosovo as an integral part of Serbia and resisted any attempts at autonomy. The ethnic tensions between these two groups were a major factor in the outbreak of the Kosovo War.

##### International Organizations and States

International organizations and states also played a crucial role in the intervention. The United Nations, for instance, was instrumental in mediating the conflict and facilitating negotiations between the Serbian government and the KLA. The European Union, particularly Germany and France, also played a significant role in the intervention. Germany, for instance, was instrumental in providing logistical support and troops for the intervention, while France played a key role in negotiating the terms of the intervention.

##### NATO

NATO, as an international military alliance, was also a key actor in the intervention. The alliance was instrumental in providing air support for the KLA and in enforcing the no-fly zone over Kosovo. The intervention marked the first time in its history that NATO had launched an offensive without the approval of the United Nations Security Council.

##### The KLA

The KLA, or the Kosovo Liberation Army, was another key actor in the intervention. The KLA was formed in 1998 by Albanian nationalists seeking to establish an independent state of Kosovo. The KLA played a crucial role in the intervention by providing ground support and intelligence to the NATO forces.

##### The Serbian Government

The Serbian government, led by President Slobodan Milošević, was another key actor in the intervention. The government was responsible for the human rights abuses and ethnic cleansing that sparked the intervention. The government's actions were a direct response to the KLA's insurgency and its attempts to establish an independent state of Kosovo.

In conclusion, the intervention in Kosovo was a complex affair involving a multitude of actors with varying interests. Each of these actors played a crucial role in shaping the intervention and its outcome. Understanding the interests and motivations of these actors is crucial to understanding the dynamics of the intervention and its impact on the region.

#### 17.2b Strategies and Tactics

The intervention in Kosovo was a complex operation that required a multitude of strategies and tactics. These strategies and tactics were employed by both the international actors involved in the intervention and the local ethnic groups.

##### Strategies and Tactics of International Actors

The international actors involved in the intervention employed a variety of strategies and tactics. The United Nations, for instance, employed a strategy of mediation and negotiation in an attempt to resolve the conflict peacefully. This strategy involved facilitating talks between the Serbian government and the KLA, with the aim of reaching a mutually agreeable solution. The European Union, particularly Germany and France, also employed a strategy of mediation and negotiation, but with a focus on facilitating the terms of the intervention.

NATO, on the other hand, employed a strategy of air power and a no-fly zone. This strategy involved using air power to support the KLA and to enforce a no-fly zone over Kosovo. This was a significant departure from NATO's traditional role of defending its member states, and marked the first time in its history that the alliance had launched an offensive without the approval of the United Nations Security Council.

##### Strategies and Tactics of Local Ethnic Groups

The local ethnic groups in Kosovo also employed a variety of strategies and tactics. The Albanian population, for instance, employed a strategy of resistance and insurgency, with the KLA serving as their primary armed force. This strategy involved engaging in guerrilla warfare against the Serbian forces and seeking international support for their cause.

The Serbian population, on the other hand, employed a strategy of control and suppression. This strategy involved using military force to maintain control over Kosovo and to suppress the Albanian population. This strategy was largely successful until the intervention, when it was met with international opposition and military force.

##### Strategies and Tactics of the Intervention

The intervention itself employed a variety of strategies and tactics. The United Nations, NATO, and the European Union all played a role in the intervention, with each employing their own strategies and tactics. The intervention also involved a combination of diplomatic efforts, military operations, and humanitarian aid.

The diplomatic efforts involved mediation and negotiation, as well as efforts to gain international support for the intervention. The military operations involved air strikes and ground operations, with the aim of protecting the Albanian population and forcing the Serbian forces to withdraw. The humanitarian aid involved providing assistance to the displaced population and rebuilding efforts.

In conclusion, the intervention in Kosovo was a complex affair that required a multitude of strategies and tactics. These strategies and tactics were employed by both the international actors involved in the intervention and the local ethnic groups, and were crucial to the success of the intervention.

#### 17.2c Outcomes and Impacts

The intervention in Kosovo had significant outcomes and impacts, both in the short term and long term. These outcomes and impacts were largely a result of the strategies and tactics employed by the international actors involved in the intervention and the local ethnic groups.

##### Short-Term Outcomes

In the short term, the intervention resulted in a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo. This was largely due to the strategy of air power and the no-fly zone employed by NATO. The air strikes and the threat of further military action forced the Serbian forces to withdraw, thereby ending the conflict.

The intervention also resulted in the establishment of a United Nations mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), which was tasked with overseeing the peace process and facilitating the return of displaced persons. This was a direct result of the United Nations' strategy of mediation and negotiation.

##### Long-Term Impacts

In the long term, the intervention had a profound impact on the political and social landscape of Kosovo. The intervention led to the establishment of an independent Kosovo, which had been a long-standing goal of the Albanian population. This was a direct result of the KLA's strategy of resistance and insurgency.

The intervention also led to a significant improvement in the human rights situation in Kosovo. The United Nations and other international organizations were able to monitor and report on human rights abuses, leading to increased accountability and improved conditions for the local population.

##### Impact on International Relations

The intervention in Kosovo also had a significant impact on international relations. The intervention marked the first time in its history that NATO had launched an offensive without the approval of the United Nations Security Council. This raised questions about the legitimacy of NATO's actions and the role of international organizations in conflict resolution.

The intervention also highlighted the importance of international cooperation in conflict resolution. The involvement of the United Nations, NATO, and the European Union demonstrated the need for a coordinated approach to addressing complex conflicts.

In conclusion, the intervention in Kosovo had significant outcomes and impacts, both in the short term and long term. These outcomes and impacts were largely a result of the strategies and tactics employed by the international actors involved in the intervention and the local ethnic groups.

#### 17.2b Strategies and Tactics

The intervention in Kosovo was a complex operation that required a multitude of strategies and tactics. These strategies and tactics were employed by both the intervention forces and the KLA, and they played a crucial role in the outcome of the conflict.

##### Strategies of the Intervention Forces

The intervention forces, primarily NATO and the United Nations, employed a combination of diplomatic, economic, and military strategies. Diplomatically, they sought to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict, with the ultimate goal of establishing a stable and democratic Kosovo. Economically, they imposed sanctions on Yugoslavia, hoping to weaken the Serbian government and create conditions for a peaceful resolution. Militarily, they enforced a no-fly zone over Kosovo and provided air support for the KLA.

##### Tactics of the Intervention Forces

The intervention forces also employed a variety of tactics. Diplomatically, they engaged in shuttle diplomacy, with representatives of the United States, Russia, and NATO shuttling between Belgrade and Pristina to negotiate a settlement. Economically, they imposed a trade embargo on Yugoslavia, restricting its access to international markets. Militarily, they conducted a bombing campaign against Serbian forces in Kosovo, targeting their military and infrastructure.

##### Strategies of the KLA

The KLA, on the other hand, employed a combination of guerrilla warfare and diplomatic strategies. Guerrilla warfare was used to disrupt Serbian control of Kosovo and to create conditions for a negotiated settlement. Diplomatically, the KLA sought international recognition and support, particularly from the United States and NATO.

##### Tactics of the KLA

The KLA employed a variety of tactics. Guerrilla warfare involved hit-and-run attacks, ambushes, and sabotage. Diplomatically, the KLA sought to internationalize the conflict by appealing to international organizations and states for support. They also sought to portray themselves as the legitimate representatives of the Albanian population in Kosovo.

In conclusion, the intervention in Kosovo was a complex affair that required a multitude of strategies and tactics. The strategies and tactics employed by the intervention forces and the KLA played a crucial role in the outcome of the conflict.

#### 17.2c Outcomes and Impacts

### Subsection: 17.2c Outcomes and Impacts

The intervention in Kosovo had significant outcomes and impacts, both in the short term and long term. These outcomes and impacts were largely a result of the strategies and tactics employed by the intervention forces and the KLA.

#### Short-Term Outcomes

In the short term, the intervention resulted in a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo. This was achieved through the diplomatic efforts of the intervention forces, particularly the United States and Russia, and the military pressure exerted by NATO. The intervention also led to the establishment of a UN peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, which helped to maintain stability and prevent further violence.

#### Long-Term Impacts

The long-term impacts of the intervention are more complex and multifaceted. On one hand, the intervention helped to establish Kosovo as an independent state, with its own government and constitution. This was a significant achievement, given the history of Serbian control over Kosovo. On the other hand, the intervention also led to a deepening of ethnic divisions in Kosovo, as the intervention forces were seen as favoring the Albanian majority over the Serbian minority. This has led to ongoing tensions and conflicts in Kosovo, particularly in the north of the country, where Serbian forces continue to maintain a presence.

#### Economic Impacts

The intervention also had significant economic impacts. The trade embargo imposed by the intervention forces led to a severe economic crisis in Yugoslavia, which contributed to the downfall of the Milosevic regime. However, the economic situation in Kosovo itself remains challenging, with high unemployment and poverty rates. The intervention also led to significant reconstruction efforts, which have helped to improve infrastructure and living conditions in Kosovo, but have also been criticized for being insufficient and inefficient.

#### Humanitarian Impacts

The intervention had a profound impact on the humanitarian situation in Kosovo. The bombing campaign conducted by NATO resulted in significant civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure. However, the intervention also led to the delivery of humanitarian aid to the population of Kosovo, which helped to alleviate the suffering caused by the conflict.

In conclusion, the intervention in Kosovo had significant outcomes and impacts, both in the short term and long term. While it helped to achieve a peaceful resolution to the conflict and establish Kosovo as an independent state, it also led to ongoing tensions and challenges. The lessons learned from this intervention are crucial for future interventions by great powers.

### Conclusion

The intervention in Kosovo serves as a case study that highlights the complexities and challenges of great power military intervention. The intervention, which was primarily led by NATO, was aimed at protecting the ethnic Albanian population from violence and discrimination by Serbian forces.

### Subsection: 18.1a Historical Context

The intervention in Iraq is a complex and controversial topic that has been extensively studied and debated. To fully understand the context of this intervention, it is important to examine the historical events that led up to it.

#### The Rise of Saddam Hussein

In 1968, a group of military officers, including Saddam Hussein, overthrew the Iraqi government in a coup d'état. Hussein quickly rose to power and became the leader of the Ba'ath Party, a socialist political party that advocated for Arab nationalism and socialism. Under Hussein's rule, Iraq became a dictatorship with a strong emphasis on Arab nationalism and anti-Western sentiment.

#### The Iran-Iraq War

In 1980, Iraq invaded Iran, sparking a long and devastating war that lasted until 1988. The war was a result of historical tensions between the two countries, with both sides claiming ownership of the disputed Shatt al-Arab waterway. The war was marked by chemical warfare, with Iraq using mustard gas and nerve agents against Iranian troops. This use of chemical weapons would later be used as justification for the United States' intervention in Iraq.

#### The Gulf War

In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, sparking the Gulf War. The United States, along with other Western powers, saw this as an opportunity to remove Saddam Hussein from power and prevent Iraq from gaining control of the region's oil reserves. The Gulf War was a short and decisive conflict, with the United States and its allies quickly defeating Iraqi forces. However, the war did not result in the removal of Saddam Hussein, and the country was left in a state of political and economic instability.

#### The Aftermath of the Gulf War

After the Gulf War, the United States and its allies imposed sanctions on Iraq, limiting its ability to rebuild and recover from the war. These sanctions were intended to weaken Iraq's military and prevent it from developing weapons of mass destruction. However, they also had a devastating impact on the civilian population, leading to shortages of food, medicine, and other essential goods.

#### The Justification for Intervention

The United States and its allies used several justifications for intervening in Iraq. One of the main reasons was the belief that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, specifically chemical and biological weapons. This belief was based on intelligence reports and the belief that Iraq had not fully complied with United Nations resolutions requiring it to destroy its weapons of mass destruction.

Another justification for intervention was the belief that Saddam Hussein's regime posed a threat to regional stability and the United States' interests in the Middle East. The United States also saw intervention as an opportunity to promote democracy and human rights in the region.

#### The Consequences of Intervention

The intervention in Iraq has had far-reaching consequences, both for the region and the world. The invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq led to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime, but it also resulted in a prolonged and costly occupation. The country has faced ongoing political instability and violence, with sectarian divisions and external influences contributing to the ongoing conflict.

The intervention has also had implications for the United States' image and standing in the world. The invasion was met with widespread international condemnation, and the subsequent occupation and handling of the country have been criticized for their lack of success and the resulting humanitarian crisis.

In conclusion, the intervention in Iraq is a complex and controversial topic that has been shaped by historical events and political motivations. The United States' decision to intervene in Iraq has had significant consequences for the region and the world, and its impact continues to be studied and debated today.





### Subsection: 18.1b The Iraq War

The Iraq War, also known as the Second Gulf War, was a major international conflict that lasted from 2003 to 2011. It was a result of the United States' decision to invade Iraq and overthrow the regime of Saddam Hussein. The war was a significant event in the history of Iraq and had far-reaching consequences for the region and the world.

#### The Invasion of Iraq

In 2002, the United States, along with its allies, began to build a case for invading Iraq. The main justification for the invasion was the belief that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), including nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. This belief was based on intelligence reports and claims made by Iraqi defectors. However, it was later revealed that these claims were based on false information and there were no WMDs in Iraq.

On March 19, 2003, the United States, along with its allies, invaded Iraq. The invasion was met with widespread international condemnation, with many countries and organizations, including the United Nations, opposing the invasion. The invasion was also met with resistance from Iraqi forces, who put up a strong fight against the invading forces.

#### The Occupation of Iraq

After the invasion, the United States and its allies faced the challenge of occupying and rebuilding Iraq. The country was in a state of political and economic instability, with a history of dictatorship and war. The occupation was marked by violence and instability, with insurgent groups and sectarian violence causing chaos and hindering the efforts of the occupying forces.

The occupation also faced challenges in rebuilding the country. The infrastructure was in ruins, and the country's economy was struggling. The United States and its allies faced criticism for their handling of the occupation, with many arguing that they were not equipped to rebuild a country with such a complex history and political landscape.

#### The Withdrawal of U.S. Forces

In 2011, the United States announced its plans to withdraw all of its troops from Iraq. The withdrawal was a result of the growing instability and violence in the country, as well as the increasing pressure from the Iraqi government for the U.S. forces to leave. The withdrawal was completed in December 2011, marking the end of the U.S. occupation of Iraq.

#### The Aftermath of the Iraq War

The Iraq War had a significant impact on the country and the region. The invasion and occupation led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and thousands of U.S. and allied troops. The country is still struggling to rebuild and recover from the war, with ongoing political and economic challenges. The war also had consequences for the region, with the rise of ISIS and the ongoing conflict in Syria.

The Iraq War is a complex and controversial topic, with many different perspectives and opinions. It is a crucial case study in understanding the impact of great power military intervention and the challenges of rebuilding a country after a war.

### Section: 19.1 Background

The intervention in Somalia by great powers is a complex and controversial topic that has been studied extensively in the field of international relations. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive study of this intervention, examining the various factors that led to it, the actions taken by the intervening powers, and the outcomes of the intervention.

### Subsection: 19.1a Historical Context

The intervention in Somalia is a prime example of the use of military force by great powers to address conflicts and crises in other countries. It involves a series of interventions by various great powers, including the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, among others. These interventions have been motivated by a variety of factors, including humanitarian concerns, regional stability, and national interests.

The historical context of Somalia is crucial in understanding the events that led to the intervention. Somalia has a long history of conflict and instability, with a series of wars and coups d'état since gaining independence from Britain and Italy in 1960. The country has also faced natural disasters, such as droughts and famines, which have exacerbated its political and social issues.

In the late 19th century, Somalia was under the control of various European powers, with Britain controlling the northern region and Italy controlling the southern region. After World War II, Somalia gained independence and became a sovereign state. However, the country faced political instability and coups d'état, leading to the overthrow of its first president, Aden Abdulle Osman, in 1969.

The intervention in Somalia can be traced back to the early 1990s, when the country faced a civil war between the northern region, controlled by the Somali National Movement (SNM), and the southern region, controlled by the United Somali Congress (USC). The conflict was fueled by ethnic and clan tensions, as well as political and economic differences.

The intervention by great powers began in 1992, when the United States, under the leadership of President George H.W. Bush, intervened in Somalia as part of a UN peacekeeping mission. The intervention was motivated by humanitarian concerns, as the country was facing a severe famine and needed assistance. However, the intervention quickly turned into a military operation as the US and other great powers became involved in the ongoing civil war.

The intervention also had regional implications, as neighboring countries, such as Ethiopia and Kenya, were also affected by the conflict in Somalia. The intervention aimed to stabilize the region and prevent the spread of violence and instability.

The intervention in Somalia has been a controversial topic, with many arguing that it was a mistake and others arguing that it was necessary to address the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis. The intervention also raised questions about the role of great powers in intervening in the affairs of other countries, and the ethical considerations surrounding such interventions.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the historical context of Somalia and examine the events that led to the intervention. We will also explore the actions taken by the intervening powers and the outcomes of the intervention.

### Subsection: 19.1b The Somali Conflict

The Somali conflict, also known as the Somali Civil War, has been a major factor in the intervention by great powers in Somalia. The conflict began in 1991, when the country faced a coup d'état led by Mohamed Siad Barre, who overthrew the government of President Mohamed Siad Barre. This coup marked the beginning of a long and complex conflict that has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and has led to a humanitarian crisis.

The Somali conflict is a result of a combination of factors, including ethnic and clan tensions, political instability, and economic disparities. The country is home to a diverse population, with various ethnic groups and clans vying for power and control. This has led to a fragmented and fractured political landscape, making it difficult for any single group to gain control and establish a stable government.

The conflict has also been fueled by external factors, including the involvement of neighboring countries and international powers. Ethiopia, Kenya, and Eritrea have all been involved in the conflict, either supporting one side or intervening directly. The United States, France, and the United Kingdom have also played a role, with the US conducting airstrikes against terrorist groups operating in Somalia.

The intervention by great powers in Somalia has been a response to the ongoing conflict and the humanitarian crisis it has created. The US, in particular, has been heavily involved in the intervention, with its military conducting operations in Somalia since 1992. These operations have been aimed at addressing the root causes of the conflict and promoting stability in the region.

However, the intervention has not been without controversy. Critics argue that the US and other great powers have been motivated by their own interests, rather than solely humanitarian concerns. They also argue that the intervention has not been effective in addressing the underlying issues that have led to the conflict.

Despite these criticisms, the intervention in Somalia remains a crucial aspect of international relations. The ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in Somalia continue to pose a threat to regional stability and global security. As such, it is essential for great powers to remain involved and work towards a resolution that addresses the root causes of the conflict and promotes long-term stability in the region.
