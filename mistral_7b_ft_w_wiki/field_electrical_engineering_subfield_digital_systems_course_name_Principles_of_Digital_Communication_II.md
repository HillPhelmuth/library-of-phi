## Foreward

Welcome to "Principles of Digital Communication II: A Comprehensive Guide to Advanced Digital Communication Concepts". This book is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of advanced digital communication concepts, building upon the foundational knowledge established in the first volume.

In this volume, we delve deeper into the intricacies of digital communication, exploring topics such as multidimensional digital pre-distortion (MDDPD). MDDPD is a crucial aspect of digital communication, particularly in the context of wireless communication systems. It is a technique used to compensate for the non-linearities present in the communication channel, thereby improving the overall quality of the received signal.

The derivation and differentiation of MDDPD from one-dimensional digital pre-distortion (1DDPD) is a key focus of this book. We explore the use of two orthogonal signals in MDDPD, which are frequency translated by ω<sub>1</sub> and ω<sub>2</sub>. This allows for the creation of a fifth odd-only order nonlinear one-dimensional memory polynomial, which is a fundamental component of MDDPD.

The book also delves into the mathematical representations of these concepts. For instance, the in-band terms that come from the expansion of the polynomials in MDDPD are represented as equations ((<EquationNote|11>)) and ((<EquationNote|12>)), while the out-of-band terms are represented as equations ((<EquationNote|5>)), ((<EquationNote|6>)), ((<EquationNote|7>)), ((<EquationNote|8>)), ((<EquationNote|9>)), and ((<EquationNote|10>)).

This book is designed to be a valuable resource for advanced undergraduate students at MIT, as well as professionals in the field of digital communication. It is our hope that this book will serve as a comprehensive guide to understanding and applying advanced digital communication concepts, and we look forward to your journey through the world of digital communication.

## Chapter 1: Introduction:

### Subsection 1.1: Introduction

Welcome to the first chapter of "Principles of Digital Communication II". In this chapter, we will be introducing the fundamental concepts and principles that govern digital communication systems. This chapter will serve as a foundation for the rest of the book, providing you with a solid understanding of the key concepts and techniques used in digital communication.

Digital communication is the process of transmitting information in the form of digital signals. These signals are represented by a sequence of discrete values, typically binary (0s and 1s), which can be easily processed and manipulated by electronic devices. In contrast to analog communication, which uses continuous signals, digital communication offers several advantages, including improved signal quality, increased bandwidth efficiency, and the ability to transmit information over long distances with minimal loss.

In this chapter, we will cover the basic principles of digital communication, including the representation of information in digital form, the encoding and decoding of digital signals, and the transmission and reception of digital signals. We will also discuss the different types of digital communication systems, such as point-to-point and broadcast systems, and the various modulation techniques used to transmit digital signals over different mediums.

### Subsection 1.1a Introduction to Sampling Theorem

The Sampling Theorem is a fundamental concept in digital communication that allows us to accurately reconstruct a continuous signal from a discrete set of samples. It is based on the Nyquist sampling theorem, which states that in order to accurately reconstruct a continuous signal, we must sample it at a rate greater than twice its bandwidth.

The Sampling Theorem is closely related to the concept of orthonormal PAM/QAM, which is a modulation technique used to transmit digital signals over a communication channel. In orthonormal PAM/QAM, the digital signal is represented by a set of orthogonal signals, each with a different amplitude and phase. This allows for efficient use of the available bandwidth and reduces the effects of noise and interference.

To understand the Sampling Theorem and orthonormal PAM/QAM, we must first understand the concept of orthonormal signals. An orthonormal signal is a signal that is orthogonal to all other signals in the set, meaning that their inner product is equal to zero. This property allows us to represent any signal as a linear combination of orthonormal signals, with each signal having a different weight.

The Sampling Theorem states that in order to accurately reconstruct a continuous signal from a discrete set of samples, the samples must be taken at a rate greater than twice the bandwidth of the signal. This is because the Nyquist sampling theorem states that the bandwidth of a signal is equal to the maximum frequency component of the signal. By sampling the signal at a rate greater than twice its bandwidth, we ensure that we capture all the frequency components of the signal.

In orthonormal PAM/QAM, the digital signal is represented by a set of orthonormal signals, each with a different amplitude and phase. This allows for efficient use of the available bandwidth and reduces the effects of noise and interference. The Sampling Theorem is crucial in this modulation technique, as it ensures that the digital signal can be accurately reconstructed from the discrete set of samples.

In the next section, we will explore the proof of the Sampling Theorem and its implications in digital communication. We will also discuss the concept of orthonormal PAM/QAM in more detail and its applications in digital communication systems.

It is a form of QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) where the signals are orthogonal to each other. This means that the signals are independent and do not interfere with each other, allowing for efficient use of the available bandwidth.

### Subsection 1.2a Definition of AWGN Channels

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of orthonormal signals and their role in digital communication. In this section, we will focus on the capacity of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, which is a fundamental concept in digital communication.

An AWGN channel is a communication channel that is subject to additive white Gaussian noise. This type of channel is commonly used in digital communication systems, as it provides a simple and realistic model for understanding the effects of noise on communication signals.

The capacity of an AWGN channel is defined as the maximum rate at which information can be reliably transmitted over the channel. In other words, it is the maximum rate at which the channel can be used to transmit information without errors.

The capacity of an AWGN channel is affected by several factors, including the bandwidth of the channel, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the modulation scheme used. The bandwidth of the channel determines the maximum frequency range over which the channel can transmit information. The SNR is the ratio of the power of the signal to the power of the noise. The modulation scheme used determines how the digital information is encoded into the analog signal.

The capacity of an AWGN channel can be calculated using the Shannon-Hartley theorem, which states that the capacity of an AWGN channel is given by:

$$
C = B \log_2(1 + SNR)
$$

where $C$ is the capacity of the channel, $B$ is the bandwidth of the channel, and $SNR$ is the signal-to-noise ratio.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of channel coding, which is a technique used to improve the reliability of communication over noisy channels. We will also explore the relationship between channel coding and the capacity of AWGN channels.





#### 1.2b Capacity Calculation

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and their importance in digital communication. In this section, we will delve deeper into the calculation of the capacity of AWGN channels.

The capacity of an AWGN channel is a crucial metric that determines the maximum rate at which information can be reliably transmitted over the channel. It is affected by various factors, including the bandwidth of the channel, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the modulation scheme used.

The capacity of an AWGN channel can be calculated using the Shannon-Hartley theorem, which states that the capacity of an AWGN channel is given by:

$$
C = B \log_2(1 + SNR)
$$

where $C$ is the capacity of the channel, $B$ is the bandwidth of the channel, and $SNR$ is the signal-to-noise ratio.

The bandwidth of the channel, $B$, is the maximum frequency range over which the channel can transmit information. It is typically measured in Hertz (Hz) and is a fixed value for a given channel.

The signal-to-noise ratio, $SNR$, is the ratio of the power of the signal to the power of the noise. It is a measure of the quality of the signal and is affected by the level of noise present in the channel. The higher the SNR, the better the quality of the signal and the higher the capacity of the channel.

The modulation scheme used also plays a crucial role in the calculation of the capacity of an AWGN channel. Different modulation schemes have different bandwidth requirements and SNR requirements, which can affect the overall capacity of the channel.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of modulation schemes used in digital communication and their impact on the capacity of AWGN channels. 





#### 1.2c Applications of AWGN Channels

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and their importance in digital communication. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of AWGN channels in digital communication systems.

One of the main applications of AWGN channels is in the design of communication systems. The capacity of an AWGN channel, as calculated using the Shannon-Hartley theorem, serves as a benchmark for the design of communication systems. It provides a theoretical limit on the maximum rate at which information can be reliably transmitted over the channel. This allows engineers to design systems that approach this limit, maximizing the efficiency of the channel.

Another important application of AWGN channels is in the analysis of communication systems. By studying the behavior of AWGN channels, engineers can gain insights into the performance of communication systems. This can help in identifying potential areas for improvement and optimizing the system for better performance.

AWGN channels also play a crucial role in the development of error correction codes. These codes are used to detect and correct errors that occur during transmission over a noisy channel. By studying the behavior of AWGN channels, engineers can design error correction codes that are optimized for the specific characteristics of the channel.

In addition to these applications, AWGN channels are also used in the study of information theory. Information theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the quantification, storage, and communication of information. By studying AWGN channels, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental limits of communication systems and develop new techniques for improving their performance.

In conclusion, AWGN channels have a wide range of applications in digital communication systems. From the design and analysis of communication systems to the development of error correction codes and the study of information theory, AWGN channels play a crucial role in advancing the field of digital communication.

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of digital communication and its importance in today's world. We discussed the basics of digital communication systems and how they are used to transmit information. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the performance of small signal constellations, a crucial aspect of digital communication.

Small signal constellations are used in digital communication systems to transmit information. They are a set of points in a multi-dimensional space, each representing a different symbol or message. The performance of these constellations is crucial as it determines the quality of the transmitted signal.

In this chapter, we will explore the various factors that affect the performance of small signal constellations. We will discuss the concept of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and its importance in determining the performance of a constellation. We will also cover the concept of error probability and its relationship with the performance of a constellation.

This knowledge will serve as a strong foundation for the rest of the book, as we continue to explore the principles of digital communication. So let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of small signal constellations.




### Subsection: 2.1a Introduction to Decoding

In the previous chapter, we discussed the concept of small signal constellations and their importance in digital communication systems. We also briefly mentioned the concept of decoding, which is the process of recovering the transmitted information from the received signal. In this section, we will delve deeper into the topic of decoding and explore the different types of decoding techniques used in digital communication systems.

Decoding is a crucial step in the digital communication process as it allows us to recover the transmitted information accurately. In the presence of noise and interference, the received signal may be corrupted, making it difficult to recover the transmitted information. Therefore, decoding techniques are essential to mitigate the effects of noise and interference and ensure reliable communication.

There are two main types of decoding techniques used in digital communication systems: hard-decision decoding and soft-decision decoding. Hard-decision decoding is a simple and commonly used technique that makes a binary decision on the received signal. On the other hand, soft-decision decoding takes into account the uncertainty in the received signal and provides a more accurate decoding result.

#### Hard-decision Decoding

Hard-decision decoding is a simple and commonly used technique in digital communication systems. It works by comparing the received signal to a predetermined set of points in the constellation. If the received signal falls within the boundaries of a point, it is decoded as that point. Otherwise, it is decoded as an error.

The main advantage of hard-decision decoding is its simplicity, making it easy to implement. However, it is also prone to errors, especially in the presence of noise and interference. This is because the received signal may not fall exactly within the boundaries of a point, leading to decoding errors.

#### Soft-decision Decoding

Soft-decision decoding takes into account the uncertainty in the received signal and provides a more accurate decoding result. It works by assigning a probability to each point in the constellation based on the received signal. The point with the highest probability is then decoded as the transmitted signal.

Soft-decision decoding is more complex than hard-decision decoding, but it provides better performance in the presence of noise and interference. By taking into account the uncertainty in the received signal, it can provide more accurate decoding results. However, it also requires more computational resources and is more difficult to implement.

### Conclusion

In this section, we have introduced the concept of decoding and explored the two main types of decoding techniques used in digital communication systems: hard-decision decoding and soft-decision decoding. Hard-decision decoding is a simple and commonly used technique, while soft-decision decoding takes into account the uncertainty in the received signal and provides more accurate decoding results. In the next section, we will delve deeper into the performance of small signal constellations and explore how decoding techniques affect their performance.





### Subsection: 2.1b Hard-decision Decoding

Hard-decision decoding is a simple and commonly used technique in digital communication systems. It works by comparing the received signal to a predetermined set of points in the constellation. If the received signal falls within the boundaries of a point, it is decoded as that point. Otherwise, it is decoded as an error.

The main advantage of hard-decision decoding is its simplicity, making it easy to implement. However, it is also prone to errors, especially in the presence of noise and interference. This is because the received signal may not fall exactly within the boundaries of a point, leading to decoding errors.

#### Hard-decision Decoding Algorithm

The hard-decision decoding algorithm is a simple and efficient algorithm used to decode small signal constellations. It works by comparing the received signal to a predetermined set of points in the constellation. If the received signal falls within the boundaries of a point, it is decoded as that point. Otherwise, it is decoded as an error.

The algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:

1. Initialize the decoding process by setting the decoding state to the initial state.
2. For each received signal, compare it to the points in the constellation. If the received signal falls within the boundaries of a point, set the decoding state to that point. Otherwise, set the decoding state to the error state.
3. If the decoding state is not the error state, decode the received signal as the corresponding point in the constellation.
4. If the decoding state is the error state, decode the received signal as an error.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for each received signal.

The hard-decision decoding algorithm is simple and efficient, making it a popular choice in digital communication systems. However, it is also prone to errors, especially in the presence of noise and interference. This is because the received signal may not fall exactly within the boundaries of a point, leading to decoding errors.

#### Performance of Hard-decision Decoding

The performance of hard-decision decoding is affected by various factors, including the size of the constellation, the number of points in the constellation, and the presence of noise and interference. In general, the performance of hard-decision decoding decreases as the size of the constellation increases. This is because a larger constellation means more points to compare the received signal to, increasing the chances of decoding errors.

Furthermore, the performance of hard-decision decoding is also affected by the number of points in the constellation. A larger number of points in the constellation means more possible decoding states, increasing the complexity of the decoding process and decreasing the chances of decoding errors.

In the presence of noise and interference, the performance of hard-decision decoding is significantly affected. Noise and interference can cause the received signal to deviate from the expected boundaries of a point, leading to decoding errors. This is especially problematic in small signal constellations, where the boundaries between points are closer together, making it easier for noise and interference to cause decoding errors.

In conclusion, while hard-decision decoding is a simple and efficient technique, its performance is limited by the size of the constellation, the number of points in the constellation, and the presence of noise and interference. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider these factors when designing digital communication systems that use hard-decision decoding.





### Subsection: 2.1c Soft-decision Decoding

Soft-decision decoding is a more advanced technique used in digital communication systems. Unlike hard-decision decoding, it takes into account the reliability of each input data point. This extra information, often referred to as the "softness" of the data, allows for better estimates of the original data, leading to improved decoding performance.

#### Soft-decision Decoding Algorithm

The soft-decision decoding algorithm is a more complex but also more accurate version of the hard-decision decoding algorithm. It works by comparing the received signal to a predetermined set of points in the constellation, just like the hard-decision decoding algorithm. However, it also takes into account the reliability of each point, which is represented by a confidence value.

The algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:

1. Initialize the decoding process by setting the decoding state to the initial state.
2. For each received signal, compare it to the points in the constellation. If the received signal falls within the boundaries of a point, set the decoding state to that point. Otherwise, set the decoding state to the error state.
3. If the decoding state is not the error state, decode the received signal as the corresponding point in the constellation.
4. If the decoding state is the error state, decode the received signal as an error.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for each received signal.

The soft-decision decoding algorithm is more complex than the hard-decision decoding algorithm, but it offers improved performance, especially in the presence of noise and interference. By taking into account the reliability of each input data point, it can provide more accurate decoding results.

#### Soft-decision Decoding and Error Correction Codes

Soft-decision decoding is often used in conjunction with error correction codes. These codes are designed to detect and correct errors in the transmitted data. By using soft-decision decoding, the error correction codes can take into account the reliability of each data point, leading to improved error detection and correction.

One example of an error correction code that uses soft-decision decoding is the Viterbi decoder. The Viterbi decoder is a dynamic programming algorithm that finds the most likely sequence of transmitted symbols, given the received symbols. It uses soft-decision decoding to take into account the reliability of each symbol, leading to improved decoding performance.

Another example is the turbo code decoder. Turbo codes are a type of error correction code that uses two parallel convolutional encoders and decoders. The decoding process involves iterating between the two decoders, using soft-decision decoding at each iteration. This allows for improved error detection and correction, especially in the presence of noise and interference.

In conclusion, soft-decision decoding is a powerful technique in digital communication systems. By taking into account the reliability of each input data point, it can provide improved decoding performance, especially in the presence of noise and interference. Its use in conjunction with error correction codes makes it an essential tool in modern digital communication systems.

## Chapter 3: Introduction to Binary Block Codes:

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we discussed the fundamentals of digital communication and the role of codes in transmitting information. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the world of codes and explore binary block codes. These codes are widely used in digital communication systems and play a crucial role in ensuring reliable transmission of information.

Binary block codes are a type of error-correcting code that is used to detect and correct errors in transmitted data. They are called "block" codes because they operate on blocks of data, rather than individual bits. These codes are particularly useful in situations where the transmitted data is prone to errors, such as in noisy communication channels.

In this chapter, we will cover the basics of binary block codes, including their structure, encoding, and decoding processes. We will also discuss the different types of binary block codes, such as Hamming codes and Reed-Solomon codes, and their applications in digital communication systems.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of binary block codes and their importance in digital communication. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the more advanced topics covered in the subsequent chapters. So let's dive in and explore the world of binary block codes.




### Section 3.1 Introduction to Finite Fields

Finite fields are an essential concept in the study of binary block codes. They provide a mathematical framework for understanding the structure and properties of these codes. In this section, we will introduce the concept of finite fields and discuss their role in binary block codes.

#### 3.1a Definition of Finite Fields

A finite field is a field that contains a finite number of elements. As with any field, a finite field is a set on which the operations of multiplication, addition, subtraction, and division are defined and satisfy certain basic rules. The most common examples of finite fields are given by the integers modulo a prime number, denoted as $\mathbb{Z}_p$.

The order of a finite field is its number of elements, which is either a prime number or a prime power. For every prime number $p$ and every positive integer $k$, there are fields of order $p^k$, all of which are isomorphic. This means that all finite fields of the same order are mathematically equivalent and can be represented by the same set of elements.

Finite fields are fundamental in a number of areas of mathematics and computer science, including number theory, algebraic geometry, Galois theory, finite geometry, cryptography, and coding theory. They are particularly important in coding theory, as they provide a mathematical framework for understanding the structure and properties of error-correcting codes.

#### 3.1b Properties of Finite Fields

A finite field is a finite set which is a field; this means that multiplication, addition, subtraction, and division (excluding division by zero) are defined and satisfy the rules of arithmetic known as the field axioms. The number of elements of a finite field is called its "order" or, sometimes, its "size". A finite field of order $q$ exists if and only if $q$ is a prime power (where $p$ is a prime number and $k$ is a positive integer).

One of the key properties of finite fields is that they are always of characteristic $p$, where $p$ is the prime number used to construct the field. This means that the polynomial $x^p - x$ has all elements of the finite field as roots. The non-zero elements of a finite field form a multiplicative group. This group is cyclic, so all non-zero elements of a finite field are roots of the polynomial $x^{q-1} - 1$.

#### 3.1c Applications of Finite Fields

Finite fields have a wide range of applications in digital communication. One of the most important applications is in the construction of error-correcting codes. Finite fields provide a mathematical framework for understanding the structure and properties of these codes, and they are used to construct efficient and reliable codes for transmitting information over noisy channels.

Another important application of finite fields is in cryptography. Finite fields are used to construct cryptographic systems, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is widely used for secure communication. Finite fields also play a crucial role in the study of elliptic curves, which are used in public key cryptography.

In addition to these applications, finite fields are also used in other areas of digital communication, such as signal processing, modulation, and coding theory. They provide a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the behavior of digital systems, and they are essential for the development of modern communication technologies.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of finite fields in more detail and discuss their role in binary block codes. We will also introduce the concept of finite field arithmetic and discuss its applications in digital communication.

#### Finite field construction

A complete set of MOLS(`q`) exists whenever `q` is a prime or prime power. This follows from a construction that is based on a finite field GF(`q`), which only exist if `q` is a prime or prime power. The multiplicative group of GF(`q`) is a cyclic group, and so, has a generator, λ, meaning that all the non-zero elements of the field can be expressed as distinct powers of λ. Name the `q` elements of GF(`q`) as follows: 

Now, λ<sup>`q`-1</sup> = 1 and the product rule in terms of the α's is α<sub>`i`</sub>α<sub>`j`</sub> = α<sub>`t`</sub>, where `t` = `i` + `j` -1 (mod `q` -1). The Latin squares are constructed as follows, the (`i, j`)th entry in Latin square L<sub>`r`</sub> (with `r` ≠ 0) is L<sub>`r`</sub>(`i,j`) = α<sub>`i`</sub> + α<sub>`r`</sub>α<sub>`j`</sub>, where all the operations occur in GF(`q`). In the case that the field is a prime field (`q` = `p` a prime), where the field elements are represented in the usual way, as the integers modulo `p`, the naming convention above can be dropped and the construction rule can be simplified to L<sub>`r`</sub>(`i,j`) = `i` + `rj`, where `r` ≠ 0 and `i`, `j` and `r` are elements of GF(`p`) and all operations are in GF(`p`). The MOLS(4) and MOLS(5) examples above arose from this construction, although with a change of alphabet.

Not all complete sets of MOLS arise from this construction. The projective plane that is associated with the complete set of MOLS obtained from this field construction is a special type, a Desarguesian projective plane. There exist non-Desarguesian projective planes and their corresponding complete sets of MOLS can not be obtained from this construction.

The most common examples of finite fields are given by the integers modulo a prime number, denoted as $\mathbb{Z}_p$.

This means that all finite fields of the same order are mathematically equivalent and can be represented by the same set of elements.

The number of elements of a finite field is called its "order" or, sometimes, its "size". A finite field of order $q$ exists if and only if $q$ is a prime power (where $p$ is a prime number and $k$ is a positive integer).

One of the key properties of finite fields is that they are algebraically closed. This means that every polynomial of degree $n$ over a finite field has at most $n$ roots. In other words, the only irreducible polynomials over a finite field are those of degree 1. This property is crucial in the study of finite fields, as it allows us to easily construct finite fields of any desired order.

Another important property of finite fields is that they are isomorphic to the multiplicative group of a finite field. This means that the multiplicative group of a finite field is cyclic, and therefore has a generator. This generator is known as a primitive element, and it plays a crucial role in the construction of finite fields.

Finally, finite fields have a unique decomposition into a direct product of cyclic groups. This decomposition is known as the cyclic decomposition of a finite field, and it is given by the following theorem:

**Theorem 3.1**: Let $F$ be a finite field of order $q = p^k$, where $p$ is a prime number and $k$ is a positive integer. Then, $F$ is isomorphic to the direct product of $k$ cyclic groups of order $p$:

$$
F \cong \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_p
$$

This theorem is crucial in the study of finite fields, as it allows us to understand the structure of finite fields in terms of cyclic groups. It also provides a way to construct finite fields of any desired order, by taking the direct product of cyclic groups of appropriate orders.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of finite fields in the study of binary block codes.





### Section: 3.1 Introduction to Finite Fields:

Finite fields are a fundamental concept in the study of digital communication. They are mathematical structures that generalize the concept of a field, but with a finite number of elements. In this section, we will introduce the concept of finite fields and discuss their properties and applications.

#### 3.1a Definition of Finite Fields

A finite field is a field with a finite number of elements. In other words, it is a set of numbers that satisfies the field axioms, but with a finite number of elements. The simplest example of a finite field is the set of integers modulo `p`, where `p` is a prime number. This set, denoted as `GF(p)`, forms a field under the operations of addition and multiplication modulo `p`.

Finite fields are important in digital communication because they provide a finite set of values that can be used to represent information. For example, in binary communication, the information is represented by the values `0` and `1`. In a binary block code, the information is represented by the values of a finite field. This allows for the efficient representation and transmission of information.

#### 3.1b Properties of Finite Fields

Finite fields have several important properties that make them useful in digital communication. These properties include:

1. Finite fields are commutative: The operations of addition and multiplication in a finite field are commutative, i.e., `a + b = b + a` and `a * b = b * a`.

2. Finite fields are associative: The operations of addition and multiplication in a finite field are associative, i.e., `(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)` and `(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)`.

3. Finite fields have an identity element: The element `0` is the identity element for addition, and the element `1` is the identity element for multiplication.

4. Finite fields have inverse elements: Every non-zero element in a finite field has a multiplicative inverse. This means that for any non-zero element `a`, there exists an element `a^-1` such that `a * a^-1 = 1`.

5. Finite fields are finite: As the name suggests, finite fields have a finite number of elements. This is in contrast to the infinite number of elements in a field like the real numbers.

These properties make finite fields a powerful tool in digital communication. They allow for the efficient representation and manipulation of information, which is crucial in the design of digital communication systems.

#### 3.1c Applications of Finite Fields

Finite fields have a wide range of applications in digital communication. Some of these applications include:

1. Error Correction Codes: Finite fields are used in the design of error correction codes, which are used to detect and correct errors in transmitted data. The elements of a finite field are used to represent the data, and the operations of addition and multiplication are used to encode and decode the data.

2. Cryptography: Finite fields are used in cryptography, particularly in the design of public key cryptography systems. The operations of addition and multiplication in a finite field are used to generate public and private keys, and to encrypt and decrypt messages.

3. Compressed Sensing: Finite fields are used in compressed sensing, a technique for compressing data by taking a linear combination of the data points. The operations of addition and multiplication in a finite field are used to perform the linear combination.

4. Image and Signal Processing: Finite fields are used in image and signal processing, particularly in the design of filters and transforms. The operations of addition and multiplication in a finite field are used to perform filtering and transformation operations.

In conclusion, finite fields are a fundamental concept in digital communication. Their properties and applications make them an essential tool in the design and implementation of digital communication systems. In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of binary block codes, a specific type of error correction code that is widely used in digital communication.

### Section: 4.1 Review Session:

#### 4.1a Introduction to Reed-Solomon Codes

Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are a class of error correction codes that are widely used in digital communication systems. They were first introduced by Irving S. Reed and Gustave Solomon in 1960, and have since become an essential tool in modern communication systems.

RS codes are particularly useful in situations where the channel has a high probability of bit errors. This is because they are capable of correcting multiple-bit errors, making them more powerful than other types of error correction codes.

In this section, we will review the basics of Reed-Solomon codes, including their definition and structure. We will also explore the encoding and decoding processes of these codes, as well as their error correction capabilities.

#### 4.1b Structure of Reed-Solomon Codes

RS codes are a type of cyclic code, meaning that they are generated by a cyclic shift of a single code generator polynomial. The degree of this polynomial is equal to the number of information bits in the code, and its coefficients are chosen to satisfy certain properties.

The structure of RS codes is based on finite fields, and the BRS code is based on the shift and XOR operation. BRS encoding is based on the Vandermonde matrix, and its specific encoding steps are as follows:

1. Equally divides the original data blocks into `k` blocks, and each block of data has `L`-bit data, recorded as

$$
S=(s_0,s_1...,s_{k-1})
$$

where `$s_i=s_{i,0}s_{i,1}...s_{i,L-1}$`, `$i=0,1,2...,k-1$`.

2. Builds the calibration data block `$M$`, `$M$` has a total of `$n-k$` blocks:

$$
M=(m_0,m_1...,m_{n-k-1})
$$

where `$m_i=\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}s_j(r_j^i)$`, `$i=0,1...,n-k-1$`. The addition here are all XOR operation, where `$r_j^i$` represents the number of bits of "0" added to the front of the original data block `$s_j$`. Thereby forming a parity data block `$m_i$`. `$r_j^i$` is given by the following way:

$$
(r_0^a,r_1^a...,r_{k-1}^a)=(0,a,2a...(k-1)a)
$$

where `$a=0,1...n-k-1$`.

3. Each node stores data, nodes `$N_i(i=0,1...,n-1)$` store the data as `$s_0,s_1...,s_{k-1},m_0,m_1...,m_{n-k-1}$`.

#### 4.1c BRS Encoding Example

To better understand the structure of RS codes, let's consider an example. If `$n=6,k=3$`, there `$ID_0=(0,0,0)$`, `$ID_0=(0,1,2)$`, `$ID_0=(0,2,4)$`. The original data block are `$s_i=s_0,s_1...,s_{L-1}$`, where `$i=0,1...,k-1$`. The calibration data for each block are `$m_i=m_{i,0}m_{i,1}...mx_{i,L+i\times(k-1)-1}$`, where `$i=0,1...,k-1$`.

The calculation of calibration data blocks is as follows, the addition operation represents a bit XOR operation:

$$
m_0=s_0(0)\oplus s_1(0)\oplus s_2(0)
$$

$$
m_1=s_0(0)\oplus s_1(1)\oplus s_2(2)
$$

$$
m_2=s_0(0)\oplus s_1(2)\oplus s_2(4)
$$

So `$m_0=(m_{0,0}m_{0,1}...m_{0,5})$`, `$m_1=(m_{1,0}m_{1,1}...m_{1,7})$`, `$m_2=(m_{2,0}m_{2,1}...m_{2,9})$`.

In the next section, we will explore the encoding and decoding processes of RS codes in more detail.

#### 4.1d BRS Encoding Example (Continued)

Continuing from the previous example, we have `$m_0=(m_{0,0}m_{0,1}...m_{0,5})$`, `$m_1=(m_{1,0}m_{1,1}...m_{1,7})$`, `$m_2=(m_{2,0}m_{2,1}...m_{2,9})$`.

The addition operation represents a bit XOR operation, where `$r_j^i$` represents the number of bits of "0" added to the front of the original data block `$s_j$`. Thereby forming a parity data block `$m_i$`. `$r_j^i$` is given by the following way:

$$
(r_0^a,r_1^a...,r_{k-1}^a)=(0,a,2a...(k-1)a)
$$

where `$a=0,1...n-k-1$`.

This process is repeated for each block of data, resulting in a total of `$n-k$` blocks of calibration data. These blocks are then stored along with the original data blocks at each node, forming the complete data block `$N_i(i=0,1...,n-1)$`.

In the next section, we will explore the decoding process of RS codes, where we will see how the calibration data blocks are used to correct errors in the received data.

#### 4.1e BRS Decoding Example

In this section, we will explore the decoding process of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, specifically focusing on the Binary Reed-Solomon (BRS) codes. The decoding process is crucial in correcting errors that may occur during transmission of data.

The decoding process involves the use of the Peterson-Gorenstein-Zierler (PGZ) algorithm, which is a systematic approach to decoding RS codes. The algorithm is based on the concept of syndrome decoding, where the received data is compared with the syndromes of known error patterns.

The PGZ algorithm begins by computing the syndrome of the received data. This is done by multiplying the received data with the generator polynomial of the code. The result is then reduced modulo the polynomial. If the result is zero, then the received data is error-free. If the result is non-zero, then an error is detected.

The next step is to find the error pattern. This is done by comparing the syndrome with the known syndromes of the error patterns. The error pattern that gives a non-zero result when multiplied with the syndrome is the one that corresponds to the error in the received data.

Once the error pattern is known, the error locations are determined. This is done by finding the roots of the error locator polynomial. The roots of the polynomial give the error locations.

The final step is to correct the errors. This is done by multiplying the received data with the error evaluator polynomial. The result is then reduced modulo the code polynomial. The result is the corrected data.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the decoding process. Suppose we have a (7,4) BRS code with the generator polynomial `$g(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$`. The code has four information bits and three parity check bits.

Suppose the received data is `$r(x) = x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$`. The syndrome is computed as `$s(x) = r(x)g(x) = x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$`.

The syndrome is non-zero, indicating an error. The syndrome is then compared with the known syndromes of the error patterns. The syndrome `$s(x) = x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$` corresponds to the error pattern `$e(x) = x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$`.

The error locations are determined by finding the roots of the error locator polynomial `$L(x) = \frac{s(x)}{e(x)} = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$`. The roots of the polynomial are `$x = 0, 1, \alpha, \alpha^2$`, where `$\alpha$` is a root of the code polynomial.

The errors are corrected by multiplying the received data with the error evaluator polynomial `$E(x) = \frac{L(x)}{s(x)} = x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$`. The result is then reduced modulo the code polynomial. The result is the corrected data `$c(x) = x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$`.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of error correction capability of RS codes.




#### 4.1b Properties of Reed-Solomon Codes

Reed-Solomon codes have several important properties that make them particularly useful in digital communication systems. These properties include:

1. **Error Correction Capability:** RS codes are capable of correcting multiple-bit errors, making them more powerful than other types of error correction codes. This is due to their ability to spread the information bits across the code, making it more resilient to errors.

2. **Cyclic Structure:** RS codes are cyclic codes, meaning that they are generated by a cyclic shift of a single code generator polynomial. This property allows for efficient encoding and decoding processes.

3. **Finite Field Structure:** RS codes are based on finite fields, which allows for the use of finite field arithmetic in the encoding and decoding processes. This simplifies the calculations and makes them more efficient.

4. **BCH Codes:** RS codes are a special case of BCH codes, which are a family of cyclic codes with good error correction capabilities. This relationship allows for the use of BCH decoding algorithms for RS codes, further simplifying the decoding process.

5. **Vandermonde Matrix:** The encoding process of RS codes is based on the Vandermonde matrix, which allows for efficient encoding of the information bits into the code. This matrix also plays a crucial role in the decoding process.

6. **XOR Operation:** The encoding and decoding processes of RS codes involve the use of XOR operations, which are efficient and easy to implement in digital systems.

These properties make Reed-Solomon codes a powerful tool in digital communication systems, capable of handling multiple-bit errors and providing efficient encoding and decoding processes. In the next section, we will explore the encoding and decoding processes of RS codes in more detail.





#### 4.1c Applications of Reed-Solomon Codes

Reed-Solomon (RS) codes have a wide range of applications in digital communication systems. In this section, we will explore some of the most common applications of RS codes.

##### Error Correction

One of the most well-known applications of RS codes is in error correction. As mentioned in the previous section, RS codes have the ability to correct multiple-bit errors, making them particularly useful in noisy communication channels. This is due to their cyclic structure and finite field arithmetic, which allows for efficient decoding of the code even in the presence of errors.

RS codes are commonly used in various communication systems, such as wireless communication, satellite communication, and optical communication. In these systems, the transmitted signal is often subject to noise and interference, which can cause errors in the received data. By using RS codes, these errors can be corrected, ensuring the reliable transmission of data.

##### Data Compression

Another important application of RS codes is in data compression. RS codes are used in conjunction with other compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and run-length encoding, to achieve high compression rates. This is because RS codes can efficiently encode data with a large number of parity check bits, which can be used to detect and correct errors in the compressed data.

RS codes are commonly used in data compression applications, such as image and video compression, where large amounts of data need to be transmitted efficiently. By using RS codes, the data can be compressed without sacrificing its integrity, making it a valuable tool in data transmission.

##### Cryptography

RS codes also have applications in cryptography, particularly in key distribution and authentication. RS codes are used to generate secret keys and authenticate messages between two parties. This is because RS codes have the ability to correct multiple-bit errors, making them resilient to eavesdropping and tampering of messages.

RS codes are commonly used in secure communication systems, such as secure email and secure communication channels. By using RS codes, the security of these systems can be enhanced, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted data.

##### Other Applications

In addition to the above applications, RS codes have many other uses in digital communication systems. They are used in error correction for data storage, such as in hard drives and flash drives. They are also used in satellite communication for error correction and data compression.

RS codes are also used in other fields, such as coding theory, where they are studied for their properties and applications. They are also used in other types of error correction codes, such as convolutional codes and turbo codes.

In conclusion, Reed-Solomon codes have a wide range of applications in digital communication systems. Their ability to correct multiple-bit errors, efficient data compression, and use in cryptography make them a valuable tool in modern communication systems. As technology continues to advance, the applications of RS codes will only continue to grow.

### Section: 5.1 Trellis Representations of Binary Linear Block Codes:

Convolutional codes are a type of error-correcting code that is widely used in digital communication systems. They are particularly useful in situations where the channel has a high probability of error, such as in wireless communication. Convolutional codes are also known for their ability to achieve near-Shannon limit performance, making them an essential tool in modern communication systems.

In this section, we will explore the concept of trellis representations of binary linear block codes. This is an important concept in understanding the structure and encoding process of convolutional codes.

#### 5.1a Introduction to Convolutional Codes

Convolutional codes are a type of error-correcting code that is used to improve the reliability of digital communication systems. They are particularly useful in situations where the channel has a high probability of error, such as in wireless communication. Convolutional codes are also known for their ability to achieve near-Shannon limit performance, making them an essential tool in modern communication systems.

Convolutional codes are a type of linear block code, which means that they are generated by a set of linear equations. These equations are used to encode the input data into a codeword, which is then transmitted over the channel. The receiver then uses the same set of equations to decode the received codeword and recover the original data.

One of the key concepts in understanding convolutional codes is the trellis representation. This representation allows us to visualize the encoding process of convolutional codes and understand how the codeword is generated.

The trellis representation of a binary linear block code is a graphical representation of the code's encoding process. It is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents the possible paths that the input data can take to generate the codeword. Each node in the trellis represents a possible state of the encoder, and the edges represent the transitions between these states.

The trellis representation is particularly useful in understanding the structure of convolutional codes. It allows us to visualize the encoding process and see how the codeword is generated. This is important in understanding the encoding and decoding processes of convolutional codes.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of trellis representations in more detail and see how they are used in the encoding and decoding processes of convolutional codes.

#### 5.1b Trellis Representations

The trellis representation of a binary linear block code is a graphical representation of the code's encoding process. It is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents the possible paths that the input data can take to generate the codeword. Each node in the trellis represents a possible state of the encoder, and the edges represent the transitions between these states.

The trellis representation is particularly useful for understanding the encoding process of convolutional codes. It allows us to visualize the possible paths that the input data can take, and how the encoder transitions between these paths. This is crucial for understanding the structure of convolutional codes and how they are able to achieve near-Shannon limit performance.

The trellis representation is also closely related to the concept of a trellis code. A trellis code is a type of convolutional code that is generated by a set of linear equations. These equations are used to encode the input data into a codeword, and the trellis representation allows us to visualize the encoding process of these codes.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of trellis codes in more detail and understand how they are used in the encoding process of convolutional codes.





#### 5.1c Binary Linear Block Codes

In the previous section, we discussed the trellis representation of binary linear block codes. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of binary linear block codes and their properties.

A binary linear block code is a type of error-correcting code that is used to encode binary data into a codeword. These codes are widely used in digital communication systems to improve the reliability of data transmission. They are particularly useful in situations where the channel is prone to errors, such as in wireless communication.

The encoding process of a binary linear block code involves multiplying the input data by a generator matrix. This matrix is carefully designed to ensure that the resulting codeword is able to detect and correct a certain number of errors. The number of errors that can be detected and corrected is known as the code's error correction capability.

The generator matrix of a binary linear block code is a square matrix with dimensions equal to the number of input bits and the number of output bits. The rows of this matrix represent the codewords, and the columns represent the input bits. The entries of the matrix are either 0 or 1, and they are carefully chosen to ensure that the resulting codeword is able to detect and correct errors.

One of the key properties of binary linear block codes is their ability to achieve near-Shannon limit performance. This means that they are able to achieve a high level of error correction with a relatively small number of codewords. This is achieved through the use of convolutional codes, which we will discuss in the next section.

Another important property of binary linear block codes is their ability to be represented using a trellis diagram. This diagram provides a visual representation of the encoding process and allows us to easily identify the possible paths that the input data can take. This is crucial for understanding the structure of convolutional codes and how they are able to achieve near-Shannon limit performance.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of convolutional codes and their role in achieving near-Shannon limit performance. We will also discuss the concept of trellis codes and their relationship with binary linear block codes.

#### 9.1b Problem Set Solutions

In this section, we will provide solutions to the problems in the first problem set of Chapter 9. These solutions are meant to serve as a guide for students to check their work and understand the correct approach to solving the problems.

#### Problem Set Solutions

1. Problem 1:

Given a binary symmetric channel with crossover probability $p = 0.5$, find the maximum achievable rate for reliable communication.

Solution:

The maximum achievable rate for reliable communication in a binary symmetric channel is given by the Shannon-Hartley theorem, which states that the maximum rate $C$ is equal to the channel capacity $C = \log_2(1 + \frac{1}{p})$. In this case, since $p = 0.5$, the maximum achievable rate is $\log_2(1 + \frac{1}{0.5}) = 1$ bit per channel use.

2. Problem 2:

Prove that the Hamming distance between two binary vectors is equal to the number of bit positions where they differ.

Solution:

Let $x$ and $y$ be two binary vectors of the same length $n$. The Hamming distance $d(x,y)$ between them is defined as the number of bit positions where they differ. We can prove this by considering the binary representation of $x$ and $y$. Let $x = x_1x_2...x_n$ and $y = y_1y_2...y_n$, where $x_i$ and $y_i$ are the $i$th bit of $x$ and $y$, respectively. The Hamming distance is then given by the number of bit positions where $x_i \neq y_i$. This is equivalent to the number of bit positions where $x_i \oplus y_i = 1$, where $\oplus$ denotes the exclusive OR operation. Since $x_i \oplus y_i = 1$ if and only if $x_i \neq y_i$, the proof is complete.

3. Problem 3:

Prove that the Hamming distance between two binary vectors is always even.

Solution:

As we proved in the previous problem, the Hamming distance $d(x,y)$ between two binary vectors is equal to the number of bit positions where they differ. Since the number of bit positions is always even, the Hamming distance must also be even. This is because the number of bit positions where $x_i \neq y_i$ is always even, as the number of bit positions where $x_i = y_i$ is always even.

4. Problem 4:

Prove that the Hamming distance between two binary vectors is always less than or equal to the number of bit positions.

Solution:

The Hamming distance $d(x,y)$ between two binary vectors is always less than or equal to the number of bit positions. This is because the Hamming distance is equal to the number of bit positions where they differ, and the number of bit positions is always greater than or equal to the number of bit positions where they differ. This is true because the number of bit positions where $x_i \neq y_i$ is always less than or equal to the number of bit positions where $x_i = y_i$.

5. Problem 5:

Prove that the Hamming distance between two binary vectors is always less than or equal to the number of bit positions.

Solution:

The Hamming distance $d(x,y)$ between two binary vectors is always less than or equal to the number of bit positions. This is because the Hamming distance is equal to the number of bit positions where they differ, and the number of bit positions is always greater than or equal to the number of bit positions where they differ. This is true because the number of bit positions where $x_i \neq y_i$ is always less than or equal to the number of bit positions where $x_i = y_i$.

1. Problem 1:

Given a binary symmetric channel with crossover probability $p = 0.5$, find the maximum achievable rate for reliable communication.

Solution:

The maximum achievable rate for reliable communication in a binary symmetric channel is given by the Shannon-Hartley theorem, which states that the maximum rate $C$ is equal to the channel capacity $C = \log_2(1 + \frac{1}{p})$. In this case, since $p = 0.5$, the maximum achievable rate is $\log_2(1 + \frac{1}{0.5}) = 1$ bit per channel use.

2. Problem 2:

Prove that the Hamming distance between two binary vectors is equal to the number of bit positions where they differ.

Solution:

Let $x$ and $y$ be two binary vectors of the same length $n$. The Hamming distance $d(x,y)$ between them is defined as the number of bit positions where they differ. We can prove this by considering the binary representation of $x$ and $y$. Let $x = x_1x_2...x_n$ and $y = y_1y_2...y_n$, where $x_i$ and $y_i$ are the $i$th bit of $x$ and $y$, respectively. The Hamming distance is then given by the number of bit positions where $x_i \neq y_i$. This is equivalent to the number of bit positions where $x_i \oplus y_i = 1$, where $\oplus$ denotes the exclusive OR operation. Since $x_i \oplus y_i = 1$ if and only if $x_i \neq y_i$, the proof is complete.

3. Problem 3:

Prove that the Hamming distance between two binary vectors is always even.

Solution:

As we proved in the previous problem, the Hamming distance $d(x,y)$ between two binary vectors is equal to the number of bit positions where they differ. Since the number of bit positions is always even, the Hamming distance must also be even. This is because the number of bit positions where $x_i \neq y_i$ is always even, and therefore the Hamming distance is always even.

4. Problem 4:

Solution:

Let $x$ and $y$ be two binary vectors of the same length $n$. The Hamming distance $d(x,y)$ between them is defined as the number of bit positions where they differ. To prove this, we will use mathematical induction on the length $n$ of the vectors.

For $n = 1$, the Hamming distance is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the two vectors are equal or not. In both cases, the number of bit positions where they differ is equal to the Hamming distance.

Now, assume that the statement is true for all vectors of length $n$. Consider two vectors $x$ and $y$ of length $n + 1$. If the last bit of $x$ and $y$ is different, then the Hamming distance is $d(x,y) = 1 + d(x',y')$, where $x'$ and $y'$ are the vectors obtained by removing the last bit from $x$ and $y$, respectively. Since $x'$ and $y'$ have length $n$, by the induction hypothesis, the number of bit positions where they differ is equal to the Hamming distance. Therefore, the number of bit positions where $x$ and $y$ differ is also equal to the Hamming distance.

If the last bit of $x$ and $y$ is equal, then the Hamming distance is $d(x,y) = d(x',y')$. By the induction hypothesis, the number of bit positions where $x'$ and $y'$ differ is equal to the Hamming distance. Therefore, the number of bit positions where $x$ and $y$ differ is also equal to the Hamming distance.

In both cases, the number of bit positions where they differ is equal to the Hamming distance. Therefore, the statement is true for all vectors of length $n + 1$, and by induction, it is true for all vectors of any length.

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we explored the fundamentals of digital communication, including modulation techniques and channel coding. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of digital communication and focus on the concept of multiple access techniques.

Multiple access techniques are essential in modern communication systems, as they allow multiple users to share the same communication channel. This is especially important in wireless communication, where the available bandwidth is limited and needs to be efficiently utilized.

In this chapter, we will cover various multiple access techniques, including time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), and code division multiple access (CDMA). We will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each technique and their applications in different communication systems.

Furthermore, we will explore the concept of multiple access channels, which are channels that allow multiple users to transmit and receive information simultaneously. We will also discuss the challenges and solutions for multiple access channels, such as interference and synchronization.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of multiple access techniques and their role in digital communication. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid foundation in multiple access techniques and be able to apply them in real-world communication systems. So let's dive in and explore the world of multiple access techniques in digital communication.

#### 12.2a Introduction to MIMO Systems

Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems are a type of wireless communication system that utilizes multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver to improve communication performance. MIMO systems have become increasingly popular in modern wireless communication systems due to their ability to significantly increase data rates and improve reliability.

##### MIMO Systems and Channel Capacity

The concept of channel capacity is a fundamental concept in information theory that describes the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a communication channel. In MIMO systems, the channel capacity is increased as the number of antennas is increased, proportional to the smaller of the number of transmit antennas and the number of receive antennas. This is known as the multiplexing gain and is a fundamental property that can be proved under almost any physical channel propagation model and with practical hardware that is prone to transceiver impairments.

##### Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff

One of the key advantages of MIMO systems is their ability to achieve high spatial multiplexing gains. However, there exists a fundamental tradeoff between transmit diversity and spatial multiplexing gains in a MIMO system. In particular, achieving high spatial multiplexing gains is of profound importance in modern wireless systems.

##### Other Applications of MIMO

The concept of MIMO is not limited to wireless communication. It can also be used for wire line communication, as seen in the development of a new type of DSL technology known as gigabit DSL. This technology is based on binder MIMO channels and is able to achieve significantly higher data rates than traditional DSL technologies.

##### Sampling Theory in MIMO Systems

An important question that arises in MIMO systems is how to use the multi-output signals at the receiver to recover the multi-input signals at the transmitter. In Shang, Sun, and Zhou (2007), sufficient and necessary conditions are established to guarantee the complete recovery of the multi-input signals.

##### Precoding in MIMO Systems

Precoding is a technique used in MIMO systems to improve communication performance. It involves pre-processing the transmitted signal to compensate for the effects of the channel. This technique is particularly useful in MIMO systems with multiple antennas, as it allows for the exploitation of the spatial diversity to improve communication performance.

##### Mathematical Description of Point-to-Point MIMO

The standard narrowband, slowly fading channel model for point-to-point MIMO is given by the following equations:

$$

where $\mathbf{y}(t)$ is the received signal vector, $\mathbf{H}$ is the channel matrix, $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the transmitted signal vector, and $\mathbf{n}(t)$ is the noise vector. The channel matrix $\mathbf{H}$ is given by:

$$
\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{H}_0\mathbf{\Lambda}\mathbf{H}_0^H
$$

where $\mathbf{H}_0$ is the deterministic part of the channel matrix and $\mathbf{\Lambda}$ is the diagonal matrix containing the channel gains.

#### 12.2b MIMO Systems with Multiple Antennas

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of MIMO systems and their ability to achieve high data rates and reliability. In this section, we will delve deeper into the topic and explore the use of multiple antennas in MIMO systems.

##### Multiple Antennas in MIMO Systems

The use of multiple antennas in MIMO systems is a key factor in achieving high data rates and reliability.

By combining these signals at the receiver, it is possible to achieve higher data rates and reliability.

##### Multiple Antennas and Channel Capacity

The use of multiple antennas also allows for the exploitation of the multiplexing gain, which is a fundamental property of MIMO systems. As mentioned earlier, the multiplexing gain is proportional to the smaller of the number of transmit antennas and the number of receive antennas. This means that by using multiple antennas, it is possible to achieve higher channel capacity, which is the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a communication channel.

##### Multiple Antennas and Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff

While the use of multiple antennas allows for the exploitation of the spatial diversity and multiplexing gain, there exists a fundamental tradeoff between transmit diversity and spatial multiplexing gains in a MIMO system. In particular, achieving high spatial multiplexing gains is of profound importance in modern wireless systems. This is because high spatial multiplexing gains allow for the transmission of multiple signals, each of which can be affected differently by the channel. By combining these signals at the receiver, it is possible to achieve higher data rates and reliability. However, achieving high spatial multiplexing gains also requires careful consideration of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff.

##### Conclusion

MIMO systems are designed to support multiple users, each with their own set of antennas. This allows for the simultaneous transmission and reception of signals, leading to increased data rates and reliability. The use of multiple users in MIMO systems is particularly important in scenarios where there are multiple users competing for the same bandwidth.

##### Interference and Multiple Users

One of the key challenges in MIMO systems with multiple users is interference. Interference occurs when the signals transmitted to different users overlap in the receiver, leading to a degradation in performance. However, the use of multiple antennas can help mitigate this interference. By carefully designing the precoding and beamforming techniques, it is possible to minimize the interference and improve the overall performance of the system.

##### Multiple Users and Channel Capacity

The use of multiple users in MIMO systems also allows for the exploitation of the channel capacity. As mentioned earlier, the channel capacity is increased as the number of antennas is increased. In the case of multiple users, the channel capacity is increased not only due to the use of multiple antennas, but also due to the presence of multiple users. This leads to even higher data rates and reliability.

##### Multiple Users and Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff

Similar to the case of multiple antennas, there exists a fundamental tradeoff between transmit diversity and spatial multiplexing gains in a MIMO system with multiple users. Achieving high spatial multiplexing gains is of profound importance in modern wireless systems, but it requires careful consideration of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff.

##### Conclusion

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the topic and explore some of the key techniques used in MIMO systems with multiple users.




#### 12.2b MIMO Channel Capacity

The channel capacity of a MIMO system is a crucial concept that determines the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over the channel. It is defined as the maximum mutual information between the input and output of a channel. In the case of MIMO systems, the channel capacity is increased as the number of antennas is increased, proportional to the smaller of the number of transmit antennas and the number of receive antennas. This is known as the multiplexing gain and is a fundamental property that can be proved under almost any physical channel propagation model and with practical hardware that is prone to transceiver impairments.

##### Proving the Multiplexing Gain

The multiplexing gain in MIMO systems can be proved using the concept of channel capacity. The channel capacity of a MIMO system is given by the formula:

$$
C = \min(N_t, N_r) \log(1 + \frac{SNR}{N_t})
$$

where $N_t$ is the number of transmit antennas, $N_r$ is the number of receive antennas, and $SNR$ is the signal-to-noise ratio. As the number of antennas is increased, the channel capacity also increases, leading to a higher multiplexing gain.

##### Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff

While the multiplexing gain is a key advantage of MIMO systems, it is important to note that there exists a fundamental tradeoff between transmit diversity and spatial multiplexing gains in a MIMO system. In particular, achieving high spatial multiplexing gains is of profound importance in modern wireless systems. However, as the number of antennas is increased, the diversity gain decreases, leading to a tradeoff between the two.

##### Other Applications of MIMO

The concept of MIMO is not limited to wireless communication. It can also be used for wire line communication, as seen in the development of a new type of DSL technology known as gigabit DSL. This technology is based on binder MIMO channels and is able to achieve significantly higher data rates than traditional DSL technologies.

##### Sampling Theory in MIMO Systems

#### 12.3b OFDM Modulation and Demodulation

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a digital modulation scheme that is widely used in modern communication systems. It is a form of multicarrier modulation, where multiple subcarriers are used to transmit data simultaneously. OFDM is particularly useful in wireless communication systems due to its ability to combat the effects of multipath fading and interference.

##### OFDM Modulation

In OFDM modulation, the digital data stream is first converted into multiple parallel substreams, each of which is modulated onto a different subcarrier. The subcarriers are carefully chosen to be orthogonal to each other, meaning that they do not interfere with each other. This is achieved by using a set of orthogonal waveforms, known as Walsh functions, to represent the subcarriers.

The modulated substreams are then combined to form the OFDM symbol, which is transmitted over the air. The OFDM symbol is typically transmitted over a period of time known as the symbol period, which is much longer than the channel coherence time. This allows the receiver to combat the effects of multipath fading, where the transmitted signal reaches the receiver via multiple paths, each with a different delay.

##### OFDM Demodulation

At the receiver, the OFDM symbol is demodulated to recover the transmitted data. The demodulation process involves converting the received signal back into the original substreams, each of which is then demodulated to recover the transmitted data.

The demodulation process is complex and involves several steps, including synchronization, equalization, and decoding. These steps are necessary to combat the effects of interference and channel distortion, which can significantly degrade the performance of the OFDM system.

##### OFDM Modulation and Demodulation in Digital Communication II

In the second chapter of "Principles of Digital Communication II", we will delve deeper into the advanced topics of OFDM modulation and demodulation.

#### 12.2c MIMO Detection Algorithms

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of MIMO channel capacity and the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. In this section, we will delve into the topic of MIMO detection algorithms, which are crucial for estimating the transmit vector in MIMO communication systems.

##### MIMO Detection Problem

The fundamental problem in MIMO communication is estimating the transmit vector, $\mathbf{x}$, given the received vector, $\mathbf{y}$. This can be posed as a statistical detection problem, and addressed using a variety of techniques including zero-forcing, successive interference cancellation a.k.a. V-blast, Maximum likelihood estimation and recently, neural network MIMO detection. 

##### Zero-Forcing

Zero-forcing (ZF) is a simple and intuitive detection algorithm that attempts to force the interference between different streams to zero. This is achieved by pre-processing the received signal with the inverse of the channel matrix, $\mathbf{H}^{-1}$. However, this approach can be unstable if the channel matrix is not full-rank.

##### Successive Interference Cancellation

Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) is another popular detection algorithm in MIMO systems. It operates by first decoding the stream with the highest signal-to-noise ratio, and then subtracting its contribution from the received signal. This process is repeated for each stream, effectively cancelling the interference from the previously decoded streams.

##### Maximum Likelihood Estimation

Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is a more sophisticated detection algorithm that aims to maximize the likelihood of the received signal given the transmitted signal. This involves solving a set of linear equations, which can be computationally intensive.

##### Neural Network MIMO Detection

Recently, there has been a surge of interest in using neural networks for MIMO detection. These networks are trained to learn the mapping from the received signal to the transmitted signal, and can often outperform traditional methods such as ZF and MLE.

##### Channel State Information

In practice, the channel matrix, $\mathbf{H}$, is not known at the receiver. Therefore, the transmitter sends a Pilot signal and the receiver learns the state of the channel from the received signal and the Pilot signal. This process is known as channel state information (CSI) estimation.

##### Deep Learning Tools

Deep learning tools have shown to be effective for MIMO detection, especially in scenarios where the channel matrix is not known. These tools can learn the complex mapping from the received signal to the transmitted signal, and can often outperform traditional methods.

##### Testing

MIMO signal testing focuses first on the transmitter/receiver system. The random phases of the sub-carrier signals can produce instantaneous power levels that cause the amplifier to compress, momentarily causing distortion and ultimately symbol errors. Signals with a high PAR (peak-to-average ratio) can cause amplifiers to compress unpredictably during transmission. OFDM signals are very dynamic and compression problems can be hard to detect because of their noise-like nature.

Knowing the quality of the signal channel is also critical. A channel emulator can simulate how a device performs at the cell edge, can add noise or can simulate what the channel looks like at speed. To fully qualify the performance of a receiver, a calibrated transmitter, such as a vector signal generator (VSG), and channel emulator can be used to test the receiver under a variety of different conditions. Conversely, the transmitter's performance under a number of different conditions can be verified using a channel emulator and a calibrated receiver, such as a vector signal analyzer (VSA).

In the direct scheme, the destination node decodes the data using the signal received from the source node, without involving any relay node. This scheme is simple, but it may not provide sufficient signal power, especially if the distance between the source node and the destination node is large.

###### Non-Cooperative Scheme

In the non-cooperative scheme, the destination node decodes the data using the signal received from the relay node, which retransmits the signal received from the source node. This scheme can provide significant signal power boosting, but it does not increase the diversity order.

###### Cooperative Scheme

In the cooperative scheme, the destination node decodes the data using both the signal received from the source node and the signal received from the relay node. This scheme can provide both signal power boosting and diversity gain, but it requires more complex decoding processing.

###### Adaptive Scheme

In the adaptive scheme, the destination node adaptively adjusts the decoding scheme based on the channel conditions. This scheme can provide the best performance, but it requires sophisticated channel estimation and adaptation algorithms.




#### 12.3b Relay Channels

Relay channels are a key component of cooperative communication systems. They are used to retransmit the signal received from the source node, thereby improving the reliability and quality of communication. In this section, we will discuss the role of relay channels in cooperative communication and their impact on the performance of the system.

##### Role of Relay Channels in Cooperative Communication

Relay channels play a crucial role in cooperative communication systems. They are used to retransmit the signal received from the source node, thereby improving the reliability and quality of communication. This is particularly important in scenarios where the communication link is subject to fading, interference, or other forms of impairment.

The basic idea behind relay channels is to exploit the diversity of the communication link. By transmitting the same information from multiple nodes, and then combining the received signals at the destination node, we can significantly improve the reliability and data rate of the communication. This is especially beneficial in scenarios where the communication link is subject to fading or interference.

##### Impact of Relay Channels on System Performance

The presence of relay channels can have a significant impact on the performance of a cooperative communication system. By retransmitting the signal received from the source node, relay channels can provide a significant boost in signal power, thereby improving the reliability of the communication.

Moreover, relay channels can also increase the diversity order of the communication link. This is particularly important in scenarios where the communication link is subject to fading or interference. By transmitting the same information from multiple nodes, and then combining the received signals at the destination node, we can increase the diversity order, thereby improving the reliability and data rate of the communication.

However, the presence of relay channels can also introduce additional complexity and overhead into the system. This is because relay channels require additional hardware and protocols for signal retransmission and combination. Therefore, the design and implementation of relay channels must be carefully considered to balance the benefits of improved system performance with the costs of additional complexity and overhead.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the key techniques and protocols used for implementing relay channels in cooperative communication systems.

#### 12.3c Cooperative Communication in Wireless Networks

Cooperative communication in wireless networks is a promising approach to improve the reliability and quality of communication. It leverages the diversity of the communication link by having multiple nodes work together to transmit and receive information. This is particularly useful in wireless networks where the communication link is subject to fading, interference, or other forms of impairment.

##### Cooperative Communication in Wireless Networks

In wireless networks, cooperative communication can be implemented in various ways. One common approach is to use relay channels, as discussed in the previous section. Another approach is to use multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which can provide significant gains in terms of reliability and data rate.

MIMO systems use multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver to transmit and receive multiple data streams simultaneously. This can significantly improve the reliability and data rate of the communication, especially in scenarios where the communication link is subject to fading or interference.

##### Impact of Cooperative Communication in Wireless Networks

The impact of cooperative communication in wireless networks can be significant. By leveraging the diversity of the communication link, cooperative communication can provide a significant boost in signal power, thereby improving the reliability of the communication.

Moreover, cooperative communication can also increase the diversity order of the communication link. This is particularly important in scenarios where the communication link is subject to fading or interference. By transmitting the same information from multiple nodes, and then combining the received signals at the destination node, we can increase the diversity order, thereby improving the reliability and data rate of the communication.

However, the implementation of cooperative communication in wireless networks can be challenging due to the additional complexity and overhead it introduces. This includes the need for additional hardware and protocols, as well as the need for coordination among the nodes involved in the communication.

Cooperative diversity is a key concept in cooperative communication systems. It refers to the ability of a system to exploit the diversity of the communication link to improve the reliability and quality of communication. In this section, we will discuss the concept of cooperative diversity and its role in cooperative communication systems.

##### Concept of Cooperative Diversity

Cooperative diversity is a form of diversity gain that can be achieved in a communication system by exploiting the diversity of the communication link.

This can significantly improve the reliability and data rate of the communication, especially in scenarios where the communication link is subject to fading or interference.

The concept of cooperative diversity can be understood in terms of the diversity order of the communication link. The diversity order is a measure of the number of independent copies of the transmitted signal that are available at the destination node. By transmitting the same information from multiple nodes, and then combining the received signals at the destination node, we can increase the diversity order, thereby improving the reliability and data rate of the communication.

The encoding and decoding of cyclic codes is a crucial aspect of their application in digital communication systems. In this section, we will discuss the encoding and decoding processes for cyclic codes.

#### Encoding Cyclic Codes

The encoding process for cyclic codes involves multiplying the message vector by the generator polynomial. This results in a codeword that is a multiple of the generator polynomial and therefore belongs to the cyclic code. The encoding process can be represented as follows:

$$
\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{g} \mathbf{m}
$$

where $\mathbf{c}$ is the codeword, $\mathbf{g}$ is the generator polynomial, and $\mathbf{m}$ is the message vector.

#### Decoding Cyclic Codes

The decoding process for cyclic codes involves solving a system of linear equations to find the message vector that corresponds to a received codeword. This process is known as syndrome decoding and involves finding the syndrome of the received codeword and using it to determine the message vector. The decoding process can be represented as follows:

$$
\mathbf{s} = \mathbf{r} \mathbf{H}^T
$$

where $\mathbf{s}$ is the syndrome, $\mathbf{r}$ is the received codeword, and $\mathbf{H}$ is the parity-check matrix.

### Subsection: 13.2b Generator and Parity Check Polynomials

In the previous section, we discussed the properties and applications of cyclic codes. In this section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical foundations of cyclic codes by exploring the concept of generator and parity check polynomials.

#### Generator Polynomials

Generator polynomials are a crucial component of cyclic codes. They are used to generate the codewords of the code. The generator polynomial is a primitive polynomial, meaning that it is irreducible and has a degree that is equal to the number of codewords in the code.

The generator polynomial is defined as the product of the feedback polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ in the pre-output function. Mathematically, it can be represented as:

$$
g(x) = f(x) \cdot h(x)
$$

where $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are the feedback polynomials, and $h(x)$ is the boolean function.

#### Parity Check Polynomials

Parity check polynomials are another important component of cyclic codes. They are used to check the parity of the codewords. The parity check polynomial is defined as the product of the feedback polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ in the pre-output function. Mathematically, it can be represented as:

$$
p(x) = f(x) \cdot h(x)
$$

where $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are the feedback polynomials, and $h(x)$ is the boolean function.

The parity check polynomial is used to check the parity of the codewords. If the parity check polynomial divides the codeword polynomial, then the codeword is a valid codeword. If the parity check polynomial does not divide the codeword polynomial, then the codeword is an error codeword.

#### Conclusion

In this section, we explored the concept of generator and parity check polynomials in cyclic codes. These polynomials play a crucial role in the generation and verification of codewords in cyclic codes. In the next section, we will discuss the encoding and decoding processes for cyclic codes.


### Conclusion

## Chapter: Principles of Digital Communication II

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we discussed the fundamentals of digital communication and how it has revolutionized the way we transmit and receive information. We explored the principles behind modulation and demodulation, and how they are used to convert digital signals into analog signals and vice versa. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the world of digital communication and explore the concept of source coding.

Source coding is a crucial aspect of digital communication, as it allows us to efficiently transmit information from a source to a destination. It involves the compression of information, which is essential in reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted. This is especially important in applications where bandwidth is limited, such as in wireless communication systems.

We will also discuss the principles behind source coding, such as entropy and coding matrices. Additionally, we will explore the concept of source coding in the context of digital communication, and how it is used to improve the efficiency of data transmission.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of source coding and its role in digital communication. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid foundation in the principles and applications of source coding, and will be able to apply this knowledge in real-world scenarios.

## Chapter 1:3: Error Control Coding:




### Section: 13.3 Convolutional Codes:

Convolutional codes are a type of error control code that is widely used in digital communication systems. They are a type of linear code, meaning that they are generated by a linear transformation. In this section, we will introduce the concept of convolutional codes and discuss their properties and applications.

#### 13.3a Introduction to Convolutional Codes

Convolutional codes are a type of error control code that is used to detect and correct errors in digital communication systems. They are a type of linear code, meaning that they are generated by a linear transformation. This means that the codewords are generated by a set of rules that can be represented by a matrix.

Convolutional codes are particularly useful in digital communication systems because they can handle burst errors, which are errors that occur in a short period of time. This is important because many communication systems, such as wireless channels, are prone to burst errors.

Convolutional codes are also efficient in terms of bandwidth and complexity. They require a relatively small number of bits to represent the codewords, making them suitable for use in systems with limited bandwidth. Additionally, the decoding process for convolutional codes is relatively simple, making them a popular choice in many communication systems.

#### 13.3b Properties of Convolutional Codes

Convolutional codes have several important properties that make them useful in digital communication systems. These properties include:

- **Burst Error Correction:** As mentioned earlier, convolutional codes are particularly useful for correcting burst errors. This is because the codewords are generated by a linear transformation, which allows for the detection and correction of errors that occur in a short period of time.
- **Efficient Use of Bandwidth:** Convolutional codes require a relatively small number of bits to represent the codewords, making them suitable for use in systems with limited bandwidth. This is important in many communication systems, where bandwidth is a limited resource.
- **Simplicity:** The decoding process for convolutional codes is relatively simple, making them a popular choice in many communication systems. This simplicity also makes them easier to implement in hardware, making them a practical choice for use in real-world systems.

#### 13.3c Applications of Convolutional Codes

Convolutional codes have a wide range of applications in digital communication systems. Some of the most common applications include:

- **Wireless Communication:** Convolutional codes are commonly used in wireless communication systems, particularly in channels that are prone to burst errors. This is because they can handle the short periods of errors that often occur in wireless channels.
- **Data Storage:** Convolutional codes are also used in data storage systems, such as hard drives and flash drives. This is because they can handle the burst errors that often occur in these systems.
- **Satellite Communication:** Convolutional codes are used in satellite communication systems, where the channel conditions can vary rapidly and cause burst errors. This is because they can handle the short periods of errors that often occur in these systems.

In conclusion, convolutional codes are a powerful tool in the field of digital communication. Their ability to handle burst errors, efficient use of bandwidth, and simplicity make them a popular choice in many communication systems. In the next section, we will discuss the different types of convolutional codes and their applications in more detail.





#### 13.3b Viterbi Decoding

Viterbi decoding is a popular decoding algorithm used for convolutional codes. It is named after its creator, Andrew Viterbi, and is based on the Viterbi algorithm for hidden Markov models. The Viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that finds the most likely sequence of hidden states given a set of observations. In the context of convolutional codes, the hidden states represent the transmitted codewords and the observations represent the received codewords.

The Viterbi decoding algorithm works by finding the most likely sequence of transmitted codewords that could have produced the received codewords. This is done by calculating the probability of each possible sequence of transmitted codewords and selecting the sequence with the highest probability. This process is repeated for each received codeword, and the final decoded sequence is the one with the highest probability.

The Viterbi decoding algorithm is particularly useful for convolutional codes because it can handle burst errors. This is because the algorithm takes into account the entire sequence of received codewords, rather than just individual codewords. This allows it to detect and correct errors that occur in a short period of time, making it well-suited for use in digital communication systems.

#### 13.3c Convolutional Codes in Digital Communication

Convolutional codes have been widely used in digital communication systems, particularly in wireless channels. They are particularly useful in these systems because they can handle burst errors, which are common in wireless channels. Additionally, their efficient use of bandwidth and simplicity make them a popular choice in many communication systems.

One of the main applications of convolutional codes in digital communication is in the design of turbo codes. Turbo codes are a class of iterated short convolutional codes that closely approach the theoretical limits imposed by Shannon's theorem. They are designed to have much less decoding complexity than the Viterbi algorithm on long convolutional codes, making them a more efficient option for achieving high performance.

In addition to their use in turbo codes, convolutional codes are also used in other error control coding schemes, such as concatenation with an outer algebraic code. This is done to address the issue of error floors inherent to turbo code designs. By combining a convolutional code with an outer algebraic code, the overall performance of the system can be improved.

In conclusion, convolutional codes are a powerful tool in the field of digital communication. Their ability to handle burst errors, efficient use of bandwidth, and simplicity make them a popular choice in many communication systems. With the development of new coding schemes, such as turbo codes, convolutional codes continue to play a crucial role in the advancement of digital communication technology.





#### 13.3c Turbo Codes

Turbo codes are a class of iterated short convolutional codes that closely approach the theoretical limits imposed by Shannon's theorem. They were first introduced in 1993 by Berrou, Glavieux, and Thitimajshima, and have since become one of the most widely used error control codes in digital communication systems.

##### 13.3c.1 Structure of Turbo Codes

Turbo codes are designed to be used in conjunction with a decoding algorithm known as the "turbo decoding algorithm". This algorithm iteratively decodes two parallel convolutional codes, using the decoding results of one code to help decode the other. This process is repeated until a satisfactory decoding result is achieved.

The structure of a turbo code is shown below:

```
[Encoder 1] ----> [Interleaver] ----> [Encoder 2]
[Decoder 1] ----> [Deinterleaver] ----> [Decoder 2]
```

The encoder and decoder for each convolutional code are typically implemented using the Viterbi algorithm, as discussed in the previous section. The interleaver and deinterleaver are used to spread out the errors in the received codewords, making it easier for the decoding algorithm to correct them.

##### 13.3c.2 Performance of Turbo Codes

Turbo codes have been shown to have excellent performance in both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and fading channels. In AWGN channels, they can achieve near-Shannon-limit performance with relatively short code lengths. In fading channels, their performance is particularly impressive, as they are able to handle burst errors that are common in these channels.

The performance of turbo codes can be further improved by using a larger number of iterations in the turbo decoding algorithm. However, this also increases the complexity of the decoding process. Therefore, a balance must be struck between performance and complexity when designing a turbo code.

##### 13.3c.3 Applications of Turbo Codes

Turbo codes have been widely used in various digital communication systems, including wireless communication, satellite communication, and optical communication. They are particularly well-suited for these systems due to their ability to handle burst errors and their near-Shannon-limit performance.

In addition, turbo codes have also been used in other areas of digital communication, such as data storage and network coding. Their ability to achieve near-Shannon-limit performance makes them a valuable tool in these applications as well.

##### 13.3c.4 Conclusion

Turbo codes are a powerful class of error control codes that have revolutionized the field of digital communication. Their ability to achieve near-Shannon-limit performance and their robustness against burst errors make them an essential tool in modern communication systems. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that turbo codes will play an even more important role in ensuring reliable communication in the face of increasing noise and interference.

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we discussed the fundamentals of digital communication, including the concepts of source coding, channel coding, and modulation. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of modulation, exploring various modulation techniques that are used in digital communication systems.

Modulation is the process of converting digital information into analog signals for transmission over a communication channel. This is necessary because most communication channels, such as radio waves, are designed to carry analog signals. However, digital information, such as computer data, is typically represented as a sequence of bits. Therefore, it is necessary to convert this digital information into analog signals for transmission.

In this chapter, we will cover various modulation techniques, including amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), and phase modulation (PM). We will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each technique, as well as their applications in different communication systems.

We will begin by discussing the basic principles of modulation, including the concept of carrier signals and the modulation process. We will then move on to discuss the different types of modulation techniques, providing examples and illustrations to help you understand the concepts better.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of modulation techniques and their role in digital communication systems. This knowledge will be essential for understanding the more advanced topics covered in the subsequent chapters of this book. So, let's dive in and explore the world of modulation techniques.




### Subsection: 14.1a Introduction to Amplitude Modulation

Amplitude modulation (AM) is a type of modulation technique that is widely used in communication systems. It is a form of linear modulation, meaning that the modulation signal is directly proportional to the information signal. In this section, we will discuss the basics of amplitude modulation, including its definition, characteristics, and applications.

#### Definition of Amplitude Modulation

Amplitude modulation is a process of varying the amplitude of a carrier signal in accordance with the amplitude of a modulating signal. The carrier signal is a high-frequency signal that is used to carry the information signal. The modulating signal is the information signal that is being transmitted. By varying the amplitude of the carrier signal, the information signal can be transmitted over a communication channel.

The mathematical representation of amplitude modulation can be expressed as:

$$
s(t) = (1 + m(t))c(t)
$$

where $s(t)$ is the modulated signal, $m(t)$ is the modulating signal, and $c(t)$ is the carrier signal. The term $(1 + m(t))$ represents the varying amplitude of the carrier signal, which is determined by the modulating signal $m(t)$.

#### Characteristics of Amplitude Modulation

Amplitude modulation has several important characteristics that make it a popular choice in communication systems. These include:

- Bandwidth efficiency: Amplitude modulation is a bandwidth-efficient modulation technique, meaning that it can transmit a large amount of information in a given bandwidth. This is because the information signal is transmitted in the form of amplitude variations, which can be represented by a smaller bandwidth compared to other modulation techniques.
- Robustness: Amplitude modulation is a robust modulation technique, meaning that it is less susceptible to noise and interference. This is because the information signal is transmitted in the form of amplitude variations, which are less affected by noise and interference compared to other modulation techniques.
- Simplicity: Amplitude modulation is a simple modulation technique, making it easier to implement in communication systems. This is because it only requires a single modulator and demodulator, making it a cost-effective solution.

#### Applications of Amplitude Modulation

Amplitude modulation has a wide range of applications in communication systems. Some of the most common applications include:

- Radio broadcasting: Amplitude modulation is widely used in radio broadcasting, where the information signal is transmitted in the form of amplitude variations of a high-frequency carrier signal.
- Wireless communication: Amplitude modulation is also used in wireless communication systems, where it is used to transmit digital data over a wireless channel.
- Satellite communication: Amplitude modulation is used in satellite communication systems, where it is used to transmit television and radio signals from satellites to earth.

In the next section, we will discuss the different types of amplitude modulation, including double-sideband amplitude modulation, single-sideband amplitude modulation, and vestigial sideband amplitude modulation. We will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each type and their applications in communication systems.





#### 14.1b AM Waveform

The waveform of an amplitude modulated signal is a sinusoidal carrier signal that is varied in amplitude by the modulating signal. This results in a modulated signal that is a combination of the carrier signal and the modulating signal. The waveform can be represented as:

$$
s(t) = (1 + m(t))c(t)
$$

where $s(t)$ is the modulated signal, $m(t)$ is the modulating signal, and $c(t)$ is the carrier signal. The term $(1 + m(t))$ represents the varying amplitude of the carrier signal, which is determined by the modulating signal $m(t)$.

The AM waveform is a popular choice in communication systems due to its bandwidth efficiency and robustness. It is commonly used in radio and television broadcasting, as well as in wireless communication systems. The AM waveform is also used in some types of radar systems, where it is known as continuous wave radar.

In the next section, we will discuss the different types of amplitude modulation and their applications in communication systems.





#### 14.1c AM Demodulation

Amplitude modulation (AM) is a type of modulation technique used in communication systems to transmit information. It is a form of linear modulation, where the amplitude of a carrier signal is varied in accordance with the information being transmitted. In this section, we will discuss the demodulation of AM signals, which is the process of extracting the modulating signal from the modulated carrier signal.

The demodulation of AM signals is a crucial step in the communication process, as it allows us to recover the original modulating signal and extract the transmitted information. The demodulation process involves the use of a demodulator, which is a device that performs the inverse operation of the modulator. In other words, the demodulator takes the modulated signal and extracts the modulating signal.

The demodulation of AM signals can be achieved through various methods, such as envelope detection, product detection, and synchronous detection. Each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of demodulation method depends on the specific application and requirements.

Envelope detection is the simplest form of demodulation and is commonly used in AM radio receivers. It involves rectifying the modulated signal and then filtering to recover the modulating signal. This method is simple and inexpensive, but it is also susceptible to noise and distortion.

Product detection, also known as coherent detection, is a more advanced form of demodulation that is commonly used in high-speed communication systems. It involves multiplying the modulated signal with a local oscillator signal that has the same frequency and phase as the carrier signal used in the modulation process. This results in the recovery of the modulating signal, but it also requires a stable and accurate local oscillator signal.

Synchronous detection, also known as coherent detection with carrier recovery, is a more complex form of demodulation that is used in advanced communication systems. It combines the advantages of envelope detection and product detection, while also mitigating their respective disadvantages. This method involves recovering the carrier signal from the modulated signal and then using it to perform product detection. This allows for more accurate demodulation, even in the presence of noise and distortion.

In conclusion, the demodulation of AM signals is a crucial step in the communication process, as it allows us to recover the original modulating signal and extract the transmitted information. The choice of demodulation method depends on the specific application and requirements, but all methods aim to achieve the same goal of extracting the modulating signal from the modulated carrier signal. 





#### 14.2a Introduction to Frequency Modulation

Frequency modulation (FM) is another type of modulation technique used in communication systems. Unlike amplitude modulation, where the amplitude of the carrier signal is varied, in frequency modulation, the frequency of the carrier signal is varied in accordance with the information being transmitted. This makes FM more immune to noise and distortion, making it a popular choice for high-quality audio transmission.

The basic principle of frequency modulation is to vary the frequency of the carrier signal in proportion to the amplitude of the modulating signal. This results in a modulated signal with a varying frequency, hence the name frequency modulation. The modulated signal can then be demodulated to recover the original modulating signal and extract the transmitted information.

The mathematical representation of frequency modulation can be expressed as:

$$
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t + \Delta\phi(t))
$$

where $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, and $\Delta\phi(t)$ is the phase deviation caused by the modulating signal. The phase deviation is directly proportional to the amplitude of the modulating signal, resulting in a varying frequency of the modulated signal.

The frequency deviation, $f_\Delta$, is defined as the maximum shift away from the carrier frequency in one direction. It is given by the equation:

$$
f_\Delta = K_f A_m
$$

where $K_f$ is the sensitivity of the frequency modulator and $A_m$ is the amplitude of the modulating signal. The sensitivity, $K_f$, is a measure of how much the frequency of the carrier signal changes for a given change in the amplitude of the modulating signal.

In the next section, we will discuss the different types of frequency modulation and their applications in communication systems.

#### 14.2b Frequency Modulation Techniques

In the previous section, we introduced the basic principle of frequency modulation and its mathematical representation. In this section, we will delve deeper into the different types of frequency modulation techniques and their applications in communication systems.

##### Linear Frequency Modulation

Linear frequency modulation (LFM) is a type of frequency modulation where the frequency of the carrier signal is varied linearly with the amplitude of the modulating signal. This results in a modulated signal with a continuously varying frequency. LFM is commonly used in radar systems for its ability to provide range and velocity information.

The mathematical representation of LFM can be expressed as:

$$
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t + \Delta\phi(t))
$$

where $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, and $\Delta\phi(t)$ is the phase deviation caused by the modulating signal. The phase deviation is directly proportional to the amplitude of the modulating signal, resulting in a continuously varying frequency of the modulated signal.

##### Non-Linear Frequency Modulation

Non-linear frequency modulation (NLFM) is a type of frequency modulation where the frequency of the carrier signal is varied non-linearly with the amplitude of the modulating signal. This results in a modulated signal with a non-uniform frequency spectrum. NLFM is commonly used in communication systems for its ability to provide a wider bandwidth compared to LFM.

The mathematical representation of NLFM can be expressed as:

$$
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t + \Delta\phi(t))
$$

where $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, and $\Delta\phi(t)$ is the phase deviation caused by the modulating signal. The phase deviation is non-linearly related to the amplitude of the modulating signal, resulting in a non-uniform frequency spectrum of the modulated signal.

##### Quadrature Frequency Modulation

Quadrature frequency modulation (QFM) is a type of frequency modulation where two carrier signals, 90 degrees out of phase, are frequency modulated by the same modulating signal. This results in a modulated signal with a constant envelope and a bandwidth that is twice that of a single carrier frequency modulation. QFM is commonly used in communication systems for its ability to provide a constant envelope, making it less susceptible to non-linear distortion.

The mathematical representation of QFM can be expressed as:

$$
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t + \Delta\phi(t)) + A_c \sin(2\pi f_c t + \Delta\phi(t))
$$

where $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, and $\Delta\phi(t)$ is the phase deviation caused by the modulating signal. The phase deviation is the same for both carrier signals, resulting in a constant envelope and a bandwidth that is twice that of a single carrier frequency modulation.

In the next section, we will discuss the different types of frequency modulation techniques and their applications in more detail.

#### 14.2c Frequency Modulation Demodulation

Frequency modulation demodulation is the process of recovering the modulating signal from a frequency modulated signal. This is a crucial step in communication systems, as it allows us to extract the information transmitted by the modulating signal.

##### Direct Detection

Direct detection is the simplest form of frequency modulation demodulation. In this method, the frequency modulated signal is passed through a bandpass filter with a center frequency equal to the carrier frequency. The output of the filter is then rectified and filtered to recover the modulating signal.

The mathematical representation of direct detection can be expressed as:

$$
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t + \Delta\phi(t))
$$

where $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, and $\Delta\phi(t)$ is the phase deviation caused by the modulating signal. The phase deviation is directly proportional to the amplitude of the modulating signal, resulting in a varying frequency of the modulated signal.

##### Coherent Detection

Coherent detection is a more advanced form of frequency modulation demodulation. In this method, the frequency modulated signal is mixed with a local oscillator signal that has the same frequency and phase as the carrier signal used in the modulation process. This results in the recovery of the modulating signal, but it also requires a stable and accurate local oscillator signal.

The mathematical representation of coherent detection can be expressed as:

$$
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t + \Delta\phi(t))
$$

where $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, and $\Delta\phi(t)$ is the phase deviation caused by the modulating signal. The phase deviation is directly proportional to the amplitude of the modulating signal, resulting in a varying frequency of the modulated signal.

##### Non-Coherent Detection

Non-coherent detection is a variation of coherent detection that does not require a stable and accurate local oscillator signal. In this method, the frequency modulated signal is mixed with a local oscillator signal that has a frequency and phase that are close to the carrier signal used in the modulation process. This results in the recovery of the modulating signal, but it also introduces some error due to the mismatch in frequency and phase.

The mathematical representation of non-coherent detection can be expressed as:

$$
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t + \Delta\phi(t))
$$

where $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, and $\Delta\phi(t)$ is the phase deviation caused by the modulating signal. The phase deviation is directly proportional to the amplitude of the modulating signal, resulting in a varying frequency of the modulated signal.

In the next section, we will discuss the different types of frequency modulation techniques and their applications in more detail.




#### 14.2b FM Waveform

The frequency modulation waveform is a sinusoidal signal whose frequency is varied in accordance with the information being transmitted. This waveform is generated by a frequency modulator, which is a device that varies the frequency of a signal in response to an input signal. The frequency modulator is an essential component in frequency modulation systems, as it is responsible for converting the information signal into a frequency-varying waveform.

The frequency modulation waveform can be represented mathematically as:

$$
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t + \Delta\phi(t))
$$

where $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, and $\Delta\phi(t)$ is the phase deviation caused by the modulating signal. The phase deviation is directly proportional to the amplitude of the modulating signal, resulting in a varying frequency of the modulated signal.

The frequency deviation, $f_\Delta$, is defined as the maximum shift away from the carrier frequency in one direction. It is given by the equation:

$$
f_\Delta = K_f A_m
$$

where $K_f$ is the sensitivity of the frequency modulator and $A_m$ is the amplitude of the modulating signal. The sensitivity, $K_f$, is a measure of how much the frequency of the carrier signal changes for a given change in the amplitude of the modulating signal.

The frequency modulation waveform is a key component in frequency modulation systems, as it is responsible for carrying the information signal. The waveform is generated by a frequency modulator, which varies the frequency of the carrier signal in accordance with the information being transmitted. The frequency deviation, $f_\Delta$, is a crucial parameter in frequency modulation systems, as it determines the amount of frequency variation in the modulated signal. 

In the next section, we will discuss the different types of frequency modulation and their applications in communication systems.

#### 14.2c Frequency Modulation Demodulation

Frequency modulation demodulation is the process of recovering the original information signal from a frequency-modulated waveform. This process is essential in frequency modulation systems, as it allows the receiver to extract the transmitted information.

The demodulation process involves converting the frequency-modulated waveform back into an amplitude-modulated waveform. This is achieved by using a frequency discriminator, which is a device that responds to changes in frequency. The frequency discriminator is an essential component in frequency modulation systems, as it is responsible for converting the frequency-modulated waveform back into an amplitude-modulated waveform.

The frequency discriminator works by detecting the frequency deviation, $f_\Delta$, in the frequency-modulated waveform. The frequency deviation is then used to generate an error signal, which is used to vary the frequency of a local oscillator. The local oscillator is tuned to the carrier frequency, $f_c$, of the frequency-modulated waveform. The error signal causes the local oscillator to vary its frequency in accordance with the frequency deviation in the frequency-modulated waveform.

The output of the local oscillator is then mixed with the frequency-modulated waveform, resulting in an intermediate frequency (IF) signal. The IF signal is then filtered to remove the carrier frequency, $f_c$, and the resulting signal is the demodulated output.

The demodulation process can be represented mathematically as:

$$
s_{demod}(t) = A_m \cos(2\pi f_c t + \Delta\phi(t))
$$

where $A_m$ is the amplitude of the modulating signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, and $\Delta\phi(t)$ is the phase deviation caused by the modulating signal. The phase deviation is directly proportional to the amplitude of the modulating signal, resulting in a varying frequency of the demodulated signal.

The frequency modulation demodulation process is a crucial component in frequency modulation systems, as it allows the receiver to extract the transmitted information. The process involves converting the frequency-modulated waveform back into an amplitude-modulated waveform, which can then be demodulated to recover the original information signal.

In the next section, we will discuss the different types of frequency modulation and their applications in communication systems.

#### 14.3a Introduction to Phase Modulation

Phase modulation (PM) is another type of modulation technique used in communication systems. Unlike frequency modulation, where the frequency of the carrier signal is varied, in phase modulation, the phase of the carrier signal is varied in accordance with the information being transmitted. This makes PM more immune to noise and distortion, making it a popular choice for high-quality audio transmission.

The basic principle of phase modulation is to vary the phase of the carrier signal in proportion to the amplitude of the modulating signal. This results in a modulated signal with a varying phase, hence the name phase modulation. The modulated signal can then be demodulated to recover the original modulating signal and extract the transmitted information.

The mathematical representation of phase modulation can be expressed as:

$$
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t + \Delta\phi(t))
$$

where $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, and $\Delta\phi(t)$ is the phase deviation caused by the modulating signal. The phase deviation is directly proportional to the amplitude of the modulating signal, resulting in a varying phase of the modulated signal.

The phase deviation, $\Delta\phi(t)$, is defined as the maximum shift away from the carrier phase in one direction. It is given by the equation:

$$
\Delta\phi(t) = K_p A_m(t)
$$

where $K_p$ is the sensitivity of the phase modulator and $A_m(t)$ is the amplitude of the modulating signal. The sensitivity, $K_p$, is a measure of how much the phase of the carrier signal changes for a given change in the amplitude of the modulating signal.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the principles of phase modulation, discussing its types, applications, and the mathematical models used to describe it.

#### 14.3b Phase Modulation Techniques

In the previous section, we introduced the basic principle of phase modulation and its mathematical representation. In this section, we will explore some of the techniques used in phase modulation.

##### Coherent Phase Modulation

Coherent phase modulation is a technique where the phase of the carrier signal is varied in accordance with the information being transmitted. The carrier signal is multiplied by a complex exponential, $e^{j\omega_ct}$, where $\omega_c$ is the carrier frequency. The phase of this complex exponential is varied to represent the information.

The mathematical representation of coherent phase modulation can be expressed as:

$$
s(t) = A_c e^{j\omega_ct} e^{j\Delta\phi(t)}
$$

where $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $\omega_c$ is the carrier frequency, and $\Delta\phi(t)$ is the phase deviation caused by the modulating signal. The phase deviation is directly proportional to the amplitude of the modulating signal, resulting in a varying phase of the modulated signal.

##### Differential Phase Modulation

Differential phase modulation (DPM) is a technique used in optical communication systems. In DPM, the phase of the carrier signal is varied by a constant amount for each bit of information. This results in a binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation scheme.

The mathematical representation of differential phase modulation can be expressed as:

$$
s(t) = A_c e^{j\omega_ct} e^{j\Delta\phi}
$$

where $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $\omega_c$ is the carrier frequency, and $\Delta\phi$ is the constant phase shift for each bit of information.

##### Quadrature Phase Modulation

Quadrature phase modulation (QPM) is a technique used in optical communication systems. In QPM, the phase of the carrier signal is varied by a constant amount for each bit of information. This results in a quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) modulation scheme.

The mathematical representation of quadrature phase modulation can be expressed as:

$$
s(t) = A_c e^{j\omega_ct} e^{j\Delta\phi}
$$

where $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $\omega_c$ is the carrier frequency, and $\Delta\phi$ is the constant phase shift for each bit of information.

In the next section, we will discuss the demodulation techniques used in phase modulation.

#### 14.3c Phase Modulation Demodulation

Phase modulation demodulation is the process of recovering the original information signal from a phase-modulated waveform. This process is essential in phase modulation systems, as it allows the receiver to extract the transmitted information.

The demodulation process involves converting the phase-modulated waveform back into an amplitude-modulated waveform. This is achieved by using a phase detector, which is a device that responds to changes in phase. The phase detector is an essential component in phase modulation systems, as it is responsible for converting the phase-modulated waveform back into an amplitude-modulated waveform.

The phase detector works by detecting the phase deviation, $\Delta\phi(t)$, in the phase-modulated waveform. The phase deviation is then used to generate an error signal, which is used to vary the phase of a local oscillator. The local oscillator is tuned to the carrier frequency, $\omega_c$, of the phase-modulated waveform. The error signal causes the local oscillator to vary its phase in accordance with the phase deviation in the phase-modulated waveform.

The output of the local oscillator is then mixed with the phase-modulated waveform, resulting in an intermediate frequency (IF) signal. The IF signal is then filtered to remove the carrier frequency, $\omega_c$, and the resulting signal is the demodulated output.

The mathematical representation of phase modulation demodulation can be expressed as:

$$
s_{demod}(t) = A_c e^{j\omega_ct} e^{j\Delta\phi(t)}
$$

where $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $\omega_c$ is the carrier frequency, and $\Delta\phi(t)$ is the phase deviation caused by the modulating signal. The phase deviation is directly proportional to the amplitude of the modulating signal, resulting in a varying phase of the demodulated signal.

In the next section, we will discuss the different types of phase modulation and their applications in communication systems.

## Chapter: Chapter 15: Multiple Access Techniques

### Introduction

In the realm of digital communication, the ability to transmit multiple signals simultaneously over a single communication channel is a game-changer. This chapter, "Multiple Access Techniques," delves into the principles and applications of these techniques, which are essential for efficient use of limited communication resources.

Multiple access techniques, also known as multiple access methods, are used to allow multiple users to share the same communication medium. This is achieved by assigning different parts of the available bandwidth to different users. The most common types of multiple access techniques are Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA).

TDMA divides the available time into multiple time slots, with each user being assigned a different time slot. This allows multiple users to take turns using the same frequency band. FDMA, on the other hand, divides the available frequency band into multiple frequency channels, with each user being assigned a different frequency channel. CDMA, a modern technique, uses unique codes to differentiate between different users, allowing them to transmit and receive data simultaneously on the same frequency band.

This chapter will provide a comprehensive understanding of these techniques, their advantages and disadvantages, and their applications in various communication systems. We will also discuss the mathematical models and algorithms used in these techniques, such as the assignment of time slots or frequency channels to users, and the decoding of transmitted signals.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of multiple access techniques and their role in digital communication. You will be equipped with the knowledge to design and analyze communication systems that use these techniques, and to make informed decisions about their application in real-world scenarios.




#### 14.2c Frequency Modulation Demodulation

Frequency modulation demodulation is the process of recovering the original modulating signal from a frequency-modulated carrier signal. This is a crucial step in frequency modulation systems, as it allows the receiver to decode the transmitted information.

The demodulation process involves converting the frequency-modulated signal back into its original form, which is a sinusoidal signal with a varying frequency. This is achieved by using a frequency discriminator, which is a device that responds to changes in frequency. The frequency discriminator is an essential component in frequency modulation systems, as it is responsible for detecting the changes in frequency caused by the modulating signal.

The frequency discriminator works by comparing the frequency of the received signal to a reference frequency. If the received signal has a higher frequency than the reference frequency, the discriminator outputs a positive voltage. If the received signal has a lower frequency than the reference frequency, the discriminator outputs a negative voltage. This process is repeated for each cycle of the received signal, resulting in a voltage waveform that follows the changes in frequency.

The output of the frequency discriminator is then passed through a low-pass filter, which removes the high-frequency components and leaves only the low-frequency components. This results in a voltage waveform that follows the changes in frequency, but with a lower frequency. This waveform is then integrated to recover the original modulating signal.

The frequency modulation demodulation process can be represented mathematically as:

$$
y(t) = \int_0^t x(\tau) d\tau
$$

where $y(t)$ is the output of the integrator, and $x(t)$ is the output of the frequency discriminator. This equation represents the integration process, where the output of the integrator is the integral of the input signal.

In conclusion, frequency modulation demodulation is a crucial step in frequency modulation systems, as it allows the receiver to decode the transmitted information. The process involves using a frequency discriminator and an integrator to recover the original modulating signal from a frequency-modulated carrier signal. 





#### 14.3a Introduction to Phase Modulation

Phase modulation (PM) is a method of modulating a carrier signal by varying its phase. This technique is widely used in communication systems due to its ability to provide high data rates and robustness against noise. In this section, we will introduce the concept of phase modulation and discuss its applications in digital communication.

Phase modulation can be represented mathematically as:

$$
s(t) = A\cos(2\pi f_ct + \Delta\phi(t))
$$

where $s(t)$ is the modulated signal, $A$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, $t$ is time, and $\Delta\phi(t)$ is the phase deviation caused by the modulating signal. The phase deviation is directly proportional to the amplitude of the modulating signal, resulting in a linear relationship between the modulating signal and the phase of the carrier signal.

One of the key advantages of phase modulation is its ability to provide high data rates. This is because the phase of the carrier signal can be varied at a much faster rate than its amplitude or frequency. This allows for more efficient use of the available bandwidth, making it a popular choice for high-speed communication systems.

Another important aspect of phase modulation is its robustness against noise. Since the phase of the carrier signal is varied, small changes in the amplitude or frequency of the carrier signal due to noise will not affect the phase modulation. This makes phase modulation a reliable choice for communication systems operating in noisy environments.

Phase modulation is widely used in various communication systems, including wireless communication, satellite communication, and optical communication. In the next section, we will discuss the different types of phase modulation techniques and their applications in more detail.

#### 14.3b Phase Modulation Techniques

Continuous Phase Modulation (CPM) is a type of phase modulation where the phase of the carrier signal is continuously varied. This technique is commonly used in wireless communication systems, particularly in spread spectrum systems. CPM is known for its ability to provide high data rates and robustness against noise.

##### Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK)

Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK) is a type of phase modulation where the phase of the carrier signal is used to represent digital data. In DPSK, the phase of the carrier signal is changed by 180 degrees to represent a binary 1 or 0. This technique is commonly used in optical communication systems due to its simplicity and robustness against noise.

##### Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK)

Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) is a type of phase modulation where the phase of the carrier signal is used to represent digital data. In QPSK, the phase of the carrier signal is changed by 90 degrees to represent a binary 1 or 0. This technique is commonly used in wireless communication systems due to its ability to provide high data rates and robustness against noise.

##### Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (OQPSK)

Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (OQPSK) is a variation of QPSK where the phase of the carrier signal is offset by 90 degrees. This technique is commonly used in wireless communication systems to simplify the receiver design.

##### Minimum Shift Keying (MSK)

Minimum Shift Keying (MSK) is a type of phase modulation where the phase of the carrier signal is varied in a minimum shift manner. This technique is commonly used in satellite communication systems due to its ability to provide high data rates and robustness against noise.

In the next section, we will discuss the demodulation techniques for these phase modulation techniques.

#### 14.3c Phase Modulation Demodulation

Phase Modulation Demodulation is the process of recovering the original modulating signal from a phase-modulated carrier signal. This process is crucial in digital communication systems as it allows the receiver to decode the transmitted information.

##### Continuous Phase Modulation (CPM) Demodulation

The demodulation of Continuous Phase Modulation (CPM) involves the use of a phase detector and a frequency discriminator. The phase detector compares the phase of the received signal with a locally generated phase reference. The frequency discriminator then filters out the frequency components of the received signal that do not match the expected frequency. The output of the phase detector and frequency discriminator is then used to recover the original modulating signal.

##### Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK) Demodulation

The demodulation of Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK) involves the use of a phase detector and a decision circuit. The phase detector compares the phase of the received signal with a locally generated phase reference. The decision circuit then makes a decision on the received signal based on the phase difference. The output of the phase detector and decision circuit is then used to recover the original modulating signal.

##### Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) Demodulation

The demodulation of Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) involves the use of a phase detector, a frequency discriminator, and a decision circuit. The phase detector compares the phase of the received signal with a locally generated phase reference. The frequency discriminator then filters out the frequency components of the received signal that do not match the expected frequency. The decision circuit then makes a decision on the received signal based on the phase difference. The output of the phase detector, frequency discriminator, and decision circuit is then used to recover the original modulating signal.

##### Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (OQPSK) Demodulation

The demodulation of Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (OQPSK) involves the use of a phase detector, a frequency discriminator, and a decision circuit. The phase detector compares the phase of the received signal with a locally generated phase reference. The frequency discriminator then filters out the frequency components of the received signal that do not match the expected frequency. The decision circuit then makes a decision on the received signal based on the phase difference. The output of the phase detector, frequency discriminator, and decision circuit is then used to recover the original modulating signal.

##### Minimum Shift Keying (MSK) Demodulation

#### 14.3b PM Waveform

The phase modulation waveform is a sinusoidal signal whose phase is varied in accordance with the modulating signal. This results in a modulated signal that is a function of the phase of the carrier signal. The PM waveform can be represented mathematically as:

$$
s(t) = A\cos(2\pi f_ct + \Delta\phi(t))
$$

where $s(t)$ is the modulated signal, $A$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, $t$ is time, and $\Delta\phi(t)$ is the phase deviation caused by the modulating signal.

The PM waveform is a popular choice for communication systems due to its ability to provide high data rates and robustness against noise. However, it also has some limitations. For example, the PM waveform is susceptible to phase noise, which can degrade the quality of the modulated signal. Additionally, the PM waveform can be difficult to demodulate, especially in the presence of noise.

Despite these limitations, the PM waveform is widely used in various communication systems, including wireless communication, satellite communication, and optical communication. In the next section, we will discuss some of the techniques used to mitigate the limitations of the PM waveform and improve its performance in communication systems.

#### 14.3c PM Demodulation

Phase modulation demodulation is the process of recovering the modulating signal from the modulated PM waveform. This is a crucial step in the communication system, as it allows us to extract the information contained in the modulating signal. The demodulation process involves converting the PM waveform back to its original form, which is a sinusoidal signal with a varying phase.

The demodulation process can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\Delta\phi(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{t} s(\tau)\cos(2\pi f_c\tau)d\tau
$$

where $s(t)$ is the modulated PM waveform, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, and $\Delta\phi(t)$ is the phase deviation caused by the modulating signal.

The demodulation process involves two main steps: envelope detection and phase detection. Envelope detection is used to recover the amplitude of the modulating signal, while phase detection is used to recover the phase of the modulating signal. These two steps are typically implemented using a combination of analog and digital circuits.

One of the main challenges in PM demodulation is dealing with the phase noise in the PM waveform. Phase noise can be caused by various sources, including the carrier signal and the modulating signal. It can significantly degrade the quality of the demodulated signal and make it difficult to recover the modulating signal.

To mitigate the effects of phase noise, various techniques have been developed, including differential phase modulation and phase-locked loop (PLL) demodulation. Differential phase modulation (DPM) is a technique that uses the difference in phase between two consecutive symbols to represent the information. This technique is particularly useful in the presence of phase noise, as it can provide better performance compared to traditional PM demodulation.

Phase-locked loop (PLL) demodulation is another technique that is used to mitigate the effects of phase noise. A PLL is a control system that generates an output signal whose phase is related to the phase of an input signal. By using a PLL, the phase noise in the PM waveform can be reduced, resulting in improved demodulation performance.

In conclusion, PM demodulation is a crucial step in the communication system, as it allows us to recover the modulating signal from the modulated PM waveform. Despite the challenges posed by phase noise, various techniques have been developed to mitigate its effects and improve the performance of PM demodulation. In the next section, we will discuss some of these techniques in more detail.




#### 14.3c PM Demodulation

Phase modulation demodulation is a crucial step in the communication system, as it allows us to recover the modulating signal from the modulated PM waveform. This process involves converting the PM waveform back to its original form, which is a sinusoidal signal with a varying phase.

The demodulation process can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\Delta\phi(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{t} s(\tau)\cos(2\pi f_c\tau)d\tau
$$

where $s(t)$ is the modulated PM waveform, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, and $\Delta\phi(t)$ is the phase deviation caused by the modulating signal.

The demodulation process involves two main steps: envelope detection and phase detection. Envelope detection is used to recover the amplitude of the modulating signal, while phase detection is used to recover the phase of the modulating signal.

Envelope detection can be achieved by passing the PM waveform through a low-pass filter, which removes the high-frequency components of the signal. This results in a signal that is a function of the amplitude of the PM waveform. The envelope of the PM waveform can then be detected using a diode or other envelope detector.

Phase detection is more complex and involves using a phase detector to measure the phase of the PM waveform. This can be achieved using a variety of techniques, such as a balanced mixer or a digital phase detector.

Once the envelope and phase of the PM waveform are detected, the modulating signal can be recovered by multiplying the envelope and phase together. This results in a signal that is a function of the amplitude and phase of the modulating signal, which can then be demodulated to recover the original modulating signal.

In conclusion, phase modulation demodulation is a crucial step in the communication system, as it allows us to recover the modulating signal from the modulated PM waveform. This process involves converting the PM waveform back to its original form, which is a sinusoidal signal with a varying phase. The demodulation process involves envelope detection and phase detection, which are used to recover the amplitude and phase of the modulating signal.

Digital modulation is a crucial aspect of digital communication systems. It involves the process of converting digital data into analog signals for transmission over a communication channel. This is necessary because most communication channels, such as radio waves, are analog in nature.

There are several types of digital modulation techniques, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. In this chapter, we will focus on three of the most commonly used digital modulation techniques: amplitude shift keying (ASK), frequency shift keying (FSK), and phase shift keying (PSK).

We will begin by discussing the basic principles of digital modulation, including the concept of modulation and demodulation. We will then delve into the specifics of each modulation technique, discussing their characteristics, advantages, and applications. We will also explore the mathematical models behind these techniques, using the popular Markdown format and the MathJax library for rendering mathematical expressions.

#### 15.1a Introduction to Amplitude Shift Keying

Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) is a digital modulation technique that uses the amplitude of a carrier signal to represent digital data. It is a form of amplitude modulation (AM) where the amplitude of the carrier signal is varied to represent different digital symbols. 

ASK is a simple and efficient modulation technique that is widely used in many communication systems, including wireless communication, satellite communication, and optical communication. It is particularly useful in systems where the bandwidth is limited, as it allows for the transmission of multiple symbols within a single frequency band.

The basic principle of ASK is to transmit a sequence of symbols, each of which is represented by a different amplitude of the carrier signal. The receiver then demodulates the received signal to recover the transmitted symbols. 

The mathematical model for ASK can be represented as follows:

$$
s(t) = A_0 \cos(2\pi f_c t + \phi), \quad 0 \leq t \leq T
$$

where $s(t)$ is the transmitted signal, $A_0$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, $T$ is the symbol period, and $\phi$ is the phase offset.

The amplitude of the carrier signal, $A_0$, is varied to represent different symbols. The receiver then demodulates the received signal to recover the transmitted symbols. This is typically done by comparing the received signal with a threshold. If the received signal is above the threshold, the symbol is interpreted as a '1'; if it is below the threshold, the symbol is interpreted as a '0'.

One of the key advantages of ASK is its simplicity. The transmitter and receiver only need to be able to generate and detect a few different amplitudes, making it easier to implement than other modulation techniques. However, ASK is susceptible to noise and interference, which can cause errors in the received symbols.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the specifics of ASK, discussing its characteristics, advantages, and applications. We will also explore the mathematical models behind ASK, using the popular Markdown format and the MathJax library for rendering mathematical expressions.

#### 15.1b Analysis of Amplitude Shift Keying

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) and its mathematical model. In this section, we will delve deeper into the analysis of ASK, focusing on its performance and the factors that affect it.

The performance of ASK is typically evaluated in terms of its bit error rate (BER), which is the probability of error in the transmitted data. The BER is a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is the ratio of the power of the transmitted signal to the power of the noise.

The BER of ASK can be approximated by the following equation:

$$
BER \approx \frac{1}{2} \text{erfc} \left( \frac{A_0 - A_1}{\sqrt{2} \sigma} \right)
$$

where $A_0$ and $A_1$ are the amplitudes of the carrier signal representing the '0' and '1' symbols, respectively, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the noise.

From this equation, we can see that the BER decreases with increasing SNR. This is because the noise has a smaller impact on the received signal as the SNR increases. However, ASK is more susceptible to noise and interference compared to other modulation techniques, such as Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) and Phase Shift Keying (PSK).

Another factor that affects the performance of ASK is the capture effect. The capture effect occurs when the receiver is unable to distinguish between symbols of different amplitudes due to the presence of noise. This can lead to an increase in the BER.

The capture effect can be mitigated by using a larger number of amplitude levels. This increases the bandwidth of the transmitted signal, but it also improves the robustness of the system against noise and interference.

In conclusion, the analysis of ASK involves understanding its performance in terms of the BER and the factors that affect it, such as the SNR and the capture effect. By understanding these aspects, we can design and implement ASK systems that are robust and efficient. In the next section, we will explore the practical aspects of ASK, including its implementation and its applications.

#### 15.1c Applications of Amplitude Shift Keying

Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) is a versatile digital modulation technique that finds applications in a wide range of communication systems. In this section, we will explore some of the key applications of ASK.

##### Wireless Communication

ASK is widely used in wireless communication systems, particularly in the design of wireless local area networks (WLANs). The IEEE 802.11 network standards, for instance, use ASK for the transmission of data over the air. The use of ASK in these systems allows for efficient use of the available bandwidth, making it a popular choice for wireless communication.

##### Satellite Communication

In satellite communication, ASK is used for the transmission of data from the satellite to the ground station. The use of ASK in these systems is particularly advantageous due to its simplicity and robustness against noise and interference. This makes it a reliable choice for communication over long distances.

##### Optical Communication

ASK is also used in optical communication systems, particularly in the design of optical wireless links. The use of ASK in these systems allows for the transmission of data over long distances without the need for expensive and complex equipment. This makes it a cost-effective solution for optical communication.

##### Multiple Frequency-Shift Keying

Multiple Frequency-Shift Keying (MFSK) is a variation of ASK that uses more than two frequencies. MFSK is a form of M-ary orthogonal modulation, where each symbol consists of one element from an alphabet of orthogonal waveforms. MFSK is classed as an M-ary signaling scheme because each of the M tone detection filters at the receiver responds only to its tone and not at all to the others; this independence provides the orthogonality.

MFSK is particularly useful in systems where a large number of symbols need to be transmitted. The use of MFSK allows for the transmission of multiple symbols simultaneously, increasing the data rate of the system. However, the use of MFSK also increases the bandwidth of the system, which can be a limitation in some applications.

In conclusion, ASK is a versatile digital modulation technique that finds applications in a wide range of communication systems. Its simplicity, robustness, and ability to transmit multiple symbols simultaneously make it a popular choice for many communication systems.




#### 15.1b ASK Waveform

The ASK waveform is a crucial component of the Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) modulation technique. It is the waveform that is modulated to represent digital data. The ASK waveform is typically a sinusoidal carrier signal, but it can also be any other waveform that can be easily modulated and demodulated.

The ASK waveform is defined by its amplitude, frequency, and phase. The amplitude of the ASK waveform is varied to represent different digital symbols. The frequency and phase of the ASK waveform are typically kept constant throughout the transmission.

The ASK waveform can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
s(t) = A_0 \cos(2\pi f_c t + \phi), \quad 0 \leq t \leq T
$$

where $s(t)$ is the ASK waveform, $A_0$ is the amplitude of the ASK waveform, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, $T$ is the symbol period, and $\phi$ is the phase offset.

The ASK waveform is typically transmitted over a communication channel. The ASK waveform is then demodulated at the receiver to recover the transmitted digital data. This is typically done by comparing the received ASK waveform with a threshold. If the received ASK waveform is above the threshold, the symbol is interpreted as a '1'; if it is below the threshold, the symbol is interpreted as a '0'.

The ASK waveform is a simple and efficient modulation technique. However, it is susceptible to noise and interference, which can cause errors in the received digital data. Therefore, ASK is often used in conjunction with error correction coding to improve the reliability of the transmitted data.

In the next section, we will discuss the implementation of ASK in more detail, including the design of the ASK modulator and demodulator. We will also discuss the effects of noise and interference on the ASK waveform, and how these can be mitigated.

#### 15.1c ASK Demodulation

ASK demodulation is the process of recovering the transmitted digital data from the received ASK waveform. This is a crucial step in the ASK modulation technique, as it allows the receiver to interpret the transmitted data correctly.

The ASK demodulation process involves comparing the received ASK waveform with a threshold. The threshold is typically set to be equal to the amplitude of the ASK waveform when it represents a '1'. If the received ASK waveform is above the threshold, the symbol is interpreted as a '1'; if it is below the threshold, the symbol is interpreted as a '0'.

The ASK demodulation process can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
\hat{b}(t) = \begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } |s(t)| > A_0 \\
0, & \text{if } |s(t)| \leq A_0
\end{cases}
$$

where $\hat{b}(t)$ is the demodulated ASK waveform, $s(t)$ is the received ASK waveform, and $A_0$ is the amplitude of the ASK waveform when it represents a '1'.

The ASK demodulation process is simple and efficient. However, it is susceptible to noise and interference, which can cause errors in the recovered digital data. Therefore, ASK demodulation is often implemented using a decision-directed equalizer, which can mitigate the effects of noise and interference.

#### 15.2a Introduction to Frequency Shift Keying

Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) is another digital modulation technique that is widely used in communication systems. Unlike Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK), which modulates the amplitude of a carrier signal, FSK modulates the frequency of the carrier signal to represent digital data.

The basic principle of FSK is to transmit a sequence of symbols, each of which is represented by a different frequency of the carrier signal. The receiver then demodulates the received signal to recover the transmitted symbols.

The mathematical model for FSK can be represented as follows:

$$
s(t) = A_0 \cos(2\pi f_c t + \phi), \quad 0 \leq t \leq T
$$

where $s(t)$ is the transmitted signal, $A_0$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, $T$ is the symbol period, and $\phi$ is the phase offset.

The frequency of the carrier signal, $f_c$, is varied to represent different symbols. The receiver then demodulates the received signal to recover the transmitted symbols. This is typically done by comparing the received signal with a threshold. If the received signal is above the threshold, the symbol is interpreted as a '1'; if it is below the threshold, the symbol is interpreted as a '0'.

One of the key advantages of FSK is its resistance to noise and interference. Since the frequency of the carrier signal is varied to represent different symbols, FSK is less susceptible to noise and interference compared to ASK. However, FSK requires a wider bandwidth compared to ASK, which can be a disadvantage in systems where bandwidth is limited.

## Chapter: Chapter 16: Multiple Access Techniques

### Introduction

In the realm of digital communication systems, the ability to transmit multiple signals simultaneously over a single communication channel is a crucial aspect. This chapter, "Multiple Access Techniques," delves into the various methods and techniques used to achieve this simultaneous transmission. 

Multiple access techniques, also known as multiple access schemes, are fundamental to the operation of modern communication systems. They allow multiple users to share the same communication channel, thereby increasing the efficiency of the system. This is particularly important in scenarios where the demand for communication channels exceeds the available supply.

The chapter will explore the two primary types of multiple access techniques: frequency division multiple access (FDMA) and time division multiple access (TDMA). Each of these techniques has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them often depends on the specific requirements of the communication system.

FDMA, as the name suggests, involves dividing the available frequency spectrum into multiple channels, each of which is assigned to a different user. This allows multiple users to transmit and receive signals simultaneously without interfering with each other.

On the other hand, TDMA divides the available time into multiple time slots, each of which is assigned to a different user. This allows multiple users to take turns using the same communication channel, thereby sharing it among themselves.

The chapter will also discuss the concept of code division multiple access (CDMA), a more modern multiple access technique that uses unique codes to differentiate between different users. This technique is particularly useful in scenarios where the number of users is very large.

In addition to these, the chapter will also touch upon other advanced multiple access techniques such as space division multiple access (SDMA) and hybrid multiple access techniques.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the principles behind multiple access techniques and be able to apply this knowledge to the design and operation of digital communication systems.




#### 15.1c ASK Demodulation

ASK demodulation is a critical step in the digital communication process. It involves recovering the transmitted digital data from the received ASK waveform. This is typically done by comparing the received ASK waveform with a threshold. If the received ASK waveform is above the threshold, the symbol is interpreted as a '1'; if it is below the threshold, the symbol is interpreted as a '0'.

The ASK demodulation process can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
\hat{x}(t) = \begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } s(t) > T \\
0, & \text{if } s(t) \leq T
\end{cases}
$$

where $\hat{x}(t)$ is the demodulated ASK waveform, $s(t)$ is the received ASK waveform, and $T$ is the threshold.

The ASK demodulation process is susceptible to noise and interference, which can cause errors in the recovered digital data. Therefore, ASK demodulation is often implemented using a decision-directed demodulation technique. This technique uses the previously demodulated symbols to estimate the transmitted symbols, which are then used to correct the demodulated symbols.

The ASK demodulation process can be improved by using error correction coding. This involves adding redundancy to the transmitted data, which allows the receiver to detect and correct errors in the received data.

In the next section, we will discuss the implementation of ASK demodulation in more detail, including the design of the ASK demodulator and the effects of noise and interference on the demodulation process.




#### 15.2a Introduction to Frequency Shift Keying

Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) is a digital modulation technique that uses the frequency of a carrier signal to represent digital data. It is a form of angle modulation, where the carrier signal's frequency is varied to represent different digital symbols. FSK is widely used in applications such as wireless communication, RFID, and satellite communication.

In FSK, the carrier signal's frequency is changed to represent different digital symbols. The two frequencies used are typically referred to as the mark and space frequencies. The mark frequency is used to represent a '1', while the space frequency is used to represent a '0'. The frequency of the carrier signal is switched between these two frequencies to transmit a sequence of digital symbols.

The FSK modulation process can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t + \phi), \quad \text{for } t \in [nT, (n+1)T)
$$

where $s(t)$ is the modulated signal, $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, $T$ is the symbol period, and $\phi$ is the phase offset.

The FSK demodulation process involves recovering the transmitted digital data from the received FSK waveform. This is typically done by comparing the received FSK waveform with the mark and space frequencies. If the received FSK waveform is close to the mark frequency, the symbol is interpreted as a '1'; if it is close to the space frequency, the symbol is interpreted as a '0'.

The FSK demodulation process can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
\hat{x}(t) = \begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } |s(t) - f_m| < \epsilon \\
0, & \text{if } |s(t) - f_s| < \epsilon
\end{cases}
$$

where $\hat{x}(t)$ is the demodulated FSK waveform, $f_m$ is the mark frequency, $f_s$ is the space frequency, and $\epsilon$ is a small positive constant representing the tolerance for frequency deviation.

In the next section, we will discuss the implementation of FSK modulation and demodulation in more detail, including the design of FSK modulators and demodulators, and the effects of noise and interference on FSK communication.

#### 15.2b FSK Modulation

FSK modulation is a critical component of digital communication systems. It is used to convert digital data into analog signals that can be transmitted over a communication channel. The process involves varying the frequency of a carrier signal to represent different digital symbols.

The FSK modulation process can be broken down into three main steps: symbol selection, frequency assignment, and modulation.

##### Symbol Selection

The first step in FSK modulation is symbol selection. This involves choosing a set of symbols that will be used to represent digital data. In FSK, these symbols are typically represented by two frequencies, one for a '1' and one for a '0'. These frequencies are often referred to as the mark and space frequencies.

##### Frequency Assignment

Once the symbols have been selected, the next step is frequency assignment. This involves assigning each symbol a unique frequency. The mark symbol is typically assigned a higher frequency than the space symbol. This frequency assignment is crucial for the successful demodulation of the received signal.

##### Modulation

The final step in FSK modulation is modulation. This involves varying the frequency of the carrier signal to represent the selected symbols. The carrier signal's frequency is switched between the mark and space frequencies to transmit a sequence of digital symbols.

The FSK modulation process can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t + \phi), \quad \text{for } t \in [nT, (n+1)T)
$$

where $s(t)$ is the modulated signal, $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, $T$ is the symbol period, and $\phi$ is the phase offset.

In the next section, we will discuss the FSK demodulation process, which involves recovering the transmitted digital data from the received FSK waveform.

#### 15.2c FSK Demodulation

FSK demodulation is the process of recovering the transmitted digital data from the received FSK waveform. This process is crucial in digital communication systems as it allows the receiver to interpret the transmitted information correctly. The FSK demodulation process can be broken down into three main steps: symbol detection, frequency detection, and demodulation.

##### Symbol Detection

The first step in FSK demodulation is symbol detection. This involves detecting the presence of a symbol in the received signal. The receiver must determine whether the received signal corresponds to the mark or space frequency. This is typically done by comparing the received signal to the predetermined mark and space frequencies.

##### Frequency Detection

Once the symbol has been detected, the next step is frequency detection. This involves determining the frequency of the received signal. The receiver must determine whether the received signal corresponds to the mark or space frequency. This is typically done by comparing the received signal to the predetermined mark and space frequencies.

##### Demodulation

The final step in FSK demodulation is demodulation. This involves converting the received analog signal back into digital data. The receiver must determine the sequence of symbols represented by the received signal. This is typically done by comparing the received signal to the predetermined mark and space frequencies.

The FSK demodulation process can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
\hat{x}(t) = \begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } |s(t) - f_m| < \epsilon \\
0, & \text{if } |s(t) - f_s| < \epsilon
\end{cases}
$$

where $\hat{x}(t)$ is the demodulated signal, $s(t)$ is the received signal, $f_m$ is the mark frequency, $f_s$ is the space frequency, and $\epsilon$ is a small positive constant representing the tolerance for frequency deviation.

In the next section, we will discuss the implementation of FSK modulation and demodulation in more detail, including the design of FSK modulators and demodulators.

#### 15.3a Introduction to Quadrature Amplitude Modulation

Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) is a digital modulation technique that combines both amplitude and phase modulation. It is a form of M-ary modulation, where each symbol consists of one element from an alphabet of orthogonal waveforms. QAM is widely used in digital communication systems due to its ability to transmit multiple bits per symbol, thereby increasing the data rate.

In QAM, the information is represented by the amplitude and phase of the carrier signal. The amplitude can be either positive or negative, and the phase can be any angle between 0 and 360 degrees. This results in a constellation diagram with four points, each representing a different symbol.

The QAM modulation process can be broken down into three main steps: symbol selection, amplitude and phase assignment, and modulation.

##### Symbol Selection

The first step in QAM modulation is symbol selection. This involves choosing a set of symbols that will be used to represent digital data. In QAM, these symbols are typically represented by the four points of a constellation diagram.

##### Amplitude and Phase Assignment

Once the symbols have been selected, the next step is amplitude and phase assignment. This involves assigning each symbol a unique amplitude and phase. The amplitude can be either positive or negative, and the phase can be any angle between 0 and 360 degrees. This assignment is crucial for the successful demodulation of the received signal.

##### Modulation

The final step in QAM modulation is modulation. This involves varying the amplitude and phase of the carrier signal to represent the selected symbols. The carrier signal's amplitude and phase are switched between the four points of the constellation diagram to transmit a sequence of digital symbols.

The QAM modulation process can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t + \phi), \quad \text{for } t \in [nT, (n+1)T)
$$

where $s(t)$ is the modulated signal, $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, $T$ is the symbol period, and $\phi$ is the phase offset.

In the next section, we will discuss the QAM demodulation process, which involves recovering the transmitted digital data from the received QAM waveform.

#### 15.3b QAM Modulation

Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) is a digital modulation technique that combines both amplitude and phase modulation. It is a form of M-ary modulation, where each symbol consists of one element from an alphabet of orthogonal waveforms. QAM is widely used in digital communication systems due to its ability to transmit multiple bits per symbol, thereby increasing the data rate.

The QAM modulation process can be broken down into three main steps: symbol selection, amplitude and phase assignment, and modulation.

In the next section, we will discuss the QAM demodulation process, which involves recovering the transmitted digital data from the received QAM waveform.

#### 15.3c QAM Demodulation

Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) demodulation is the process of recovering the transmitted digital data from the received QAM waveform. This process is crucial in digital communication systems as it allows the receiver to decode the transmitted information accurately.

The QAM demodulation process can be broken down into three main steps: symbol detection, amplitude and phase detection, and decoding.

##### Symbol Detection

The first step in QAM demodulation is symbol detection. This involves detecting the presence of a symbol in the received signal. The receiver must determine whether the received signal corresponds to one of the four points of the constellation diagram. This is typically done by comparing the received signal to the predetermined constellation points.

##### Amplitude and Phase Detection

Once the symbol has been detected, the next step is amplitude and phase detection. This involves determining the amplitude and phase of the received signal. The receiver must determine whether the received signal corresponds to a positive or negative amplitude, and an angle between 0 and 360 degrees. This is typically done by comparing the received signal to the predetermined constellation points.

##### Decoding

The final step in QAM demodulation is decoding. This involves converting the detected amplitude and phase into digital data. The receiver must determine which symbol corresponds to the detected amplitude and phase. This is typically done by using a look-up table that maps the constellation points to the digital symbols.

The QAM demodulation process can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
\hat{x} = \arg\min_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \|s - A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t + \phi)\|^2
$$

where $\hat{x}$ is the estimated symbol, $s$ is the received signal, $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, $T$ is the symbol period, $\phi$ is the phase offset, and $\mathcal{X}$ is the set of all possible symbols.

In the next section, we will discuss the implementation of QAM modulation and demodulation in more detail, including the use of error correction codes to improve the reliability of the transmitted data.

### Introduction

In the realm of digital communication systems, the ability to transmit multiple signals simultaneously over a single communication channel is a crucial aspect. This chapter, "Multiple Access Techniques," delves into the various methods and techniques used to achieve this simultaneous transmission, known as multiple access.

Multiple access techniques are essential in modern communication systems, especially in wireless communication, where the available bandwidth is limited. These techniques allow multiple users to share the same communication channel, thereby increasing the efficiency of the system. They are the backbone of many communication systems, including cellular networks, satellite communication, and wireless local area networks (WLANs).

In this chapter, we will explore the different types of multiple access techniques, including Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). Each of these techniques has its own unique characteristics and applications, and understanding them is crucial for anyone working in the field of digital communication systems.

We will also discuss the principles behind these techniques, including the mathematical models and equations that govern their operation. For example, in TDMA, different users are assigned different time slots to transmit their signals. This can be represented mathematically as `$y_j(n)$`, where `$y_j(n)$` is the signal transmitted by user `$j$` at time `$n$`.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of multiple access techniques and their role in digital communication systems. You should also be able to apply this knowledge to design and analyze communication systems that use these techniques.

So, let's embark on this journey to unravel the intricacies of multiple access techniques in digital communication systems.




#### 15.2b FSK Waveform

The FSK waveform is a key component of the FSK modulation technique. It is the waveform that is modulated to represent digital data. The FSK waveform is typically a sinusoidal carrier signal, but it can also be a non-sinusoidal signal.

The FSK waveform can be represented mathematically as follows:

The FSK waveform is used to represent digital data by varying its frequency. The frequency of the FSK waveform is changed to represent different digital symbols. The two frequencies used are typically referred to as the mark and space frequencies. The mark frequency is used to represent a '1', while the space frequency is used to represent a '0'.

The FSK waveform is used in both the modulation and demodulation processes. In the modulation process, the FSK waveform is modulated to represent digital data. In the demodulation process, the FSK waveform is demodulated to recover the transmitted digital data.

In the next section, we will discuss the implementation of FSK demodulation in more detail.

#### 15.2d FSK Modulation Examples

In this section, we will provide some examples of FSK modulation to illustrate the concepts discussed in the previous sections.

##### Example 1: Binary FSK Modulation

Consider a binary FSK modulation system with a carrier frequency of $f_c = 1000$ Hz and a symbol period of $T = 1$ ms. The mark frequency is set to $f_m = f_c + 100$ Hz and the space frequency is set to $f_s = f_c - 100$ Hz.

1, & \text{if } |s(t) - f_m| < \epsilon \\
0, & \text{if } |s(t) - f_s| < \epsilon
\end{cases}
$$

These examples illustrate the basic principles of FSK modulation. In the next section, we will discuss some practical considerations in the implementation of FSK modulation.




#### 15.2c FSK Demodulation

Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) demodulation is the process of recovering the transmitted digital data from the received FSK waveform. This process involves demodulating the received FSK waveform to recover the original digital data.

The FSK demodulation process can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
\hat{s}(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t + \phi), \quad \text{for } t \in [nT, (n+1)T)
$$

where $\hat{s}(t)$ is the demodulated FSK waveform, $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, $T$ is the symbol period, and $\phi$ is the phase offset.

The FSK demodulation process involves two main steps: synchronization and symbol detection.

This is typically done by correlating the received FSK waveform with a known reference signal.

The symbol detection process involves detecting the digital symbols represented by the received FSK waveform. This is typically done by comparing the received FSK waveform with the mark and space frequencies. The symbol detected is the frequency that the received FSK waveform most closely matches.

$$

where $\hat{s}(t)$ is the demodulated FSK waveform, $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, $T$ is the symbol period, and $\phi$ is the phase offset.

The FSK demodulation process is a key component of the FSK modulation technique. It is the process that allows the receiver to recover the transmitted digital data from the received FSK waveform. The FSK demodulation process is essential for ensuring reliable communication over noisy channels.




#### 15.3a Introduction to Phase Shift Keying

Phase Shift Keying (PSK) is a digital modulation technique that uses the phase of a carrier signal to represent digital data. It is a form of angle modulation, where the phase of the carrier signal is varied to represent different digital symbols. PSK is widely used in digital communication systems due to its simplicity and robustness against noise.

The basic principle of PSK is to transmit a sequence of digital symbols by varying the phase of a carrier signal. The phase of the carrier signal is changed to represent different digital symbols. For example, a phase shift of 0 degrees can represent a binary 0, while a phase shift of 180 degrees can represent a binary 1.

The PSK modulation process can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t + \phi), \quad \text{for } t \in [nT, (n+1)T)
$$

where $s(t)$ is the PSK modulated signal, $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, $T$ is the symbol period, and $\phi$ is the phase offset.

The PSK demodulation process involves recovering the digital symbols from the received PSK modulated signal. This is typically done by correlating the received signal with a set of known phase shifts. The phase shift that results in the highest correlation is then used to decode the digital symbol.

The PSK demodulation process can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
\hat{s}(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t + \phi), \quad \text{for } t \in [nT, (n+1)T)
$$

where $\hat{s}(t)$ is the demodulated PSK signal, $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, $T$ is the symbol period, and $\phi$ is the phase offset.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the principles and applications of PSK, including its variants such as Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) and Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK). We will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of PSK, and how it compares with other digital modulation techniques.

#### 15.3b PSK Modulation

Phase Shift Keying (PSK) modulation is a form of digital modulation where the phase of a carrier signal is varied to represent digital data. The phase of the carrier signal is changed to represent different digital symbols. For example, a phase shift of 0 degrees can represent a binary 0, while a phase shift of 180 degrees can represent a binary 1.

The PSK modulation process can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t + \phi), \quad \text{for } t \in [nT, (n+1)T)
$$

where $s(t)$ is the PSK modulated signal, $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, $T$ is the symbol period, and $\phi$ is the phase offset.

The PSK modulation process involves varying the phase of the carrier signal to represent different digital symbols. The phase of the carrier signal is changed by a constant amount for each symbol. This constant amount is known as the phase shift. The phase shift is typically 180 degrees for binary PSK (BPSK), but can be larger for higher order PSK schemes.

The PSK modulation process can be visualized as a constellation diagram, where each point on the diagram represents a different digital symbol. The distance from the origin represents the amplitude of the carrier signal, and the angle represents the phase of the carrier signal.

The PSK modulation process is robust against noise, making it suitable for use in digital communication systems. However, it is more susceptible to phase noise and frequency offset than other modulation schemes.

In the next section, we will discuss the PSK demodulation process, which involves recovering the digital symbols from the received PSK modulated signal.

#### 15.3c PSK Demodulation

Phase Shift Keying (PSK) demodulation is the process of recovering the digital symbols from the received PSK modulated signal. The demodulation process involves correlating the received signal with a set of known phase shifts to determine the transmitted symbol.

The PSK demodulation process can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
\hat{s}(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t + \phi), \quad \text{for } t \in [nT, (n+1)T)
$$

where $\hat{s}(t)$ is the demodulated PSK signal, $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, $T$ is the symbol period, and $\phi$ is the phase offset.

The PSK demodulation process involves correlating the received signal with a set of known phase shifts to determine the transmitted symbol. The phase shift that results in the highest correlation is then used to decode the digital symbol.

The PSK demodulation process can be visualized as a constellation diagram, where each point on the diagram represents a different digital symbol. The distance from the origin represents the amplitude of the carrier signal, and the angle represents the phase of the carrier signal.

The PSK demodulation process is susceptible to phase noise and frequency offset, which can cause errors in the demodulated symbols. Techniques such as differential detection and equalization can be used to mitigate these effects.

In the next section, we will discuss the performance of PSK modulation and demodulation, including the effects of noise and the advantages of PSK over other modulation schemes.

#### 15.3d PSK in Digital Communication

Phase Shift Keying (PSK) plays a crucial role in digital communication systems. It is a form of digital modulation that is widely used in wireless communication, satellite communication, and optical communication. PSK is particularly attractive due to its simplicity and robustness against noise.

In digital communication, PSK is used to transmit digital data over a communication channel. The digital data is represented by a sequence of symbols, each of which is a phase shift of the carrier signal. The receiver then demodulates the received signal to recover the transmitted symbols.

The use of PSK in digital communication can be illustrated by the IEEE 802.11ah standard, which is used for wireless local area networks (WLANs). This standard uses PSK for its modulation scheme. The standard defines four different modulation schemes, each of which uses PSK with different modulation and coding schemes (MCS). These MCS are used to transmit data at different data rates and with different levels of error correction.

The performance of PSK in digital communication can be evaluated using the concept of spectral efficiency. Spectral efficiency is a measure of the amount of information that can be transmitted per unit of bandwidth. For PSK, the spectral efficiency is given by the formula:

$$
R = \frac{1}{T} \log_2(M)
$$

where $R$ is the spectral efficiency, $T$ is the symbol period, and $M$ is the number of symbols. This formula shows that the spectral efficiency of PSK is proportional to the logarithm of the number of symbols. This means that by using a larger number of symbols, we can achieve a higher spectral efficiency and transmit more data per unit of bandwidth.

However, the use of a larger number of symbols also increases the complexity of the demodulation process. This is because the receiver needs to correlate the received signal with a larger set of known phase shifts to determine the transmitted symbol. This can be mitigated by using techniques such as differential detection and equalization, as discussed in the previous section.

In the next section, we will discuss the performance of PSK in more detail, including its sensitivity to noise and its ability to achieve high data rates.

## Chapter: Chapter 16: Multiple Access Techniques

### Introduction

In the realm of digital communication, the ability to transmit multiple signals simultaneously over a single communication channel is a crucial concept. This chapter, "Multiple Access Techniques," delves into the principles and applications of these techniques, which are essential for efficient use of limited communication resources.

Multiple access techniques, also known as multiple access schemes, are methods used to allow multiple users to share the same communication medium. These techniques are particularly important in wireless communication systems, where the available bandwidth is often limited. By enabling multiple users to access the same bandwidth simultaneously, these techniques increase the overall capacity of the communication system.

The chapter will explore various multiple access techniques, including Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). Each of these techniques has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which to use depends on the specific requirements of the communication system.

We will also discuss the concept of channel capacity, which is a measure of the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a communication channel. Understanding channel capacity is crucial for designing efficient multiple access schemes.

Finally, we will touch upon the concept of multiple access interference, which is a major challenge in multiple access techniques. We will explore methods to mitigate this interference and improve the performance of multiple access schemes.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of multiple access techniques and their role in digital communication systems. You should also be able to apply this knowledge to design and analyze communication systems that use these techniques.




#### 15.3b PSK Waveform

The PSK waveform is a sinusoidal carrier signal whose phase is varied to represent digital symbols. The PSK waveform can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t + \phi), \quad \text{for } t \in [nT, (n+1)T)
$$

where $s(t)$ is the PSK modulated signal, $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, $T$ is the symbol period, and $\phi$ is the phase offset.

The PSK waveform is a form of angle modulation, where the phase of the carrier signal is changed to represent different digital symbols. The phase of the carrier signal is changed by a multiple of $2\pi/M$, where $M$ is the number of symbols in the constellation. This results in a set of $M$ equally spaced phase shifts, each representing a different digital symbol.

The PSK waveform is a form of M-ary modulation, where each symbol consists of $M$ elements. The elements of the symbol are represented by the phase of the carrier signal, and the symbols are represented by the constellation points. The constellation points are evenly spaced and equally likely, making PSK a form of uniform modulation.

The PSK waveform is a form of coherent modulation, where the phase of the carrier signal is used to represent digital symbols. This makes PSK susceptible to phase noise and carrier frequency offset, which can cause errors in the demodulation process. To mitigate these effects, PSK systems often use a pilot symbol or training sequence to estimate and correct for the phase noise and carrier frequency offset.

The PSK waveform is a form of bandwidth efficient modulation, where the bandwidth is proportional to the logarithm of the number of symbols in the constellation. This makes PSK a popular choice for digital communication systems, especially in applications where bandwidth is limited.

In the next section, we will discuss the different types of PSK, including Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK), and Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK). We will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each type of PSK, and how they are used in different applications.

#### 15.3c PSK Demodulation

The demodulation of a PSK waveform involves recovering the digital symbols from the received PSK modulated signal. This is typically done by correlating the received signal with a set of known phase shifts, each representing a different digital symbol. The phase shift that results in the highest correlation is then used to decode the digital symbol.

The PSK demodulation process can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
\hat{s}(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t + \phi), \quad \text{for } t \in [nT, (n+1)T)
$$

where $\hat{s}(t)$ is the demodulated PSK signal, $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, $T$ is the symbol period, and $\phi$ is the phase offset.

The PSK demodulation process involves two main steps: synchronization and symbol detection. The synchronization step involves estimating the carrier frequency and phase offset of the received signal. This is typically done using a pilot symbol or training sequence, which is known at both the transmitter and receiver.

The symbol detection step involves correlating the received signal with a set of known phase shifts, each representing a different digital symbol. The phase shift that results in the highest correlation is then used to decode the digital symbol. This is typically done using a decision rule, which compares the correlation values to a predetermined threshold.

The PSK demodulation process is susceptible to errors due to noise and interference. To mitigate these effects, PSK systems often use error correction coding and interleaving techniques. These techniques help to improve the reliability of the demodulated symbols, especially in the presence of noise and interference.

In the next section, we will discuss the different types of PSK demodulation, including Coherent PSK Demodulation, Differential PSK Demodulation, and Non-Coherent PSK Demodulation. We will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each type of PSK demodulation, and how they are used in different applications.

#### 15.3d PSK Modulation Examples

In this section, we will provide some examples of PSK modulation to illustrate the concepts discussed in the previous sections. These examples will help to solidify your understanding of PSK modulation and demodulation.

##### Example 1: Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK)

Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) is a simple form of PSK modulation where the phase of the carrier signal is used to represent binary symbols (0 and 1). The phase of the carrier signal is set to 0 for symbol 0 and to $\pi$ for symbol 1.

The BPSK modulation process can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t + \phi), \quad \text{for } t \in [nT, (n+1)T)
$$

where $s(t)$ is the BPSK modulated signal, $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, $T$ is the symbol period, and $\phi$ is the phase offset. The phase offset $\phi$ is set to 0 for symbol 0 and to $\pi$ for symbol 1.

The BPSK demodulation process involves correlating the received signal with a set of known phase shifts, each representing a different digital symbol. The phase shift that results in the highest correlation is then used to decode the digital symbol. This is typically done using a decision rule, which compares the correlation values to a predetermined threshold.

##### Example 2: Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK)

Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) is a more complex form of PSK modulation where the phase of the carrier signal is used to represent quadrature symbols (00, 01, 10, and 11). The phase of the carrier signal is set to 0 for symbol 00, to $\pi/4$ for symbol 01, to $\pi/2$ for symbol 10, and to $3\pi/4$ for symbol 11.

The QPSK modulation process can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t + \phi), \quad \text{for } t \in [nT, (n+1)T)
$$

where $s(t)$ is the QPSK modulated signal, $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier signal, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, $T$ is the symbol period, and $\phi$ is the phase offset. The phase offset $\phi$ is set to 0 for symbol 00, to $\pi/4$ for symbol 01, to $\pi/2$ for symbol 10, and to $3\pi/4$ for symbol 11.

The QPSK demodulation process involves correlating the received signal with a set of known phase shifts, each representing a different digital symbol. The phase shift that results in the highest correlation is then used to decode the digital symbol. This is typically done using a decision rule, which compares the correlation values to a predetermined threshold.

These examples illustrate the basic principles of PSK modulation and demodulation. In the next section, we will discuss the different types of PSK modulation and demodulation in more detail.
