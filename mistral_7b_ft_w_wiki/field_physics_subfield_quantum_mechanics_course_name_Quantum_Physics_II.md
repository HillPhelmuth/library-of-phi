### Introduction

Wave mechanics is a fundamental concept in quantum physics that describes the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level. It is a branch of physics that deals with the study of waves and their behavior. In this chapter, we will explore the principles of wave mechanics and its applications in quantum physics.

Wave mechanics is based on the wave-particle duality, which states that particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior. This concept was first proposed by Louis de Broglie in 1924 and was later confirmed by experiments, such as the double-slit experiment.

One of the key principles of wave mechanics is the Schrödinger equation, which describes the evolution of a quantum system over time. It is a mathematical equation that describes the wave-like behavior of particles and is used to calculate the probability of finding a particle at a particular location.

Another important concept in wave mechanics is the wave function, which is a mathematical function that describes the state of a particle. It is used to calculate the probability of finding a particle at a particular location and is represented by the symbol $\Psi$.

Wave mechanics has numerous applications in quantum physics, including the study of atomic and molecular systems, the behavior of particles in a magnetic field, and the behavior of particles in a potential energy well. It also plays a crucial role in the development of quantum mechanics, which is the branch of physics that deals with the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level.

In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the principles of wave mechanics and explore its applications in quantum physics. We will also discuss the mathematical equations and concepts that are essential to understanding wave mechanics. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of wave mechanics and its role in quantum physics.

### Subsection 1.1a Historical background

The concept of wave-particle duality has been a subject of debate and research for centuries. It was first proposed by the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, who believed that all objects have a natural tendency to move towards their natural place. This idea was further developed by the German physicist Albert Einstein, who proposed the concept of wave-particle duality in his famous paper on the photoelectric effect.

In the early 20th century, the German physicist Max Planck also contributed to the understanding of wave-particle duality. He proposed the concept of quantization, which states that energy can only exist in discrete packets called quanta. This idea was later expanded upon by the French physicist Louis de Broglie, who proposed the concept of wave-particle duality.

The concept of wave-particle duality was further developed by the German physicist Werner Heisenberg, who proposed the uncertainty principle, which states that it is impossible to know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute certainty. This principle is a direct consequence of wave-particle duality, as particles exhibit wave-like behavior and cannot have a definite position and momentum at the same time.

The concept of wave-particle duality has been experimentally verified through various experiments, such as the double-slit experiment and the Compton scattering experiment. These experiments have shown that particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior, further solidifying the concept of wave-particle duality.

In modern physics, the concept of wave-particle duality is a fundamental concept that is essential for understanding the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level. It has revolutionized our understanding of the physical world and has led to the development of quantum mechanics, which is the branch of physics that deals with the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level.

In the next section, we will explore the principles of wave mechanics in more detail and discuss its applications in quantum physics. We will also delve deeper into the concept of wave-particle duality and its implications for our understanding of the physical world.

### Subsection 1.1b Double-slit experiment

The double-slit experiment is a fundamental experiment in quantum physics that demonstrates the wave-particle duality of matter. It was first performed by Thomas Young in 1801, and later refined by scientists such as Augustin-Jean Fresnel and George Gabriel Stokes.

In the double-slit experiment, a beam of particles, such as electrons, is passed through two closely spaced slits and strikes a screen. The particles are expected to behave like particles and create two distinct bands on the screen, corresponding to the two slits. However, what is observed is an interference pattern, similar to what would be observed with waves. This phenomenon cannot be explained by classical mechanics, and is a direct consequence of the wave-particle duality of matter.

The mathematical representation of the double-slit experiment can be derived from the general equation of wave motion. The wave function for the particles passing through the slits can be written as:

$$
\Psi = \int_{\mathrm{slit}} \frac{i}{r\lambda} \Psi^\prime e^{-ikr}\,d\mathrm{slit}
$$

where $N$ is the number of slits, $a$ is the size of the slits, and $d$ is the spacing between the slits. The distance $r$ from the slits is given by:

$$
r = z \left(1 + \frac{\left(x - x^\prime\right)^2 + y^{\prime2}}{z^2}\right)^\frac{1}{2}
$$

where $z$ is the distance from the slits to the screen, and $x^\prime$ and $y^\prime$ are the coordinates on the screen. The wave function for each slit can be written as:

$$
\Psi_j = \int_{-{a}/{2}}^ e^\frac{ikx\left(x' - jd\right)}{z} e^\frac{-ik\left(x' - jd\right)^2}{2z} \,dx^\prime
$$

where $j$ is the index of the slit. The total wave function for the particles passing through the slits is then given by the sum of the wave functions for each slit:

$$
\Psi = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \Psi_j
$$

Using the identity:

$$
\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} e^{x j} = \frac{1 - e^{Nx}}{1 - e^x}
$$

we can simplify the equation for the wave function to:

$$
\Psi = a C \frac{\sin\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}}{\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}}\left(\frac{1 - e^{iNkd\sin\theta}}{1 - e^{ikd\sin\theta}}\right)
$$

where $a$ is the size of the slits, $C$ is a normalization constant, $k$ is the wave number, and $\theta$ is the angle of diffraction. This equation describes the interference pattern observed in the double-slit experiment, and is a direct consequence of the wave-particle duality of matter.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of the double-slit experiment and the concept of wave-particle duality in more detail.





### Subsection 1.1c Particle-wave duality

The particle-wave duality is a fundamental concept in quantum physics that describes the behavior of particles as both particles and waves. This duality is a direct consequence of the wave-particle duality of matter, and it is a key to understanding the quantum world.

The particle-wave duality is often illustrated using the double-slit experiment. As we have seen in the previous section, the particles behave like waves when passing through the slits, creating an interference pattern on the screen. However, when we observe the particles on the screen, they behave like particles, creating distinct bands corresponding to the two slits. This behavior is a manifestation of the particle-wave duality.

The mathematical representation of the particle-wave duality can be derived from the wave function. The wave function for a particle can be written as:

$$
\Psi = \int_{\mathrm{particle}} \frac{i}{r\lambda} \Psi^\prime e^{-ikr}\,d\mathrm{particle}
$$

where $N$ is the number of particles, $a$ is the size of the particles, and $d$ is the spacing between the particles. The distance $r$ from the particles is given by:

$$
r = z \left(1 + \frac{\left(x - x^\prime\right)^2 + y^{\prime2}}{z^2}\right)^\frac{1}{2}
$$

where $z$ is the distance from the particles to the screen, and $x^\prime$ and $y^\prime$ are the coordinates on the screen. The wave function for each particle can be written as:

$$
\Psi_j = \int_{-{a}/{2}}^ e^\frac{ikx\left(x' - jd\right)}{z} e^\frac{-ik\left(x' - jd\right)^2}{2z} \,dx^\prime
$$

where $j$ is the index of the particle. The total wave function for the particles is then given by the sum of the wave functions for each particle:

$$
\Psi = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \Psi_j
$$

Using the identity:

$$
\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} e^{x j} = \frac{1 - e^{Nx}}{1 - e^x}
$$

we can simplify the equation for the wave function to:

$$
\Psi = a C \frac{1 - e^{Nx}}{1 - e^x}
$$

where $a$ is the size of the particles, $C$ is a normalization constant, and $N$ is the number of particles. This equation represents the wave function for a particle, and it is a manifestation of the particle-wave duality.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of the particle-wave duality for the behavior of particles in the quantum world.
