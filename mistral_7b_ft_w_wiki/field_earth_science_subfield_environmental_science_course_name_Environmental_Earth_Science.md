### Subsection 1.1b: Geologic Time

Geologic time is a fundamental concept in Environmental Earth Science. It refers to the time scale used to measure the history of the Earth and its processes. This time scale is based on the principles of stratigraphy, which is the study of rock layers and their relationships.

The geologic time scale is divided into four major divisions: the Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic. Each division is further divided into smaller units, such as eras, periods, and epochs. These divisions are based on the appearance of new fossils and other geological evidence.

The Hadean Eon, for example, is the oldest division of the geologic time scale and is estimated to have lasted from 4.6 billion to 3.8 billion years ago. It is characterized by the formation of the Earth's core and the differentiation of the mantle and crust. The Archean Eon, which followed the Hadean, saw the development of the first continents and the appearance of microbial life.

The Proterozoic Eon, which lasted from 2.5 billion to 541 million years ago, saw the development of more complex life forms and the formation of the first large continents. The Phanerozoic Eon, which began 541 million years ago, is the current division of the geologic time scale and is characterized by the diversification of life and the development of modern continents.

Understanding geologic time is crucial for understanding the history of the Earth and its processes. It allows us to track changes in the Earth's climate, ecosystems, and resources over millions of years. By studying the geologic time scale, we can gain insights into the long-term impacts of human activities on the environment and work towards sustainable practices for the future.





### Section 1.1b Geological Dating Techniques

Geological dating techniques are essential tools for understanding the Earth's history and the processes that have shaped it. These techniques allow us to determine the age of rocks and other materials, providing valuable insights into the timing of geological events and the rates of geological processes.

#### Radiometric Dating

Radiometric dating is a method of determining the age of rocks and other materials by measuring the amount of radioactive decay of a radioactive isotope with a known half-life. This technique is based on the principle that the amount of a radioactive isotope will decrease over time as it decays into a stable form. By measuring the amount of the parent isotope and its decay products, geologists can estimate the time that has passed since the material was formed.

There are several types of radiometric dating techniques, each of which is suitable for different types of materials and time scales. For example, the radiocarbon method is commonly used for dating organic materials up to about 50,000 years old, while the <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar dating method can be extended into the time of early human life and into recorded history.

#### Cosmogenic Nuclide Geochronology

Cosmogenic nuclide geochronology is a series of related techniques for determining the age at which a geomorphic surface was created (exposure dating), or at which formerly surficial materials were buried (burial dating). These techniques use the concentration of exotic nuclides, such as <sup>10</sup>Be, <sup>26</sup>Al, and <sup>36</sup>Cl, produced by cosmic rays interacting with Earth materials as a proxy for the age of a surface or sediment.

#### Luminescence Dating

Luminescence dating techniques observe 'light' emitted from materials such as quartz, diamond, feldspar, and calcite. These techniques, including optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), thermoluminescence (TL), and infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL), are used to date sediments and soils. The amount of light emitted is proportional to the amount of radiation the material has received, which can be used to estimate the time since the material was last exposed to sunlight or heat.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the principles and applications of these geological dating techniques.





### Subsection 1.1c Stratigraphy and Fossils

Stratigraphy and fossils are two important tools in environmental earth science for understanding the Earth's history. Stratigraphy is the study of rock layers and their relationships, while fossils are the remains of ancient organisms that can provide valuable information about the past.

#### Stratigraphy

Stratigraphy is a crucial aspect of geology that deals with the study of rock layers and their relationships. These layers, or strata, are formed by sedimentation and can provide valuable information about the Earth's history. The principle of superposition, which states that younger layers are deposited on top of older layers, is a fundamental concept in stratigraphy.

Stratigraphic columns are vertical representations of rock layers, with the oldest layers at the bottom and the youngest at the top. These columns can be used to reconstruct the history of a particular area, including changes in sea level, climate, and the presence of ancient life.

#### Fossils

Fossils are the remains of ancient organisms that have been preserved in the Earth's crust. They can provide valuable information about the past, including the types of organisms that existed, the environment in which they lived, and the timing of their existence.

Fossils can be classified into two main types: body fossils and trace fossils. Body fossils are the remains of the organism itself, while trace fossils are impressions or traces left by the organism, such as footprints or burrows.

Fossils can also be used to determine the age of rocks. For example, if a rock layer contains fossils of a particular species that is known to have existed during a specific time period, then the rock layer can be dated to that time period.

In conclusion, stratigraphy and fossils are powerful tools in environmental earth science for understanding the Earth's history. By studying rock layers and their relationships, and the remains of ancient organisms, we can gain valuable insights into the past and the processes that have shaped our planet.




### Subsection 1.2a Stable Isotopes in Environmental Science

Stable isotopes play a crucial role in environmental science, providing valuable insights into the Earth's history and current environmental conditions. Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have different numbers of neutrons. The relative abundance of these isotopes can vary depending on the source, and this variation can be measured and analyzed.

#### Isotopes as Tracers

Isotopes can be used as tracers to track the movement of elements through various environmental systems. For example, the isotopes of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon are commonly used to study water and carbon cycling in the environment. These isotopes can provide information about the origin of the water or carbon, its age, and the processes it has undergone.

#### Isotopes and Climate Change

Isotopes can also be used to study climate change. For instance, the isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water can provide information about the temperature at which the water was formed. This can be used to reconstruct past climate conditions and to study the effects of climate change on water systems.

#### Isotopes and Paleoenvironments

Isotopes can be used to study paleoenvironments, or past environments. For example, the isotopes of carbon and oxygen in sedimentary rocks can provide information about the temperature and salinity of the ancient oceans. This can be used to reconstruct the climate and ocean conditions during past geological periods.

#### Isotopes and Paleoaltimetry

Isotopes can also be used in paleoaltimetry, the study of the altitude or uplift history of a region. The isotopes of strontium and neodymium, for example, can provide information about the altitude at which a rock was formed. This can be used to reconstruct the uplift history of a region, which can be useful for understanding the tectonic history of the Earth.

In conclusion, stable isotopes are powerful tools in environmental science, providing valuable insights into the Earth's history and current environmental conditions. Their use in various fields, including paleoenvironments, climate change, and paleoaltimetry, highlights their importance in understanding the complex interplay between the Earth's systems.




### Subsection 1.2b Radioactive Isotopes and Their Applications

Radioactive isotopes, unlike stable isotopes, are unstable and undergo radioactive decay, emitting radiation in the form of alpha, beta, or gamma particles. These isotopes have a wide range of applications in environmental science, medicine, and industry.

#### Radioisotopes in Environmental Science

Radioisotopes are used in environmental science for a variety of purposes. For instance, tritium, an isotope of hydrogen, is used in hydrogen bombs and nuclear reactors. It is also used in the production of tritiated water, which is used in a variety of applications, including as a tracer in environmental studies.

Plutonium-244, another radioisotope, is used as an internal standard for isotope dilution mass spectrometry analysis of plutonium. This allows for precise measurements of plutonium concentrations in environmental samples.

#### Radioisotopes in Medicine

Radioisotopes have numerous applications in medicine, particularly in the field of nuclear medicine. For example, iodine-131 is used in the treatment of thyroid cancer, while strontium-90 is used in the treatment of bone cancer. These isotopes are also used in imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), which allow for the visualization of metabolic processes in the body.

#### Radioisotopes in Industry

Radioisotopes are also used in various industrial applications. For instance, carbon-14 is used in radiocarbon dating, a method for determining the age of organic materials. This technique has been used to date a wide range of materials, from ancient artifacts to modern environmental samples.

In addition, radioisotopes are used in the production of smoke detectors, which contain small amounts of radioactive americium-241. This isotope is also used in the production of luminous paints and dials, which contain a small amount of radium-228.

#### Radioisotopes and Environmental Monitoring

Radioisotopes are used in environmental monitoring to detect and measure the presence of radioactive materials in the environment. For example, americium-241 is used in the production of smoke detectors, which can be used to detect the presence of radioactive materials in the air. Similarly, radium-228 is used in the production of luminous paints and dials, which can be used to detect the presence of radioactive materials on surfaces.

In conclusion, radioisotopes play a crucial role in environmental science, medicine, and industry. Their unique properties make them invaluable tools for a wide range of applications, from dating ancient artifacts to detecting radioactive materials in the environment.




### Subsection 1.2c Isotopic Fractionation and Mixing Models

Isotopic fractionation is a fundamental concept in environmental earth science that describes the preferential uptake of certain isotopes over others by organisms or during chemical reactions. This phenomenon can be used as a tracer to study the movement of elements and compounds in the environment.

#### Isotopic Fractionation

Isotopic fractionation occurs when different isotopes of the same element are distributed unevenly between two or more substances. This can occur due to differences in the affinity of isotopes for certain molecules or structures, or due to kinetic effects during chemical reactions.

For example, in the case of carbon isotopes, the heavier isotope, carbon-13, is preferentially taken up by organisms during photosynthesis. This results in a higher concentration of carbon-13 in organic matter compared to the atmosphere, which can be used to trace the movement of carbon in the environment.

#### Mixing Models

Mixing models are mathematical models used to describe the mixing of different substances in the environment. These models can be used to estimate the contribution of different sources to a particular sample, or to predict the movement of substances in the environment.

One type of mixing model is the end-member mixing model, which assumes that the sample of interest is a mixture of two or more end-members, each with a known isotopic composition. The isotopic composition of the sample can then be calculated based on the relative contributions of each end-member.

Another type of mixing model is the box model, which assumes that the system can be represented as a series of interconnected boxes, each with a known isotopic composition. The movement of substances between boxes can be described using mass balance equations, and the isotopic composition of the system can be calculated based on the relative contributions of each box.

#### Isotopic Fractionation and Mixing Models in Environmental Earth Science

Isotopic fractionation and mixing models are powerful tools in environmental earth science. They allow us to trace the movement of elements and compounds in the environment, and to understand the processes that drive these movements.

For example, in the study of the Selli Event, isotopic fractionation and mixing models have been used to trace the movement of iron and manganese in the ocean. By studying the isotopic composition of these elements, researchers have been able to reconstruct the oceanic anoxic event that occurred during this time, and to understand the role of these elements in the event.

Similarly, in the study of the carbon cycle, isotopic fractionation and mixing models have been used to trace the movement of carbon between the atmosphere, the ocean, and the land. This has allowed researchers to understand the role of different reservoirs in the carbon cycle, and to predict the effects of changes in the carbon cycle on the environment.

In conclusion, isotopic fractionation and mixing models are essential tools in environmental earth science. They allow us to understand the movement of elements and compounds in the environment, and to predict the effects of these movements on the environment.




### Subsection 1.3a Rock Types and Their Formation Processes

Rocks are an essential component of the Earth's surface and are formed through a variety of processes. These processes can be broadly categorized into three main types: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Each of these processes results in the formation of unique rock types with distinct characteristics.

#### Igneous Rocks

Igneous rocks are formed from molten rock, or magma, which is generated deep within the Earth's mantle. The magma can be either extrusive, meaning it is erupted onto the surface, or intrusive, meaning it cools and solidifies within the Earth's crust. The composition of the magma, as well as the conditions under which it cools and solidifies, determine the type of igneous rock that forms.

Extrusive igneous rocks, such as basalt and rhyolite, are typically dark in color and have a fine-grained texture due to rapid cooling. In contrast, intrusive igneous rocks, such as granite and diorite, are typically light in color and have a coarse-grained texture due to slower cooling.

#### Sedimentary Rocks

Sedimentary rocks are formed from the accumulation and consolidation of sediment, such as sand, silt, and organic matter. These sediments are deposited by wind, water, or ice, and can be derived from the weathering of existing rocks or from the remains of organisms.

The type of sedimentary rock that forms depends on the type of sediment deposited and the conditions under which it is consolidated. For example, sandstone is formed from the consolidation of sand, while limestone is formed from the consolidation of calcium carbonate, often derived from the shells of marine organisms.

#### Metamorphic Rocks

Metamorphic rocks are formed from the transformation of existing rocks under high pressure and temperature. This can occur deep within the Earth's crust, or at the interface between the crust and the mantle.

The type of metamorphic rock that forms depends on the type of parent rock, as well as the conditions under which it is metamorphosed. For example, gneiss is formed from the metamorphosis of granite under high pressure and temperature, while slate is formed from the metamorphosis of shale under lower pressure and temperature.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the properties and characteristics of these rock types, as well as their role in the Earth's environment.
