### Subsection 1.2a: Definition of Vector and Scalar Fields

In the previous section, we introduced the concepts of scalar and vector fields. In this section, we will delve deeper into these concepts and explore their mathematical definitions.

#### Scalar Fields

A scalar field is a function that assigns a scalar value to every point in a space. The scalar value represents a physical quantity, such as temperature, pressure, or spin. Scalar fields are the subject of scalar field theory, which is used to describe the behavior of scalar bosons, such as the Higgs field.

Mathematically, a scalar field $f(x)$ is defined as:

$$
f(x) = \text{scalar}
$$

where $x$ is a point in the space.

#### Vector Fields

A vector field is a function that assigns a vector to every point in a space. A vector field in the plane, for instance, can be visualized as a collection of arrows with a given magnitude and direction each attached to a point in the plane. Vector fields are often used to model the speed and direction of a moving fluid throughout space, or the strength and direction of some force, such as the magnetic or gravitational force, as it changes from point to point.

Mathematically, a vector field $\vec{F}(x)$ is defined as:

$$
\vec{F}(x) = \text{vector}
$$

where $x$ is a point in the space.

#### Vectors and Pseudovectors

In more advanced treatments, one further distinguishes pseudovector fields and pseudoscalar fields, which are identical to vector fields and scalar fields, except that they change sign under an orientation-reversing map. This distinction is clarified and elaborated in geometric algebra, as described below.

#### Vector Algebra

The algebraic operations in vector calculus are referred to as vector algebra. These operations are defined for a vector space and then globally applied to a vector field. The basic algebraic operations consist of addition, subtraction, and multiplication by a scalar. The two triple products, the dot product and the cross product, are also commonly used.

#### Operators and Theorems

Vector calculus studies various differential operators defined on scalar or vector fields, which are typically expressed in terms of the del operator ($\nabla$). These operators include the gradient, divergence, and curl, which are used to describe the behavior of vector fields. Theorems such as the divergence theorem and Stokes' theorem are also important in vector calculus.

In the next section, we will explore these concepts further and discuss their applications in electricity and magnetism.




### Subsection 1.2b: Properties of Vector and Scalar Fields

In the previous section, we introduced the concepts of scalar and vector fields. In this section, we will explore the properties of these fields, which are crucial to understanding their behavior and applications.

#### Symmetry

The symmetry of a field refers to how the field changes under certain transformations. For instance, the vector spherical harmonics (VSH) satisfy a certain symmetry property, as shown below:

$$
\mathbf{Y}_{\ell,-m} = (-1)^m \mathbf{Y}^*_{\ell m}, \\
\mathbf{\Psi}_{\ell,-m} = (-1)^m \mathbf{\Psi}^*_{\ell m}, \\
\mathbf{\Phi}_{\ell,-m} = (-1)^m \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{\ell m},
$$

where the star indicates complex conjugation. This symmetry cuts the number of independent functions roughly in half.

#### Orthogonality

The orthogonality of a field refers to how the field is perpendicular to other fields at each point. For the VSH, this property is given by:

$$
\mathbf{Y}_{\ell m}(\mathbf{r}) \cdot \mathbf{\Psi}_{\ell m}(\mathbf{r}) = 0, \\
\mathbf{Y}_{\ell m}(\mathbf{r}) \cdot \mathbf{\Phi}_{\ell m}(\mathbf{r}) = 0, \\
\mathbf{\Psi}_{\ell m}(\mathbf{r}) \cdot \mathbf{\Phi}_{\ell m}(\mathbf{r}) = 0.
$$

This property is also true in Hilbert space:

$$
\int\mathbf{Y}_{\ell m}\cdot \mathbf{Y}^*_{\ell'm'}\,d\Omega = \delta_{\ell\ell'}\delta_{mm'}, \\
\int\mathbf{\Psi}_{\ell m}\cdot \mathbf{\Psi}^*_{\ell'm'}\,d\Omega = \ell(\ell+1)\delta_{\ell\ell'}\delta_{mm'}, \\
\int\mathbf{\Phi}_{\ell m}\cdot \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{\ell'm'}\,d\Omega = \ell(\ell+1)\delta_{\ell\ell'}\delta_{mm'}, \\
\int\mathbf{Y}_{\ell m}\cdot \mathbf{\Psi}^*_{\ell'm'}\,d\Omega = 0, \\
\int\mathbf{Y}_{\ell m}\cdot \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{\ell'm'}\,d\Omega = 0, \\
\int\mathbf{\Psi}_{\ell m}\cdot \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{\ell'm'}\,d\Omega = 0.
$$

An additional result at a single point $\mathbf{r}$ (not reported in Barrera et al, 1985) is, for all $\ell,m,\ell',m'$,

$$
\mathbf{Y}_{\ell m}(\mathbf{r}) \cdot \mathbf{\Psi}_{\ell'm'}(\mathbf{r}) = 0, \\
\mathbf{Y}_{\ell m}(\mathbf{r}) \cdot \mathbf{\Phi}_{\ell'm'}(\mathbf{r}) = 0.
$$

#### Vector Multipole Moments

The orthogonality relations allow one to compute the spherical multipole moments of a vector field as

$$
E^r_{\ell m} = \int \mathbf{E}\cdot \mathbf{Y}^*_{\ell m}\,d\Omega, \\
E^{(1)}_{\ell m} = \frac{1}{\ell(\ell+1)}\int \mathbf{E}\cdot \mathbf{\Psi}^*_{\ell m}\,d\Omega.
$$

These properties are crucial to understanding the behavior of vector and scalar fields in various physical systems. In the next section, we will explore how these properties are applied in the study of electricity and magnetism.




### Subsection 1.2c: Applications of Vector and Scalar Fields

In this section, we will explore some of the applications of vector and scalar fields in the study of electricity and magnetism. These fields are fundamental to understanding the behavior of electric and magnetic phenomena, and their applications are vast.

#### Electromagnetic Fields

The electromagnetic field is a vector field that describes the electric and magnetic phenomena in space. It is represented by the electric and magnetic field vectors, $E$ and $B$, respectively. The electric field vector is defined as the force experienced by a positive test charge placed in the field, while the magnetic field vector is defined as the force experienced by a moving positive test charge placed in the field.

The electromagnetic field is governed by Maxwell's equations, which are a set of four differential equations that describe how electric and magnetic fields interact. These equations are fundamental to the study of electricity and magnetism, and they have numerous applications in various fields, including telecommunications, electronics, and medical imaging.

#### Vector Spherical Harmonics

Vector spherical harmonics (VSH) are a set of vector functions that are solutions to the Laplace equation in spherical coordinates. They are used in various applications, including the study of electromagnetic fields, fluid dynamics, and quantum mechanics.

The VSH satisfy certain symmetry and orthogonality properties, which make them useful in solving problems involving vector fields. For instance, the symmetry property of the VSH reduces the number of independent functions, while the orthogonality property allows us to decompose a vector field into a sum of VSH.

#### Lorenz Gauge, Electric and Magnetic Fields

The Lorenz gauge is a gauge condition that is used in the study of electromagnetic fields. It is defined as the condition that the divergence of the electric field vector is equal to the negative of the time derivative of the magnetic field vector.

The Lorenz gauge is useful in simplifying the equations of electromagnetism, and it has numerous applications in various fields, including the study of electromagnetic waves and the behavior of charged particles in electromagnetic fields.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the study of vector and scalar fields, and we will explore more of their applications in the study of electricity and magnetism.




### Subsection 1.3a: Definition of Gravitational Fields

In classical mechanics, a gravitational field is a physical quantity that describes the gravitational interaction between objects. It is defined using Newton's law of universal gravitation, which states that the force between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$$

where $F$ is the force, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the objects, and $r$ is the distance between them.

The gravitational field around a single particle of mass $m$ is a vector field consisting at every point of a vector pointing directly towards the particle. The magnitude of the field at every point is calculated by applying the universal law, and represents the force per unit mass on any object at that point in space. Because the force field is conservative, there is a scalar potential energy per unit mass, $U$, at each point in space associated with the force fields; this is called gravitational potential. The gravitational field equation is:

$$
\mathbf{g} = \frac{\mathbf{F}}{m} = \frac{d^2\mathbf{R}}{dt^2} = -GM\frac{\mathbf{\hat R}}{\left|\mathbf{R}\right|^2} = -\nabla\Phi
$$

where $\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational field, $\mathbf{F}$ is the gravitational force, $m$ is the mass of the test particle, $\mathbf{R}$ is the position of the test particle, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $\mathbf{\hat R}$ is the unit vector in the radial direction of $\mathbf{R}$, $t$ is time, and $\nabla\Phi$ is the gradient of the gravitational potential.

This includes Newton's law of universal gravitation, and the relation between gravitational potential and field acceleration. Note that $\mathbf{g}$ and $\nabla\Phi$ are both equal to the gravitational acceleration (equivalent to the inertial acceleration, so same mathematical form, but also defined as gravitational force per unit mass). The negative signs are inserted since the force acts antiparallel to the displacement. The equivalent field equation in terms of mass density of the attracting mass is:

$$
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{g} = -\nabla^2\Phi = -4\pi G\rho
$$

which contains Gauss's law for gravity, and Poisson's equation for gravity. Newton's law implies Gauss's law, but not vice versa.




### Subsection 1.3b: Properties of Gravitational Fields

The properties of gravitational fields are governed by the principles of general relativity, which is a theory of gravity that describes the gravitational interaction between objects. In general relativity, the gravitational field is not a separate entity, but rather a part of the fabric of space-time. This means that the gravitational field is not a vector field, but a tensor field.

The gravitational field is described by the Einstein field equations, which relate the curvature of space-time to the distribution of mass-energy. These equations can be written as:

$$
G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}
$$

where $G_{\mu\nu}$ is the Einstein tensor, $T_{\mu\nu}$ is the stress-energy tensor, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $c$ is the speed of light.

The Einstein field equations have several important properties. First, they are non-linear, meaning that the equations cannot be solved by simple substitution. Second, they are differential equations, meaning that they describe the behavior of the gravitational field at every point in space-time. Finally, they are covariant, meaning that they are independent of the choice of coordinate system.

The Einstein field equations also have several important implications. For example, they imply the existence of gravitational waves, which are ripples in the fabric of space-time that propagate at the speed of light. They also imply the equivalence principle, which states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames, including those in free fall.

In addition to the Einstein field equations, there are several other important properties of gravitational fields. For example, the gravitational field is a conservative field, meaning that the work done by a gravitational field on a closed loop is zero. This is a direct consequence of the conservation of energy.

Another important property of gravitational fields is that they are irrotational, meaning that the curl of the gravitational field is zero. This is a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum.

Finally, the gravitational field is a static field, meaning that it does not change with time. This is a consequence of the conservation of mass-energy, which states that the total mass-energy of a closed system is constant.

In summary, the properties of gravitational fields are governed by the principles of general relativity and have important implications for our understanding of the universe. They also provide a foundation for many applications, including the study of gravitational waves and the development of gravitational wave detectors.





### Subsection 1.3c: Applications of Gravitational Fields

#### 1.3c.1 Gravitational Waves

One of the most significant applications of gravitational fields is the discovery of gravitational waves. These are ripples in the fabric of space-time that propagate at the speed of light. The existence of gravitational waves was predicted by the Einstein field equations, which describe the behavior of the gravitational field.

The detection of gravitational waves was a significant milestone in the field of physics. It provided direct evidence of the existence of gravitational waves and confirmed the predictions of general relativity. This discovery has opened up new avenues for research, including the study of the early universe and the detection of gravitational waves from black holes and other celestial bodies.

#### 1.3c.2 Gravitational Fields in Engineering

Gravitational fields also have numerous applications in engineering. For example, the principles of gravitational fields are used in the design of satellites and spacecraft. The gravitational field is used to determine the orbit of these objects and to control their trajectory.

In addition, gravitational fields are used in the design of sensors and detectors. For example, the LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) uses the principles of gravitational fields to detect gravitational waves. This technology has numerous applications, including the detection of gravitational waves from black holes and the study of the early universe.

#### 1.3c.3 Gravitational Fields in Technology

Gravitational fields also have applications in technology. For example, the principles of gravitational fields are used in the design of levitation systems. These systems use the repulsive force between two magnets to levitate a train or other object. This technology has numerous applications, including high-speed rail systems and magnetic levitation trains.

In addition, gravitational fields are used in the design of sensors and detectors. For example, the LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) uses the principles of gravitational fields to detect gravitational waves. This technology has numerous applications, including the detection of gravitational waves from black holes and the study of the early universe.

#### 1.3c.4 Gravitational Fields in Cosmology

Gravitational fields also have applications in cosmology. For example, the principles of gravitational fields are used to study the large-scale structure of the universe. The distribution of matter in the universe creates a gravitational field that affects the motion of celestial bodies. By studying this gravitational field, scientists can gain insights into the structure and evolution of the universe.

In addition, gravitational fields are used in the study of black holes. The strong gravitational field near a black hole can distort light and other electromagnetic waves, creating a shadow that can be observed from a distance. This phenomenon, known as gravitational lensing, can provide valuable information about the properties of black holes and the universe.
