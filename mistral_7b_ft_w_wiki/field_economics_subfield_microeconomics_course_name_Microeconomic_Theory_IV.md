# Microeconomic Theory IV: A Comprehensive Guide to Decision Making and Market Design":


## Foreward

Welcome to "Microeconomic Theory IV: A Comprehensive Guide to Decision Making and Market Design". This book is designed to provide a thorough understanding of microeconomic theory and its applications in decision making and market design. As we delve into the complexities of microeconomic theory, we will explore the intricate relationship between individual decision making and market outcomes.

In this book, we will build upon the foundational concepts introduced in the previous three volumes of "Microeconomic Theory". We will delve deeper into the nuances of decision making and market design, exploring the interplay between individual rationality and market outcomes. We will also examine the role of groups in decision making, a topic that has been largely overlooked in traditional economic theory.

Behavioral game theory, a field that considers the effects of groups on rationality, has shed light on the difference in rationality between groups and individuals. Milton Friedman's argument that group behavior is often perceived as more rational than individual behavior has led to a need to model group decision-making behavior. This book will explore these concepts in depth, providing a comprehensive understanding of group decision-making behavior.

We will also delve into the beauty contest game, a game that has been used to study and compare individual and group behavior. This game, where participants choose a number between zero and one hundred, provides a fascinating insight into the dynamics of decision making and market design.

As we journey through this book, we will also explore the concept of bounded rationality, a concept that has been largely overlooked in traditional economic theory. This concept, which recognizes the limitations of human cognitive abilities, has significant implications for decision making and market design.

This book is designed to be a comprehensive guide, providing a thorough understanding of microeconomic theory and its applications. It is our hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and policymakers alike, providing a deeper understanding of the complexities of decision making and market design.

Welcome to the journey. Let's delve into the world of microeconomic theory and explore the fascinating interplay between individual decision making and market outcomes.




### Introduction

Welcome to the first chapter of "Microeconomic Theory IV: A Comprehensive Guide to Decision Making and Market Design". In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of decision making under uncertainty. This is a crucial aspect of microeconomic theory, as it helps us understand how individuals and firms make choices when faced with unknown outcomes.

The concept of uncertainty is central to many economic decisions. Whether it's a consumer choosing between different products, a firm deciding on a new investment, or a government policy maker setting a tax rate, all these decisions involve a degree of uncertainty. How we make these decisions, and how we design markets to facilitate these decisions, is the focus of this chapter.

We will begin by exploring the basic principles of decision making under uncertainty. We will discuss the concept of risk, and how it differs from uncertainty. We will also introduce the concept of expected utility, which is a fundamental tool in decision making under uncertainty.

Next, we will delve into the different types of decision making under uncertainty. We will discuss decisions under risk, where the outcomes are known but the probabilities are uncertain, and decisions under ambiguity, where the outcomes and probabilities are both uncertain.

Finally, we will explore the implications of decision making under uncertainty for market design. We will discuss how uncertainty affects market outcomes, and how we can design markets to mitigate the effects of uncertainty.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive guide to decision making under uncertainty. By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of the principles and tools used in decision making under uncertainty, and how these principles apply to market design.

So, let's embark on this journey of exploring decision making under uncertainty, and discover how it shapes our economic world.




### Subsection: 1.1a Introduction to Principal-Agent Models

Principal-agent models are a fundamental concept in microeconomic theory, providing a framework for understanding decision making under uncertainty. These models are particularly useful in situations where one party (the principal) delegates decision making to another party (the agent), and the principal must incentivize the agent to act in their best interest.

In the context of decision making under uncertainty, principal-agent models are often used to analyze situations where one party (the principal) has incomplete information about the actions of another party (the agent). This is particularly relevant in situations where the agent's actions are not directly observable, and the principal must rely on indirect signals to assess the agent's performance.

#### 1.1a.1 Static Principal-Agent Models

Static principal-agent models are a simple yet powerful tool for understanding decision making under uncertainty. In these models, the principal and agent interact only once, and the principal must make a decision based on the information available at that time.

The principal's decision is typically represented by a contract, which specifies the agent's compensation based on their performance. The agent's performance, in turn, is influenced by their effort level. The principal's goal is to design a contract that incentivizes the agent to exert high effort, while the agent's goal is to maximize their compensation.

#### 1.1a.2 Moral Hazard

One of the key challenges in principal-agent models is moral hazard. Moral hazard occurs when the agent's actions are not directly observable, and the principal cannot observe the agent's effort level. This creates an incentive for the agent to shirk their responsibilities, as their effort level is not directly observable.

In the context of decision making under uncertainty, moral hazard can lead to adverse selection. Adverse selection occurs when the principal cannot observe the agent's type, and the agent has an incentive to misrepresent their type to the principal. This can lead to suboptimal decisions, as the principal cannot accurately assess the agent's performance.

#### 1.1a.3 Applications of Principal-Agent Models

Principal-agent models have a wide range of applications in microeconomic theory. They are often used to analyze situations where one party has incomplete information about the actions of another party, and the principal must incentivize the agent to act in their best interest.

For example, principal-agent models can be used to analyze situations where a firm hires an employee, a government hires a contractor, or a consumer hires a service provider. In each of these situations, the principal must design a contract that incentivizes the agent to act in their best interest.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of moral hazard, and explore how it affects decision making under uncertainty.




### Subsection: 1.1b Types of Moral Hazard Problems

Moral hazard problems can be broadly classified into two types: ex-ante and ex-post moral hazard. 

#### 1.1b.1 Ex-Ante Moral Hazard

Ex-ante moral hazard occurs when the principal and agent interact before the agent's actions are observable. In this scenario, the agent has the opportunity to manipulate their actions to maximize their compensation. This type of moral hazard is particularly relevant in situations where the agent's actions are not directly observable, such as in the case of a worker's effort level.

To mitigate ex-ante moral hazard, the principal can design a contract that incentivizes the agent to act in their best interest. This can be achieved by tying the agent's compensation to their performance, such as in the case of a salesperson's commission.

#### 1.1b.2 Ex-Post Moral Hazard

Ex-post moral hazard occurs after the agent's actions are observable. In this scenario, the agent has already performed their actions and the principal must decide how to compensate the agent based on their performance. This type of moral hazard is particularly relevant in situations where the agent's actions are not directly observable, such as in the case of a doctor's diagnosis.

To mitigate ex-post moral hazard, the principal can design a contract that rewards the agent for good performance and punishes them for bad performance. This can be achieved by implementing a bonus-malus system, where the agent's compensation is adjusted based on their performance.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of moral hazard and explore its implications in more detail.




### Subsection: 1.1c Incentive Compatibility and the Revelation Principle

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of moral hazard and how it can be mitigated through contract design. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of incentive compatibility and its relationship with the revelation principle.

#### 1.1c.1 Incentive Compatibility

Incentive compatibility is a fundamental concept in mechanism design. It refers to the property of a mechanism where agents are incentivized to report their true type. In other words, an incentive-compatible mechanism ensures that agents have no incentive to lie about their type.

In the context of moral hazard, incentive compatibility is crucial. If the principal and agent are to engage in a contract, the agent must have an incentive to act in the best interest of the principal. This can be achieved by designing a contract that is incentive-compatible.

#### 1.1c.2 The Revelation Principle

The revelation principle is a fundamental principle in mechanism design. It states that if a social choice function can be implemented by an arbitrary mechanism, then the same function can be implemented by an incentive-compatible-direct-mechanism with the same equilibrium outcome (payoffs).

In simpler terms, the revelation principle states that if a mechanism can achieve a certain outcome, then there exists an incentive-compatible mechanism that can achieve the same outcome. This principle is of utmost importance in mechanism design as it helps in finding solutions to complex problems.

#### 1.1c.3 Incentive Compatibility and the Revelation Principle in Moral Hazard Models

In the context of moral hazard, the revelation principle can be used to design incentive-compatible contracts. If a principal and agent are to engage in a contract, the principal can design an incentive-compatible contract that achieves the desired outcome. This contract can be implemented using the revelation principle, which ensures that the agent has no incentive to lie about their type.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of dynamic moral hazard and how it can be mitigated through the use of reputation mechanisms.




### Subsection: 1.2a Team Production and Incentive Provision

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of incentive compatibility and its relationship with the revelation principle. In this section, we will explore the application of these concepts in the context of team production and incentive provision.

#### 1.2a.1 Team Production

Team production refers to the process of producing goods or services through the collective efforts of a group of individuals. This is often the case in large firms where tasks are complex and require a diverse set of skills. Team production can enhance company productivity by assigning tasks to expert workers with complementary skills (Alchian and Demsetz 1972).

However, team production also presents a unique set of challenges when it comes to incentive provision. The principal-agent problem, as discussed in the previous section, can manifest in team production scenarios. This is because the output of a team is often a function of the collective efforts of its members, and individual contributions cannot be easily identified. This can lead to moral hazard problems, where agents have an incentive to free-ride on the efforts of their team members.

#### 1.2a.2 Incentive Provision

Incentive provision is a crucial aspect of team production. It involves designing contracts that incentivize agents to act in the best interest of the principal. In the context of team production, this can be achieved by designing contracts that are incentive-compatible and implementable using the revelation principle.

Incentive-compatible contracts ensure that agents have an incentive to report their true type. This is crucial in team production scenarios, where agents may have an incentive to shirk their responsibilities or free-ride on the efforts of their team members. By designing incentive-compatible contracts, the principal can ensure that agents have an incentive to act in the best interest of the team.

The revelation principle, on the other hand, ensures that the desired outcome can be achieved through an incentive-compatible contract. This is important because it allows the principal to design a contract that achieves the desired outcome, without having to worry about the complexity of the contract.

#### 1.2a.3 Moral Hazard in Teams

Moral hazard can be a significant issue in team production scenarios. As discussed earlier, the principal-agent problem can manifest in team production, leading to moral hazard problems. This is because the output of a team is often a function of the collective efforts of its members, and individual contributions cannot be easily identified.

Incentive-compatible contracts and the revelation principle can help mitigate moral hazard in teams. By designing contracts that are incentive-compatible and implementable using the revelation principle, the principal can ensure that agents have an incentive to act in the best interest of the team. This can help reduce moral hazard problems and enhance team productivity.

In the next section, we will explore the role of peer pressure in mitigating moral hazard in teams.




### Subsection: 1.2b Incentive Schemes for Team Members

In the previous section, we discussed the importance of incentive provision in team production. In this section, we will delve deeper into the specifics of incentive schemes for team members.

#### 1.2b.1 Team-Based Incentives

Team-based incentives are a common approach to incentivizing team members. These incentives are based on the performance of the team as a whole, rather than individual performance. This can be particularly effective in team production scenarios, where individual contributions are difficult to identify and measure.

Team-based incentives can promote cohesiveness, trust, cooperation, and support within a team. Research has shown a positive relationship between team-based incentives and employees' work efficacy, stability, and salary as well as company output (Lawler and Thayer 1969).

#### 1.2b.2 Individual-Based Incentives

While team-based incentives can be effective, they can also lead to feelings of unfairness among team members. This is particularly true in situations where some team members contribute more than others, yet all receive the same level of incentive.

Individual-based incentives, on the other hand, can provide a clear link between effort and reward. This can be particularly motivating for employees, especially in situations where the effect of team incentives weakens as the team expands (Lawler and Thayer 1969).

#### 1.2b.3 Hybrid Incentive Schemes

In some cases, a combination of team-based and individual-based incentives can be used to provide a balance between the benefits of both approaches. This can be particularly effective in situations where team production involves a mix of tasks that are easily and difficultly identifiable.

For example, a hybrid incentive scheme could involve team-based incentives for tasks that are difficult to identify and individual-based incentives for tasks that are easily identifiable. This can provide the benefits of both approaches, while mitigating potential drawbacks.

#### 1.2b.4 Incentive Compatibility and Implementation

Regardless of the specific incentive scheme used, it is crucial to ensure that the scheme is incentive-compatible and implementable using the revelation principle. This can be achieved by designing contracts that align the interests of the principal and agent, and by ensuring that agents have an incentive to report their true type.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of moral hazard in more detail, and discuss strategies for mitigating moral hazard problems in team production scenarios.

### Subsection: 1.2c Risk Sharing in Team Environments

In the previous sections, we have discussed the importance of incentives in team production and the different types of incentives that can be used. However, in many team environments, there is also a risk of moral hazard, where team members may not exert as much effort as they would in the absence of incentives. This can be particularly problematic in situations where the team's performance is difficult to monitor.

#### 1.2c.1 Moral Hazard in Teams

Moral hazard in teams refers to the risk that team members may not exert as much effort as they would in the absence of incentives. This can be due to a variety of factors, including the difficulty of monitoring individual contributions, the potential for free-riding, and the potential for shirking.

#### 1.2c.2 Risk Sharing in Teams

One way to mitigate the risk of moral hazard in teams is through risk sharing. Risk sharing involves the distribution of risk among team members, such that each member is responsible for a portion of the risk. This can help to ensure that each member has an incentive to exert effort, as they are responsible for a portion of the team's performance.

Risk sharing can be achieved through various mechanisms, including team-based incentives, individual-based incentives, and hybrid incentive schemes. For example, in a team-based incentive scheme, each member's performance is considered in determining the team's incentive. This can help to ensure that each member has an incentive to exert effort, as their performance affects the team's performance.

#### 1.2c.3 Incentives and Risk Sharing

Incentives can play a crucial role in risk sharing in team environments. By providing incentives for performance, teams can help to ensure that each member has an incentive to exert effort. This can help to mitigate the risk of moral hazard and promote a more efficient allocation of effort.

However, it is important to note that incentives can also lead to a misallocation of effort, particularly if they are not well-designed. For example, if incentives are too high, team members may have an incentive to exert effort beyond what is necessary, leading to inefficiencies. Conversely, if incentives are too low, team members may have little incentive to exert effort, leading to a risk of moral hazard.

In conclusion, risk sharing in team environments is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. By understanding the role of incentives and risk sharing, teams can design incentive schemes that promote efficient effort allocation and mitigate the risk of moral hazard.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the complex world of decision making under uncertainty.
