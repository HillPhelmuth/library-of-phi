Trace element analysis is a powerful tool used in the field of geochemistry, biochemistry, and environmental science. It allows for the detection and quantification of trace elements, which are elements present in very small quantities in a given sample. These elements can provide valuable information about the origin, composition, and processes of the sample.

One of the most commonly used techniques for trace element analysis is neutron activation analysis (NAA). NAA is a non-destructive and highly sensitive method that utilizes the interaction between neutrons and atoms to identify and measure the concentration of trace elements in a sample. This technique has been widely used in various fields, including geochemistry, biochemistry, and environmental science, due to its ability to provide accurate and precise results.

### Subsection 1.2: Principles of Neutron Activation Analysis

Neutron activation analysis is a technique that utilizes the interaction between neutrons and atoms to identify and measure the concentration of trace elements in a sample. This technique is based on the principle of nuclear transmutation, where a neutron is absorbed by an atom, causing it to become excited and emit gamma rays. The energy of these gamma rays is unique to each element, allowing for the identification and quantification of the element.

The process of neutron activation analysis involves three main steps: irradiation, decay, and measurement. In the first step, the sample is exposed to a beam of neutrons, typically from a nuclear reactor. The neutrons interact with the atoms in the sample, causing them to become excited and emit gamma rays. In the second step, the sample is allowed to decay for a specific period of time, during which the excited atoms return to their ground state and emit more gamma rays. Finally, in the measurement step, the gamma rays emitted from the sample are detected and measured using specialized equipment.

One of the key advantages of neutron activation analysis is its sensitivity. It can detect trace elements at very low concentrations, making it a valuable tool for studying geological, biological, and environmental materials. Additionally, NAA is a non-destructive technique, meaning that the sample can be recovered and used for further analysis.

### Subsection 1.3: Applications of Trace Element Analysis

Trace element analysis has a wide range of applications in various fields, including geochemistry, biochemistry, and environmental science. In geochemistry, it is used to study the composition of rocks and minerals, as well as to identify the origin of different geological formations. In biochemistry, trace element analysis is used to study the composition of biological samples, such as tissues and fluids. In environmental science, it is used to study the impact of human activities on the environment, as well as to monitor the quality of air, water, and soil.

One of the most significant advantages of trace element analysis is its ability to provide information about the origin and composition of a sample. By studying the trace elements present in a sample, scientists can determine its source and the processes that have influenced its composition. This information can be crucial in understanding the formation of geological structures, the evolution of biological systems, and the impact of human activities on the environment.

### Section: 2.1a Trace Element Analysis of Geological Materials

Neutron activation analysis (NAA) has been widely used in the field of geology for the analysis of trace elements in various geological materials. This technique has proven to be a powerful tool for understanding the composition and evolution of geological materials, providing valuable insights into their origin and history.

#### 2.1a.1 Trace Element Analysis of Igneous Rocks

Igneous rocks, formed by the cooling and solidification of molten rock, are a common type of geological material that can be analyzed using NAA. The trace element composition of these rocks can provide information about the conditions under which they were formed, including the temperature, pressure, and the presence of certain elements.

For example, the trace element composition of basalt, a common type of igneous rock, can be used to determine the depth at which it was formed. This is because the trace element composition of basalt changes with depth, with deeper depths resulting in a higher concentration of certain elements.

#### 2.1a.2 Trace Element Analysis of Sedimentary Rocks

Sedimentary rocks, formed by the accumulation and lithification of sediments, are another type of geological material that can be analyzed using NAA. The trace element composition of these rocks can provide information about the source of the sediments, as well as the conditions under which they were deposited.

For instance, the trace element composition of sedimentary rocks can be used to identify the presence of certain minerals, such as quartz or feldspar, which can indicate the source of the sediments. Additionally, the trace element composition of these rocks can also provide insights into the redox conditions of the environment in which they were deposited.

#### 2.1a.3 Trace Element Analysis of Metamorphic Rocks

Metamorphic rocks, formed by the transformation of igneous or sedimentary rocks under high pressure and temperature, can also be analyzed using NAA. The trace element composition of these rocks can provide information about the conditions under which they were metamorphosed, as well as the composition of the parent rock.

For example, the trace element composition of garnet amphibolite, a common type of metamorphic rock, can be used to determine the temperature and pressure at which it was formed. This is because the trace element composition of garnet amphibolite changes with temperature and pressure, with higher temperatures and pressures resulting in a different trace element composition.
