## Chapter: - Chapter 1: Time-independent Hamiltonian:




### Section: 1.1 Introduction to Time-independent Hamiltonian:

In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of Hamiltonian mechanics and its equations of motion. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the time-independent Hamiltonian, which is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics.

The Hamiltonian, denoted by $\mathcal{H}$, is a function of position and momentum, and it represents the total energy of a system. In classical mechanics, the Hamiltonian is defined as the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of a system. However, in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian takes on a more complex form, incorporating the quantum mechanical operators for position and momentum.

The time-independent Hamiltonian is a special case of the Hamiltonian, where the Hamiltonian is independent of time. This is a crucial concept in quantum mechanics, as it allows us to make predictions about the future state of a system without considering the passage of time.

To understand the time-independent Hamiltonian, we must first understand the concept of deparametrization. Deparametrization is the process of removing the dependence of a system on a parameter, in this case, time. In the case of the parametrized clock and pendulum system, we can recover the usual equations of motion by deparametrizing the system.

The fundamental equations governing our system can be written as:

$$
\frac{dx}{d\tau} = \lambda \frac{p}{m}, \quad \frac{dp}{d\tau} = -\lambda m\omega^2x, \quad \frac{dt}{d\tau} = \lambda, \quad \frac{dp_t}{d\tau} = 0
$$

where $\tau$ is the deparametrized time. These equations represent the fundamental equations governing our system, and they can be used to make predictions about the future state of the system.

In the case of the parametrized clock and pendulum system, we can recover the usual equations of motion by deparametrizing the system. This allows us to make predictions about the future state of the system without considering the passage of time.

The time-independent Hamiltonian is a crucial concept in quantum mechanics, as it allows us to make predictions about the future state of a system without considering the passage of time. In the next section, we will explore the properties of the time-independent Hamiltonian and its applications in quantum mechanics.

### Subsection: 1.1b Mathematical Formulation of Time-independent Hamiltonian

The mathematical formulation of the time-independent Hamiltonian is crucial in understanding the behavior of quantum systems. It allows us to make predictions about the future state of a system without considering the passage of time.

The time-independent Hamiltonian is defined as:

$$
\mathcal{H} = \frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x)
$$

where $p$ is the momentum operator, $m$ is the mass of the particle, and $V(x)$ is the potential energy function. This equation represents the total energy of a system, and it is independent of time.

The Schrödinger equation for a time-independent Hamiltonian is given by:

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(x,t) = \mathcal{H} \Psi(x,t)
$$

where $\Psi(x,t)$ is the wave function of the system, and $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant. This equation describes the evolution of the wave function over time, and it is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics.

The time-independent Hamiltonian is particularly useful in quantum mechanics because it allows us to make predictions about the future state of a system without considering the passage of time. This is because the Hamiltonian is independent of time, and therefore, the equations of motion are also independent of time. This allows us to make predictions about the future state of a system without considering the passage of time.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of the time-independent Hamiltonian in more detail and discuss its applications in quantum mechanics.

To understand <math display="inline">\lim_{t \to \infty}\phi(t)</math>, the only terms <math display="inline"> c_i(t) = c_i(0) e^{-k \lambda_i t}</math> that remain are those where <math display="inline">\lambda_i = 0</math>, since

In other words, the equilibrium state of the system is determined completely by the kernel of <math display="inline">L</math>.

Since by definition, <math display="inline">\sum_{j}L_{ij} = 0</math>, the vector <math display="inline">\mathbf{v}^1</math> of all ones is in the kernel. If there are <math display="inline">k</math> disjoint connected components in the graph, then this vector of all ones can be split into the sum of <math display="inline">k</math> independent <math display="inline">\lambda = 0</math> eigenvectors of ones and zeros, where each connected component corresponds to an eigenvector with ones at the elements in the connected component and zeros elsewhere.

Since this is the solution to the heat diffusion equation, this makes perfect sense intuitively. We expect that neighboring elements in the graph will exchange energy until that energy is spread out evenly throughout all of the elements that are connected to each other.

### Subsection: 1.2 Solving Time-independent Schrödinger Equation:

The time-independent Schrödinger equation is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that describes the behavior of a quantum system. It is a mathematical representation of the conservation of energy in quantum mechanics. The equation is given by:

$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\psi + V\psi = E\psi
$$

where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, $m$ is the mass of the particle, $\psi$ is the wave function of the particle, $V$ is the potential energy of the particle, and $E$ is the energy of the particle.

To solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation, we must first understand the concept of eigenstates and eigenvalues. Eigenstates are states of a system that have a specific energy, and eigenvalues are the corresponding energies. The time-independent Schrödinger equation can be rewritten in terms of eigenstates and eigenvalues as:

$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\psi + V\psi = E\psi
$$

where $\psi$ is an eigenstate with energy $E$. This equation can be solved using various methods, such as the method of separation of variables or the variational method.

### Subsection: 1.2a Stationary States and Energy Eigenvalues:

In quantum mechanics, stationary states are states of a system that do not change over time. These states are described by wave functions that do not depend on time, and their energy is constant. The energy of a stationary state is given by the eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian operator.

The time-independent Schrödinger equation can be used to find the energy eigenvalues and eigenstates of a system. The eigenvalues represent the possible energies of the system, and the eigenstates represent the corresponding states. The eigenstates are orthogonal to each other, meaning that they are independent of each other.

The time-independent Schrödinger equation can also be used to find the probability of finding a particle in a particular state. The probability density is given by $|\psi|^2$, where $\psi$ is the wave function of the particle. This probability density can be used to calculate the average position and momentum of a particle in a particular state.

In summary, the time-independent Schrödinger equation is a powerful tool in quantum mechanics that allows us to understand the behavior of a quantum system. By solving this equation, we can find the energy eigenvalues and eigenstates of a system, as well as calculate the probability of finding a particle in a particular state.

### Section: 1.2b Eigenvalue Problems and Boundary Conditions

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of eigenvalue problems and their importance in quantum mechanics. In this section, we will delve deeper into the topic and explore the relationship between eigenvalue problems and boundary conditions.

#### 1.2b Eigenvalue Problems and Boundary Conditions

Eigenvalue problems are mathematical problems that involve finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. In quantum mechanics, these eigenvalues represent the possible energy levels of a system, while the eigenvectors represent the corresponding wavefunctions. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a Hamiltonian matrix are particularly important, as they provide information about the energy levels and wavefunctions of a quantum system.

Boundary conditions, on the other hand, are constraints placed on the wavefunction of a system. These constraints are necessary to ensure that the wavefunction is well-behaved and satisfies certain physical requirements. In quantum mechanics, boundary conditions are often used to determine the behavior of a wavefunction at the boundaries of a system.

The relationship between eigenvalue problems and boundary conditions is crucial in quantum mechanics. The eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian matrix are determined by the boundary conditions placed on the wavefunction. This means that by manipulating the boundary conditions, we can control the eigenvalues and therefore the energy levels of a system.

One way to manipulate boundary conditions is through the use of perturbation theory. Perturbation theory is a mathematical technique used to approximate the behavior of a system when it is subjected to a small perturbation. In quantum mechanics, perturbation theory is often used to study the effects of a small perturbation on the energy levels and wavefunctions of a system.

Let us consider a system with degenerate energy eigenstates and a perturbation that lifts this degeneracy to first order. This means that the perturbation causes a small change in the energy levels of the system, but does not significantly alter the wavefunctions. In this case, the boundary conditions remain the same, but the eigenvalues are modified. This allows us to study the effects of the perturbation on the energy levels of the system.

In conclusion, the relationship between eigenvalue problems and boundary conditions is crucial in understanding the behavior of quantum systems. By manipulating boundary conditions, we can control the eigenvalues and therefore the energy levels of a system. Perturbation theory provides a powerful tool for studying the effects of small perturbations on the energy levels and wavefunctions of a system.
