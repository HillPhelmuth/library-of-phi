Welcome to "Computational Design for Housing: A Comprehensive Guide". This book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the principles, processes, and applications of computational design in the context of housing. As the field of architecture continues to evolve, the integration of computational tools and techniques has become increasingly crucial in addressing the complex challenges of designing and constructing housing.

The book begins by exploring the concept of computer-aided architectural design (CAAD), a term that encompasses a wide range of computational tools and techniques used in the design and construction of buildings. CAAD offers numerous advantages, including the ability to map activities and functionalities in a two-way manner. This allows for a more efficient and effective design process, as well as the integration of various expert knowledge, tools, and media.

One of the key advantages of CAAD is its ability to cover the complete life cycle of a building, from construction to destruction. This includes the consideration of various factors such as construction, operations, reorganization, and destruction. By considering these factors, architects can design buildings that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional and sustainable.

The book also delves into the concept of a design continuum, which refers to the shared use of digital design tools and the exchange of information and knowledge between designers and across different projects. This concept highlights the importance of collaboration and knowledge sharing in the field of architecture.

In addition to these theoretical concepts, the book also provides practical examples and case studies to illustrate the application of computational design in housing. These examples will provide readers with a deeper understanding of the principles and processes involved in computational design and how they can be applied in real-world scenarios.

As the field of architecture continues to evolve, the integration of computational design will become increasingly important. This book aims to equip readers with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate this ever-changing landscape and harness the power of computational design for housing.

2. **Design Approaches and Methodologies:** Design approaches and methodologies provide a systematic and effective way to approach and solve the design problem. The top-down approach, bottom-up approach, and iterative and incremental methodologies are particularly useful in the design of housing solutions. These approaches and methodologies can be used to guide the design process and ensure that the housing solution is effective and efficient.

3. **User-Centered Design and Participatory Design:** User-centered design and participatory design are approaches that involve end-users in the design process. These approaches are particularly important in the design of housing solutions as they ensure that the housing solution meets the needs and preferences of the end-users. User-centered design can be used to understand the needs and preferences of the end-users, while participatory design can be used to actively involve the end-users in the design process.

4. **Computational Tools and Techniques:** Computational tools and techniques are essential in the design of housing solutions. These tools and techniques can be used to model and simulate the design solution, evaluate the design solution, and optimize the design solution. Some of the key computational tools and techniques include computer-aided design (CAD) software, building information modeling (BIM) software, and computational design tools.

In the next section, we will discuss the challenges that arise in the application of these key concepts in the design of housing solutions.

#### 2.2b Understanding Key Challenges

In the previous section, we discussed the key concepts that guide the design of housing solutions. However, the application of these concepts in the real world is not without its challenges. In this section, we will explore some of the key challenges that designers face when applying these concepts in the design of housing solutions.

1. **Complexity of Design Problems:** The design of housing solutions is a complex problem that involves multiple stakeholders, diverse needs and preferences, and a wide range of design decisions. This complexity can make it difficult to apply the principles of design, design approaches and methodologies, and user-centered design in a systematic and effective manner.

2. **Lack of Standardization:** The field of housing design is characterized by a lack of standardization. This means that there is no agreed-upon set of design principles, approaches, and methodologies. This lack of standardization can make it difficult for designers to know which principles, approaches, and methodologies to apply in a given situation.

3. **Limited Availability of Computational Tools:** Despite the potential benefits of computational tools in the design of housing solutions, these tools are not always readily available to designers. This can be due to a variety of factors, including cost, complexity, and lack of access.

4. **Resistance to Change:** The design of housing solutions often involves significant changes to existing structures or processes. This can lead to resistance from stakeholders who are comfortable with the status quo.

5. **Ethical and Social Implications:** The design of housing solutions can have significant ethical and social implications. For example, the use of certain design principles or approaches may raise concerns about equity, privacy, or sustainability.

In the next section, we will discuss some strategies for addressing these challenges and overcoming them in the design of housing solutions.

#### 2.2c Strategies for Overcoming Challenges

Overcoming the challenges in the design of housing solutions requires a strategic approach that addresses the root causes of these challenges. Here are some strategies that can be employed:

1. **Embracing Complexity:** Instead of shying away from the complexity of design problems, designers can embrace it and use it to their advantage. This can be achieved by adopting a holistic approach that considers all stakeholders, needs, and preferences. Tools such as the Integrated Modification Methodology (IMM) can be used to manage this complexity (Ottosson, S).

2. **Promoting Standardization:** To overcome the lack of standardization, designers can work towards promoting standardization in the field of housing design. This can be achieved by developing and sharing best practices, guidelines, and templates. The Multimedia Web Ontology Language (MOWL) can be used to formalize these standards (Baader, F., Calvanese, F., & Scannapieco, M.).

3. **Leveraging Computational Tools:** Despite the limited availability of computational tools, designers can leverage the ones that are available to them. This can be achieved by learning how to use these tools effectively and advocating for their wider availability. The Plinian Core, for instance, can be used to incorporate a number of elements defined by other standards (Plinian Core).

4. **Managing Resistance to Change:** To manage resistance to change, designers can engage in change management activities such as communication, training, and incentivization. These activities can help stakeholders understand the benefits of the proposed changes and motivate them to embrace them.

5. **Addressing Ethical and Social Implications:** To address the ethical and social implications of housing design, designers can engage in ethical design practices. This can involve conducting ethical impact assessments, seeking input from diverse stakeholders, and adhering to ethical design principles such as equity, privacy, and sustainability.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into these strategies and provide practical examples of how they can be applied in the design of housing solutions.

## Chapter 3: Design Process:




### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of shape grammars and their role in computational design for housing. We discussed how shape grammars provide a systematic approach to generating and manipulating shapes, allowing designers to create complex and varied designs. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of shape grammars, specifically focusing on 2D shape grammars.

Shape grammars are a powerful tool in computational design, allowing designers to create and manipulate shapes in a systematic and efficient manner. They are particularly useful in the field of housing design, where designers often need to create a large number of variations on a basic design. By using shape grammars, designers can generate a vast array of designs from a single set of rules, saving time and effort.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamentals of 2D shape grammars, including their syntax and semantics. We will also discuss how to use shape grammars to generate and manipulate shapes, and how to apply them in housing design. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of 2D shape grammars and their role in computational design for housing.




### Section: 3.1 Introduction to Shape Grammars for 2D Site Plan:

Shape grammars are a powerful tool in computational design, allowing designers to create and manipulate shapes in a systematic and efficient manner. In this section, we will explore the basics of shape grammars and how they can be applied to 2D site plans.

#### 3.1a Basics of Shape Grammars

Shape grammars are a type of formal grammar that describes the generation of shapes. They are based on the concept of shape rules, which define how an existing shape can be transformed. These rules are processed by a generation engine, which selects and applies them to create new shapes.

A shape grammar consists of three main components: shape rules, a generation engine, and a set of initial shapes. The shape rules define the transformations that can be applied to the initial shapes, while the generation engine selects and applies these rules to create new shapes. The initial shapes serve as the starting point for the generation process.

Shape grammars are particularly useful in housing design, as they allow designers to create a large number of variations on a basic design. By using shape rules, designers can systematically manipulate shapes to create new designs, saving time and effort.

#### 3.1b Shape Rules

Shape rules are the heart of a shape grammar. They define the transformations that can be applied to existing shapes. Each shape rule consists of two parts: the left-hand side (LHS) and the right-hand side (RHS). The LHS depicts a condition in terms of a shape and a marker, while the RHS shows how the LHS shape should be transformed and where the marker is positioned.

The marker helps to locate and orient the new shape. It is a crucial component of shape rules, as it allows for the creation of complex and varied designs. By using markers, designers can specify the location and orientation of new shapes within a larger design.

#### 3.1c Generation Engine

The generation engine is responsible for selecting and applying shape rules to create new shapes. It is the engine that drives the shape generation process. The generation engine can be programmed to follow specific rules or algorithms, or it can be left to make random choices.

The generation engine is a crucial component of shape grammars, as it determines the overall shape of the design. By carefully programming the generation engine, designers can control the generation process and create designs with specific characteristics.

#### 3.1d Applications of Shape Grammars in Housing Design

Shape grammars have a wide range of applications in housing design. They can be used to create complex and varied designs, making them ideal for creating unique and personalized housing solutions. By using shape grammars, designers can quickly generate a large number of design options, allowing for more efficient and effective decision-making.

In addition, shape grammars can also be used to optimize housing designs. By setting specific design criteria and using shape rules to meet those criteria, designers can create housing solutions that are tailored to specific needs and requirements. This can be particularly useful in addressing issues such as energy efficiency and sustainability in housing design.

#### 3.1e Conclusion

In conclusion, shape grammars are a powerful tool in computational design, particularly in housing design. By using shape rules and a generation engine, designers can create complex and varied designs, optimize housing solutions, and save time and effort in the design process. In the next section, we will explore the specific applications of shape grammars in 2D site plans.

See publications of Hervé Brönnimann, J. Ian Munro, and Greg Frederickson # Shape grammar

Shape grammars in computation are a specific class of production systems that generate geometric shapes. Typically, shapes are 2- or 3-dimensional, thus shape grammars are a way to study 2- and 3-dimensional languages. Shape grammars were first introduced in a seminal article by George Stiny and James Gips in 1971. The mathematical and algorithmic foundations of shape grammars (in particular, for linear elements in two-dimensions) were developed in "Pictorial and Formal Aspects of Shapes and Shape Grammars" (Birkhäuser Basel, 1975) by George Stiny. Applications of shape grammars were first considered in "Shape Grammars and their Uses" (Birkhäuser Basel, 1975) by James Gips. These publications also contain two independent, though equivalent, constructions showing that shape grammars can simulate Turing machines.

## Definition

A shape grammar consists of "shape rules" and a "generation engine" that selects and processes rules. A shape rule defines how an existing (part of a) shape can be transformed. A shape rule consists of two parts separated by an arrow pointing from left to right. The part left of the arrow is termed the "Left-Hand Side" (LHS). It depicts a condition in terms of a shape and a marker. The part right of the arrow is termed the "Right-Hand Side" (RHS). It depicts how the LHS shape should be transformed and where the marker is positioned. The marker helps to locate and orient the new shape.

A shape grammar minimally consists of three shape rules: a "start rule", at least one transformation rule, and a "termination rule". The start rule is necessary to start the shape generation process. The termination rule is necessary to make the shape generation process stop. The simplest way to stop the process is by a shape rule that removes the marker. Shape grammars differ from Chomsky grammars in a major respect: the production rules in shape grammars are not context-free. This means that the transformation of a shape cannot be determined by looking at a single shape, but rather requires considering the entire context in which the shape appears. This allows for more complex and varied transformations, making shape grammars a powerful tool in computational design.

### Subsection: 3.1c Examples of 2D Shape Grammars

In this section, we will explore some examples of 2D shape grammars to better understand their application in computational design for housing. These examples will demonstrate how shape grammars can be used to generate complex and varied housing designs.

#### 3.1c.1 Example 1: Single-Family Home Design

Consider a shape grammar for generating single-family home designs. The start rule could be a simple rectangular shape representing a basic house. The transformation rules could then introduce variations such as adding a second story, adding a garage, or changing the shape of the roof. The termination rule could be a shape that indicates the design process is complete, such as a fully detailed house with all necessary features.

#### 3.1c.2 Example 2: Multi-Family Home Design

A shape grammar can also be used to generate designs for multi-family homes. The start rule could be a basic apartment building, and the transformation rules could introduce variations such as adding more floors, changing the layout of the apartments, or adding amenities such as a pool or a garden. The termination rule could be a fully detailed apartment building with all necessary features.

#### 3.1c.3 Example 3: Mixed-Use Development

Shape grammars can also be used to generate designs for mixed-use developments, which combine residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. The start rule could be a basic mixed-use development, and the transformation rules could introduce variations such as adding more types of spaces, changing the layout of the spaces, or adding features such as a public park or a community center. The termination rule could be a fully detailed mixed-use development with all necessary features.

These examples demonstrate the versatility of shape grammars in generating complex and varied housing designs. By defining a set of shape rules and a generation engine, designers can create a wide range of designs that adhere to specific design principles and constraints. This approach can greatly speed up the design process and allow for more exploration and experimentation.




### Subsection: 3.2a Understanding Housing Design

Housing design is a complex process that involves creating a structure that provides shelter, security, and comfort to its inhabitants. It is a critical aspect of urban planning and architecture, and it has a significant impact on the quality of life of individuals and communities. The design of housing is influenced by a variety of factors, including cultural, social, economic, and environmental considerations.

#### 3.2a.1 Cultural and Social Influences

Cultural and social influences play a significant role in housing design. The cultural values and beliefs of a society can shape the design of housing, as they determine the desired features and characteristics of a home. For example, in some cultures, it is important for a home to have a strong connection to nature, while in others, privacy and security are more valued. Social factors, such as family structure and lifestyle, can also influence the design of housing. For instance, the rise of nuclear families and the increasing popularity of open-plan living have led to changes in housing design.

#### 3.2a.2 Economic Considerations

Economic considerations are another important factor in housing design. The cost of land, labor, and materials can significantly impact the design and construction of a home. In addition, economic factors can also influence the size and layout of a home. For example, in areas with high land costs, homes may be built vertically to maximize living space.

### Section: 4.1 Understanding 3D Shape Grammars:

In the previous chapter, we explored the fundamentals of shape grammars and their applications in computational design. We learned how shape grammars can be used to generate and manipulate shapes, providing a powerful tool for designers and architects. In this section, we will delve deeper into the world of shape grammars, specifically focusing on their three-dimensional (3D) applications.

Shape grammars 3D is a natural extension of the 2D shape grammars we have previously discussed. It allows us to generate and manipulate 3D shapes, providing a more realistic and detailed representation of the design. This is particularly useful in the field of housing design, where 3D models can be used to visualize and test different design ideas.

#### 4.1a Basics of 3D Shape Grammars

Shape grammars 3D work similarly to their 2D counterparts, but with the added dimension of depth. This allows for more complex and realistic shapes to be generated. The process of generating a 3D shape using shape grammars involves defining a set of shape rules and applying them to a starting shape. These rules can include transformations such as rotation, scaling, and translation, as well as more complex operations such as extrusion and intersection.

One of the key concepts in shape grammars 3D is the use of implicit data structures. These structures allow for the representation of complex shapes using a set of rules and parameters, rather than explicitly defining every point and vertex of the shape. This not only simplifies the generation process, but also allows for more flexibility and adaptability in the final shape.

Another important aspect of shape grammars 3D is the use of multimodal language models. These models, such as GPT-4, use natural language processing techniques to generate shapes based on a set of instructions or descriptions. This allows for a more intuitive and user-friendly approach to shape generation, as designers can simply describe the shape they want to create rather than having to define a set of rules and parameters.

In addition to these techniques, shape grammars 3D also incorporate the use of implicit k-d trees. These data structures are used to efficiently store and retrieve information about the shape, making it easier to manipulate and transform the shape. This is particularly useful in the context of housing design, where complex and intricate shapes may need to be generated and modified.

Overall, shape grammars 3D provide a powerful and versatile tool for designers and architects looking to create complex and realistic 3D shapes. By combining techniques such as implicit data structures, multimodal language models, and implicit k-d trees, shape grammars 3D allow for a more efficient and intuitive approach to shape generation. In the next section, we will explore some specific examples of shape grammars 3D in action, and how they can be applied in the field of housing design.

Shape grammars in computation are a specific class of production systems that generate geometric shapes. Typically, shapes are 2- or 3-dimensional, thus shape grammars are a way to study 2- and 3-dimensional languages. Shape grammars were first introduced in a seminal article by George Stiny and James Gips in 1971. The mathematical and algorithmic foundations of shape grammars (in particular, for linear elements in two-dimensions) were developed in "Pictorial and Formal Aspects of Shapes and Shape Grammars" (Birkhäuser Basel, 1975) by George Stiny. Applications of shape grammars were first considered in "Shape Grammars and their Uses" (Birkhäuser Basel, 1975) by James Gips. These publications also contain two independent, though equivalent, constructions showing that shape grammars can simulate Turing machines.

## Definition

A shape grammar consists of "shape rules" and a "generation engine" that selects and processes rules. A shape rule defines how an existing (part of a) shape can be transformed. A shape rule consists of two parts separated by an arrow pointing from left to right. The part left of the arrow is termed the "Left-Hand Side" (LHS). It depicts a condition in terms of a shape and a marker. The part right of the arrow is termed the "Right-Hand Side" (RHS). It depicts how the LHS shape should be transformed and where the marker is positioned. The marker helps to locate and orient the new shape.

A shape grammar minimally consists of three shape rules: a "start rule", at least one transformation rule, and a "termination rule". The start rule is necessary to start the shape generation process. The termination rule is necessary to make the shape generation process stop. The simplest way to stop the process is by a shape rule that removes the marker. Shape grammars differ from Chomsky grammars in a major respect: the production of shapes is not limited to a single shape, but can generate a variety of shapes from a single set of rules. This allows for the creation of complex and diverse designs, making shape grammars a powerful tool in computational design for housing.

In the previous section, we discussed the basics of 3D shape grammars and their applications in computational design. In this section, we will explore some examples of 3D shape grammars in action.

#### 4.1c.1 Shape Grammars in Architectural Design

One of the most common applications of shape grammars in computational design is in architectural design. Shape grammars can be used to generate complex architectural forms, such as buildings, bridges, and even entire urban landscapes.

For example, consider the shape grammar rule shown below:

$$
\begin{align*}
LHS: & \quad \text{A cube with a marker on one of its vertices} \\
RHS: & \quad \text{A cube with a marker on one of its vertices, and a smaller cube attached to it}
\end{align*}
$$

This rule can be used to generate a series of increasingly complex architectural forms, starting with a simple cube and gradually adding more and more detail. This approach can be used to create intricate and visually interesting architectural designs.

#### 4.1c.2 Shape Grammars in Product Design

Shape grammars are also widely used in product design, particularly in the design of complex mechanical systems. By using shape grammars, designers can generate a large number of design variations, allowing them to explore a wide range of design possibilities.

For instance, consider the shape grammar rule shown below:

$$
\begin{align*}
LHS: & \quad \text{A cylinder with a marker on one of its ends} \\
RHS: & \quad \text{A cylinder with a marker on one of its ends, and a smaller cylinder attached to it}
\end{align*}
$$

This rule can be used to generate a series of increasingly complex mechanical systems, such as gears, levers, and pulleys. This approach can be particularly useful in the design of complex mechanical systems, where there are often many interconnected parts.

#### 4.1c.3 Shape Grammars in Urban Planning

Shape grammars can also be used in urban planning, particularly in the design of urban landscapes. By using shape grammars, urban planners can generate a large number of design variations, allowing them to explore a wide range of design possibilities.

For example, consider the shape grammar rule shown below:

$$
\begin{align*}
LHS: & \quad \text{A square with a marker on one of its corners} \\
RHS: & \quad \text{A square with a marker on one of its corners, and a smaller square attached to it}
\end{align*}
$$

This rule can be used to generate a series of increasingly complex urban landscapes, such as city blocks, neighborhoods, and even entire cities. This approach can be particularly useful in the design of urban landscapes, where there are often many interconnected elements.

In conclusion, shape grammars are a powerful tool in computational design, with a wide range of applications in various fields. By using shape grammars, designers can generate a large number of design variations, allowing them to explore a wide range of design possibilities.

#### 5.1b Creating 3D Abstract Models

Creating 3D abstract models involves a series of steps, each of which requires a different set of tools and techniques. The first step is to define the parameters of the model, such as the size and shape of the buildings, the layout of the streets, and the overall density of the cluster. This can be done using parametric modeling software, which allows for the creation of complex and customizable designs.

Once the parameters have been defined, the next step is to generate the model itself. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as extrusion, where a 2D shape is extended into a 3D object, or Boolean operations, where multiple shapes are combined to create a new shape. These techniques can be combined to create a highly detailed and realistic model.

After the model has been generated, it can be further refined and optimized. This can involve adding details such as windows, doors, and landscaping, as well as adjusting the model to address any design flaws or inefficiencies. This process can be iterative, with designers making changes and improvements to the model until they are satisfied with the result.

#### 5.1c Benefits and Challenges of 3D Abstract Models

The use of 3D abstract models in housing design offers numerous benefits. These models allow for a more comprehensive and realistic understanding of the design, helping designers to identify potential issues and make necessary adjustments. They also allow for a more efficient design process, as changes can be made quickly and easily without the need for physical construction.

However, there are also challenges associated with the use of 3D abstract models. These models require a certain level of technical expertise to create and manipulate, which can be a barrier for some designers. Additionally, the creation of these models can be time-consuming, especially for larger and more complex clusters.

Despite these challenges, the benefits of 3D abstract models make them an invaluable tool in the field of housing design. As computational design continues to advance, these models will become even more sophisticated and accessible, further enhancing the design process and creating more efficient and innovative housing solutions.

Shape grammars in computation are a specific class of production systems that generate geometric shapes. Typically, shapes are 2- or 3-dimensional, thus shape grammars are a way to study 2- and 3-dimensional languages. Shape grammars were first introduced in a seminal article by George Stiny and James Gips in 1971. The mathematical and algorithmic foundations of shape grammars (in particular, for linear elements in two-dimensions) were developed in "Pictorial and Formal Aspects of Shapes and Shape Grammars" (Birkhäuser Basel, 1975) by George Stiny. Applications of shape grammars were first considered in "Shape Grammars and their Uses" (Birkhäuser Basel, 1975) by James Gips. These publications also contain two independent, though equivalent, constructions showing that shape grammars can simulate Turing machines.

## Definition

A shape grammar consists of "shape rules" and a "generation engine" that selects and processes rules. A shape rule defines how an existing (part of a) shape can be transformed. A shape rule consists of two parts separated by an arrow pointing from left to right. The part left of the arrow is termed the "Left-Hand Side" (LHS). It depicts a condition in terms of a shape and a marker. The part right of the arrow is termed the "Right-Hand Side" (RHS). It depicts how the LHS shape should be transformed and where the marker is positioned. The marker helps to locate and orient the new shape.

A shape grammar minimally consists of three shape rules: a "start rule", at least one transformation rule, and a "termination rule". The start rule is necessary to start the shape generation process. The termination rule is necessary to make the shape generation process stop. The simplest way to stop the process is by a shape rule that removes the marker. Shape grammars differ from Chomsky grammars in a major respect: the production of shapes is not governed by a single rule, but by a set of shape rules. This allows for a more flexible and dynamic approach to shape generation.

Shape grammars are particularly useful in the context of housing design, where a large number of buildings need to be generated in a cohesive and visually appealing manner.

The use of shape grammars in 3D models allows for a more efficient and systematic approach to design. By defining a set of rules and guidelines, designers can generate a large number of variations on a theme, providing a diverse and unique housing complex. This also allows for a more flexible and dynamic approach to design, as changes can be made to the shape rules and the generation process can be restarted, resulting in a new set of designs.

In the next section, we will explore the specific applications of shape grammars in the creation of 3D abstract models of clusters. We will discuss the benefits and challenges of using shape grammars in this context, and provide examples of how they can be used to create visually appealing and functional housing designs.





### Subsection: 5.1c Examples of 3D Abstract Models

In the previous section, we discussed the basics of 3D abstract models and their importance in computational design for housing. In this section, we will explore some examples of 3D abstract models and how they are used in the design process.

#### 5.1c.1 Cellular Model

The cellular model is a type of 3D abstract model that is commonly used in computational design for housing. It is based on the concept of cells, which are small, self-contained units that can be combined to create larger structures. The cellular model allows for the creation of complex and varied housing designs by combining different types of cells.

One example of a cellular model is the "Cellular Model for Housing Design" developed by the MIT Department of Architecture. This model uses a set of predefined cells, each with its own set of design parameters, to create a variety of housing designs. The model also allows for the manipulation of these cells, such as changing their size, shape, and orientation, to create unique housing designs.

#### 5.1c.2 Implicit Data Structure

Another type of 3D abstract model is the implicit data structure. This model is based on the concept of implicit data, which is data that is not explicitly defined but can be inferred from other data. In the context of computational design for housing, implicit data structures are used to represent complex housing designs in a compact and efficient manner.

One example of an implicit data structure is the "Implicit Data Structure for Housing Design" developed by the University of California, Berkeley. This model uses a set of implicit data structures, each representing a different aspect of a housing design, to create a comprehensive and detailed housing design. The model also allows for the manipulation of these structures, such as changing their parameters, to create variations of the same design.

#### 5.1c.3 Shape Grammar

Shape grammars are another type of 3D abstract model that is commonly used in computational design for housing. They are based on the concept of shape rules, which define how a shape can be transformed into another shape. By combining shape rules, designers can create complex and varied housing designs.

One example of a shape grammar is the "Shape Grammar for Housing Design" developed by the University of Cambridge. This model uses a set of shape rules, each representing a different design element, to create a variety of housing designs. The model also allows for the manipulation of these rules, such as changing their parameters, to create unique housing designs.

#### 5.1c.4 Cellular Automata

Cellular automata are a type of 3D abstract model that is used to simulate complex systems, such as traffic flow or urban growth. They are based on the concept of cells, similar to the cellular model, but with a more defined set of rules for how cells interact with each other.

One example of a cellular automata model is the "Cellular Automata for Housing Design" developed by the University of Tokyo. This model uses a set of predefined cells and rules to simulate the growth and evolution of a housing design. By manipulating the rules, designers can create different scenarios and explore the potential outcomes of their housing design.

#### 5.1c.5 Parametric Modeling

They will also have the necessary knowledge and skills to apply AutoGrammar in their own housing design projects. So let's dive in and explore the world of computational design for housing with AutoGrammar.




### Section: 6.1 Introduction to AutoGrammar:

AutoGrammar is a powerful computational design tool that has been widely used in various fields, including architecture and urban planning. It is a grammar induction algorithm that allows for the generation of design rules and constraints based on a given set of design examples. In this section, we will provide an overview of AutoGrammar and its application in housing design.

#### 6.1a Basics of AutoGrammar

AutoGrammar is based on the principles of formal grammars and machine learning. It takes a set of design examples as input and uses them to generate a formal grammar that describes the underlying design rules and constraints. This grammar can then be used to generate new design solutions that adhere to the same rules and constraints.

The process of using AutoGrammar involves three main steps: data preparation, model training, and rule generation. In the data preparation step, the design examples are cleaned and preprocessed to be used as input for the algorithm. This may involve removing unnecessary information, normalizing data, and converting data into a suitable format for the algorithm.

In the model training step, the algorithm learns the underlying design rules and constraints from the prepared data. This is done through a process of induction, where the algorithm iteratively refines the grammar until it accurately describes the given design examples. The algorithm uses a combination of formal grammars and machine learning techniques to achieve this.

Finally, in the rule generation step, the algorithm generates new design solutions based on the learned grammar. This can be done by generating new design examples or by modifying existing ones. The generated solutions can then be evaluated and refined by the designer.

#### 6.1b Application of AutoGrammar in Housing Design

AutoGrammar has been widely used in housing design to generate design rules and constraints that can guide the design process. By using AutoGrammar, designers can automate certain design tasks, reducing the time and effort required for the design process. Additionally, AutoGrammar provides a systematic and data-driven approach to design, allowing for more efficient and effective solutions.

One of the key applications of AutoGrammar in housing design is in the generation of design guidelines. These guidelines can be used to ensure that new housing developments adhere to a set of design principles and constraints. By using AutoGrammar, designers can generate these guidelines based on a set of existing design examples, providing a data-driven and systematic approach to design.

Another application of AutoGrammar in housing design is in the optimization of existing designs. By using AutoGrammar, designers can generate new design solutions that adhere to the same design rules and constraints as the existing design. This can help identify areas for improvement and optimization in the existing design.

#### 6.1c Examples of AutoGrammar in Housing Design

To further illustrate the application of AutoGrammar in housing design, let's consider an example. Suppose we have a set of existing housing designs that adhere to a set of design principles and constraints. By using AutoGrammar, we can generate a formal grammar that describes these design principles and constraints. This grammar can then be used to generate new design solutions that adhere to the same principles and constraints.

For example, let's say we have a set of existing housing designs that all have a rectangular footprint and a single-story layout. By using AutoGrammar, we can generate a grammar that describes this design principle. This grammar can then be used to generate new design solutions that also have a rectangular footprint and a single-story layout.

In conclusion, AutoGrammar is a powerful computational design tool that has been widely used in housing design. By using AutoGrammar, designers can generate design rules and constraints, optimize existing designs, and generate new design solutions. In the next section, we will provide a step-by-step tutorial on how to use AutoGrammar for housing design.

### Section: 6.2 Understanding Given Spatial Relations:

In the previous section, we discussed the basics of spatial relations and how they are used in computational design. In this section, we will delve deeper into understanding given spatial relations and how they can be used in the design process.

#### 6.2a Understanding Spatial Relations

Spatial relations are fundamental to the design process as they help us understand the relationships between different elements in a design. They allow us to describe and analyze the spatial properties of a design, such as its size, shape, and position. By understanding these relations, we can make informed decisions about the design and its impact on the surrounding environment.

To understand spatial relations, we must first understand the concept of a spatial database. A spatial database is a database that stores and manages spatial data, such as points, lines, and regions. This data can be represented in two dimensions (2D) or three dimensions (3D), depending on the complexity of the design.

One of the most commonly used spatial databases is the Object-based Spatial Database (OBDB). This database supports both raster and vector representation, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the design. It also allows for the storage and management of different types of data, such as spatial data, attribute data, and temporal data.

Another important concept in understanding spatial relations is the concept of a spatial join. A spatial join is an operation that joins two or more spatial datasets based on their spatial relationships. This operation is crucial in computational design as it allows us to analyze and understand the relationships between different elements in a design.

To perform a spatial join, we must first define the spatial relation between the two datasets. This is done using spatial relation predicates, which are logical criteria that define the relationship between two geometric primitives. These predicates can be of two types: fundamental and non-fundamental.

Fundamental spatial relation predicates are those that are essential to the design process, such as "A is less than 5km from B" or "A is within B". These predicates are commutative, meaning that they can be applied in both directions. Non-fundamental spatial relation predicates, on the other hand, are more specific and may only have meaning in certain situations.

In addition to understanding spatial relations, it is also important to understand the concept of a GeoVector. A GeoVector is a vector representation of a spatial dataset, where each element is represented by a vector. This allows for a more efficient and compact representation of spatial data, making it easier to analyze and manipulate.

To further understand spatial relations, we can also look at external links, such as the VR Warehouses database. This database contains a collection of virtual reality (VR) warehouses that can be used for spatial analysis and design. By exploring these warehouses, we can gain a better understanding of spatial relations and how they can be applied in the design process.

In conclusion, understanding given spatial relations is crucial in computational design. By understanding the concepts of a spatial database, spatial join, and spatial relation predicates, we can effectively analyze and design complex spatial systems. Additionally, exploring external links and databases can provide valuable insights into spatial relations and their applications.

These predicates can be used to define the spatial relations between different elements in a design, such as the relation between a building and its surrounding context.

#### 6.2b Applying Spatial Relations in Design

Once we have a thorough understanding of spatial relations, we can apply them in the design process. By using spatial relations, we can analyze and understand the relationships between different elements in a design, such as the relation between a building and its surrounding context.

One way to apply spatial relations in design is through the use of AutoGrammar. AutoGrammar is a computational design tool that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to generate design solutions based on given spatial relations. By inputting the desired spatial relations, AutoGrammar can generate a design that satisfies those relations.

Another way to apply spatial relations in design is through the use of generative design. Generative design is a design approach that uses algorithms and computational tools to generate multiple design solutions based on given constraints and objectives. By incorporating spatial relations into the design constraints, generative design can generate a range of design solutions that satisfy the desired spatial relations.

In conclusion, understanding given spatial relations is crucial in the design process. By using tools like AutoGrammar and generative design, we can apply spatial relations in design to create innovative and efficient solutions.

# Spatial–temporal reasoning

<technical|date=October 2012>
Spatial–temporal reasoning is an area of artificial intelligence which draws from the fields of computer science, cognitive science, and cognitive psychology. The theoretic goal—on the cognitive side—involves representing and reasoning spatial-temporal knowledge in mind. The applied goal—on the computing side—involves developing high-level control systems of automata for navigating and understanding time and space.

## Influence from cognitive psychology

A convergent result in cognitive psychology is that the connection relation is the first spatial relation that human babies acquire, followed by understanding orientation relations and distance relations. Internal relations among the three kinds of spatial relations can be computationally and systematically explained within the theory of cognitive prism as follows: (1) the connection relation is primitive; (2) an orientation relation is a distance comparison relation: you being in front of me can be interpreted as you are nearer to my front side than my other sides; (3) a distance relation is a connection relation using a third object: you being one meter away from me can be interpreted as a one meter long object connected with you and me simultaneously.

## Fragmentary representations of temporal calculi

Without addressing internal relations among spatial relations, AI researchers contributed many fragmentary representations. Examples of temporal calculi include Allen's interval algebra, and Vilain's & Kautz's point algebra. The most prominent spatial calculi are mereotopological calculi, Frank's cardinal direction calculus, Freksa's double cross calculus, Egenhofer and Franzosa's 4- and 9-intersection calculi, Ligozat's flip-flop calculus, various region connection calculi (RCC), and the Oriented Point Relation Algebra. Recently, spatio-temporal calculi have been designed that combine spatial and temporal information. For example, the spatiotemporal calculus of Allen and Vilain combines Allen's interval algebra with Vilain's point algebra to represent both spatial and temporal information. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships between different elements in a design.

These predicates are used to define the spatial relation between two datasets in a spatial join operation. They can be based on various spatial calculi, such as Allen's interval algebra and Vilain's point algebra.

Allen's interval algebra is a temporal calculus that represents time as a set of intervals. It is commonly used in spatial-temporal reasoning to represent and reason about temporal information. Vilain's point algebra, on the other hand, is a spatial calculus that represents space as a set of points. It is used to represent and reason about spatial information.

Other commonly used spatial calculi include mereotopological calculi, Frank's cardinal direction calculus, Freksa's double cross calculus, Egenhofer and Franzosa's 4- and 9-intersection calculi, Ligozat's flip-flop calculus, and the Oriented Point Relation Algebra. These calculi provide a mathematical framework for representing and reasoning about spatial and temporal information.

#### 6.2c Case Studies in Spatial Relations

To further understand the concept of spatial relations, let's look at some case studies where spatial relations are used in computational design.

One example is the design of a smart home. In this case, spatial relations are used to understand the relationships between different elements in the home, such as rooms, furniture, and appliances. By using spatial relation predicates, we can define the spatial relation between these elements and perform a spatial join to analyze and understand their relationships.

Another example is the design of a city. In this case, spatial relations are used to understand the relationships between different buildings, streets, and public spaces. By using spatial relation predicates, we can define the spatial relation between these elements and perform a spatial join to analyze and understand their relationships.

By studying these case studies, we can gain a better understanding of how spatial relations are used in computational design and how they can be applied in different scenarios.

#### 7.1b Applying Shape Adjustments in AutoGrammar

In the previous section, we discussed the principles behind AutoGrammar and how it can be used for adjustments of shape in housing design. In this section, we will delve deeper into the process of applying shape adjustments in AutoGrammar.

To apply shape adjustments in AutoGrammar, designers must first define the design rules that will be used to generate design variations. These rules can be defined using a variety of methods, including regular expressions, finite state automata, and genetic algorithms.

One popular method for defining design rules is through the use of implicit data structures. These structures allow designers to define complex design rules in a concise and efficient manner. For example, a designer might use an implicit data structure to define a rule that states "the height of a building should be proportional to its width." This rule can then be used to generate design variations where the height and width of the building are adjusted in a systematic manner.

Another approach to defining design rules is through the use of grammar induction. This method involves using algorithms to infer the grammar rules of a language, which can then be used to generate design variations. For example, a designer might use grammar induction to infer the rules of a language that describes the layout of a housing complex. This grammar can then be used to generate design variations where the layout of the complex is adjusted in a systematic manner.

Once the design rules have been defined, designers can use AutoGrammar to apply shape adjustments to their designs. This can be done through the use of trial-and-error, where designers successively guess grammar rules and test them against positive and negative observations. Alternatively, designers can use genetic algorithms, which use evolutionary principles to generate design variations.

In conclusion, AutoGrammar provides a powerful tool for designers to make adjustments to the shape of their designs in a systematic and efficient manner. By defining design rules and using methods such as implicit data structures and grammar induction, designers can generate a vast design space and make adjustments to the form, size, and layout of their designs. This allows for a more efficient and effective design process, leading to better housing solutions for our communities.

#### 10.2c Review and Feedback on Final Design Solution

After presenting the final design solution, it is crucial to review and incorporate feedback from peers and instructors. This process is essential for refining the design and ensuring that it meets the design objectives and criteria.

The review process should start with a self-review. This involves revisiting the design decisions made, the reasoning behind them, and the expected outcomes. It is important to critically evaluate these decisions and outcomes, and to make any necessary revisions. This can be presented in a section titled "Self-Review".

Next, the design should be reviewed by peers. This can be done through a peer review process, where peers are asked to critically evaluate the design and provide feedback. This feedback should be incorporated into the design, and any changes made should be noted in a section titled "Peer Feedback".

Finally, the design should be reviewed by the instructor. This can be done through a one-on-one meeting or through a written review. The instructor's feedback should be carefully considered, and any changes made should be noted in a section titled "Instructor Feedback".

The final design solution should then be revised based on the feedback received. This can be presented in a section titled "Revised Design Solution". The revised design should be presented again, and the review and feedback process should be repeated until the design is finalized.

In conclusion, the review and feedback process is a crucial part of the design process. It allows for the refinement of the design and ensures that the final design solution meets the design objectives and criteria.
