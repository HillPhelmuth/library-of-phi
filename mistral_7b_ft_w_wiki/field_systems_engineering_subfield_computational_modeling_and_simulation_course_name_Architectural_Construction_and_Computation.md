### Subsection 1.1c Traditional vs. Modern Design

Traditional design and modern design are two distinct approaches to architecture that have shaped the built environment in different ways. While traditional design is rooted in history and cultural context, modern design is characterized by innovation and a break from the past. In this section, we will explore the key differences and similarities between these two approaches.

#### Traditional Design

Traditional design is a method of creating buildings and structures that have been used for centuries. It is deeply rooted in cultural and historical context, and is often characterized by a sense of timelessness and functionality. Traditional design principles and elements, such as balance, proportion, unity, emphasis, and scale, are used to create harmonious and aesthetically pleasing structures.

Traditional design values, such as Classicism, Vernacular, Restoration, and Preservation, are also important considerations in this approach. Classicism, for example, is based on the principles of ancient Greek and Roman architecture, and is characterized by symmetry, proportion, and a sense of grandeur. Vernacular design, on the other hand, is inspired by the local building traditions and materials of a particular region or culture. Restoration and Preservation values prioritize the preservation of existing buildings and products for future generations.

#### Modern Design

Modern design, on the other hand, emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a response to the rapid changes brought about by industrialization. It is characterized by a break from traditional design principles and a focus on innovation and functionality. Modern design values, such as Minimalism, Deconstructivism, and Sustainability, have shaped the built environment in significant ways.

Minimalism, for example, is a design approach that prioritizes simplicity and functionality over ornamentation and decoration. Deconstructivism, on the other hand, challenges traditional notions of form and function, and often results in complex and abstract designs. Sustainability is a modern design value that prioritizes the use of environmentally friendly materials and techniques to reduce the impact of buildings on the planet.

#### Comparison and Contrast

While traditional and modern design have distinct differences, they also share some common principles and values. Both approaches prioritize functionality and aesthetics, and both value the preservation of existing buildings and products. However, traditional design is rooted in history and cultural context, while modern design is characterized by innovation and a break from the past.

In the next section, we will explore how these two approaches have been integrated and adapted in the field of architectural computation.




### Subsection 1.2a Conceptualization

Conceptualization is a crucial step in the design process, as it sets the foundation for the entire project. It involves the formation of a clear and comprehensive understanding of the project's goals, objectives, and constraints. This understanding is then translated into a set of design principles and values that guide the creation of the final product.

#### Conceptualization in Traditional Design

In traditional design, conceptualization is often guided by the principles and values of the particular design approach being used. For example, in Classicism, the conceptualization process may involve a deep study of ancient Greek and Roman architecture, as well as an understanding of the principles of symmetry, proportion, and grandeur. This understanding is then used to create a design that embodies these principles and values.

In Vernacular design, the conceptualization process may involve a study of the local building traditions and materials. This understanding is then used to create a design that is in harmony with the local context and culture.

In Restoration and Preservation, the conceptualization process may involve a study of the existing building or product to be preserved. This understanding is then used to create a design that respects and enhances the existing features while addressing any necessary modifications or repairs.

#### Conceptualization in Modern Design

In modern design, the conceptualization process may be guided by the principles and values of the particular design approach being used. For example, in Minimalism, the conceptualization process may involve a deep study of the principles of simplicity and functionality. This understanding is then used to create a design that is minimalist and functional.

In Deconstructivism, the conceptualization process may involve a study of the principles of deconstruction and reconstruction. This understanding is then used to create a design that deconstructs and reconstructs existing architectural forms and principles.

In Sustainability, the conceptualization process may involve a study of the principles of sustainability and environmental responsibility. This understanding is then used to create a design that is sustainable and environmentally responsible.

In conclusion, conceptualization is a crucial step in the design process, as it sets the foundation for the entire project. It involves the formation of a clear and comprehensive understanding of the project's goals, objectives, and constraints, which is then translated into a set of design principles and values.




### Subsection 1.2b Design Development

Design development is the process of refining and elaborating on the design concepts generated during the conceptualization phase. It involves the application of design principles and processes to create a detailed and comprehensive design solution.

#### Design Development in Traditional Design

In traditional design, design development is often a manual process that involves the use of hand-drawn sketches and physical models. These tools allow designers to explore and refine their design ideas in a tangible and tactile manner. For example, in Classicism, designers may create sketches and models to explore different variations of symmetry and proportion in their designs.

In Vernacular design, designers may create sketches and models to explore how different building materials and forms can be used to create a design that is in harmony with the local context and culture.

In Restoration and Preservation, designers may create sketches and models to explore how the existing features of a building or product can be preserved and enhanced while addressing any necessary modifications or repairs.

#### Design Development in Modern Design

In modern design, design development is often a digital process that involves the use of computer-aided design (CAD) software. These tools allow designers to create, manipulate, and analyze their design ideas in a virtual environment. For example, in Minimalism, designers may use CAD software to create detailed 3D models of their designs, allowing them to explore different variations and make precise adjustments to their designs.

In Deconstructivism, designers may use CAD software to deconstruct and reconstruct their designs, exploring the principles of deconstruction and reconstruction in a digital manner.

In both traditional and modern design, design development is a iterative process that involves continuous refinement and elaboration of the design ideas. This process is guided by the design principles and processes that are specific to the design approach being used.

### Subsection 1.2c Final Design

The final design phase is the culmination of the design process, where all the design concepts and ideas are translated into a comprehensive and detailed design solution. This phase is crucial as it sets the stage for the actual construction or implementation of the design.

#### Final Design in Traditional Design

In traditional design, the final design phase often involves the creation of detailed drawings and specifications. These documents serve as a blueprint for the construction team, detailing the exact dimensions, materials, and construction methods to be used. For example, in Classicism, the final design may include detailed drawings of the building's facade, showing the exact proportions and placement of the columns, windows, and other elements.

In Vernacular design, the final design may include detailed drawings of the building's form and layout, showing how the different building materials and forms are integrated to create a design that is in harmony with the local context and culture.

In Restoration and Preservation, the final design may include detailed drawings and specifications for the preservation and enhancement of the existing features of a building or product.

#### Final Design in Modern Design

In modern design, the final design phase often involves the creation of digital models and simulations. These models and simulations allow for a more detailed and accurate representation of the design, and can be used to test and optimize the design before construction. For example, in Minimalism, the final design may include a 3D model of the building, allowing for a detailed analysis of the building's form and function.

In Deconstructivism, the final design may include a digital model of the building, showing how the different elements of the building are deconstructed and reconstructed to create a design that challenges traditional notions of form and function.

In both traditional and modern design, the final design phase is a critical step in the design process, ensuring that the design is comprehensive, detailed, and feasible for construction.
