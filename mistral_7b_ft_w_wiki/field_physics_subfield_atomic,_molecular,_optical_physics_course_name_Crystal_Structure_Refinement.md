### 1.1: Basics of Crystal Structure Refinement:

Crystal structure refinement is a powerful technique used to determine the atomic and molecular structure of crystalline materials. It is an essential tool in the field of materials science, as it allows us to understand the arrangement of atoms and molecules within a crystal, which is crucial for predicting and controlling the properties of materials.

In this section, we will cover the basics of crystal structure refinement, including the concept of crystal structure, the different types of crystal structures, and the principles behind crystal structure refinement.

#### 1.1a: Crystal Structure

A crystal is a solid material with a regular, repeating arrangement of atoms or molecules. This arrangement is known as the crystal structure, and it is what gives crystals their unique properties. The crystal structure is determined by the type of atoms or molecules present in the crystal, as well as the interactions between them.

There are several types of crystal structures, including simple cubic, body-centered cubic, and face-centered cubic. Each of these structures has a unique arrangement of atoms or molecules, which results in different physical properties.

The principles behind crystal structure refinement involve using experimental data, such as X-ray diffraction patterns, to determine the crystal structure. This is done by comparing the experimental data to theoretical calculations based on the known crystal structure. Any discrepancies between the two sets of data can then be used to refine the crystal structure, resulting in a more accurate understanding of the crystal's atomic and molecular arrangement.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the different methods and techniques used in crystal structure refinement, including X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, and electron diffraction. We will also discuss the importance of data collection and processing in crystal structure refinement, as well as the role of computer software in the refinement process.

### Subsection 1.1a: Crystallography Basics

Crystallography is the study of the structure and properties of crystals. It is a fundamental field in materials science, as it allows us to understand the atomic and molecular arrangement within a crystal, which is crucial for predicting and controlling the properties of materials.

#### Miller Indices

In crystallography, vectors and planes are described using the Miller index notation. This notation uses the indices "h", "k", and "ℓ" as directional parameters. By definition, the syntax ("hkℓ") denotes a plane that intercepts the three points "a"<sub>1</sub>/"h", "a"<sub>2</sub>/"k", and "a"<sub>3</sub>/"ℓ", or some multiple thereof. This means that the Miller indices are proportional to the inverses of the intercepts of the plane with the unit cell. If one or more of the indices is zero, it means that the planes do not intersect that axis. A plane containing a coordinate axis is translated so that it no longer contains that axis before its Miller indices are determined.

#### Unit Cell

The unit cell is the smallest repeating unit that has the full symmetry of the crystal structure. It is defined as a parallelepiped, providing six lattice parameters taken as the lengths of the cell edges ("a", "b", "c") and the angles between them (α, β, γ). The positions of particles inside the unit cell are described by the fractional coordinates ("x<sub>i</sub>", "y<sub>i</sub>", "z<sub>i</sub>") along the cell edges, measured from a reference point. It is only necessary to report the coordinates of a smallest asymmetric subset of particles, called the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The asymmetric unit may be chosen so that it occupies the smallest physical space, which means that not all particles need to be physically located inside the boundaries given by the lattice parameters. All other particles of the unit cell are generated by the symmetry operations that characterize the symmetry of the unit cell. The collection of symmetry operations of the unit cell is expressed formally as the space group of the crystal structure.

#### Space Group

The space group of a crystal structure is a mathematical group that describes the symmetry operations of the unit cell. It is a collection of symmetry operations that characterize the symmetry of the unit cell. The space group is crucial in crystallography, as it allows us to determine the symmetry of a crystal structure and predict the positions of particles within the unit cell. The space group is also used in crystal structure refinement, as it helps to determine the most accurate crystal structure based on experimental data.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of crystal structures and their unique properties.

### Subsection 1.1b: Diffraction Theory

Diffraction theory is a fundamental concept in crystallography that explains how a crystal structure can be determined from the diffraction pattern produced when a beam of electromagnetic radiation, such as X-rays or light, is passed through a crystal. This theory is based on the principles of wave-particle duality and the Bragg's law.

#### Wave-Particle Duality

The wave-particle duality is a concept in quantum mechanics that describes how every particle or quantum entity can be described as both a particle and a wave. This concept is crucial in diffraction theory as it explains how particles, such as electrons, can exhibit wave-like properties, leading to the phenomenon of diffraction.

#### Bragg's Law

Bragg's law, named after the British physicist William Henry Bragg, is a fundamental principle in crystallography that describes the conditions for constructive interference in a crystal. It states that when a wave is scattered by a crystal lattice, the scattered waves will interfere constructively if the path difference between the waves is equal to an integer multiple of the wavelength. Mathematically, Bragg's law can be expressed as:

$$
n\lambda = 2d\sin\theta
$$

where $n$ is the order of the diffraction, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the incident wave, $d$ is the spacing between crystal planes, and $\theta$ is the angle of diffraction.

#### Fraunhofer Diffraction Equation

The Fraunhofer diffraction equation is a mathematical expression that describes the diffraction pattern produced by a crystal. It is derived from the Huygens-Fresnel principle, which states that every point on a wavefront can be considered as a source of secondary spherical wavelets. The Fraunhofer diffraction equation is given by:

$$
U(\theta) = a \left [e^{\frac { i\pi S \sin \theta }{\lambda}} + e^{- \frac { i \pi S \sin \theta} {\lambda}} \right] \int_ {-W/2}^{W/2} e^{ {-2 \pi ix' \sin \theta} / \lambda} \, dx'
$$

where $U(\theta)$ is the amplitude of the diffracted wave, $a$ is the amplitude of the incident wave, $S$ is the spacing between the slits, $W$ is the width of the slits, and $x'$ is the coordinate along the width of the slits.

#### Solution by Integration and Fourier Transform

The diffracted pattern can be solved by integration or using Fourier transform. The solution by integration is given by:

$$
U(\theta) = 2a \cos {\frac { \pi S \sin \theta } \lambda} W \operatorname{sinc} \frac { \pi W \sin \theta} \lambda
$$

The Fourier transform of the aperture function is given by:

$$
\hat f(\operatorname{rect}(ax)) = \frac 1 \cdot \operatorname{sinc}\left(\frac{\xi}{2a}\right)
$$

where $\xi$ is the Fourier transform frequency. The Fourier transform of the aperture function can be used to solve the diffracted pattern as:

$$
U(x,z) = \hat {f} \left [a \left[\operatorname {rect} \left (\frac{x-S/2}{W} \right) + \operatorname {rect} \left (\frac{x+S/2}{W} \right) \right ] \right ] = 2W \left[ e^{- i \pi Sx/\lambda z}+e^{ i \pi Sx/\lambda z} \right] \frac {\sin { \frac {\pi Wx} {\lambda z}}}{ \frac {\pi Wx} {\lambda z}}
$$

The intensity of the diffracted pattern is given by:

$$
I(\theta) \propto \cos^2 \left [ \frac {\pi S \sin \theta} \lambda \right] \operatorname{sinc}^2 \left [ \frac {\pi W \sin \theta}\lambda \right]
$$

It can be seen that the form of the intensity pattern is the product of the individual slit diffraction pattern, and the interference pattern which would be obtained with slits of infinite width.




### Subsection 1.1c: Diffraction Pattern Analysis

The analysis of the diffraction pattern is a crucial step in crystal structure refinement. It involves the interpretation of the diffraction pattern to determine the crystal structure. This process is guided by the principles of diffraction theory and the properties of the crystal.

#### Interpretation of the Diffraction Pattern

The diffraction pattern is a set of spots or rings on a detector, which correspond to the different directions in which the crystal lattice is periodic. The positions of these spots or rings are determined by the Bragg's law, which states that the path difference between the waves scattered by the crystal lattice must be equal to an integer multiple of the wavelength.

The interpretation of the diffraction pattern involves identifying the crystal planes that are responsible for the observed diffraction pattern. This is done by comparing the observed positions of the diffraction spots with the predicted positions based on the known crystal structure. If the observed and predicted positions match, then the crystal structure is confirmed. If they do not match, then the crystal structure is refined by adjusting the crystal parameters, such as the crystal lattice constant and the crystal orientation.

#### Crystal Structure Refinement

Crystal structure refinement is a process of iteratively adjusting the crystal parameters to improve the agreement between the observed and predicted diffraction patterns. This process is guided by the principles of least squares, which states that the best fit is achieved when the sum of the squares of the residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted diffraction patterns) is minimized.

The crystal parameters are adjusted by the method of least squares, which involves minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals. This is done by iteratively adjusting the crystal parameters and recalculating the residuals until the sum of the squares of the residuals is minimized.

The crystal structure refinement process is a powerful tool for determining the crystal structure of a crystal. It allows for the accurate determination of the crystal structure even when the crystal is imperfect or when the crystal structure is complex. However, it requires a good understanding of the principles of diffraction theory and the properties of the crystal.
