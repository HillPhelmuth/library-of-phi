## Foreward

Welcome to "Quantum Physics III: Advanced Topics in Quantum Mechanics". This book is a continuation of our exploration into the fascinating world of quantum physics, building upon the foundational concepts and methods introduced in the previous two volumes.

In this volume, we delve deeper into the advanced topics of quantum mechanics, expanding our understanding of the quantum world beyond the basic principles. We will explore the intricacies of quantum entanglement, quantum computing, and the quantum nature of space and time. These topics are not only of theoretical interest, but also have practical implications in fields such as cryptography, information theory, and quantum teleportation.

As we embark on this journey, it is important to remember the words of physicist Leslie E. Ballentine, who praised the previous volume for its clear and concise presentation of quantum foundations and ongoing research. We aim to maintain this standard in this volume, providing a comprehensive and accessible exploration of advanced quantum topics.

We also draw inspiration from the work of physicist Asher Peres, whose book on quantum foundations was described by Michael Nielsen as a "revelation" and by Nielsen and Isaac Chuang as "superb". Peres' work has been instrumental in shaping our understanding of quantum mechanics, and we are honored to follow in his footsteps.

As we delve into the advanced topics of quantum mechanics, we will continue to draw upon the work of leading physicists such as John C. Baez, Jochen Rau, and N. David Mermin. Their contributions have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of quantum mechanics, and we are grateful for their insights and contributions.

In this book, we will strive to bridge the "textual gap" between conceptually-oriented books and more practical books, as described by Mermin. We aim to provide a comprehensive and accessible exploration of advanced quantum topics, while also maintaining a deep understanding of the underlying principles.

We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for advanced undergraduate students at MIT, as well as for anyone else interested in the fascinating world of quantum physics. We invite you to join us on this journey, as we explore the advanced topics of quantum mechanics and continue to unravel the mysteries of the quantum world.

Thank you for choosing to embark on this journey with us. Let's dive into the world of quantum physics and discover the wonders that lie beyond the basic principles.

## Chapter 1: Quantum Entanglement

### Introduction

Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon that has fascinated physicists for over a century. It is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, and it has been the subject of numerous studies and experiments. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the intricacies of quantum entanglement, exploring its properties, implications, and applications.

Quantum entanglement is a state of two or more particles where the state of one particle cannot be described without considering the state of the other particles, even if they are separated by large distances. This phenomenon was first described by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen in their famous EPR paradox paper in 1935. They argued that this phenomenon violated the principle of locality, which states that the state of a particle should only depend on its own properties and not on the properties of other particles.

Since then, numerous experiments have been conducted to test the existence of quantum entanglement. These experiments have confirmed the predictions of quantum mechanics and have shown that quantum entanglement is a real phenomenon. This has led to the development of technologies such as quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation, which rely on the properties of quantum entanglement.

In this chapter, we will explore the mathematical formalism of quantum entanglement, including the concept of entanglement entropy and the Bell inequality. We will also discuss the role of quantum entanglement in quantum computing and quantum information theory. Finally, we will touch upon the philosophical implications of quantum entanglement and its challenge to our understanding of causality and locality.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of quantum entanglement, from its fundamental principles to its practical applications. We will use the popular Markdown format to present the material, making it accessible to both students and researchers in the field. We hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about quantum entanglement and its role in quantum mechanics.

## Chapter 1: Perturbation Theory:

### Introduction

Welcome to the first chapter of "Quantum Physics III: Advanced Topics in Quantum Mechanics". In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of perturbation theory, a powerful mathematical tool used in quantum mechanics to study systems that are influenced by small perturbations.

Perturbation theory is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, and it is used to study systems that are influenced by small perturbations. These perturbations can be external forces, interactions with other systems, or changes in the system's parameters. The goal of perturbation theory is to find the effects of these perturbations on the system's behavior, often by approximating the system's behavior near the unperturbed state.

In this chapter, we will explore the mathematical foundations of perturbation theory, including the perturbation expansion and the perturbative solutions of the Schrödinger equation. We will also discuss the applications of perturbation theory in various areas of quantum physics, such as quantum computing, quantum information theory, and quantum control.

We will begin by introducing the basic concepts of perturbation theory, including the perturbation Hamiltonian and the perturbation expansion. We will then move on to discuss the perturbative solutions of the Schrödinger equation, which are solutions that are valid near the unperturbed state. We will also explore the concept of perturbative stability, which is a crucial aspect of perturbation theory.

Finally, we will discuss the applications of perturbation theory in various areas of quantum physics. We will see how perturbation theory is used to study the effects of external forces on quantum systems, how it is used to understand the behavior of quantum systems near critical points, and how it is used to design and analyze quantum control schemes.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of perturbation theory and its applications in quantum physics. You will be equipped with the mathematical tools and concepts needed to study and analyze quantum systems that are influenced by small perturbations. So, let's dive into the fascinating world of perturbation theory and explore its advanced applications in quantum mechanics.




### Subsection 1.1a Introduction to Perturbation Theory

Perturbation theory is a powerful mathematical tool used in quantum mechanics to study systems that are influenced by small perturbations. These perturbations can be external forces, interactions with other systems, or changes in the system's parameters. The goal of perturbation theory is to find the effects of these perturbations on the system's behavior, often by approximating the system's behavior near the unperturbed state.

In this section, we will introduce the basic concepts of perturbation theory, including the perturbation Hamiltonian and the perturbation expansion. We will also discuss the perturbative solutions of the Schrödinger equation, which are solutions that are valid near the unperturbed state.

#### The Perturbation Hamiltonian

The perturbation Hamiltonian, denoted as $\hat{H}_I$, is the part of the total Hamiltonian that represents the perturbation. It is often much smaller than the unperturbed Hamiltonian, $\hat{H}_0$, and its effects on the system's behavior are typically small. The perturbation Hamiltonian can be written as:

$$
\hat{H}_I = \lambda \hat{V}
$$

where $\lambda$ is a small parameter that controls the strength of the perturbation, and $\hat{V}$ is the perturbation operator. The perturbation operator is a function of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, $\hat{H}_0$, and it describes how the system's behavior changes due to the perturbation.

#### The Perturbation Expansion

The perturbation expansion is a series expansion of the system's behavior in terms of the perturbation parameter, $\lambda$. This expansion is valid when the perturbation is small, and it allows us to approximate the system's behavior near the unperturbed state. The perturbation expansion is given by:

$$
\Psi(\lambda) = \Psi_0 + \lambda \Psi_1 + \lambda^2 \Psi_2 + \cdots
$$

where $\Psi_n$ are the perturbative solutions of the Schrödinger equation. These solutions are valid near the unperturbed state, and they provide a way to approximate the system's behavior when the perturbation is small.

#### Perturbative Solutions of the Schrödinger Equation

The perturbative solutions of the Schrödinger equation are solutions that are valid near the unperturbed state. These solutions are typically found by iterating the perturbation expansion, and they provide a way to approximate the system's behavior when the perturbation is small.

The first-order perturbative solution, $\Psi_1$, is given by:

$$
\Psi_1 = \frac{1}{\hat{H}_0 - E_0} \hat{H}_I \Psi_0
$$

where $E_0$ is the unperturbed energy eigenvalue, and $\Psi_0$ is the unperturbed wave function. This solution describes the first-order correction to the unperturbed wave function due to the perturbation.

The second-order perturbative solution, $\Psi_2$, is given by:

$$
\Psi_2 = \frac{1}{\hat{H}_0 - E_0} \hat{H}_I \Psi_1
$$

This solution describes the second-order correction to the unperturbed wave function due to the perturbation.

#### Perturbative Stability

Perturbative stability is a crucial aspect of perturbation theory. It refers to the condition under which the perturbation expansion is valid. In general, the perturbation expansion is valid when the perturbation is small, and the system's behavior near the unperturbed state is smooth. If the perturbation is large, or the system's behavior near the unperturbed state is not smooth, the perturbation expansion may not be valid, and other methods may be needed to study the system's behavior.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of perturbation theory in various areas of quantum physics, including quantum computing, quantum information theory, and quantum control. We will see how perturbation theory is used to study the effects of external forces on quantum systems, how it is used to understand the behavior of quantum systems near critical points, and how it is used to design and analyze quantum control schemes.
