# Hybrid masonry

### Type III

Similar to Type II hybrid masonry, Type III hybrid masonry has the vertical confinement. In addition to the vertical contact with the beam, contact with the columns is also used for horizontal confinement. Shear studs are welded on the insides of the columns to transfer vertical forces that are the result of axial load in the columns as well as shear in the wall. The wall system resembles infill masonry in terms of confinement in the steel, yet differs in that it is grouted and reinforced, allowing for a more ductile response.

## Research

Prof. Ian Robertson at the University of Hawaiʻi -Mānoa(UHM) has developed and tested the steel plate connections between the masonry. The result was a design method of a fuse plate that yields along its entire length, with the aim of creating a ductile energy dissipating fuse. Bolt pullout tests were also performed at UHM to validate the strength of the masonry with through bolts. A research team at Rice University develops computational models for the study of hybrid masonry structural systems. Profs. Larry A. Fahnestock and Daniel P. Abrams are performing full scale experimental tests on hybrid masonry at the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation(NEES) site at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign # Cellular model

## Masonry

Masonry has been used in structures for thousands of years, and can take the form of stone, brick or blockwork. Masonry is very strong in compression but cannot carry tension (because the mortar between bricks or blocks is unable to carry tension). Because it cannot carry structural tension, it also cannot carry bending, so masonry walls become unstable at relatively small heights. High masonry structures require stabilisation against lateral loads from buttresses (as with the flying buttresses seen in many European medieval churches) or from windposts.

Historically masonry was constructed using a variety of techniques, including rubble masonry, ashlar masonry, and coursed rubble masonry. Each of these techniques has its own unique characteristics and properties, which can greatly impact the structural behavior of a historic structure.

In the previous section, we discussed the analysis of advanced masonry structures, including load-bearing capacity, structural failure, and repair and restoration techniques. In this section, we will continue our exploration of advanced masonry structures, focusing on the analysis of masonry structures in the context of historic structures.

Historic structures are buildings or other structures that have been designated as historically significant due to their architectural, cultural, or social importance. These structures are often made of masonry and are subject to unique challenges in terms of structural analysis and preservation.

One of the key considerations in analyzing historic masonry structures is understanding the original construction techniques and materials used. As mentioned earlier, masonry can take various forms, and each form has its own unique properties and behavior. For example, rubble masonry, which is made of irregularly shaped stones held together with mortar, is more prone to structural failure than ashlar masonry, which is made of uniformly shaped stones.

Another important factor to consider is the impact of time and the environment on the structure. Historic structures are often exposed to harsh weather conditions and may have been subjected to repairs and alterations over the years. These factors can affect the structural integrity and stability of the structure, making it crucial to consider them in the analysis process.

In addition to these factors, the analysis of historic masonry structures also involves understanding the structural behavior of the structure under different loading conditions. This includes understanding the load-bearing capacity of the structure, as well as the potential for structural failure.

To accurately analyze historic masonry structures, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of the structure's construction techniques and materials, as well as the impact of time and the environment. This knowledge can then be used to develop appropriate preservation and restoration techniques to ensure the structural stability and integrity of these historic structures.

#### 5.1c Timber Structures in Modern Architecture

Christopher Alexander, a renowned architect and urban planner, has been a pioneer in the use of timber structures in modern architecture. His book "A Pattern Language" presents a set of patterns for creating livable buildings and communities. These patterns are based on the principles of biophilia, which is the human tendency to connect with nature and natural processes.

One of the key principles of biophilia is the use of natural materials, such as timber, in architecture. Timber structures are not only aesthetically pleasing, but they also have a number of practical advantages. They are strong, durable, and resistant to environmental conditions, making them ideal for use in modern architecture.

In his book, Alexander presents a pattern for creating a "timber structure" that is based on the principles of biophilia. This pattern involves using timber as the primary material for the structure, and incorporating natural elements such as light and ventilation. The result is a structure that is not only functional, but also harmonious with the natural environment.

Alexander's work has been influential in the field of modern architecture, and his use of timber structures has been adopted by many architects. The use of timber structures in modern architecture is not limited to residential buildings, but also extends to commercial and public buildings.

One notable example is the work of architect Michael Batty, who has been a key figure in the development of urban design and planning. Batty's work has been heavily influenced by Alexander's principles, and he has incorporated timber structures into many of his projects.

In conclusion, timber structures continue to play a significant role in modern architecture. Their use is not only a reflection of the principles of biophilia, but also a testament to their practicality and aesthetic appeal. As we continue to explore the principles of biophilia in architecture, the use of timber structures will undoubtedly remain a key element in creating livable and sustainable buildings and communities.

### Section 9.1 Advanced Concrete Structures:

In this section, we will explore advanced topics related to concrete structures, including structural behavior under different loading conditions, durability, and repair and rehabilitation techniques.

#### 9.1a Concrete Structures I

Concrete is a widely used material in construction due to its strength, durability, and versatility. However, it is not immune to deterioration and failure, especially under extreme loading conditions. Therefore, understanding the behavior of concrete structures under different loading conditions is crucial for their safe and efficient use.

One of the key factors that affect the structural behavior of concrete is the type of loading it experiences. Concrete structures are typically designed to withstand three types of loading: axial, bending, and shear. Each type of loading has a different effect on the structural behavior of concrete, and it is important for engineers to consider these effects when designing and analyzing concrete structures.

Axial loading, also known as compression or tension, occurs when a structure is subjected to a uniform load in the direction of its length. This type of loading is typically caused by the weight of the structure itself, as well as any additional loads placed on top of it. Under axial loading, concrete experiences compressive or tensile stress, depending on whether the load is pushing or pulling on the structure.

Bending loading occurs when a structure is subjected to a varying load along its length. This type of loading is typically caused by external forces, such as wind or seismic forces, acting on the structure. Under bending loading, concrete experiences both compressive and tensile stress, depending on the location and direction of the load.

Shear loading occurs when a structure is subjected to a load that is parallel to its length. This type of loading is typically caused by external forces, such as lateral loads or earthquakes, acting on the structure. Under shear loading, concrete experiences shear stress, which can cause cracks and failure if the load exceeds the strength of the concrete.

In addition to understanding the behavior of concrete under different types of loading, engineers must also consider the durability of concrete structures. Durability refers to the ability of a structure to resist deterioration over time. Concrete structures are susceptible to various forms of deterioration, such as corrosion, cracking, and spalling, which can compromise their structural integrity.

To ensure the durability of concrete structures, engineers must carefully consider the materials and construction techniques used. This includes selecting appropriate concrete mixes, reinforcing bars, and placement techniques. Additionally, regular maintenance and inspection are crucial for identifying and addressing any potential issues before they become major problems.

In cases where concrete structures have already experienced damage or deterioration, repair and rehabilitation techniques can be used to restore their structural integrity. These techniques may include patching, strengthening, or replacement of damaged areas, as well as the use of protective coatings or corrosion inhibitors.

In conclusion, understanding the behavior of concrete structures under different types of loading, as well as their durability and repair and rehabilitation techniques, is crucial for engineers in designing and analyzing concrete structures. By considering these advanced topics, engineers can ensure the safe and efficient use of concrete structures in various applications.

### Subsection: 12.1b Historical Context of Stone Structures

The use of stone in construction has been a fundamental aspect of human civilization for thousands of years. From the ancient temples of Egypt to the grand cathedrals of Europe, stone has been a symbol of strength, durability, and beauty. In this section, we will explore the historical context of stone structures, focusing on the Medieval period.

#### Medieval Fortifications

The Medieval period, spanning from the 5th to the 15th century, was a time of significant technological advancements in fortification design. The string of Welsh castles Edward I of England had built are a prime example of these advancements. These castles were constructed with a focus on speed, utilizing a combination of paid workers and forced levies of laborers. This allowed for the construction of these massive structures in a matter of a few years, a significant improvement from the decades it could take to build similar structures in the past.

#### Nature as a Defense

During the Medieval period, nature played a crucial role in the defense of castles. The location of these structures was often determined by the natural defenses provided by the surrounding landscape. For instance, castles were often built on larger hills, cliffs, or close to rivers, lakes, or caves, which provided additional protection.

#### Materials and Construction

The materials used in the construction of Medieval castles varied throughout history. Wood was the primary material used until 1066, due to its low cost and ease of construction. However, the flammability of wood led to its eventual replacement by stone. Stone castles, while more expensive and time-consuming to construct, were stronger and provided better protection against enemy attacks.

The cost of constructing these stone structures depended on the material used. Wood was cheap and quick to build, but was weak. Stone, on the other hand, was strong but very expensive and time-consuming to construct. The manpower required for these projects was primarily provided by serfs, who were the primary source of labor during the Medieval era in Europe.

#### Walls and Defenses

The height of the walls in Medieval castles varied widely, but were often thick. They were typically topped with crenellation or parapets, which provided protection to defenders. Some castles also featured machicolations, which were openings between a wall and a parapet, formed by corbelling out the latter. These allowed defenders to throw stones, boiling water, and other projectiles onto assailants below.

In conclusion, the Medieval period was a time of significant advancements in stone construction. The use of stone in fortifications allowed for the creation of strong, durable structures that could withstand enemy attacks. The historical context of these structures provides valuable insights into the technological advancements and societal changes that occurred during this period.

## Colonial

When the Europeans settled in North America, they brought their architectural traditions and construction techniques for building. The oldest buildings in America have examples of that. Construction was dependent on the available resources. Wood and brick are the most common elements of English buildings in New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the coastal South. It had also brought the conquest, destruction, and displacement of the indigenous peoples existing buildings in their homeland, as their dwelling and settlement construction techniques devalued compared to colonial standards. The colonizers appropriated the territories and sites for new forts, dwellings, missions, churches, and agricultural developments.

### Spanish influences

The Spanish colonial architecture in the United States was markedly different from the European styles adopted in other parts of America such as the simple French colonial houses in the Mississippi Valley, which were consisted of adjoining rooms that opened upon a "galerie". The Spanish architecture (particularly evident in ecclesiastical establishments) built in the states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Florida, and Georgia was similar to the design adopted in Mexico. According to scholars, the Spaniards built without any consideration to the cost, believing that their tenure in America would be eternal.

#### Florida

Spanish colonial architecture was built in Florida and the Southeastern United States from 1559 to 1821. The "conch style" is represented in Pensacola, Florida and other areas of Florida, adorning houses with balconies of wrought iron, as appears in the mostly Spanish-built French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana. Fires in 1788 and 1794 destroyed the original French structures in New Orleans. Many of the city's present buildings date to late-18th-century rebuilding efforts.

#### 15.1a Composite Materials and Techniques

Composite materials are a blend of two or more materials with different physical and chemical properties. These materials are combined in a way that they work together to produce a material with characteristics superior to those of the individual components. The matrix material, often a polymer, surrounds and supports the reinforcement materials, maintaining their relative positions. The reinforcements impart their special mechanical and physical properties to enhance the matrix properties. This synergy produces material properties unavailable from the individual constituent materials.

Composite materials are widely used in various fields due to their unique properties. They offer high strength-to-weight ratios, excellent corrosion resistance, and the ability to be tailored for specific applications. In the context of historic structures, composite materials can provide a means to conserve and preserve these structures, while also enhancing their structural integrity and durability.

#### 15.1b Composite Techniques

Composite techniques are the methods used to create composite structures. These techniques involve the careful selection and combination of materials, as well as the application of specific processes to create the desired structure. The choice of materials and techniques depends on the specific requirements of the structure, including its intended use, environmental conditions, and aesthetic considerations.

One of the most common composite techniques is the use of a polymer matrix, such as epoxy or polyester resin, reinforced with fibers. These fibers can be made from a variety of materials, including glass, carbon, or aramid fibers. The fibers are impregnated with the polymer matrix, which holds the fibers in place and transfers the load between them. The resulting composite is lightweight, strong, and durable.

Another common technique is the use of a concrete matrix reinforced with steel bars or fibers. This technique is often used in civil engineering applications, such as bridges and high-rise buildings. The concrete provides compressive strength, while the steel bars or fibers provide tensile strength. This combination of properties makes concrete-steel composites ideal for structures that need to withstand large loads.

### Subsection: 20.1a Structural Retrofitting Techniques

Structural retrofitting is a critical process in preserving and protecting historic structures. It involves the addition of new structural elements or modifications to existing ones to improve the structural integrity and safety of the building. In this section, we will discuss the various techniques used in structural retrofitting.

#### Strengthening

Strengthening is one of the most common techniques used in structural retrofitting. It involves increasing the strength of the existing structure to withstand increased loads or resist failure. This can be achieved through various methods, including:

- Adding new structural elements: This involves adding new structural elements, such as beams or columns, to increase the strength of the structure.
- Reinforcing existing elements: Existing structural elements can be reinforced by adding additional steel or concrete to increase their strength.
- Upgrading materials: The use of stronger materials, such as high-strength steel or reinforced concrete, can significantly increase the strength of the structure.

#### Stiffening

Stiffening is another important technique used in structural retrofitting. It involves increasing the stiffness of the structure to resist deformation under load. This can be achieved through various methods, including:

- Adding bracing: Bracing can be added to existing structural elements to increase their stiffness.
- Reinforcing connections: The connections between structural elements can be reinforced to increase their stiffness.
- Upgrading foundations: Upgrading the foundations of a structure can significantly increase its stiffness.

#### Stabilizing

Stabilizing is a crucial technique used in structural retrofitting. It involves improving the stability of the structure to resist overturning or collapse. This can be achieved through various methods, including:

- Adding new supports: New supports, such as piers or braces, can be added to improve the stability of the structure.
- Reinforcing existing supports: Existing supports can be reinforced to improve their stability.
- Upgrading foundations: Upgrading the foundations of a structure can significantly improve its stability.

Each of these techniques can be used individually or in combination to achieve the desired results. The choice of technique depends on the specific needs and characteristics of the structure, as well as the available resources.

In the next section, we will discuss the challenges and considerations that come with retrofitting historic structures. These include the need to maintain the historical integrity of the building, the potential for unforeseen structural issues, and the need for careful planning and execution.




### Subsection: 20.1b Structural Retrofitting Case Study

In this section, we will examine a case study of structural retrofitting to further illustrate the techniques discussed in the previous section. The case study will focus on the Richmond–San Rafael Bridge, a historic structure located in the San Francisco Bay Area.

#### The Richmond–San Rafael Bridge

The Richmond–San Rafael Bridge, also known as the San Rafael Bridge, is a historic structure that was built in the 1950s. It is a two-tier bridge that spans the San Rafael Canal and connects the cities of Richmond and San Rafael. The bridge is a vital transportation link, carrying over 100,000 vehicles per day.

#### Seismic Retrofitting of the Richmond–San Rafael Bridge

In the fall of 2001, the Richmond–San Rafael Bridge commenced an extensive seismic retrofitting program. The retrofit was designed to allow the bridge to withstand a 7.4 magnitude earthquake on the Hayward Fault and an 8.3 magnitude quake on the San Andreas Fault. The foundation piers were strengthened by wrapping the lower section of structural steel in a concrete casing, installing new shear piles, and adding bracing to the structural steel towers. Isolation joints and bearings were also added to the main bridge structures (cantilever spans over the navigation channels) to strengthen the structure.

#### Challenges and Solutions

The retrofitting of the Richmond–San Rafael Bridge presented several challenges. The bridge was in active use, and the retrofit needed to be completed while minimizing traffic disruptions. Additionally, the bridge was showing its age and needed age-related maintenance, which was performed in conjunction with the seismic upgrade work. There were reports of cars being damaged while traveling on the lower deck by fist-sized concrete chunks falling from the joints of upper deck slabs.

To address these challenges, the retrofit was designed to allow the bridge to remain open to traffic. For economy, schedule efficiency, and traffic impact mitigation, much of the repair work was fabricated off-site and shipped to the bridge by barge. The major work was performed at night, with two lanes of traffic moving in each direction during daylight hours, then reduced to a single lane in each direction at night. This approach allowed for the bridge to remain open to traffic while the retrofit was being completed.

#### Conclusion

The Richmond–San Rafael Bridge case study illustrates the importance of structural retrofitting in preserving historic structures. The retrofit not only improved the structural integrity of the bridge but also addressed age-related maintenance issues. The use of innovative techniques, such as off-site fabrication and nighttime work, allowed for the bridge to remain open to traffic while the retrofit was being completed. This case study serves as a valuable example for future structural retrofitting projects.




### Subsection: 20.1c Structural Retrofitting in Modern Architecture

Structural retrofitting has become an integral part of modern architecture, particularly in the context of historic structures. As our understanding of structural engineering and seismic activity continues to evolve, so too does our approach to retrofitting these structures. In this section, we will explore the principles and applications of structural retrofitting in modern architecture, with a particular focus on the use of OpenStructures.

#### OpenStructures in Structural Retrofitting

OpenStructures is a modular construction model that has been applied to a variety of projects, including structural retrofitting. The OpenStructures grid, a scalable system of squares, provides a framework for designing and constructing new parts, as well as for retrofitting existing structures.

The OpenStructures model encourages collaboration and sharing among designers, manufacturers, and craftsmen. This collaborative approach can be particularly beneficial in the context of structural retrofitting, where multiple perspectives and expertise may be required.

#### The OpenStructures Grid

The OpenStructures grid is built around a square of 4 x 4 cm, which can be further subdivided or put together to form larger squares. This grid serves as a standard for determining dimensions, assembly points, and interconnecting diameters. This allows for compatibility between different parts, whether they are being used in new construction or in retrofitting existing structures.

The scalability of the OpenStructures grid makes it particularly useful in the context of structural retrofitting. For example, in the case of the Richmond–San Rafael Bridge, the grid could be used to determine the dimensions and assembly points for the various components of the retrofit, ensuring compatibility and interconnectivity between the different parts.

#### The OpenStructures Database

In addition to the grid, the OpenStructures project also includes a database where anyone can share designs. This database is a valuable resource for structural retrofitting, as it allows for the dissemination of knowledge and best practices. Each component design in the OS system features previously designed OS parts that were used to create it, as well as component designs that can be made from it. This encourages a circular economy, where materials are reused and repurposed, reducing waste and promoting sustainability.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, structural retrofitting in modern architecture is a complex and multifaceted process. The principles and applications of structural retrofitting, as well as the use of OpenStructures, provide a comprehensive approach to this process. By leveraging the collaborative and scalable nature of OpenStructures, we can ensure the preservation and enhancement of our historic structures for future generations.
