This project aims to explore the urban design landscape of Providence, a city known for its rich history, diverse culture, and vibrant urban spaces. The project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the city's urban design, its evolution, and the various factors that have influenced its current state.

The background research is a crucial step in the urban design process. It provides the necessary context and understanding of the city, its people, and its spaces. This knowledge is then used to inform the design decisions and strategies that will be implemented in the project. 

The research will cover a wide range of topics, including the city's history, demographics, economic conditions, transportation systems, and urban planning policies. It will also explore the city's unique characteristics, such as its walkability, public spaces, and architectural diversity. 

The research will be conducted through various methods, including literature reviews, field observations, and interviews with local experts. The findings will be presented in a clear and concise manner, providing a solid foundation for the subsequent chapters of the book.

This chapter serves as a guide for the readers to understand the research process and its importance in urban design. It will also provide a glimpse into the fascinating world of urban design, where art, science, and social science intersect to create livable, sustainable, and vibrant cities. 

Join us as we embark on this exciting journey of exploring Providence's urban design landscape through the lens of research.

## Chapter 2: Urban Design Concept Development:

### Introduction

Urban design is a multidisciplinary field that combines elements of architecture, landscape architecture, and urban planning to create functional and aesthetically pleasing cities. The process of urban design involves a series of steps, each of which is crucial to the overall success of the project. In this chapter, we will focus on the concept development stage, which is the foundation of any urban design project.

The concept development stage is where urban designers take a step back and analyze the site, its context, and the needs of the community. This stage is crucial as it sets the direction for the entire project. It involves a thorough understanding of the site, its history, and its potential. Urban designers must also consider the needs and desires of the community, as well as any constraints or challenges that may impact the project.

In this chapter, we will explore the various techniques and tools used in concept development, such as site analysis, community engagement, and visioning. We will also discuss the importance of creating a clear and concise concept statement, which serves as a roadmap for the project. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the concept development stage and its significance in the overall urban design process.
