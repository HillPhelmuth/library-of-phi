### Section 1.1 Definition and Principles:

Shape grammars are a powerful tool for generating and manipulating geometric shapes. They are a specific class of production systems that have been widely used in computer graphics, architecture, and urban planning. In this section, we will define shape grammars and discuss their principles and applications.

#### 1.1a Definition of Shape Grammars

A shape grammar is a set of rules that define how a shape can be transformed into another shape. These rules are applied recursively, allowing for the generation of complex shapes from simple ones. The rules are represented as pairs of shapes, with the left shape representing the input and the right shape representing the output. This allows for the creation of a shape language, where each shape represents a word in the language.

Shape grammars were first introduced in a seminal article by George Stiny and James Gips in 1971. They were further developed in the book "Pictorial and Formal Aspects of Shapes and Shape Grammars" by George Stiny in 1975. This book also contains two independent, though equivalent, constructions showing that shape grammars can simulate Turing machines. This demonstrates the power and versatility of shape grammars.

#### 1.1b Principles of Shape Grammars

Shape grammars are based on the principles of recursion and transformation. Recursion allows for the generation of complex shapes from simple ones, while transformation allows for the manipulation of shapes. These principles are essential for the creation of shape languages and the generation of complex shapes.

Shape grammars also allow for the use of shape variables, which can represent any shape in the language. This allows for the creation of more complex and flexible shape languages. Additionally, shape grammars can be used to define shape rules, which are specific sets of rules that can be applied to a shape. This allows for the creation of more specific and targeted shape languages.

#### 1.1c Applications of Shape Grammars

Shape grammars have a wide range of applications in various fields. In computer graphics, they are used for generating and manipulating 2D and 3D shapes. In architecture and urban planning, they are used for creating complex and intricate designs. They are also used in the field of robotics for generating and manipulating robot movements.

Furthermore, shape grammars have been applied in the field of artificial intelligence for generating and manipulating artificial creatures. This allows for the creation of more realistic and natural-looking movements in virtual environments.

In conclusion, shape grammars are a powerful tool for generating and manipulating geometric shapes. They are based on the principles of recursion and transformation and have a wide range of applications in various fields. In the next section, we will explore the different types of shape grammars and their properties.

Shape grammars in computation are a specific class of production systems that generate geometric shapes. Typically, shapes are 2- or 3-dimensional, thus shape grammars are a way to study 2- and 3-dimensional languages. Shape grammars were first introduced in a seminal article by George Stiny and James Gips in 1971. The mathematical and algorithmic foundations of shape grammars (in particular, for linear elements in two-dimensions) were developed in "Pictorial and Formal Aspects of Shapes and Shape Grammars" (Birkhäuser Basel, 1975) by George Stiny. Applications of shape grammars were first considered in "Shape Grammars and their Uses" (Birkhäuser Basel, 1975) by James Gips. These publications also contain two independent, though equivalent, constructions showing that shape grammars can simulate Turing machines.

## Definition

A shape grammar consists of "shape rules" and a "generation engine" that selects and processes rules. A shape rule defines how an existing (part of a) shape can be transformed. A shape rule consists of two parts separated by an arrow pointing from left to right. The part left of the arrow is termed the "Left-Hand Side" (LHS). It depicts a condition in terms of a shape and a marker. The part right of the arrow is termed the "Right-Hand Side" (RHS). It depicts how the LHS shape should be transformed and where the marker is positioned. The marker helps to locate and orient the new shape.

A shape grammar minimally consists of three shape rules: a "start rule", at least one transformation rule, and a "termination rule". The start rule is necessary to start the shape generation process. The termination rule is necessary to make the shape generation process stop. The simplest way to stop the process is by a shape rule that removes the marker. Shape grammars differ from Chomsky grammars in a major respect: the production of shapes is not limited to a single shape, but can generate an infinite number of shapes. This is due to the recursive nature of shape grammars, where a shape can be transformed into another shape, which can then be transformed again, and so on. This allows for the creation of complex and varied shapes.

### Subsection: 1.2a Introduction to Notation

Shape grammars are a powerful tool for generating and manipulating shapes. They are defined using a set of shape rules, which are mathematical expressions that describe how to transform a shape. These rules are applied recursively to generate more complex shapes.

#### Shape Rules

Shape rules are the heart of shape grammars. They are mathematical expressions that describe how to transform a shape. These transformations can include translation, rotation, scaling, and other geometric operations. 

For example, a simple shape rule might be `$A \rightarrow B + C$`, which means that shape `A` can be transformed into shape `B` plus shape `C`. This rule can be applied recursively to generate more complex shapes.

#### Generation Engine

The generation engine is the algorithm that applies the shape rules to generate shapes. It starts with an initial shape and applies the shape rules recursively until it reaches a stopping point. The resulting shape is then output.

The generation engine can be deterministic or non-deterministic. In a deterministic generation engine, the same shape is always generated for a given set of shape rules and initial shape. In a non-deterministic generation engine, different shapes may be generated for the same set of shape rules and initial shape.

#### Notation

Shape grammars use a notation to represent shapes and shape rules. This notation includes symbols for shapes, operators for transformations, and quantifiers for repetition.

For example, the shape `$A$` might be represented as `$A$`, and the transformation `$A \rightarrow B + C$` might be represented as `$A \rightarrow B + C$`. The quantifier `$*$` can be used to indicate repetition, so `$A*$` would represent any number of shape `A`s.

#### Examples

Here are some examples of shape rules and their applications:

- `$A \rightarrow B + C$`: This rule can be applied recursively to generate more complex shapes. For example, starting with shape `A`, we can generate `B + C + A`, then `B + C + A + B + C`, and so on.

- `$A \rightarrow B \cdot C$`: This rule can be used to generate shapes that are composed of multiple copies of shape `B` and shape `C`. For example, starting with shape `A`, we can generate `B \cdot C \cdot A`, then `B \cdot C \cdot A \cdot B \cdot C`, and so on.

- `$A \rightarrow B \setminus C$`: This rule can be used to generate shapes that are composed of shape `B` minus shape `C`. For example, starting with shape `A`, we can generate `B \setminus C \setminus A`, then `B \setminus C \setminus A \setminus B \setminus C`, and so on.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical foundations of shape grammars, exploring the properties of 2- and 3-dimensional languages, and the role of shape grammars in computer science.




### Subsection: 1.2b Common Notation Systems

In addition to the basic shape grammar notation, there are several common systems of notation that are used in shape grammars. These systems provide a standardized way of representing shapes and shape rules, making it easier to communicate and share shape grammars.

#### ISO 31-0

ISO 31-0 is a standardized system of mathematical signs and symbols. It includes symbols for shapes, operators, and quantifiers, among other things. This system is widely used in shape grammars and other areas of mathematics.

For example, the symbol `$\setminus$` is used to represent the set difference operation, and the symbol `$\cup$` is used to represent the union of sets. These symbols can be used in shape rules to describe how shapes are transformed.

#### Plinian Core

Plinian Core is a system of notation for shape grammars that is based on the ISO 31-0 standard. It includes a set of predefined elements for representing shapes and shape rules, making it easier to write and read shape grammars.

For example, the element `<anchor|Technical notes>` can be used to represent a technical note, and the element `<math>` can be used to represent a mathematical expression. These elements can be used in shape rules to describe how shapes are transformed.

#### Simple Function Point Method

The Simple Function Point (SFP) method is a system of notation for shape grammars that is based on the Plinian Core system. It includes a set of simplified rules for representing shapes and shape rules, making it easier to write and read shape grammars.

For example, the rule `$A \rightarrow B + C$` can be simplified to `$A \rightarrow B + C$`, where `$A$` represents the shape being transformed, `$B$` represents the shape on the left side of the rule, and `$C$` represents the shape on the right side of the rule. This simplified notation can be used in shape rules to describe how shapes are transformed.

#### Further Reading

For more information on these and other systems of notation for shape grammars, see the references provided in the bibliography. These references provide a more detailed explanation of the notation systems and how they are used in shape grammars.




### Subsection: 1.2c Notation Examples

In this section, we will explore some examples of shape grammar notation to better understand how it is used to describe shapes and their transformations.

#### Example 1: ISO 31-0 Notation

Let's consider the shape grammar rule `$A \rightarrow B + C$`, where `$A$` represents the shape being transformed, `$B$` represents the shape on the left side of the rule, and `$C$` represents the shape on the right side of the rule. This rule can be represented using ISO 31-0 notation as `$A \rightarrow B \cup C$`.

#### Example 2: Plinian Core Notation

Using Plinian Core notation, the same shape grammar rule can be represented as `<anchor|A> <union|B C>`. This notation is more verbose than ISO 31-0 notation, but it provides a clearer representation of the rule.

#### Example 3: Simple Function Point Method

The Simple Function Point (SFP) method can be used to simplify the representation of shape grammar rules. In this method, the rule `$A \rightarrow B + C$` can be represented as `$A \rightarrow B + C$`. This simplified notation makes it easier to write and read shape grammars.

#### Example 4: Further Reading

For more information on shape grammar notation, we recommend reading the publications of Hervé Brönnimann, J. Ian Munro, and Greg Frederickson. These authors have made significant contributions to the field of shape grammars and have published numerous papers on the topic.

### Conclusion

In this section, we have explored some examples of shape grammar notation to better understand how it is used to describe shapes and their transformations. We have seen how ISO 31-0 notation, Plinian Core notation, and the Simple Function Point method can be used to represent shape grammar rules. We have also provided some further reading for those interested in learning more about shape grammars.

### Section 1.3 Rule Application:

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of shape grammars and their applications. In this section, we will delve deeper into the process of rule application in shape grammars.

#### 1.3a Basic Rule Application

In shape grammars, rules are used to generate new shapes from existing ones. These rules are defined by a set of production rules, which specify how a shape can be broken down into smaller shapes. The process of applying these rules is known as rule application.

The basic rule application process involves selecting a shape from the current set of shapes and applying the appropriate production rule to it. This results in the generation of a new shape, which is then added to the current set of shapes. This process is repeated until all shapes have been generated.

Let's consider an example to better understand the process of rule application. Suppose we have a set of shapes {A, B, C} and the following production rules:

A -> B + C
B -> A - C
C -> A * B

To generate new shapes, we start with shape A and apply the production rule A -> B + C. This results in the generation of shape B + C. We then apply the production rule B -> A - C to shape B + C, resulting in the generation of shape A - C. Finally, we apply the production rule C -> A * B to shape A - C, resulting in the generation of shape A * B.

The resulting set of shapes is now {A, B, C, B + C, A - C, A * B}. This process can be repeated to generate even more shapes.

#### 1.3b Advanced Rule Application

While the basic rule application process is useful, it can be further enhanced by incorporating advanced techniques. One such technique is the use of shape variables, which allow for more flexibility in the generation of shapes.

Shape variables are symbols that represent a set of shapes. For example, the shape variable X could represent the set of shapes {A, B, C}. This allows for more complex production rules to be defined, such as X -> Y + Z, where Y and Z are also shape variables.

Another advanced technique is the use of shape constraints, which specify the relationships between different shapes. For example, the shape constraint X < Y could mean that shape X must be smaller than shape Y. This allows for more precise control over the generation of shapes.

By incorporating shape variables and constraints, the rule application process becomes more powerful and can generate a wider range of shapes. This is especially useful in applications where complex and intricate shapes are required.

In the next section, we will explore some real-world applications of shape grammars and how they are used in various fields.

### Section 1.4 Shape Generation:

In the previous section, we discussed the basics of shape grammars and how they are used to generate shapes. In this section, we will delve deeper into the process of shape generation and explore some advanced techniques.

#### 1.4a Basic Shape Generation

As mentioned before, shape generation involves applying shape rules to generate new shapes. These rules are defined by a shape grammar and can be used to create complex designs and patterns. In this subsection, we will discuss the process of basic shape generation and how it is used to create simple shapes.

To begin, let's consider a simple shape rule that defines how a square can be broken down into smaller squares. This rule can be represented as follows:

$$
S \rightarrow S_1S_2S_3S_4
$$

where $S$ represents the original square and $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$ represent the smaller squares. This rule states that a square can be broken down into four smaller squares. By applying this rule, we can generate new squares of different sizes.

Now, let's consider a more complex shape rule that defines how a triangle can be broken down into smaller triangles. This rule can be represented as follows:

$$
T \rightarrow T_1T_2T_3T_4T_5T_6T_7T_8T_9T_{10}
$$

where $T$ represents the original triangle and $T_1, T_2, T_3, T_4, T_5, T_6, T_7, T_8, T_9, T_{10}$ represent the smaller triangles. This rule states that a triangle can be broken down into ten smaller triangles. By applying this rule, we can generate new triangles of different sizes.

In addition to these basic shape rules, there are also more advanced techniques that can be used for shape generation. These include the use of shape parameters, shape variables, and shape constraints.

Shape parameters allow for the creation of variations within a shape. For example, in the square shape rule, we can introduce a shape parameter $n$ to represent the number of smaller squares. This allows us to generate squares of different sizes by varying the value of $n$.

Shape variables allow for the creation of more complex shapes by introducing additional shape elements. For example, in the triangle shape rule, we can introduce a shape variable $m$ to represent the number of smaller triangles. This allows us to generate triangles of different sizes and shapes by varying the value of $m$.

Shape constraints allow for the creation of specific shapes by defining constraints on the shape elements. For example, in the square shape rule, we can introduce a shape constraint that requires the smaller squares to have a specific size or orientation. This allows us to generate specific shapes, such as a checkerboard pattern, by applying the shape rule with the appropriate constraints.

By combining these advanced techniques with basic shape rules, we can create more complex and varied shapes. This allows for the generation of intricate designs and patterns, making shape grammars a powerful tool for shape generation.

In the next section, we will explore some applications of shape generation and how it is used in different fields.


## Chapter 1:: Introduction to Shape Grammars:




### Section 1.4b Advanced Shape Generation

In the previous section, we discussed the basics of shape generation and how it is used to create simple shapes. In this section, we will explore some advanced techniques that can be used for shape generation.

#### 1.4b.1 Shape Parameters

As mentioned before, shape parameters allow for the creation of variations within a shape. By introducing shape parameters, we can generate a family of shapes that share a common structure. For example, in the square shape rule, we can introduce a shape parameter $n$ to represent the number of smaller squares. This allows us to generate squares of different sizes by varying the value of $n$.

#### 1.4b.2 Shape Variables

Shape variables allow for the creation of more complex shapes by introducing additional shape rules. For example, in the triangle shape rule, we can introduce a shape variable $m$ to represent the number of smaller triangles. This allows us to generate triangles of different sizes and shapes by varying the value of $m$.

#### 1.4b.3 Shape Constraints

Shape constraints are used to control the generation of shapes. They can be used to ensure that certain conditions are met while generating shapes. For example, we can introduce a shape constraint that requires the generated shapes to have a certain aspect ratio. This allows us to control the shape of the generated shapes and ensure that they meet specific criteria.

#### 1.4b.4 Shape Grammars with Context

In the previous section, we discussed shape grammars without context. However, shape grammars can also have context, where the shape rules are dependent on the surrounding shapes. This allows for more complex and realistic shape generation. For example, we can introduce a shape rule that states that a square can only be broken down into smaller squares if it is surrounded by other squares. This adds a level of complexity to the shape generation process and allows for more intricate designs.

#### 1.4b.5 Shape Generation Algorithms

In addition to shape grammars, there are also algorithms that can be used for shape generation. These algorithms use mathematical principles and algorithms to generate shapes. For example, the L-system algorithm uses a set of rules and a starting shape to generate complex and intricate shapes. The Koch snowflake is a well-known example of a shape generated using the L-system algorithm.

#### 1.4b.6 Shape Generation in Computer Graphics

Shape generation is a crucial aspect of computer graphics, as it allows for the creation of complex and realistic shapes. In computer graphics, shape generation is used for a variety of purposes, such as creating 3D models, generating textures, and creating animations. With the advancements in technology, shape generation has become an essential tool for creating realistic and lifelike characters and objects in computer-generated scenes.

In conclusion, shape generation is a powerful tool for creating complex and intricate shapes. By using shape grammars, shape parameters, shape variables, shape constraints, and shape generation algorithms, we can generate a wide range of shapes for various applications. With the continuous advancements in technology, shape generation will continue to play a crucial role in the field of computer graphics.

## Chapter: Introduction to Shape Grammars: A Comprehensive Guide

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we discussed the basics of shape grammars and how they can be used to generate shapes. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic and explore the concept of shape transformations. Shape transformations are an essential aspect of shape grammars as they allow us to manipulate and modify shapes in a systematic manner. This chapter will cover the various types of shape transformations, including translation, rotation, and scaling, and how they can be applied to shapes. We will also discuss the concept of shape invariance and how it relates to shape transformations. By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of shape transformations and their role in shape grammars.
