## Foreward

Welcome to "Applied Macro and International Economics II: Concepts and Applications"! This book is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of macroeconomics and international economics, with a focus on practical applications and real-world examples.

As we delve into the complexities of these fields, we will be guided by the work of renowned economist Alan M. Taylor. Taylor's contributions to economic history, trade, finance, growth, and macroeconomics have been instrumental in shaping our understanding of these subjects. His work on the economic history of Argentina, in particular, has been recognized with the Gerschenkron Prize and the Cole Prize by the Economic History Association.

In this book, we will explore the concepts and applications of macroeconomics and international economics, building on the foundations laid by Taylor and other leading economists. We will delve into the intricacies of the trilemma, a concept introduced by Taylor and Obstfeld that describes the macroeconomic policy tradeoff between fixed exchange rates, open capital markets, and monetary policy.

As we navigate through these complex topics, we will also explore the role of international organizations and central banks in shaping global economic policies. We will examine how these institutions interact with economic history, trade, finance, and growth, and how they influence the global economic landscape.

This book is designed to be a valuable resource for advanced undergraduate students at MIT, providing a comprehensive understanding of macroeconomics and international economics. It is our hope that this book will not only enhance your understanding of these subjects but also inspire you to delve deeper into these fascinating fields.

Thank you for joining us on this journey. Let's explore the world of applied macro and international economics together.




### Section 1.1: Introduction to BBNN Framework:

The BBNN (Bayesian Business Network Network) framework is a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing complex economic systems. It is a graphical model that represents the relationships between different economic variables and their probabilistic dependencies. This framework is particularly useful in macro and international economics, where there are often many interconnected variables and complex relationships.

The BBNN framework is based on the principles of Bayesian statistics, which allow us to update our beliefs about the world based on new evidence. In the context of economics, this means that we can use the BBNN framework to update our understanding of the economy as new data becomes available.

The BBNN framework is also closely related to the concept of causal inference, which is the process of inferring cause-and-effect relationships from data. In economics, causal inference is crucial for understanding the effects of different policies and interventions on the economy.

In this chapter, we will explore the key concepts and applications of the BBNN framework in macro and international economics. We will start by discussing the basic principles of Bayesian statistics and causal inference, and then move on to more advanced topics such as network analysis and model validation. We will also provide several examples and case studies to illustrate the practical applications of the BBNN framework.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of the BBNN framework and its applications in macro and international economics. This knowledge will be essential for further exploration of the topics covered in this book, as well as for understanding and analyzing real-world economic systems. So let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of the BBNN framework!

### Subsection 1.1a: Introduction to PROMISE

The PROMISE (Promises, Futures, and Concurrent Logic Variables) framework is a subset of the BBNN framework that focuses on the use of promises, futures, and concurrent logic variables in economic analysis. These concepts are particularly useful in understanding and analyzing complex economic systems, as they allow us to model and predict the behavior of economic variables in a more efficient and accurate manner.

Promises are a type of future that represents a value that will be available at a future point in time. They are particularly useful in economic analysis as they allow us to model and predict the behavior of economic variables that are not yet available, but will be in the future. This is especially important in macro and international economics, where economic variables can change rapidly and unexpectedly.

Futures, on the other hand, are a type of promise that represents a value that will be available at a future point in time, but with a guaranteed delivery time. They are particularly useful in economic analysis as they allow us to model and predict the behavior of economic variables that are not yet available, but will be in the future, with a known delivery time. This is especially important in macro and international economics, where economic variables can change rapidly and unexpectedly, and having a guaranteed delivery time can help us make more accurate predictions.

Concurrent logic variables are a type of variable that can have multiple values at the same time. They are particularly useful in economic analysis as they allow us to model and predict the behavior of economic variables that can have multiple values at the same time. This is especially important in macro and international economics, where economic variables can have multiple values due to the complex and interconnected nature of economic systems.

In the next section, we will explore the key concepts and applications of the PROMISE framework in more detail, including its use in network analysis and model validation. We will also provide several examples and case studies to illustrate the practical applications of the PROMISE framework.

#### 1.1b.1 Introduction to PROMISE

The PROMISE (Promises, Futures, and Concurrent Logic Variables) framework is a subset of the BBNN framework that focuses on the use of promises, futures, and concurrent logic variables in economic analysis. These concepts are particularly useful in understanding and analyzing complex economic systems, as they allow us to model and predict the behavior of economic variables in a more efficient and accurate manner.

Promises are a type of future that represents a value that will be available at a future time. They are useful for modeling economic variables that are not yet available, but will become available in the future. For example, in macroeconomics, we often use promises to model the future value of GDP or inflation.

Futures are another type of future that represents a value that will be available at a future time. However, unlike promises, futures have a fixed expiration date and can be traded in financial markets. This makes them useful for modeling economic variables that have a known expiration date, such as the price of a stock or a commodity.

Concurrent logic variables are a type of variable that can take on multiple values simultaneously. They are useful for modeling economic variables that can have multiple states, such as the state of the economy or the state of a market.

#### 1.1b.2 Applications of PROMISE in Economic Analysis

The PROMISE framework has many applications in economic analysis. One of the main applications is in forecasting economic variables. By using promises, futures, and concurrent logic variables, we can model and predict the behavior of economic variables in a more efficient and accurate manner.

Another application of PROMISE is in risk management. By using promises and futures, we can model and manage risks associated with economic variables. This is particularly useful in financial markets, where risks can have a significant impact on the economy.

PROMISE is also useful in policy analysis. By using promises, futures, and concurrent logic variables, we can model the effects of different policies and interventions on the economy. This allows us to make informed decisions and evaluate the effectiveness of policies.

In conclusion, the PROMISE framework is a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing complex economic systems. By using promises, futures, and concurrent logic variables, we can model and predict the behavior of economic variables in a more efficient and accurate manner. This makes it a valuable tool for economic analysis in macro and international economics.





### Section 1.1c Applications of PROMISE

The PROMISE framework has a wide range of applications in macro and international economics. In this section, we will explore some of the key applications of PROMISE in economic analysis.

#### 1.1c.1 Predicting Economic Trends

One of the main applications of PROMISE in economics is predicting economic trends. By using promises, futures, and concurrent logic variables, economists can model and predict the behavior of economic variables such as stock prices, interest rates, and GDP. This allows them to make informed decisions about investments and policies.

For example, a promise can be used to represent the future value of a stock price. By analyzing the relationships between different stock prices and other economic variables, economists can make predictions about future stock prices and inform their investment decisions.

#### 1.1c.2 Modeling Complex Economic Systems

The BBNN framework is particularly useful in modeling complex economic systems, and the PROMISE framework is no exception. By using promises, futures, and concurrent logic variables, economists can model and analyze the relationships between different economic variables in a more efficient and accurate manner.

For instance, the BBNN framework can be used to model the effects of different policies and interventions on the economy. By representing the relationships between different economic variables as a network, economists can use network analysis techniques to understand the effects of these policies and interventions.

#### 1.1c.3 Conducting Causal Inference

Causal inference is a crucial aspect of economic analysis, and the PROMISE framework is well-suited for this task. By using promises, futures, and concurrent logic variables, economists can model and test causal relationships between different economic variables.

For example, a promise can be used to represent the future value of a variable that is affected by another variable. By analyzing the relationships between these variables, economists can test the causal relationship between them and make informed decisions about policies and interventions.

In conclusion, the PROMISE framework is a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing complex economic systems. By using promises, futures, and concurrent logic variables, economists can make predictions about economic trends, model complex economic systems, and conduct causal inference. In the next section, we will explore the key concepts and applications of the BBNN framework in more detail.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the concepts and applications of BBNN, or Balance of Payments and Exchange Rates. This topic is crucial in understanding the functioning of the global economy and the impact of international trade on individual countries. We will explore the internal and external adjustment mechanisms that countries employ to maintain a stable balance of payments and exchange rate.

The balance of payments is a record of all economic transactions between a country and the rest of the world over a specific period. It includes all payments for goods, services, and assets. The balance of payments is a key indicator of a country's economic health and its ability to participate in international trade.

The exchange rate, on the other hand, is the rate at which one country's currency can be exchanged for another. It is a critical factor in international trade as it determines the cost of imports and exports. Changes in exchange rates can have significant implications for a country's balance of payments and overall economic performance.

In this chapter, we will explore the relationship between the balance of payments and exchange rates, and how countries adjust their economies to maintain a stable balance of payments and exchange rate. We will also discuss the role of international organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund, in managing exchange rates and promoting global economic stability.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the concepts and applications of BBNN, and how they contribute to the functioning of the global economy. This knowledge will be essential for anyone studying or working in the field of macroeconomics and international trade. So, let's dive into the world of BBNN and explore the fascinating dynamics of international trade and exchange rates.




### Section: 2.1 Short Run Adjustment: ASAD:

In the previous chapter, we discussed the basic concepts of macroeconomics and international trade. In this section, we will delve deeper into the short run adjustment process, specifically focusing on the ASAD (Adjustment of Short Run Aggregate Demand) model.

The ASAD model is a key component of macroeconomics, providing a framework for understanding how an economy adjusts to changes in aggregate demand in the short run. It is particularly useful in the context of international trade, as it helps us understand how changes in aggregate demand can impact a country's balance of payments and exchange rate.

The ASAD model is based on the Keynesian theory of aggregate demand, which states that aggregate demand is determined by the interaction of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. In the short run, changes in these components can lead to changes in aggregate demand, which in turn can impact the overall level of economic activity.

The ASAD model also takes into account the role of monetary policy in adjusting aggregate demand. Changes in the money supply can have a significant impact on aggregate demand, particularly in the short run. For example, an increase in the money supply can lead to an increase in aggregate demand, as it allows for more spending and investment.

However, the ASAD model also recognizes the role of external factors in adjusting aggregate demand. Changes in the international economy, such as changes in exchange rates or global economic conditions, can also impact a country's aggregate demand. For instance, a depreciation of a country's currency can increase its exports and decrease its imports, leading to an increase in aggregate demand.

In the next section, we will explore the ASAD model in more detail, discussing its assumptions, components, and applications. We will also examine how the ASAD model can be used to analyze the impact of changes in aggregate demand on a country's balance of payments and exchange rate. By the end of this section, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the ASAD model and its role in short run adjustment.





### Section: 2.1 Short Run Adjustment: ASAD:

#### 2.1b ASAD in BBNN Framework

The BBNN (Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research) framework provides a useful framework for understanding the short run adjustment process in the context of business cycles. The BBNN framework is based on the concept of the business cycle, which refers to the fluctuations in economic activity that an economy experiences over a period of time.

The BBNN framework recognizes that the economy is constantly adjusting to changes in aggregate demand, both internally and externally. Internal adjustment refers to the changes that occur within the economy, such as changes in consumption, investment, and government spending. External adjustment, on the other hand, refers to the changes that occur outside the economy, such as changes in the international economy or changes in the money supply.

The ASAD model can be integrated into the BBNN framework to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the short run adjustment process. The ASAD model can be used to analyze the impact of changes in aggregate demand on the business cycle, both in the short run and in the long run.

In the short run, changes in aggregate demand can have a significant impact on the business cycle. For instance, an increase in aggregate demand can lead to an increase in economic activity, which can be represented as an expansion of the business cycle. Conversely, a decrease in aggregate demand can lead to a contraction of the business cycle.

In the long run, changes in aggregate demand can have a more subtle impact on the business cycle. The ASAD model can be used to analyze the long run effects of changes in aggregate demand on the business cycle, taking into account factors such as changes in the money supply and external factors.

The integration of the ASAD model into the BBNN framework provides a powerful tool for understanding the short run adjustment process in the context of business cycles. It allows us to analyze the impact of changes in aggregate demand on the business cycle, both in the short run and in the long run, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the economy's adjustment process.




### Section: 2.1 Short Run Adjustment: ASAD:

#### 2.1c Short Run Adjustment Mechanisms

The ASAD model provides a framework for understanding the short run adjustment process in the context of business cycles. In this section, we will delve deeper into the mechanisms of short run adjustment, focusing on the role of aggregate demand and supply in the economy.

The ASAD model is based on the concept of aggregate demand and supply, which are the total demand and supply for goods and services in an economy. Aggregate demand is determined by the interaction of the four major components of demand: consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. Changes in these components can shift the aggregate demand curve, leading to changes in the business cycle.

On the other hand, aggregate supply is determined by the availability of resources and technology in the economy. Changes in aggregate supply can shift the aggregate supply curve, leading to changes in the business cycle.

The short run adjustment process involves the movement along the aggregate demand and supply curves. When there is an increase in aggregate demand, the economy moves along the aggregate demand curve, leading to an increase in economic activity. Conversely, when there is a decrease in aggregate demand, the economy moves along the aggregate demand curve, leading to a decrease in economic activity.

The ASAD model can be used to analyze the short run adjustment process in the context of business cycles. For instance, an increase in aggregate demand can lead to an increase in economic activity, which can be represented as an expansion of the business cycle. Conversely, a decrease in aggregate demand can lead to a contraction of the business cycle.

In the long run, changes in aggregate demand can have a more subtle impact on the business cycle. The ASAD model can be used to analyze the long run effects of changes in aggregate demand on the business cycle, taking into account factors such as changes in the money supply and external factors.

The integration of the ASAD model into the BBNN framework provides a powerful tool for understanding the short run adjustment process in the context of business cycles. The BBNN framework recognizes that the economy is constantly adjusting to changes in aggregate demand, both internally and externally. The ASAD model provides a mathematical representation of this adjustment process, allowing us to analyze the impact of changes in aggregate demand on the business cycle.
