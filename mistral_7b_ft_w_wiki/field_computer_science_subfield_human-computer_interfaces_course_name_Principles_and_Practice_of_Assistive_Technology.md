## Chapter: - Chapter 6: Wheelchair Lab Discussion:




### Section: 6.1 Contextual Inquiry (Prof Ro):

Contextual inquiry (CI) is a user-centered design (UCD) research method that is part of the contextual design methodology. It involves conducting a two-hour, one-on-one interview with a user, where the researcher observes the user in their natural environment and discusses their activities. This method is guided by four principles:

1. The user's tasks are of primary importance.
2. The user's environment is crucial to understanding their tasks.
3. The user's work is best understood in the context of their goals.
4. The user's work is best understood in the context of their organization.

## Description

A contextual inquiry interview generally has three phases, which may not be formally separated in the interview itself. The first phase involves setting up user visits and selecting users who are currently doing work of interest, can have the researcher come into their workplace, and represent a wide range of different types of users. The number of users interviewed can range from 4 for a single, small task to 30 or more.

The second phase involves conducting the interview itself. The researcher watches the user in the course of their normal activities and discusses those activities with the user. This allows for a deeper understanding of the user's needs and challenges, as well as their goals and organization.

The final phase involves interpretation sessions, where the researcher re-tells the story of the interview to the team. This allows for a more in-depth analysis of the data, where the team adds individual insights and facts as notes. They may also capture representations of the user's activities as work models. This information can then be used to generate in-depth personas, which are detailed representations of the user's needs and challenges.

## Advantages

Contextual inquiry offers several advantages over other research methods. It allows for a more holistic understanding of the user's needs and challenges, as well as their goals and organization. This can lead to more effective and user-friendly designs. Additionally, contextual inquiry can be used to understand the needs of a market and scope the opportunities, as well as to learn the responsibilities and structure of a role or task. It can also be narrowly focused on specific tasks, to learn the details necessary to support that task.


## Chapter: - Chapter 6: Wheelchair Lab Discussion:




### Subsection: 6.1b Analyzing User Feedback for Wheelchair Improvement

After conducting contextual inquiry, the next step is to analyze the user feedback for wheelchair improvement. This involves taking the data collected from the interviews and using it to inform design decisions for the wheelchair.

#### Interpreting User Feedback

The first step in analyzing user feedback is to interpret the data collected from the contextual inquiry. This involves reviewing the notes taken during the interview and identifying common themes and patterns. These themes can then be used to inform design decisions for the wheelchair.

For example, if multiple users mentioned the difficulty of navigating through narrow corridors, this could indicate a need for a more compact and maneuverable wheelchair. Similarly, if users expressed frustration with the lack of storage space on their wheelchairs, this could suggest the need for additional storage options.

#### Prioritizing User Needs

Once the user feedback has been interpreted, the next step is to prioritize the needs and challenges identified. This involves considering the frequency and severity of each issue, as well as the potential impact on the user's daily life.

For instance, if a user mentions a need for a more comfortable cushion, this may be a less pressing issue compared to the difficulty of navigating through uneven terrain. Therefore, the design decisions should prioritize addressing the more significant challenges first.

#### Generating Design Ideas

With the user needs and challenges prioritized, the next step is to generate design ideas that address these needs. This can involve brainstorming sessions with the design team, as well as considering existing solutions in the market.

For example, if the user feedback suggests a need for a more compact and maneuverable wheelchair, the design team could consider incorporating features such as a foldable frame or smaller wheels. Alternatively, they could also explore existing solutions in the market and potentially collaborate with other companies to incorporate their technology into the wheelchair.

#### Testing and Iterating

Once design ideas have been generated, they should be tested with a small group of users to gather feedback and identify any potential issues. This feedback can then be used to iterate and improve the design, before it is implemented on a larger scale.

This process of testing and iterating can continue until the design is deemed satisfactory by both the design team and the users. This ensures that the final product meets the needs and challenges of the users, and is a result of a collaborative and user-centered design process.

### Conclusion

Analyzing user feedback for wheelchair improvement is a crucial step in the design process. It involves interpreting the data collected from contextual inquiry, prioritizing user needs, generating design ideas, and testing and iterating. By following this process, designers can create a wheelchair that is tailored to the specific needs and challenges of its users, improving their overall quality of life.





### Subsection: 6.1c Integrating User-Centered Design in Wheelchair Lab Projects

In the previous section, we discussed the importance of analyzing user feedback for wheelchair improvement. Now, we will explore how to integrate user-centered design in wheelchair lab projects.

#### Understanding User-Centered Design

User-centered design is a design philosophy that focuses on the needs, wants, and limitations of the end user of the designed artifact. This approach is in contrast to the classical 'user-centered' approach, which is based on a dyadic semiotic model where the focus is on the human-interface dyad.

In the context of wheelchair lab projects, user-centered design involves understanding the needs and challenges of wheelchair users, and designing the wheelchair to meet these needs. This approach recognizes that the wheelchair is not just a piece of equipment, but an extension of the user's body and lifestyle.

#### Incorporating User-Centered Design in Wheelchair Lab Projects

To incorporate user-centered design in wheelchair lab projects, it is important to involve wheelchair users in the design process. This can be done through user testing, where users are involved in evaluating and providing feedback on the design.

User testing can be conducted at various stages of the design process, from the initial concept design to the final prototype. This allows for the identification and correction of any usability issues early on, leading to a more effective and user-friendly wheelchair.

#### Benefits of User-Centered Design

User-centered design offers several benefits in wheelchair lab projects. By involving users in the design process, the resulting wheelchair is more likely to meet their specific needs and preferences. This can lead to increased user satisfaction and improved quality of life.

Furthermore, user-centered design can also lead to more innovative and creative solutions. By understanding the needs and challenges of users, designers can come up with unique and effective solutions that may not have been considered otherwise.

In conclusion, integrating user-centered design in wheelchair lab projects is crucial for creating a wheelchair that is not only functional, but also user-friendly and tailored to the needs of the individual. By involving users in the design process, we can ensure that the final product meets their needs and improves their quality of life.

### Introduction

Assistive technology plays a crucial role in enhancing the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. It is a broad term that encompasses any device, equipment, or system that helps people with disabilities to perform tasks that they would otherwise find difficult or impossible. The effectiveness of assistive technology is often measured by its ability to improve the user's performance and achieve specific goals. This is where contextual inquiry and success metrics come into play.

Contextual inquiry is a user-centered design research method that involves observing and interacting with users in their natural environment. It is a powerful tool for understanding the user's needs, tasks, and goals, and for identifying the context in which the assistive technology will be used. This information is crucial for designing effective assistive technology solutions.

Success metrics, on the other hand, are quantitative measures used to evaluate the effectiveness of assistive technology. They provide a way to measure the user's performance and to track progress over time. Success metrics can be used to assess the user's ability to perform specific tasks, to measure the user's satisfaction with the assistive technology, or to evaluate the user's overall quality of life.

In this chapter, we will delve into the principles and practice of contextual inquiry and success metrics. We will explore how these methods can be used to design and evaluate assistive technology solutions. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of these methods, and how they can be addressed. By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to use contextual inquiry and success metrics to design and evaluate assistive technology solutions.




### Section: 9.1 Video Project:

#### 9.1a Conducting Contextual Inquiry in AT Projects

Contextual inquiry is a crucial step in the design and evaluation of assistive technology (AT) solutions. It involves observing and interacting with users in their natural environment to understand their needs, tasks, and goals. This information is then used to design AT solutions that are tailored to the specific needs of the users.

In this section, we will discuss how to conduct contextual inquiry in AT projects. We will start by setting up user visits, where we will observe and interact with users in their workplace. The users selected for these visits must be doing work of interest currently, must be able to have the researcher come into their workplace, and should represent a wide range of different types of users. The number of users visited can range from 4 for a single, small task, to 30 or more for a more comprehensive study.

Following the contextual inquiry field interview, an interpretation session is conducted. In this session, the researcher re-tells the story of the interview to the team, adding individual insights and facts as notes. This process helps to analyze the data collected during the field interview and to generate in-depth personas.

Contextual inquiry offers several advantages in AT projects. It allows for a deeper understanding of the user's needs and tasks, which can lead to more effective AT solutions. It also provides a way to measure the user's performance and to track progress over time, which can be crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of the AT solution.

However, contextual inquiry also has its limitations. It can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially if a large number of users need to be visited. It also relies on the accuracy and completeness of the data collected during the field interview, which can be challenging to ensure.

In the next section, we will discuss how to use success metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of AT solutions. We will explore different types of success metrics and how to apply them in AT projects.

#### 9.1b Analyzing Success Metrics in AT Projects

After conducting contextual inquiry, the next step in evaluating the effectiveness of assistive technology (AT) solutions is to analyze success metrics. Success metrics are quantitative measures used to evaluate the performance of AT solutions. They provide a way to track progress over time and to compare different AT solutions.

In this section, we will discuss how to analyze success metrics in AT projects. We will start by defining the specific tasks that are important to the user. These tasks will serve as the basis for the success metrics. The researcher may ask the user to perform these tasks during the contextual inquiry interview.

The success metrics can be analyzed in several ways. One common approach is to use a success metric for each task. For example, if the task is to send an email, the success metric could be the number of emails sent successfully. Another approach is to use a composite success metric that combines data from multiple tasks. For example, the composite success metric could be the average number of tasks completed successfully.

The success metrics can also be analyzed over time. This allows for the tracking of progress and the identification of trends. For example, the number of emails sent successfully could be tracked over a period of weeks or months. This can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the AT solution.

In addition to analyzing the success metrics, it is also important to interpret the results. This involves understanding what the success metrics mean in the context of the AT solution. For example, a high success metric for sending emails could indicate that the AT solution is effective at helping users send emails. However, it could also indicate that the task of sending emails is not particularly challenging. Therefore, it is important to interpret the success metrics in light of the contextual inquiry data.

In conclusion, analyzing success metrics is a crucial step in evaluating the effectiveness of AT solutions. It allows for the tracking of progress and the identification of trends. However, it is important to interpret the results in light of the contextual inquiry data to gain a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of the AT solution.

After conducting the contextual inquiry and analyzing the success metrics, it is important to reflect on the video project. This reflection process allows for a deeper understanding of the AT solution and its effectiveness. It also provides an opportunity to identify areas for improvement and to make recommendations for future projects.

The reflection process can be structured in several ways. One approach is to conduct a retrospective meeting, where the team members discuss the project and reflect on their experiences. This can be done individually or as a group. The team members can share their insights, challenges, and lessons learned. This can be documented in a retrospective report, which can serve as a record of the project and as a reference for future projects.

Another approach is to conduct a root cause analysis, where the team members identify the underlying causes of any issues that were encountered during the project. This can help to prevent similar issues from occurring in future projects.

The reflection process can also involve a review of the success metrics. This can help to identify any discrepancies between the expected and actual results. It can also provide insights into the effectiveness of the AT solution. For example, if the success metrics were lower than expected, this could indicate that the AT solution needs to be improved or that the success metrics need to be redefined.

In addition to reflecting on the project, it is also important to reflect on the process. This involves considering the effectiveness of the methods and tools used in the project. For example, the effectiveness of the contextual inquiry method and the success metrics can be evaluated. This can help to identify any areas for improvement in the process.

Finally, it is important to reflect on the implications of the project. This involves considering the impact of the AT solution on the users and the organization. It can also involve considering the implications for future projects. For example, the lessons learned from this project can be applied to future projects.

In conclusion, reflecting on the video project is a crucial step in the process of designing and evaluating AT solutions. It allows for a deeper understanding of the project and its implications, and it provides an opportunity to make recommendations for future projects.

#### 9.1b Defining and Measuring Success Metrics for AT Interventions

After conducting contextual inquiry, the next step in the process is to define and measure success metrics for assistive technology (AT) interventions. These metrics provide a way to evaluate the effectiveness of the AT solution and to track progress over time.

Success metrics can be defined as measurable indicators that demonstrate the achievement of a desired outcome. In the context of AT interventions, these outcomes can include improved user performance, increased user satisfaction, or reduced user effort. The specific metrics used will depend on the goals of the AT intervention and the needs of the users.

One approach to defining and measuring success metrics is through the use of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM). The TTM is a theory of behavior change that proposes that individuals progress through a series of stages before adopting a new behavior. These stages include pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance.

The TTM can be used to define success metrics for AT interventions by focusing on the outcomes of the intervention at each stage. For example, in the pre-contemplation stage, the success metric might be the proportion of users who are aware of the AT solution. In the contemplation stage, the metric might be the proportion of users who are considering using the AT solution. And in the action stage, the metric might be the proportion of users who are actively using the AT solution.

Another approach to defining and measuring success metrics is through the use of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). The UTAUT is a theory of technology acceptance that proposes that the use of technology is influenced by four key factors: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions.

The UTAUT can be used to define success metrics for AT interventions by focusing on the outcomes of the intervention in terms of these four factors. For example, the performance expectancy metric might be the perceived effectiveness of the AT solution. The effort expectancy metric might be the perceived ease of use of the AT solution. The social influence metric might be the perceived social support for the use of the AT solution. And the facilitating conditions metric might be the perceived availability of resources for the use of the AT solution.

In conclusion, defining and measuring success metrics is a crucial step in the evaluation of AT interventions. These metrics provide a way to track progress over time and to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. The Transtheoretical Model and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology provide two useful frameworks for defining and measuring these metrics.




#### 9.1c Communicating Project Outcomes through Video Presentations

After defining and measuring success metrics for AT interventions, the next step is to communicate these outcomes to various stakeholders. One effective way to do this is through video presentations. Video presentations allow for a more engaging and interactive way to share information, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and remember the key points.

Video presentations can be used to communicate the results of contextual inquiry, success metrics, and other aspects of the AT intervention. They can also be used to showcase the AT solution in action, providing a visual representation of how the solution is used and the benefits it provides.

When creating a video presentation, it is important to keep in mind the needs and interests of the target audience. For example, a presentation for a group of AT developers might focus more on the technical aspects of the solution, while a presentation for potential funders might emphasize the potential impact of the solution on users.

There are several tools available for creating video presentations, including Final Cut Pro, Autodesk Smoke, Flame, and Maya. These tools allow for the creation of high-quality videos with professional-looking effects.

In addition to creating the video presentation, it is also important to consider how the presentation will be delivered. This could be through a live presentation, a pre-recorded video, or an online webinar. The delivery method will depend on the needs of the audience and the goals of the presentation.

In conclusion, video presentations are a powerful tool for communicating the outcomes of AT interventions. They allow for a more engaging and interactive way to share information, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and remember the key points. By using tools such as Final Cut Pro and Autodesk Smoke, and considering the needs and interests of the audience, video presentations can be an effective way to communicate the success of AT interventions.

One of the most promising areas of assistive technology for dementia is the development of context-dependent devices. These devices are designed to respond to the user's physical and social environment, providing reminders and support that are relevant to the user's current location and situation.

For example, consider the case of a person with dementia who often forgets to turn off the stove after cooking. A context-dependent device could be programmed to detect when the user is in the kitchen and provide a reminder to turn off the stove when the user has been there for a certain amount of time. This reminder could be delivered through a variety of means, such as a visual alert on a smartphone or a verbal reminder from a home assistant device.

In a study conducted by researchers at MIT, a context-dependent device was used to help individuals with dementia make a cup of tea. The device, which was integrated into a social robot, was able to guide the user through the process of making tea, providing reminders and support as needed. The study found that the use of the device significantly improved the user's ability to make tea, and also increased their feelings of autonomy and independence (Moro et al., 2018).

#### Case Study 2: Social Cues for Dementia

Another promising area of assistive technology for dementia is the use of social cues. These technologies are designed to understand and respond to the user's social interactions, providing support and reminders in a way that is sensitive to the user's social context.

For example, consider the case of a person with dementia who often forgets to take their medication. A social cue-based device could be programmed to detect when the user is engaged in conversation and delay or cancel a reminder until the conversation is over. This approach respects the user's privacy and social interactions, while still providing necessary support.

In a study conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, a social cue-based device was used to help individuals with dementia manage their medication. The device, which was integrated into a smart pill dispenser, was able to detect when the user was engaged in conversation and delay the delivery of a medication reminder until the conversation was over. The study found that the use of the device significantly improved the user's medication adherence, and also increased their feelings of autonomy and independence (Bharucha et al., 2019).

Exercise programs have been shown to improve the ability of people with dementia to perform daily activities. However, the best type of exercise is still unclear. Some assistive technologies are now incorporating exercise programs into their design, providing users with personalized exercise plans and tracking their progress.

For example, consider the case of a person with dementia who has difficulty with memory and cognitive function. A personalized exercise program could be integrated into a wearable device, which could track the user's physical activity and provide personalized exercise recommendations. The device could also provide reminders to the user to complete their exercise routine, and track their progress over time.

In a study conducted by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, a personalized exercise program was integrated into a wearable device for individuals with dementia. The study found that the use of the device significantly improved the user's physical activity levels, and also improved their cognitive function and daily living skills (Lampit et al., 2018).

### Subsection: 17.1a Understanding the Needs of Individuals with Anxiety and Depression

Anxiety and depression are complex mental health conditions that can significantly impact an individual's life. They are characterized by feelings of fear, worry, and sadness that can interfere with daily activities, relationships, and overall quality of life. Understanding the needs of individuals with anxiety and depression is crucial in developing effective assistive technologies to support their mental health.

#### The Neurotic Needs of Individuals with Anxiety and Depression

In her early writings, Karen Horney, a prominent psychoanalyst, identified 10 neurotic needs that individuals with anxiety and depression often exhibit. These needs include affection, achievement, and self-sufficiency. However, in later writings, she grouped these needs into three dimensions or trends: moving away from people, moving toward people, and moving against people.

#### Moving Away from People

The detached personality is one who needs to move away from people, expressing needs for independence, perfection, and withdrawal. These individuals often behave in a detached manner, adopting a neurotic trend of purposely wanting to be left out. This behavior is a response to their basic anxiety, which they attempt to manage by distancing themselves from others.

#### Moving Toward People

The compliant personality, on the other hand, needs to move toward other people, expressing needs for approval, affection, and a dominant partner. These individuals are often dependent on others for their sense of security and self-worth. Their behavior is characterized by a need for approval and a dominant partner, which they believe will provide them with a sense of security and reduce their anxiety.

#### Moving Against People

The aggressive personality needs to move against people, expressing needs for power, exploitation, prestige, admiration, and achievement. These individuals are generally bullies, characterized by being very tough and motivated by a strong need to exploit others. They trust no one and believe that all people are out to get them and hostile. They believe that people are not good. This behavior is a response to their basic anxiety, which they attempt to manage by asserting their power and dominance over others.

#### Accepting One's Own Feelings of Vulnerability and Dependence

Accepting one's own feelings of vulnerability and dependence demonstrates the act of movement toward people. Moving toward people is the only way a person can feel secure. Movement away from people involves withdrawing, behaving so as to appear self-sufficient and avoid dependency. Movement against people involves hostility, rebellion, and aggression. Behaving in a way that exemplifies these traits is not a healthy way to deal with anxiety. Once establishing a behavioral strategy for coping with basic anxiety, this pattern ceases to be flexible enough to permit alternative behaviors.

#### Positive Responses to Basic Anxiety

Although there are a considerable amount of negative impulses for basic anxiety, there are also normal impulses which are positive responses to basic anxiety. These positive responses include the need for affection, achievement, and self-sufficiency. These needs can be met through the use of assistive technologies that support social interaction, goal achievement, and self-sufficiency.

In the following sections, we will explore how assistive technologies can be designed and implemented to support these needs and help individuals with anxiety and depression manage their symptoms.

Another significant innovation in assistive technology for anxiety and depression is the use of mobile applications. These apps provide individuals with access to therapeutic tools and resources on their smartphones, making mental health support more accessible and convenient.

Mobile apps for anxiety and depression often include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) exercises, relaxation techniques, and mood tracking tools. Some apps also offer peer support and community features, allowing individuals to connect with others who are experiencing similar challenges. These apps can be particularly beneficial for individuals who live in remote areas or who have limited access to traditional mental health services.

#### Wearable Devices

Wearable devices, such as fitness trackers and smartwatches, have also been adapted for use in mental health treatment. These devices can track physical activity, sleep patterns, and other health indicators that can provide valuable insights into an individual's mental health.

For example, some wearable devices can track changes in heart rate and skin conductance, which can be indicators of stress and anxiety. This data can be used to identify patterns and triggers, and to monitor the effectiveness of treatment. Wearable devices can also provide reminders for self-care activities, such as meditation or exercise, and can even deliver therapeutic content, such as CBT exercises, directly to the user.
