## Chapter 2: Data Structures




### Section: 2.1 Lecture 2: Data Structures notes

#### 2.1a Arrays

In the previous lecture, we introduced the concept of data structures and discussed the importance of understanding different types of data structures in the field of algorithms. In this section, we will delve deeper into one of the most fundamental data structures - arrays.

An array is a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type. It is a linear data structure, meaning that the elements are stored in a linear fashion, with each element having a specific index. The first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.

Arrays are widely used in various applications due to their simplicity and efficiency. They are particularly useful when dealing with large amounts of data, as they allow for efficient access to elements. This is because the time complexity for accessing an element in an array is `O(1)`, meaning that the time required is constant, regardless of the size of the array.

However, arrays also have some limitations. One of the main limitations is that the size of an array is fixed. This means that once an array is created, its size cannot be changed. If we need to add more elements to an array, we have to create a new array with a larger size and copy the existing elements into it. This can be time-consuming and inefficient, especially for large arrays.

Another limitation of arrays is that they can only store elements of the same type. This means that we cannot mix different types of data in an array. For example, we cannot have an array that contains both integers and strings. This can be a limitation in certain applications where we need to store different types of data together.

Despite these limitations, arrays are still a fundamental data structure and are used in many algorithms. In the next section, we will explore some of the applications of arrays in algorithms.





#### 2.1b Linked Lists

In the previous section, we discussed arrays, a fundamental data structure that stores a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type. In this section, we will explore another important data structure - linked lists.

A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, each containing a data element and a reference to the next node in the list. Unlike arrays, linked lists are dynamic, meaning that their size can be changed as needed. This makes them particularly useful for storing data that is constantly changing or growing.

The basic building block of a linked list is the node. Each node in a linked list contains a data element and a reference to the next node in the list. The first node in a linked list is called the head, and the last node is called the tail. If a linked list has no nodes, it is considered to be empty.

Linked lists have several advantages over arrays. One of the main advantages is their flexibility. As mentioned earlier, the size of a linked list can be changed as needed, making them suitable for storing data that is constantly changing or growing. This also means that linked lists can be used to store data of different types, as the size and type of the data do not affect the structure of the list.

Another advantage of linked lists is their ability to handle large amounts of data. Unlike arrays, which have a fixed size and can become inefficient when dealing with large amounts of data, linked lists can be made as large as needed. This makes them suitable for applications that involve handling large datasets.

However, linked lists also have some disadvantages. One of the main disadvantages is their time complexity for accessing elements. Unlike arrays, where the time complexity for accessing an element is `O(1)`, the time complexity for accessing an element in a linked list is `O(n)`. This means that as the size of the list increases, the time required to access an element also increases.

Another disadvantage of linked lists is their memory usage. Since each node in a linked list contains a data element and a reference to the next node, they require more memory compared to arrays. This can be a limitation for applications that have strict memory constraints.

Despite these disadvantages, linked lists are still widely used in various applications due to their flexibility and ability to handle large amounts of data. In the next section, we will explore some of the applications of linked lists in algorithms.





#### 2.1c Stacks

In the previous sections, we have discussed arrays and linked lists, two fundamental data structures. In this section, we will explore another important data structure - stacks.

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element inserted into the stack is the first one to be removed. Stacks are often used in situations where the order of operations is important, such as in mathematical calculations.

The basic building block of a stack is the node. Each node in a stack contains a data element and a reference to the next node in the stack. The top node, which is the last node inserted into the stack, is called the top of the stack. The bottom node, which is the first node inserted into the stack, is called the bottom of the stack. If a stack has no nodes, it is considered to be empty.

Stacks have several advantages over other data structures. One of the main advantages is their simplicity. Stacks are easy to implement and understand, making them suitable for applications that require a simple and efficient data structure.

Another advantage of stacks is their ability to handle recursive algorithms. Recursive algorithms often use stacks to store the function calls and their parameters. This allows the algorithm to keep track of the function calls and return to the correct point in the code when the function calls are completed.

However, stacks also have some disadvantages. One of the main disadvantages is their time complexity for accessing elements. Similar to linked lists, the time complexity for accessing an element in a stack is `O(n)`. This means that as the size of the stack increases, the time required to access an element also increases.

In the next section, we will explore another important data structure - queues.
