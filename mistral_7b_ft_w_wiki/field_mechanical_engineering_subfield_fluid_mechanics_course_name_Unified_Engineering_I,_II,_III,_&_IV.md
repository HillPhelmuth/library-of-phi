Mechanical engineers use mathematical models and equations, such as `$F = ma$` and `$$\Delta w = ...$$`, to design and analyze these systems.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into each of these disciplines, exploring their principles, methods, and applications. We will also discuss the role of mathematics in each discipline, and how engineers use mathematical models and equations to design and analyze systems.




### Subsection 1.2a Introduction to Engineering Design Process

The engineering design process is a systematic approach to problem-solving and innovation. It is a crucial aspect of engineering, as it allows engineers to create solutions to complex problems. The process involves a series of steps, each of which is essential for the successful completion of a project.

The engineering design process can be broadly categorized into four phases: Clarification of the task, Conceptual design, Embodiment design, and Detail design. These phases are not always linear and may involve iteration and feedback.

#### Clarification of the Task

The first phase of the engineering design process involves understanding the problem or need that needs to be addressed. This includes defining the project goals, understanding the constraints, and gathering information about the problem domain. This phase is crucial as it sets the foundation for the rest of the design process. It is important to have a clear understanding of the problem at this stage to avoid wasting time and resources on solutions that do not address the core issue.

#### Conceptual Design

Once the task has been clarified, the next phase is to generate potential solutions. This involves brainstorming, sketching, and modeling different ideas. The goal is to come up with a range of possible solutions that could potentially address the problem. This phase is often iterative, as ideas are refined and improved upon based on feedback and evaluation.

#### Embodiment Design

In the embodiment design phase, the most promising solutions from the conceptual design phase are further developed and refined. This involves creating detailed designs, prototypes, or simulations of the solutions. The goal is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the solutions. This phase may involve iteration and feedback from previous phases.

#### Detail Design

The final phase of the engineering design process is to finalize the design and prepare it for implementation. This involves finalizing the design details, creating detailed drawings or specifications, and preparing for manufacturing or construction. This phase is crucial as it ensures that the final solution meets all the requirements and is ready for implementation.

The engineering design process is not always linear and may involve iteration and feedback. It is important for engineers to be flexible and adaptive in their approach to problem-solving. The process should be seen as a cycle, with each phase feeding into the next.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into each of these phases, exploring the methods and tools that can be used to facilitate the engineering design process.

### Subsection 1.2b Design Methods

Design methods are systematic approaches to problem-solving and innovation in engineering. They provide a structured process for engineers to follow, from the initial problem identification to the final solution implementation. These methods are often based on a set of principles and guidelines, and they can be applied to a wide range of engineering problems.

#### Methods and Processes

There are numerous design methods and processes that engineers can use. These include the UK's Design Council model, which consists of four phases: Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver. The Discover phase involves gaining insight into the problem, while the Define phase focuses on defining the area to focus on. The Develop phase is where potential solutions are developed, and the Deliver phase involves implementing the solutions that work.

Another popular design method is the Pahl and Beitz model, which consists of four phases: Clarification of the task, Conceptual design, Embodiment design, and Detail design. This model is more linear than the UK's Design Council model, but it also allows for iteration and feedback.

#### Iteration and Feedback

Iteration and feedback are crucial aspects of the design process. They allow engineers to refine their solutions and improve their designs based on feedback and evaluation. This iterative process is often represented by a spiral or a cycle, as seen in the architectural design process.

#### Divergent and Convergent Thinking

The design process often involves a sequence of stages of divergent and convergent thinking. Divergent thinking involves generating a large number of ideas or solutions, while convergent thinking involves evaluating and refining these ideas. This process allows engineers to explore a wide range of possibilities and then focus on the most promising solutions.

#### Design Process Models

There are numerous design process models available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The Dubberly Design Office has compiled examples of more than 80 design process models, but this list is not exhaustive. Engineers should choose a design process model that best suits their needs and the nature of their project.

#### Design Methods for Individuals

J. Christopher Jones has outlined a basic design process for individuals. This process involves defining the problem, generating ideas, evaluating these ideas, and implementing the best solution. This approach is less prescriptive than some of the other design methods, but it provides a useful framework for individuals who are new to the design process.

In conclusion, design methods and processes are essential tools for engineers. They provide a structured approach to problem-solving and innovation, and they allow engineers to create effective and efficient solutions. By understanding and applying these methods, engineers can improve their design skills and become more effective problem-solvers.

### Subsection 1.2c Engineering Design Tools

Engineering design tools are essential for the successful implementation of the design process. These tools provide engineers with the necessary resources to create, evaluate, and implement designs. They can range from simple hand tools to complex computer software and hardware.

#### Hand Tools

Hand tools are essential for the physical creation of designs. They include tools for measuring, cutting, shaping, and assembling materials. These tools are often used in conjunction with computer-aided design (CAD) software, which allows engineers to create detailed digital models of their designs.

#### Computer-Aided Design (CAD) Software

CAD software is a powerful tool for creating, modifying, and analyzing designs. It allows engineers to create detailed digital models of their designs, which can be viewed from any angle and at any scale. CAD software also includes tools for analyzing the structural integrity of designs, optimizing designs for performance, and creating detailed manufacturing instructions.

#### Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) Software

Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software is used to control machine tools during the manufacturing process. It takes the digital models created in CAD software and translates them into instructions for machines such as mills, lathes, and 3D printers. This allows for precise and efficient manufacturing, reducing the risk of errors and improving the quality of the final product.

#### Finite Element Analysis (FEA) Software

Finite element analysis (FEA) software is used to simulate the behavior of physical systems under various conditions. It allows engineers to test the performance of their designs under different loads, temperatures, and other conditions without the need for physical prototypes. This can save time and resources, and it allows engineers to identify and address potential issues before the design is manufactured.

#### Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) Tools

Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) tools are increasingly being used in engineering design. VR allows engineers to immerse themselves in a virtual environment and interact with their designs in a more intuitive way. AR, on the other hand, overlays digital information onto the physical world, allowing engineers to visualize and understand complex designs in a more tangible way.

#### Design for Manufacturability (DFM) Tools

Design for manufacturability (DFM) tools are used to ensure that designs are optimized for manufacturing. They help engineers identify potential issues with their designs, such as overly complex parts or assembly sequences, and provide guidance on how to simplify and improve the design for manufacturing.

#### Design for Sustainability (DfS) Tools

Design for sustainability (DfS) tools are used to ensure that designs are optimized for sustainability. They help engineers consider the environmental impact of their designs, from the materials used to the energy consumption and waste generation. This allows engineers to create designs that are not only functional but also environmentally friendly.

In conclusion, engineering design tools are essential for the successful implementation of the design process. They provide engineers with the necessary resources to create, evaluate, and implement designs, and they play a crucial role in the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the engineering design process.




### Subsection 1.3a Introduction to Problem Solving Techniques

Problem-solving is a crucial skill for engineers, as it allows them to find creative and effective solutions to complex problems. In this section, we will introduce some of the most commonly used problem-solving techniques in engineering.

#### Unified Structured Inventive Thinking (USIT)

USIT is a problem-solving methodology that emphasizes the use of both logic and creativity. It is based on a unifying theory that focuses on the three fundamental components of objects, attributes, and effects. This methodology is particularly useful when conventional problem-solving methods have been exhausted.

USIT consists of three common phases: problem definition, problem analysis, and application of solution concepts. Each phase is equally important and requires equal time and effort. The first phase involves clearly defining the problem, including identifying the problem domain, goals, and constraints. The second phase focuses on analyzing the problem, including identifying the objects, attributes, and effects involved. The final phase involves applying solution concepts, which are derived from the problem analysis.

#### Dimensionality

Dimensionality is a heuristic used in USIT that focuses on the attributes available and new ones discovered during problem analysis. It encourages problem solvers to think creatively and explore new possibilities by considering the different dimensions or aspects of a problem.

#### Pluralization

Pluralization is another heuristic used in USIT that focuses on the multiplication or division of objects, their parts, or their uses. This heuristic encourages problem solvers to think outside the box and consider alternative ways of using objects or their components.

#### Distribution

Distribution is a heuristic that focuses on the distribution of functions among objects in a problem situation. It encourages problem solvers to consider different ways of distributing functions among objects, which can lead to new and innovative solutions.

#### Transduction

Transduction is a heuristic that uses attribute-function-attribute links to reach new solutions. It encourages problem solvers to think about the relationships between attributes and functions and how they can be manipulated to create new solutions.

By understanding and applying these problem-solving techniques, engineers can effectively tackle complex problems and find creative and effective solutions. In the next section, we will explore some real-world examples of how these techniques have been used in engineering.
