### Subsection 1.2 History of (environmental) microbiology

The history of environmental microbiology is deeply intertwined with the history of microbiology as a whole. The field of microbiology, as we know it today, was born in the 19th century, with the work of Ferdinand Cohn, Louis Pasteur, and Robert Koch.

#### Ferdinand Cohn and the Birth of Bacteriology

Ferdinand Cohn, a botanist, is often considered the father of bacteriology. His studies on algae and photosynthetic bacteria led him to describe several bacteria, including "Bacillus" and "Beggiatoa". Cohn was also the first to formulate a scheme for the taxonomic classification of bacteria, and to discover endospores. His work laid the foundation for the modern study of bacteria and their role in the environment.

#### Louis Pasteur and the Germ Theory of Disease

Louis Pasteur, another contemporary of Cohn, is often considered the father of modern microbiology. His series of experiments designed to disprove the then widely held theory of spontaneous generation solidified microbiology's identity as a biological science. Pasteur also designed methods for food preservation (pasteurization) and vaccines against several diseases such as anthrax, fowl cholera, and rabies.

Pasteur's work, however, did not accurately reflect the true diversity of the microbial world because of his exclusive focus on microorganisms having direct medical relevance. It was not until the late 19th century and the work of Martinus Beijerinck and Sergei Winogradsky that the true breadth of microbiology was revealed.

#### Martinus Beijerinck and the Discovery of Viruses

Martinus Beijerinck made two major contributions to microbiology: the discovery of viruses and the development of enrichment culture technique. His work on viruses, which he referred to as "contagious microbes", laid the foundation for the study of these tiny infectious agents.

#### Sergei Winogradsky and the Role of Microorganisms in Nutrient Cycling

Sergei Winogradsky, another pioneer in the field of microbiology, made significant contributions to our understanding of the role of microorganisms in nutrient cycling. His work on the nitrogen cycle, in particular, revolutionized our understanding of how nitrogen is cycled in the environment.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the role of microorganisms in nutrient cycling and their impact on the environment.

Microscopy is a fundamental tool in environmental microbiology, allowing us to observe and study microorganisms and their interactions with their environment. There are several types of microscopy, each with its own advantages and limitations. In this section, we will focus on two of the most commonly used microscopy techniques in environmental microbiology: light microscopy and electron microscopy.

##### Light Microscopy

Light microscopy, also known as optical microscopy, is a technique that uses visible light to observe and study biological samples. It is a powerful tool for studying the structure and behavior of microorganisms, as it allows us to observe their morphology, motility, and interactions with other organisms and their environment.

Light microscopes come in a variety of configurations, including bright-field, dark-field, and fluorescence microscopy. Each of these configurations provides different information about the sample. For example, bright-field microscopy is used to observe the general morphology and structure of cells, while dark-field microscopy is used to observe the motility of cells and the movement of particles within cells. Fluorescence microscopy, on the other hand, is used to observe specific molecules within cells, such as DNA or proteins, by staining them with fluorescent dyes.

##### Electron Microscopy

Electron microscopy (EM) is a technique that uses a beam of electrons to image and study biological samples. Unlike light microscopy, which uses visible light, electron microscopy uses electrons with much shorter wavelengths, allowing for much higher resolution imaging. This makes EM particularly useful for studying the fine details of cell structure and function.

There are two types of electron microscopy: scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). SEM is used to image the surface of samples, providing information about their topography and surface features. TEM, on the other hand, is used to image the internal structure of samples, providing information about their ultrastructure and the distribution of molecules within cells.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the principles and applications of these microscopy techniques in environmental microbiology.

#### 2.1b Spectroscopy

Spectroscopy is another powerful tool in environmental microbiology, allowing us to study the interactions between microorganisms and their environment at a molecular level. Spectroscopy involves the absorption, emission, or scattering of electromagnetic radiation by molecules, providing information about their structure, composition, and interactions.

##### Interferometric Scattering Microscopy (iSCAT)

Interferometric Scattering Microscopy (iSCAT) is a type of spectroscopy that has been used in multiple applications in environmental microbiology. iSCAT is a label-free imaging technique that provides high-resolution images of biological samples. It is particularly useful for studying the dynamics of biological processes, as it allows for the observation of rapid changes in cellular structure and function.

One of the key advantages of iSCAT is its ability to image live cells without the need for labeling or staining. This makes it a valuable tool for studying the behavior of microorganisms in their natural environment, without disturbing their natural processes.

##### Single-Cell Analysis

Single-cell analysis is a technique that involves the study of individual cells, rather than populations of cells. This is particularly important in environmental microbiology, as it allows us to understand the behavior and interactions of individual microorganisms.

Single-cell analysis can be performed using a variety of techniques, including microscopy, spectroscopy, and DNA sequencing. Each of these techniques provides different information about the cell, allowing us to build a comprehensive picture of its structure, function, and interactions.

##### Cell–Cell Interaction

Cell–cell interactions are a fundamental aspect of microbial life. These interactions can be stable, as in the case of symbiotic relationships, or transient, as in the case of predator-prey interactions. Understanding these interactions is crucial for understanding the dynamics of microbial communities.

Spectroscopic techniques, such as iSCAT and single-cell analysis, provide valuable insights into these interactions. By studying the interactions of individual cells, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of microbial communities.

These techniques are now commonplace in a number of diverse fields such as medicine, biological research, cancer research, drug testing, metallurgy, etc.

The advent of solid-state detectors has yielded several advantages, including higher resolution and sensitivity. Cryogenic cooling is also common, to minimize noise. Often, digital cameras used for this application provide pixel intensity data to a resolution of 12-16 bits, much higher than is used in consumer imaging products.

##### Image Acquisition

Image acquisition is typically done using a CCD camera mounted in the optical path of the microscope. The camera may be full color or monochrome. Very often, very high resolution cameras are employed to gain as much direct information as possible. Cryogenic cooling is also common, to minimize noise.

Until the early 1990s, most image acquisition in video microscopy applications was typically done with an analog video camera, often simply closed circuit TV cameras. While this required the use of a frame grabber to digitize the images, video cameras provided images at full video frame rate (25-30 frames per second) allowing live video recording and processing.

Today, acquisition is usually done using a CCD camera mounted in the optical path of the microscope. The camera may be full color or monochrome. Very often, very high resolution cameras are employed to gain as much direct information as possible. Cryogenic cooling is also common, to minimize noise. Often digital cameras used for this application provide pixel intensity data to a resolution of 12-16 bits, much higher than is used in consumer imaging products.

##### Image Processing and Analysis

Image processing and analysis is a crucial aspect of microscopy. It involves the use of digital image processing techniques to enhance the quality of images, extract useful information, and analyze the dynamics of microbial communities.

One of the key advantages of image processing and analysis is its ability to provide real-time information about the behavior and interactions of microorganisms. This allows us to study the dynamics of microbial communities, including the effects of environmental changes and the interactions between different species.

In conclusion, imaging techniques, including microscopy and image processing, are powerful tools in environmental microbiology. They allow us to observe and study the complex interactions between microorganisms and their environment, providing valuable insights into the structure, function, and dynamics of microbial communities.
