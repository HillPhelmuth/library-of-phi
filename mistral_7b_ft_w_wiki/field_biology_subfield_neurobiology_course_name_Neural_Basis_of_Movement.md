### Subsection 1.2b Applications in rehabilitation

The study of the neural basis of movement has significant applications in the field of rehabilitation. By understanding how movement is controlled and regulated by the nervous system, we can develop more effective rehabilitation strategies for individuals with movement disorders.

#### Telerehabilitation

Telerehabilitation, the use of telecommunication and information technologies to provide rehabilitation services, is one such application. Telerehabilitation has been particularly useful in the field of speech-language pathology, where the emphasis on auditory and visual communicative interaction between the client and the clinician lends itself well to this technology (Plain Old Telephone System – POTS).

Early applications of telerehabilitation in speech-language pathology involved the use of the telephone to treat patients with aphasia and motor speech disorders (Vaughan, 1976, Wertz, et al., 1987), a computer controlled video laserdisc over the telephone and a closed-circuit television system to assess speech and language disorders (Wertz et al., 1987), and a satellite-based videoconferencing system to assess patients in rural areas (Duffy, Werven & Aronson, 1997).

More recent applications have involved the use of sophisticated Internet-based videoconferencing systems with dedicated software which enable the assessment of language disorders, the treatment of language disorders, and the assessment and treatment of motor speech disorders (Hill, Theodoros, Russell, Cahill, Ward, Clark, 2006; Theodoros, Constantinescu, Russell, Ward, Wilson & Wootton, in press) following brain impairment and Parkinson's disease.

#### Rehabilitation of Movement Disorders

The study of the neural basis of movement also has significant implications for the rehabilitation of movement disorders. For instance, the SOGA2 gene, which is involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission, has been linked to various neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (SOGA2). Understanding the role of SOGA2 in these disorders could lead to the development of more effective rehabilitation strategies.

Similarly, the GPR17 gene, which is involved in the regulation of calcium signaling, has been proposed as a potential pharmacological target for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury in humans (GPR17). By studying the neural basis of movement, we can gain a better understanding of how these diseases affect our movement and potentially develop more effective rehabilitation strategies.

The neural basis of movement is also crucial for understanding the mechanisms of various diseases. For instance, the Musashi-2 (MIS2) gene, which is involved in the regulation of gene expression, has been found to be a potential cancer biomarker as well as a drug target (Musashi-2). By studying the neural basis of movement, we can gain insights into the mechanisms of various cancers and potentially develop more effective rehabilitation strategies.




### Subsection 1.2c Role in understanding human behavior

The study of the neural basis of movement is not only crucial for understanding how we move, but also for understanding human behavior in general. The neural mechanisms underlying movement are deeply intertwined with cognitive processes such as perception, attention, and decision-making. By studying these mechanisms, we can gain insights into how these cognitive processes work and how they are affected by various factors such as injury, disease, and aging.

#### Cognitive Processes and Movement

Cognitive processes play a crucial role in movement. For instance, perception and attention are necessary for us to perceive and attend to relevant information in our environment, which can then guide our movements. Decision-making is also involved in movement, as we often have to make choices about how to move or where to go.

The neural basis of these cognitive processes is closely tied to the neural basis of movement. For example, the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in decision-making, also plays a role in motor control. Similarly, the parietal cortex, which is involved in perception and attention, also plays a role in motor control.

#### Injury, Disease, and Aging

Injury, disease, and aging can all affect the neural mechanisms underlying movement and, consequently, human behavior. For instance, a brain injury can disrupt the neural networks involved in movement, leading to motor deficits. Similarly, diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's can affect these neural networks, leading to movement disorders and cognitive decline.

Aging can also affect the neural mechanisms underlying movement. As we age, our brains undergo changes that can affect these mechanisms, leading to declines in motor function and cognitive abilities.

#### Telerehabilitation and Understanding Human Behavior

Telerehabilitation, as discussed in the previous section, provides a unique opportunity to study human behavior in a controlled setting. By using telerehabilitation technologies, researchers can observe and analyze how individuals with movement disorders interact with their environment and how they make decisions about their movements. This can provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying movement and human behavior.

In conclusion, the study of the neural basis of movement is not only crucial for understanding how we move, but also for understanding human behavior in general. By studying the neural mechanisms underlying movement, we can gain insights into how cognitive processes work and how they are affected by various factors. Telerehabilitation technologies provide a unique opportunity to study these mechanisms in a controlled setting.
