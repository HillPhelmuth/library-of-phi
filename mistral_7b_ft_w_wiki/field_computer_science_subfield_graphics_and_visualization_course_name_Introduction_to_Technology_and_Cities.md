#### 10.1a ICT for Social Inclusion

Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have the potential to play a significant role in promoting social inclusion in urban environments. Social inclusion refers to the ability of individuals and groups to participate fully in society, regardless of their background or circumstances. In the context of urban environments, social inclusion is crucial for creating a cohesive and harmonious society, where all members have equal opportunities to participate and benefit from the city's resources.

ICTs can contribute to social inclusion in several ways. First, they can provide access to information and services that were previously inaccessible to certain groups. For instance, the internet can provide access to a vast array of information and services, including education, healthcare, and employment opportunities. This can be particularly beneficial for marginalized groups who may have limited access to these resources in traditional, offline settings.

Second, ICTs can facilitate communication and interaction between different groups. Social media platforms, for example, can be used to bridge social divides and promote dialogue and understanding between different communities. This can help to reduce social isolation and promote a sense of belonging and community.

Third, ICTs can be used to tailor services and resources to the specific needs and circumstances of different groups. For instance, mobile apps can be designed to provide personalized support and guidance for individuals with specific needs, such as those with disabilities or those facing social exclusion.

However, it is important to note that the use of ICTs for social inclusion is not without its challenges. One of the main challenges is the digital divide, which refers to the unequal access to ICTs and digital resources between different groups. This can exacerbate existing social inequalities and further marginalize certain groups.

To address this challenge, it is crucial to ensure that all members of the urban society have equal access to ICTs and digital resources. This includes providing affordable and reliable internet access, digital literacy training, and inclusive design of ICTs. Additionally, policies and regulations should be put in place to promote digital inclusion and prevent discrimination in the use of ICTs.

In conclusion, ICTs have the potential to play a significant role in promoting social inclusion in urban environments. However, to fully realize this potential, efforts must be made to address the digital divide and ensure that all members of the urban society have equal access to ICTs and digital resources.

#### 10.1b Challenges of ICT for Social Inclusion

Despite the potential of ICTs to promote social inclusion, there are several challenges that need to be addressed. These challenges can be broadly categorized into three areas: accessibility, affordability, and digital literacy.

##### Accessibility

The first challenge is ensuring the accessibility of ICTs. As mentioned in the previous section, the digital divide refers to the unequal access to ICTs and digital resources between different groups. This can be due to a variety of factors, including geographical location, socio-economic status, and disability. For instance, individuals living in rural areas may have limited access to the internet due to poor infrastructure, while low-income individuals may struggle to afford internet access and devices. Similarly, individuals with certain disabilities may face barriers to using ICTs due to a lack of assistive technologies or digital accessibility features.

To address these issues, it is crucial to promote universal design principles in the development of ICTs. Universal design refers to the design of products and environments that are usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. This includes designing ICTs that are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their location, socio-economic status, or disability.

##### Affordability

The second challenge is affordability. Even when ICTs are accessible, many individuals may still be unable to access them due to cost barriers. For instance, the cost of internet access, devices, and digital services can be prohibitive for low-income individuals and families. This can limit their ability to fully participate in digital society and access the benefits of ICTs.

To address this challenge, it is important to promote affordable access to ICTs. This can be achieved through various means, such as subsidies, public-private partnerships, and community-based initiatives. For instance, governments can provide subsidies for low-income individuals to access the internet or devices, while private companies can partner with community organizations to provide digital literacy training and access to digital resources.

##### Digital Literacy

The third challenge is digital literacy. Even when ICTs are accessible and affordable, many individuals may still struggle to use them due to a lack of digital literacy skills. Digital literacy refers to the ability to use digital technologies effectively and safely. This includes skills such as navigating the internet, using digital devices, and managing digital information.

To address this challenge, it is crucial to promote digital literacy education and training. This can be achieved through formal education programs, community-based initiatives, and online learning platforms. By equipping individuals with the necessary digital literacy skills, we can ensure that they can fully participate in digital society and access the benefits of ICTs.

In conclusion, while ICTs have the potential to promote social inclusion, there are several challenges that need to be addressed to ensure that all individuals have equal access to and benefit from these technologies. By promoting universal design, affordable access, and digital literacy, we can create a more inclusive and equitable digital society.

#### 10.1c Case Studies of ICT for Social Inclusion

In this section, we will explore some case studies that highlight the successful implementation of ICTs for social inclusion. These case studies will provide practical examples of how ICTs can be used to address the challenges of accessibility, affordability, and digital literacy.

##### Case Study 1: Universal Design in Smart Cities

The concept of smart cities, where technology is used to improve the quality of life for its citizens, provides a unique opportunity to implement universal design principles. For instance, the city of Barcelona has implemented a smart city platform that provides a range of services, including transportation, energy management, and waste management. This platform is designed with universal design principles in mind, ensuring that it is accessible to all citizens, regardless of their location, socio-economic status, or disability[^1^].

##### Case Study 2: Affordable Internet Access in Developing Countries

In developing countries, the cost of internet access can be a significant barrier to accessing ICTs. However, initiatives such as the Google Station in India have successfully provided affordable internet access to low-income individuals. The Google Station provides high-speed internet access at affordable prices, making it accessible to a wider population[^2^].

##### Case Study 3: Digital Literacy Training in Rural Communities

Digital literacy training is crucial for individuals who may struggle to use ICTs due to a lack of digital literacy skills. For instance, the Digital Literacy Program in rural India has successfully provided digital literacy training to over 10 million individuals. This program has been implemented through a public-private partnership, with the government providing the curriculum and infrastructure, and private companies providing the training[^3^].

These case studies demonstrate the potential of ICTs to promote social inclusion. By addressing the challenges of accessibility, affordability, and digital literacy, we can ensure that all individuals have equal access to the benefits of ICTs.

#### 10.1b Smart Social Inclusion Solutions

Smart city initiatives, which leverage information and communication technologies (ICTs) to improve the efficiency and sustainability of urban environments, can also play a crucial role in promoting social inclusion. These initiatives can be designed to address the specific needs and circumstances of different groups, thereby promoting equal access to resources and opportunities.

One such initiative is the concept of self-sovereign identity (SSI), a value-laden technology that aims to give individuals control over their digital identities. SSI operates on the principle of decentralization, where individuals have direct control over their digital identities, rather than relying on centralized institutions. This can be particularly beneficial for marginalized groups who may have limited access to traditional identity documents or face challenges in navigating bureaucratic systems.

However, the implementation of SSI can vary significantly, embedding different goals, agendas, and intentions into the technology. This can lead to semantic confusion, as the term "self-sovereign identity" may create expectations that individuals have absolute control and ownership over their digital identities, akin to physical possessions. In reality, SSI involves complex technical infrastructure, interactions with identity issuers and verifiers, and compliance with legal frameworks. Therefore, it is crucial to educate individuals about the true nature of SSI and manage their expectations.

Another concern with SSI is digital literacy. Critics argue that SSI may exacerbate social inequalities and exclude those with limited access to technology or digital literacy. SSI assumes reliable internet connectivity, access to compatible devices, and proficiency in navigating digital systems. Consequently, marginalized populations, including the elderly, individuals in developing regions, or those with limited technological resources, may face exclusion and reduced access to the benefits of SSI.

To address these concerns, it is essential to consider the digital inclusion of marginalized groups in the design and implementation of SSI. This can be achieved through initiatives such as the Australian Government's National Closing the Gap target for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to have equal levels of digital inclusion by 2026. Additionally, tools such as the Australian Digital Inclusion Index (ADII) can be used to measure digital inclusion and guide policy and practice.

In conclusion, smart social inclusion solutions, such as SSI, have the potential to promote social inclusion in urban environments. However, it is crucial to consider the potential challenges and inequalities that may arise from their implementation and take steps to address them.

#### 10.1c Future Trends in ICT and Social Inclusion

As we move further into the digital age, the role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in promoting social inclusion is expected to grow even more significant. The future trends in ICT and social inclusion are likely to be shaped by several key factors, including advancements in technology, changes in societal attitudes, and policy interventions.

Advancements in technology are expected to play a crucial role in promoting social inclusion. For instance, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies could potentially address some of the challenges associated with self-sovereign identity (SSI). AI could be used to simplify the process of interacting with identity issuers and verifiers, thereby reducing the digital literacy requirements for SSI. Additionally, AI could be used to personalize the SSI experience, making it more accessible and user-friendly for marginalized groups.

Changes in societal attitudes are also likely to influence the future of ICT and social inclusion. As society becomes more comfortable with digital identities and digital transactions, the stigma associated with not having a digital identity may decrease. This could potentially reduce the exclusion faced by those who lack access to traditional identity documents or face challenges in navigating bureaucratic systems.

Policy interventions are also expected to play a crucial role in promoting social inclusion through ICT. Governments around the world are increasingly recognizing the importance of digital inclusion in promoting social equity. For instance, the Australian Government has set a National Closing the Gap target for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to have equal levels of digital inclusion by 2026. Similarly, other governments are likely to introduce policies and initiatives to promote digital inclusion and reduce social exclusion.

In conclusion, the future trends in ICT and social inclusion are likely to be shaped by advancements in technology, changes in societal attitudes, and policy interventions. These trends could potentially lead to a more inclusive and equitable urban society, where all individuals have equal access to resources and opportunities.

#### 10.2a ICT and Urban Governance

Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have the potential to revolutionize urban governance, providing new tools and platforms for city administrations to engage with their citizens, address urban challenges, and improve the quality of life for all residents. This section will explore the role of ICT in urban governance, focusing on the concept of smart governance and the challenges and opportunities it presents.

Smart governance refers to the use of ICT to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency of government operations. It involves the use of data, analytics, and digital technologies to improve decision-making, service delivery, and citizen engagement. In the context of urban governance, smart governance can help city administrations to better understand the needs and preferences of their citizens, identify and address urban challenges, and deliver more efficient and effective services.

One of the key benefits of smart governance is the potential to improve citizen engagement. ICT can provide new channels for citizens to voice their opinions, report issues, and participate in decision-making processes. For instance, social media platforms can be used to solicit feedback from citizens, while mobile apps can be used to report issues such as potholes or graffiti. This not only allows citizens to have a more active role in shaping their city, but also helps to build trust and accountability between the government and its citizens.

However, the implementation of smart governance also presents several challenges. One of the main challenges is the digital divide, which refers to the unequal access to ICT and digital resources between different groups. This can exacerbate existing social inequalities and exclude certain groups from the benefits of smart governance. For instance, marginalized communities or those with limited access to technology may be left behind in the digital transformation of urban governance.

Another challenge is the potential for privacy and security breaches. The use of ICT in governance involves the collection and processing of large amounts of personal data, which can be vulnerable to misuse or abuse. This raises important ethical and legal considerations, particularly in the context of self-sovereign identity (SSI), where individuals have direct control over their digital identities. As discussed in the previous section, SSI involves complex technical infrastructure and interactions with identity issuers and verifiers, which can create semantic confusion and raise concerns about digital literacy and exclusion.

In conclusion, ICT has the potential to transform urban governance, providing new tools and platforms for city administrations to engage with their citizens, address urban challenges, and improve the quality of life for all residents. However, the successful implementation of smart governance requires careful consideration of the potential challenges and opportunities it presents, including the digital divide and privacy and security concerns.

#### 10.2b ICT and Urban Policy Making

Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have a profound impact on urban policy making. The use of ICT in policy making can be traced back to the 1960s when the United States government initiated the use of computer-based systems for policy analysis and decision making[^1^]. Since then, ICT has evolved significantly, and its application in urban policy making has become more complex and comprehensive.

One of the key benefits of ICT in policy making is the ability to leverage data and analytics for informed decision making. With the advent of smart cities, urban administrations have access to vast amounts of data from various sources such as sensors, mobile devices, and social media. This data can be used to identify patterns and trends, inform policy decisions, and measure the effectiveness of policies[^2^]. For instance, data from sensors can be used to optimize traffic flow, while data from social media can provide insights into public sentiment and preferences.

However, the use of ICT in policy making also presents several challenges. One of the main challenges is the need for policy makers to understand and interpret the vast amount of data available to them. This requires a high level of digital literacy and the ability to critically evaluate the reliability and relevance of data. Additionally, the use of ICT in policy making can exacerbate existing social inequalities if certain groups are excluded from the digital realm[^3^].

Another challenge is the potential for privacy and security breaches. The use of ICT in policy making involves the collection and processing of large amounts of personal data, which can be vulnerable to misuse or abuse. This raises important ethical and legal considerations, particularly in the context of self-sovereign identity (SSI), where individuals have direct control over their digital identities[^4^].

In conclusion, ICT has the potential to revolutionize urban policy making, providing new tools and platforms for policy makers to engage with their citizens, address urban challenges, and improve the quality of life for all residents. However, the successful implementation of ICT in policy making requires careful consideration of the potential challenges and opportunities it presents.

Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have the potential to play a significant role in promoting citizen engagement in social inclusion. By leveraging the power of technology, citizens can be actively involved in decision-making processes, policy formulation, and implementation, thereby ensuring that their needs and concerns are addressed.

One of the key ways in which ICTs can facilitate citizen engagement is through the use of self-sovereign identity (SSI). As discussed in the previous section, SSI is a technology that aims to give individuals control over their digital identities. By implementing SSI, citizens can have a direct say in how their digital identities are managed and used, thereby promoting a sense of agency and empowerment.

However, the implementation of SSI can vary significantly, embedding different goals, agendas, and intentions into the technology. This can lead to semantic confusion, as the term "self-sovereign identity" may create expectations that individuals have absolute control and ownership over their digital identities, akin to physical possessions. In reality, SSI involves complex technical infrastructure, interactions with identity issuers and verifiers, and compliance with legal frameworks. Therefore, it is crucial to educate citizens about the true nature of SSI and manage their expectations.

Another concern with SSI is digital literacy. Critics argue that SSI may exacerbate social inequalities and exclude those with limited access to technology or digital literacy. SSI assumes reliable internet connectivity, access to compatible devices, and proficiency in navigating digital systems. Consequently, marginalized populations, including the elderly, individuals in developing regions, or those with limited technological resources, may face exclusion and reduced access to the benefits of SSI.

To address these concerns, it is important to ensure that digital literacy programs are in place to support those who may struggle with SSI. Additionally, efforts should be made to ensure that SSI is accessible and user-friendly for all citizens, regardless of their technological resources or proficiency.

In conclusion, ICTs, particularly SSI, have the potential to promote citizen engagement in social inclusion. However, it is crucial to address the concerns of implementation and digital literacy to ensure that all citizens have equal access to the benefits of ICTs.

## Types

Several frameworks have been proposed for defining types of innovation.

### Sustaining vs disruptive innovation

One framework proposed by Clayton Christensen draws a distinction between sustaining and disruptive innovations. Sustaining innovation is the improvement of a product or service based on the known needs of current customers (e.g. faster microprocessors, flat screen televisions). Disruptive innovation in contrast refers to a process by which a new product or service creates a new market (e.g. transistor radio, free crowdsourced encyclopedia, etc.), eventually displacing established competitors. According to Christensen, disruptive innovations are critical to long-term success in business.

Disruptive innovation is often enabled by disruptive technology. Marco Iansiti and Karim R. Lakhani define foundational technology as having the potential to create new foundations for global technology systems over the longer term. Foundational technology tends to transform business operating models as entirely new business models emerge over many years, with gradual antecedents in the technology.

### Disruptive innovation

Disruptive innovation is a process that creates a new market and value network, eventually disrupting an existing market and replacing an existing product (or service) with a new one. The process of disruptive innovation is often driven by the introduction of a new technology that enables the creation of a new product or service. This new product or service is typically targeted at a niche market that is not profitable enough to attract the attention of existing market leaders. However, as the new product or service gains acceptance in the market, it begins to disrupt the existing market, eventually overtaking it.

Disruptive innovation is often associated with the concept of "creative destruction," a term coined by economist Joseph Schumpeter. Creative destruction refers to the process by which new products or services replace old ones, leading to the destruction of existing markets and the creation of new ones. This process is a key driver of economic growth and innovation.

### Smart Innovation Solutions

Smart Innovation Solutions (SIS) is a concept that combines the principles of disruptive innovation with the use of information and communication technologies (ICT). SIS leverages the power of ICT to create innovative solutions that disrupt existing markets and create new ones. These solutions are often based on the use of disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, big data analytics, and blockchain.

SIS is a key driver of urban innovation. By leveraging the power of ICT, cities can create innovative solutions that address a wide range of urban challenges, from improving public services to enhancing the quality of life for residents. These solutions can be used to create smart cities, where ICT is used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of urban systems, leading to better services for residents and a more sustainable urban environment.

In the following sections, we will explore the role of SIS in urban innovation, focusing on the use of ICT to create disruptive solutions that transform urban environments. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with SIS, and how cities can navigate these to successfully implement SIS and drive urban innovation.

## Applications and examples

<Quotation|Urban computing is a process of acquisition, integration, and analysis of big and heterogeneous data generated by a diversity of sources in urban spaces, such as sensors, devices, vehicles, buildings, and human, to tackle the major issues that cities face. Urban computing connects unobtrusive and ubiquitous sensing technologies, advanced data management and analytics models, and novel visualization methods, to create win-win-win solutions that improve urban environment, human life quality, and city operation systems.|Yu Zheng|Urban Computing with Big Data>

### Cultural archiving

Cities are more than a collection of places and people - places are continually reinvented and re-imagined by the people occupying them. As such, the prevalence of computing in urban spaces leads people to supplement their physical reality with what is virtually available. Toward this end, researchers engaged in ethnography, collective memory, and public history have leveraged urban computing strategies to introduce platforms that enable people to share their interpretation of the urban environment. Examples of such projects include CLIO—an urban computing system that came out of the Collective City Memory of Oulu study—which "allows people to share personal memories, context annotate them and relate them with city landmarks, thus creating the collective city memory." and the Cleveland Historical project which aims to create a shared history of the city by allowing people to contribute stories through their own digital devices.

### Energy consumption

# Urban computing

### Transportation

One of the major application areas of urban computing is to improve private and public transportation in a city. The primary sources of data are floating car data (data about where cars are at a given moment). This includes individual GPS’s, taxi GPS’s, WiFI signals, loop sensors, and (for some applications) user input.
Urban computing can help select better driving routes, which is important for applications like Waze, Google Maps, and trip planning. Wang et al. built a system to get real-time travel time estimates. They solve the problems: one, not all road segments will have data from GPS in the last 30 minutes or ever; two, some paths will be covered by several car records, and it’s necessary to combine those records to create the most accurate estimate of travel time; and three, a city can have tens of thousands of road segments and an infinite amount of paths to be queried, so providing an instantaneous real time estimate must be scalable. They used various techniques and tested it out on 32670 taxis over two months in Beijing, and accurately estimated travel time to within 25 seconds of error per kilometer.

Bicycle counters are an example of computing technology to count the number of cyclists at a certain spot in order to help urban planning with reliable data.

Uber is an on-demand taxi-like service where users can request rides with their smartphone. By using the data of the active riders and drivers, Uber can price discriminate based on the current rider/driver ratio. This lets them earn more money than they would without “surge pricing,” and helps get more drivers out on the street in unpopular working hours.

Urban computing can also improve public transportation cheaply. A University of Washington group developed OneBusAway, which uses public bus GPS data to provide real-time bus information to riders. Placing displays at bus stops to give information is expensive, but developing several interfaces (apps, website
