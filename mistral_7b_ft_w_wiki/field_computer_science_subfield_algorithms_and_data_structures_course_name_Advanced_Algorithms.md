## Chapter 1: Network Flows:

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the concept of network flows, a fundamental topic in the field of algorithms. Network flows are a crucial aspect of many real-world problems, such as transportation and communication networks, supply chains, and resource allocation. Understanding and solving network flow problems is essential for optimizing these systems and making them more efficient.

We will begin by defining what network flows are and how they are represented.

We will also discuss the various algorithms used to solve these problems, such as the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm and the shortest path algorithm.

Throughout this chapter, we will use mathematical notation to describe and analyze network flow problems. For example, we will use the notation $G = (V, E)$ to represent a directed graph, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges. We will also use the notation $f(u, v)$ to represent the flow from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of network flows and the algorithms used to solve them. You will also be able to apply this knowledge to real-world problems and optimize network systems for maximum efficiency. So let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of network flows.




### Section 1.1 Ahuja, R. K., T. L. Magnanti, and J. B. Orlin. Network Flows: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications:

#### 1.1a Introduction to Network Flows

Network flows are a fundamental concept in the field of algorithms, with applications in a wide range of areas such as transportation, communication, and supply chain management. In this section, we will introduce the basic concepts of network flows, including flow networks, commodities, and flow variables. We will also discuss the four constraints that must be satisfied in a network flow problem.

#### Flow Networks

A flow network is a directed graph $G(V,E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges. Each edge $(u,v) \in E$ has a capacity $c(u,v)$, which represents the maximum amount of flow that can pass through the edge. The flow network also includes source and sink nodes, which are designated as $s_i$ and $t_i$ for each commodity $i$.

#### Commodities

A commodity $K_i=(s_i,t_i,d_i)$ in a flow network is defined by its source and sink nodes, $s_i$ and $t_i$, and its demand $d_i$. The demand represents the amount of flow that must be sent from the source to the sink.

#### Flow Variables

The variable $f_i(u,v)$ represents the fraction of flow $i$ that passes through edge $(u,v)$. This variable can take values in the interval $[0,1]$ if the flow can be split among multiple paths, or it can be binary ($f_i(u,v) \in \{0,1\}$) if the flow must follow a single path.

#### Constraints

The four constraints that must be satisfied in a network flow problem are:

1. Link capacity: The sum of all flows routed over a link does not exceed its capacity.
2. Flow conservation on transit nodes: The amount of a flow entering an intermediate node $u$ is the same that exits the node.
3. Flow conservation at the source: A flow must exit its source node completely.
4. Flow conservation at the destination: A flow must enter its sink node completely.

These constraints ensure that the flow network operates in a feasible manner, with no more flow entering a node than leaving it, and with all flow reaching its destination.

#### Corresponding Optimization Problems

The network flow problem can be formulated as an optimization problem, with the goal of minimizing the maximum utilization $U_{max}$ or the sum of the squares of the utilizations $\sum_{u,v\in V} (U(u,v))^2$. These optimization problems can be solved using various algorithms, such as the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or the shortest path algorithm.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the different types of network flow problems, including the maximum flow problem, the minimum cost flow problem, and the multi-commodity flow problem. We will also discuss the algorithms used to solve these problems in more detail.

#### 1.1b Flow Networks and Commodities

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of flow networks and commodities. In this section, we will delve deeper into the definition of commodities and how they interact with the flow network.

#### Commodities

A commodity $K_i=(s_i,t_i,d_i)$ in a flow network is defined by its source and sink nodes, $s_i$ and $t_i$, and its demand $d_i$. The demand represents the amount of flow that must be sent from the source to the sink. 

The flow variables $f_i(u,v)$ represent the fraction of flow $i$ that passes through edge $(u,v)$. This variable can take values in the interval $[0,1]$ if the flow can be split among multiple paths, or it can be binary ($f_i(u,v) \in \{0,1\}$) if the flow must follow a single path.

#### Flow Conservation

The flow conservation constraints ensure that the flow network operates in a feasible manner. The first constraint, link capacity, ensures that the sum of all flows routed over a link does not exceed its capacity. This constraint is represented mathematically as:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i(u,v) \leq c(u,v)
$$

for all edges $(u,v) \in E$.

The second constraint, flow conservation on transit nodes, ensures that the amount of a flow entering an intermediate node $u$ is the same that exits the node. This constraint is represented mathematically as:

$$
\sum_{v \in V} f_i(u,v) = \sum_{v \in V} f_i(v,u)
$$

for all nodes $u \in V \setminus \{s_i, t_i\}$ and all commodities $i$.

The third constraint, flow conservation at the source, ensures that a flow must exit its source node completely. This constraint is represented mathematically as:

$$
\sum_{v \in V} f_i(s_i,v) = d_i
$$

for all commodities $i$.

The fourth constraint, flow conservation at the destination, ensures that a flow must enter its sink node completely. This constraint is represented mathematically as:

$$
\sum_{v \in V} f_i(v,t_i) = d_i
$$

for all commodities $i$.

#### Corresponding Optimization Problems

The network flow problem can be formulated as an optimization problem, with the goal of minimizing the maximum utilization $U_{max}$ or the sum of the squares of the utilizations $\sum_{u,v\in V} (U(u,v))^2$. These optimization problems can be solved using various algorithms, such as the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or the shortest path algorithm.

In the next section, we will explore these algorithms in more detail and discuss how they can be used to solve the network flow problem.

#### 1.1c Flow Variables and Constraints

In the previous sections, we have introduced the concept of flow networks, commodities, and the flow conservation constraints. In this section, we will delve deeper into the flow variables and the constraints they must satisfy.

#### Flow Variables

The flow variables $f_i(u,v)$ represent the fraction of flow $i$ that passes through edge $(u,v)$. These variables are crucial in determining the path that a flow takes through the network. They can take values in the interval $[0,1]$ if the flow can be split among multiple paths, or they can be binary ($f_i(u,v) \in \{0,1\}$) if the flow must follow a single path.

#### Constraints on Flow Variables

The flow variables must satisfy certain constraints to ensure the feasibility of the flow network. These constraints are derived from the flow conservation constraints discussed in the previous section.

The first constraint, link capacity, ensures that the sum of all flows routed over a link does not exceed its capacity. This constraint can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i(u,v) \leq c(u,v)
$$

for all edges $(u,v) \in E$.

The second constraint, flow conservation on transit nodes, ensures that the amount of a flow entering an intermediate node $u$ is the same that exits the node. This constraint can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\sum_{v \in V} f_i(u,v) = \sum_{v \in V} f_i(v,u)
$$

for all nodes $u \in V \setminus \{s_i, t_i\}$ and all commodities $i$.

The third constraint, flow conservation at the source, ensures that a flow must exit its source node completely. This constraint can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\sum_{v \in V} f_i(s_i,v) = d_i
$$

for all commodities $i$.

The fourth constraint, flow conservation at the destination, ensures that a flow must enter its sink node completely. This constraint can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\sum_{v \in V} f_i(v,t_i) = d_i
$$

for all commodities $i$.

These constraints ensure that the flow network operates in a feasible manner, with no more flow entering a node than leaving it, and with all flow reaching its destination.

#### 1.1d Optimization Problems

The network flow problem can be formulated as an optimization problem, with the goal of minimizing the maximum utilization $U_{max}$ or the sum of the squares of the utilizations $\sum_{u,v\in V} (U(u,v))^2$. These optimization problems can be solved using various algorithms, such as the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or the shortest path algorithm.

The optimization problem can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\min_{f_i(u,v)} \max_{u,v \in V} U(u,v)
$$

or

$$
\min_{f_i(u,v)} \sum_{u,v \in V} (U(u,v))^2
$$

where $U(u,v)$ is the utilization of edge $(u,v)$, defined as the sum of all flows routed over the edge divided by its capacity.

The optimization problem aims to find the assignment of flow variables that minimizes the maximum utilization or the sum of the squares of the utilizations. This is achieved by satisfying the flow conservation constraints and the link capacity constraint.

In the next section, we will discuss the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, a popular algorithm for solving the network flow problem.




### Section 1.1b Theory of Network Flows

#### 1.1b.1 Flow in Networks

The theory of network flows is a mathematical framework for understanding how resources, such as data or physical goods, move through a network. It is a fundamental concept in the field of algorithms, with applications in a wide range of areas such as transportation, communication, and supply chain management.

In the context of network flows, a network is represented as a directed graph $G(V,E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges. Each edge $(u,v) \in E$ has a capacity $c(u,v)$, which represents the maximum amount of flow that can pass through the edge. The flow network also includes source and sink nodes, which are designated as $s_i$ and $t_i$ for each commodity $i$.

#### 1.1b.2 Commodities and Flow Variables

A commodity $K_i=(s_i,t_i,d_i)$ in a flow network is defined by its source and sink nodes, $s_i$ and $t_i$, and its demand $d_i$. The demand represents the amount of flow that must be sent from the source to the sink.

The variable $f_i(u,v)$ represents the fraction of flow $i$ that passes through edge $(u,v)$. This variable can take values in the interval $[0,1]$ if the flow can be split among multiple paths, or it can be binary ($f_i(u,v) \in \{0,1\}$) if the flow must follow a single path.

#### 1.1b.3 Constraints

The four constraints that must be satisfied in a network flow problem are:

1. Link capacity: The sum of all flows routed over a link does not exceed its capacity.
2. Flow conservation on transit nodes: The amount of a flow entering an intermediate node $u$ is the same that exits the node.
3. Flow conservation at the source: A flow must exit its source node completely.
4. Flow conservation at the destination: A flow must enter its sink node completely.

These constraints ensure that the flow network operates within its capacity and that the flow is conserved at each node.

#### 1.1b.4 Applications of Network Flow Theory

The theory of network flows has a wide range of applications. In transportation networks, it can be used to optimize traffic flow and minimize congestion. In communication networks, it can be used to optimize data transmission and minimize delays. In supply chain networks, it can be used to optimize the movement of goods and minimize costs.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the algorithms used to solve network flow problems.




### Section: 1.1c Algorithms for Network Flows

#### 1.1c.1 Introduction to Algorithms for Network Flows

The theory of network flows is a powerful tool for understanding how resources move through a network. However, to apply this theory in practice, we need efficient algorithms for solving network flow problems. These algorithms are the focus of this section.

#### 1.1c.2 The Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem

One of the most important algorithms for network flows is the Max-Flow Min-Cut theorem. This theorem provides a method for finding the maximum flow in a network, which is the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from the source to the sink without violating the capacity of any edge.

The Max-Flow Min-Cut theorem is based on the concept of a cut, which is a set of edges that, when removed, disconnects the source from the sink. The theorem states that the maximum flow in a network is equal to the minimum cut. This means that to find the maximum flow, we can simply find the minimum cut and use it to construct the maximum flow.

#### 1.1c.3 The Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm

The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm for finding the maximum flow in a network. It is based on the Max-Flow Min-Cut theorem and is one of the most efficient algorithms for this problem.

The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm starts with an initial flow of 0 and then iteratively increases the flow along a path from the source to the sink until no more increase is possible. This process is repeated until the maximum flow is reached.

#### 1.1c.4 The Remez Algorithm

The Remez algorithm is another important algorithm for network flows. It is used for solving the multi-commodity flow problem, which is a generalization of the single-commodity flow problem.

The Remez algorithm is based on the concept of a flow decomposition, which is a way of decomposing the flow of a commodity into smaller flows along different paths. This algorithm uses this decomposition to solve the multi-commodity flow problem efficiently.

#### 1.1c.5 The KHOPCA Clustering Algorithm

The KHOPCA clustering algorithm is a variant of the Remez algorithm that is used for solving the multi-commodity flow problem in static networks. It has been shown that this algorithm terminates after a finite number of state transitions and provides a solution to the multi-commodity flow problem.

#### 1.1c.6 Conclusion

In this section, we have introduced some of the most important algorithms for network flows. These algorithms are essential tools for solving network flow problems in practice and are the foundation for many applications in areas such as transportation, communication, and supply chain management. In the next section, we will delve deeper into the theory of network flows and explore some of the key concepts and principles that underpin these algorithms.
