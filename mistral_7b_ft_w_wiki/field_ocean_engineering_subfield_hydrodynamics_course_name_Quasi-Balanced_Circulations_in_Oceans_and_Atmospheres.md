# Title: Quasi-Balanced Circulations in Oceans and Atmospheres: A Comprehensive Guide":

## Foreward

Welcome to "Quasi-Balanced Circulations in Oceans and Atmospheres: A Comprehensive Guide". This book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamics of quasi-balanced circulations in the oceans and atmosphere. As we delve into the intricacies of these circulations, we will explore the role of eddy saturation and eddy compensation in the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) and the Atlantic Convection Circulation (ACC).

The MOC, driven primarily by wind forcing, exhibits a near independence to the increase of wind stress, a phenomenon known as eddy compensation. This is in contrast to the ACC, which is fully eddy saturated but only partially eddy compensated. The degree to which there is eddy compensation in the Southern Ocean is currently unknown, and it is hypothesized that the ACC is fully eddy saturated, but only partially eddy compensated.

To understand these dynamics, we will examine the effect of eddy saturation and eddy compensation in the ACC and MOC using eddy permitting and eddy resolving models. The resolution of these models is of great importance, and idealized studies have shown that the MOC response is more sensitive to model resolution than the ACC transport.

Observations in the oceans do not have a high enough resolution to fully estimate the degree of eddy saturation and eddy compensation. However, through the use of these models and idealized studies, we can gain a deeper understanding of these phenomena.

In this book, we will also explore the role of convection and entrainment in the Labrador Sea in the formation of Labrador Sea Water (LSW). This process is crucial in the production of LSW, which is a key component of the MOC.

As we journey through this book, we will also discuss the implications of these dynamics for climate change. The MOC plays a crucial role in the global climate system, and any changes in its dynamics could have significant implications for global climate patterns.

I hope this book will serve as a valuable resource for students and researchers alike, providing a comprehensive guide to the complex dynamics of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. Let us embark on this journey together, exploring the fascinating world of quasi-balanced circulations.

### Subsection 1.1a Definition of Quasi-Balanced Flow

Quasi-balanced flow is a fundamental concept in the study of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. It refers to a state of flow where the effects of rotation and stratification are balanced, resulting in a simplified description of the flow. This concept is particularly useful in the study of large-scale circulations, where the effects of rotation and stratification are dominant.

The quasi-balanced flow is governed by the quasi-geostrophic balance, which is a simplified form of the geostrophic balance. The quasi-geostrophic balance is based on the assumption that the flow is nearly parallel to the isobars or isopycnals, and that the Coriolis parameter is constant. This allows us to neglect the vertical component of the Coriolis force and the vertical gradient of the Coriolis parameter.

The quasi-geostrophic balance can be expressed mathematically as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + J(\eta, \psi) &= 0, \\
\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} + H(\eta) &= 0,
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\eta$ is the potential vorticity, $\psi$ is the stream function, $J$ is the Jacobian operator, and $H$ is the horizontal gradient operator.

The quasi-geostrophic balance is a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of quasi-balanced flows. It allows us to simplify the equations of motion and to derive important results, such as the conservation of potential vorticity and the geostrophic balance. However, it is important to note that the quasi-geostrophic balance is an approximation, and it may not hold in all situations. In particular, it may not hold in regions of strong curvature or in the presence of strong vertical gradients.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of the quasi-geostrophic balance for the dynamics of quasi-balanced flows. We will also discuss the role of the quasi-geostrophic balance in the study of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres.




#### 1.1b Conservation Principles

Conservation principles are fundamental to the study of quasi-balanced flows. These principles are based on the laws of physics and provide a framework for understanding the behavior of quasi-balanced flows. In this section, we will discuss the conservation principles that are most relevant to quasi-balanced flows.

##### Conservation of Mass

The principle of conservation of mass states that the mass of a system remains constant unless it is added or removed by external forces. In the context of quasi-balanced flows, this principle can be expressed mathematically as follows:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0,
$$

where $\rho$ is the density, $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity vector, and $\nabla \cdot$ denotes the divergence operator. This equation states that the rate of change of mass in a volume is equal to the net mass flux out of the volume.

##### Conservation of Momentum

The principle of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of a system remains constant unless it is changed by external forces. In the context of quasi-balanced flows, this principle can be expressed mathematically as follows:

$$
\frac{\partial (\rho \mathbf{u})}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u} \mathbf{u} + p\mathbf{I}) = \rho \mathbf{g} + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma},
$$

where $p$ is the pressure, $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix, $\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration vector, and $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is the stress tensor. This equation states that the rate of change of momentum in a volume is equal to the net force acting on the volume.

##### Conservation of Energy

The principle of conservation of energy states that the total energy of a system remains constant unless it is changed by external forces. In the context of quasi-balanced flows, this principle can be expressed mathematically as follows:

$$
\frac{\partial (\rho e)}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u} e + p\mathbf{u}) = \rho \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{g} + \nabla \cdot (\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{u}) - \nabla \cdot (\kappa \nabla T),
$$

where $e$ is the total energy per unit mass, $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity, and $T$ is the temperature. This equation states that the rate of change of energy in a volume is equal to the net energy flux out of the volume.

These conservation principles provide a powerful framework for understanding the behavior of quasi-balanced flows. They allow us to derive important results, such as the conservation of potential vorticity and the geostrophic balance, and to understand the implications of these results for the dynamics of quasi-balanced flows. However, it is important to note that these principles are based on assumptions about the nature of the flow, and they may not hold in all situations. In particular, they may not hold in regions of strong curvature or in the presence of strong vertical gradients.

#### 1.1c Applications of Quasi-Balanced Flow

Quasi-balanced flow is a fundamental concept in the study of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. It is a simplified model that allows us to understand the behavior of large-scale flows in a more manageable way. In this section, we will discuss some of the applications of quasi-balanced flow in the study of circulations in oceans and atmospheres.

##### Oceanic and Atmospheric Circulations

Quasi-balanced flow is used to study large-scale circulations in oceans and atmospheres. These circulations are driven by a variety of forces, including wind, pressure gradients, and the Coriolis effect. The quasi-balanced flow model allows us to understand the behavior of these circulations in a simplified way, by neglecting certain terms in the equations of motion. This simplification is possible because the quasi-balanced flow model assumes that the flow is nearly parallel to the isobars or isopycnals, and that the Coriolis parameter is constant.

##### Geostrophic Balance

The quasi-balanced flow model is used to derive the geostrophic balance, which is a fundamental principle in the study of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. The geostrophic balance states that the Coriolis force is balanced by the pressure gradient force in a quasi-balanced flow. This balance is expressed mathematically as follows:

$$
f \times \mathbf{u} = -\nabla p,
$$

where $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity vector, and $\nabla p$ is the pressure gradient vector. The geostrophic balance is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of quasi-balanced flows, as it allows us to derive important results, such as the conservation of potential vorticity.

##### Potential Vorticity Conservation

The quasi-balanced flow model is used to derive the conservation of potential vorticity, which is a fundamental principle in the study of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. The potential vorticity is defined as the ratio of the absolute vorticity to the depth of the fluid layer. In a quasi-balanced flow, the potential vorticity is conserved along the flow lines. This conservation is expressed mathematically as follows:

$$
\frac{D}{Dt} \left( \frac{f}{h} \right) = 0,
$$

where $D/Dt$ is the material derivative, $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, and $h$ is the depth of the fluid layer. The conservation of potential vorticity is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of quasi-balanced flows, as it allows us to understand the formation of eddies and the evolution of large-scale circulations.

In conclusion, the quasi-balanced flow model is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. It allows us to derive important principles, such as the geostrophic balance and the conservation of potential vorticity, which are fundamental to the study of these circulations.




#### 1.1c Applications in Oceanography and Meteorology

The principles of quasi-balanced flows have been applied in various fields, including oceanography and meteorology. These applications have led to significant advancements in our understanding of ocean and atmospheric dynamics.

##### Oceanography

In oceanography, the principles of quasi-balanced flows have been used to study large-scale ocean currents and their interactions with the Earth's rotation and topography. For instance, the RAPID program, which has been monitoring the ocean circulation since 2004, relies on these principles to understand the complex dynamics of the ocean. The data collected by the RAPID program have been used to improve ocean models and forecast hurricane intensity, among other applications.

The TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 missions, which have been monitoring the ocean surface topography since 1999, have also been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the ocean. These missions have revealed the surprising variability of the ocean, ending the traditional notion of a quasi-steady, large-scale pattern of global ocean circulation. The data from these missions have been used to improve weather and climate predictions, identify and track large ocean/atmosphere phenomena such as El Niño and La Niña, and improve the safety and efficiency of offshore industry operations, among other applications.

##### Meteorology

In meteorology, the principles of quasi-balanced flows have been used to study atmospheric dynamics, particularly in the context of quasi-balanced circulations. These principles have been instrumental in understanding the formation and evolution of weather systems, such as hurricanes and typhoons. They have also been used to improve weather and climate predictions, as well as to understand the role of the ocean in climate change.

In conclusion, the principles of quasi-balanced flows have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of ocean and atmospheric dynamics. Their applications in oceanography and meteorology have led to significant advancements in these fields, and continue to be a topic of active research.




#### 1.2a Newton's Laws in Fluid Dynamics

Newton's laws of motion are fundamental principles in classical mechanics that describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it. In the context of fluid dynamics, these laws are used to derive the equations of motion that govern the behavior of fluid particles.

##### Newton's First Law

Newton's first law of motion states that an object at rest tends to stay at rest, and an object in motion tends to stay in motion, unless acted upon by an external force. In fluid dynamics, this law is often expressed as the conservation of momentum. For a fluid particle of mass $m$ and velocity $v$, the momentum $p = mv$ is conserved unless acted upon by an external force $F$. This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\frac{dp}{dt} = F
$$

##### Newton's Second Law

Newton's second law of motion states that the force acting on a body is equal to the mass of the body times its acceleration. In fluid dynamics, this law is used to derive the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the motion of viscous fluids. The force $F$ acting on a fluid particle is equal to the mass of the particle times its acceleration $a$, plus the viscous force $f$:

$$
F = ma + f
$$

##### Newton's Third Law

Newton's third law of motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In fluid dynamics, this law is used to derive the Cauchy momentum equation, which describes the conservation of momentum in a fluid. The left-hand side of the equation represents the force acting on a fluid particle, and the right-hand side represents the sum of the forces acting on the fluid particle from its surroundings:

$$
\frac{dp}{dt} = \sum F
$$

These Newtonian principles form the basis of fluid dynamics and are essential for understanding the behavior of fluid particles in quasi-balanced flows. In the following sections, we will explore how these principles are applied in the study of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres.

#### 1.2b Euler's Laws in Fluid Dynamics

Euler's laws of fluid dynamics are a set of three equations that describe the motion of inviscid fluids. These laws are named after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, who first derived them in the 18th century. In the context of quasi-balanced flows, these laws are particularly useful as they provide a simplified description of fluid motion, allowing us to focus on the larger-scale dynamics of the flow.

##### Euler's First Law

Euler's first law of fluid dynamics states that the rate of change of momentum of a fluid particle is equal to the force acting on it. This law is a direct consequence of Newton's second law of motion, and it can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\frac{d(mv)}{dt} = F
$$

where $m$ is the mass of the fluid particle, $v$ is its velocity, and $F$ is the force acting on it.

##### Euler's Second Law

Euler's second law of fluid dynamics states that the rate of change of kinetic energy of a fluid particle is equal to the work done on it by external forces. This law is a direct consequence of the first law, and it can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{1}{2}mv^2\right) = Fv
$$

where $F$ is the force acting on the fluid particle, and $v$ is its velocity.

##### Euler's Third Law

Euler's third law of fluid dynamics states that the rate of change of angular momentum of a fluid particle is equal to the torque acting on it. This law is a direct consequence of the first two laws, and it can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\frac{d(mv\times r)}{dt} = F\times r
$$

where $m$ is the mass of the fluid particle, $v$ is its velocity, $r$ is the position vector of the fluid particle, and $F$ is the force acting on it.

These laws are particularly useful in the study of quasi-balanced flows, as they allow us to focus on the larger-scale dynamics of the flow without having to consider the detailed behavior of individual fluid particles. In the following sections, we will explore how these laws are applied in the study of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres.

#### 1.2c Applications in Oceanography and Meteorology

The principles of fluid dynamics, including Newton's laws and Euler's laws, have wide-ranging applications in the fields of oceanography and meteorology. These laws are used to model and understand the behavior of quasi-balanced flows in these two complex and interconnected systems.

##### Oceanography

In oceanography, these laws are used to study the dynamics of ocean currents, tides, and other large-scale flows. For example, the Euler's laws are used to model the motion of ocean currents, taking into account the forces acting on the water particles and the changes in their momentum and kinetic energy. This allows us to understand the complex interactions between ocean currents and the Earth's rotation, topography, and wind patterns.

The principles of fluid dynamics are also used in the study of ocean eddies, which are circular currents that play a crucial role in the transport of heat, nutrients, and other properties across the ocean. The quasi-balanced approximation, which assumes that the vertical and horizontal scales of motion are much larger than the thickness of the fluid layer, simplifies the equations of motion and allows us to focus on the larger-scale dynamics of these eddies.

##### Meteorology

In meteorology, these laws are used to study the dynamics of atmospheric flows, including winds, storms, and other weather phenomena. For example, the Euler's laws are used to model the motion of air particles, taking into account the forces acting on them and the changes in their momentum and kinetic energy. This allows us to understand the complex interactions between atmospheric flows and the Earth's rotation, topography, and wind patterns.

The principles of fluid dynamics are also used in the study of atmospheric eddies, which are circular currents that play a crucial role in the transport of heat, moisture, and other properties across the atmosphere. The quasi-balanced approximation, which assumes that the vertical and horizontal scales of motion are much larger than the thickness of the fluid layer, simplifies the equations of motion and allows us to focus on the larger-scale dynamics of these eddies.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these applications, exploring how the principles of fluid dynamics are used to model and understand the behavior of quasi-balanced flows in oceans and atmospheres.
