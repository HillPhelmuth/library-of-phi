### Section 1.1 Classification of Geometric Modeling Forms:

Geometric modeling can be classified into two main forms: parametric and non-parametric. In this section, we will focus on parametric modeling, which is a powerful and widely used form of geometric modeling.

#### 1.1a Parametric Modeling

Parametric modeling is a method of geometric modeling that uses parameters to define the shape of an object. These parameters can be adjusted to create variations of the object, making it a powerful tool for design and visualization.

One of the key advantages of parametric modeling is its ability to create complex shapes with a relatively small number of parameters. This makes it particularly useful in fields such as computer graphics, where realistic and detailed objects are often needed.

Parametric modeling is also closely related to the concept of generative design, which is the use of algorithms to generate and optimize designs based on a set of constraints. This allows for the creation of highly efficient and optimized designs, which can be particularly useful in fields such as architecture and engineering.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of parametric curves and surfaces, which are essential tools in parametric modeling. We will also discuss how these curves and surfaces can be combined to create complex and realistic objects.

### Section 1.1 Classification of Geometric Modeling Forms:

Geometric modeling is a fundamental concept in computational geometry, and it is used to represent and manipulate geometric objects in a digital environment. In this section, we will explore the different forms of geometric modeling and their applications.

#### 1.1a Parametric Modeling

Parametric modeling is a powerful tool in geometric modeling that allows for the creation of complex shapes using a set of parameters. These parameters can be adjusted to create variations of the shape, making it a versatile and efficient method for creating geometric objects.

One of the key advantages of parametric modeling is its ability to create smooth and continuous curves and surfaces. This is achieved by using mathematical equations to define the shape, and the parameters act as variables in these equations. By adjusting the parameters, the shape can be manipulated and modified, allowing for a wide range of design possibilities.

Parametric modeling is widely used in various fields, including computer graphics, architecture, and engineering. In computer graphics, it is used to create realistic and detailed objects for virtual environments. In architecture, it is used to design and visualize buildings and structures. In engineering, it is used to create complex shapes for machines and structures.

#### 1.1b Non-Parametric Modeling

Non-parametric modeling is another form of geometric modeling that does not use parameters to define the shape of an object. Instead, it relies on a set of data points or samples to create a representation of the object. This method is particularly useful for creating complex and irregular shapes that may not be easily represented using mathematical equations.

One of the key advantages of non-parametric modeling is its ability to create accurate representations of real-world objects. By using a large number of data points, it can capture the intricate details and variations of the object. However, this also means that it can be computationally intensive and may not be suitable for creating large and complex shapes.

Non-parametric modeling is commonly used in fields such as medical imaging, where it is used to create 3D models of organs and tissues. It is also used in computer graphics for creating realistic and detailed environments and characters.

#### 1.1c Implicit Modeling

Implicit modeling is a form of geometric modeling that combines elements of both parametric and non-parametric modeling. It uses mathematical equations to define the shape of an object, but instead of using parameters, it relies on a set of implicit constraints. These constraints are used to guide the creation of the shape, and the resulting model is a combination of both parametric and non-parametric elements.

One of the key advantages of implicit modeling is its ability to create complex and detailed shapes while still being computationally efficient. By using implicit constraints, it can create smooth and continuous shapes while also capturing the intricate details of the object. This makes it a popular choice in fields such as computer graphics and animation.

In the next section, we will explore the different techniques and algorithms used in geometric modeling, including parametric, non-parametric, and implicit modeling. We will also discuss their applications and advantages in various fields.


## Chapter 1: Introduction to Geometric Modeling:




#### 1.1c Explicit Modeling

Explicit modeling is a form of geometric modeling that combines the advantages of both parametric and non-parametric modeling. It allows for the creation of complex shapes using mathematical equations, while also being able to capture the intricate details and variations of real-world objects.

In explicit modeling, the shape is defined by a set of explicit equations that describe the geometry of the object. These equations can be written in a variety of forms, such as polynomial equations, parametric equations, or implicit equations. By adjusting the parameters in these equations, the shape can be manipulated and modified, similar to parametric modeling. However, unlike parametric modeling, explicit modeling also allows for the creation of complex shapes that may not be easily represented using mathematical equations.

One of the key advantages of explicit modeling is its ability to create smooth and continuous curves and surfaces, similar to parametric modeling. However, it also allows for the creation of irregular and complex shapes, similar to non-parametric modeling. This makes it a versatile and powerful tool for creating geometric objects in a digital environment.

Explicit modeling is widely used in various fields, including computer graphics, architecture, and engineering. In computer graphics, it is used to create realistic and detailed objects for virtual environments. In architecture, it is used to design and visualize buildings and structures. In engineering, it is used to create complex shapes for machines and structures.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of explicit modeling forms and their applications in more detail.

## Chapter 2: Differential Geometry of Curves:




### Section: 2.1 Differential Geometry of Curves:

### Subsection: 2.1a Curve Definition

In this section, we will explore the definition of curves in differential geometry. A curve is a continuous function that maps a real number to a point in a Euclidean space. In other words, a curve is a path that connects two points. The study of curves is essential in many fields, including computer graphics, robotics, and machine learning.

#### 2.1a.1 Parametric Curves

A parametric curve is a curve that is defined by a set of parameters. These parameters can be thought of as the controls of the curve, and they determine the shape and position of the curve. The most common type of parametric curve is the Bézier curve, which is defined by a set of control points.

#### 2.1a.2 Bézier Curves

Bézier curves are a type of parametric curve that is widely used in computer graphics and design. They are defined by a set of control points, which determine the shape and position of the curve. The Bézier curve can be defined for any degree "n", and it has a recursive definition that expresses it as a point-to-point linear combination of a pair of corresponding points in two Bézier curves of degree "n" − 1.

#### 2.1a.3 Explicit Definition of Bézier Curves

The formula for a Bézier curve of degree "n" can be expressed explicitly as follows:

$$
\mathbf{B}(t) = \sum_{i=0}^n {n\choose i}(1 - t)^{n - i}t^i\mathbf{P}_i
$$

where $\scriptstyle {n \choose i}$ are the binomial coefficients. This formula can be extended to higher degrees, with the coefficients becoming more complex.

#### 2.1a.4 Terminology

Some terminology is associated with these parametric curves. The points P<sub>"i"</sub> are called "control points" for the Bézier curve. The polygon formed by connecting the Bézier points with lines, starting with P<sub>0</sub> and finishing with P<sub>"n"</sub>, is called the "Bézier polygon" (or "control polygon"). The convex hull of the Bézier polygon contains the Bézier curve.

#### 2.1a.5 Polynomial Form of Bézier Curves

Sometimes it is desirable to express the Bézier curve as a polynomial instead of a sum of less straightforward Bernstein polynomials. This can be achieved by applying the binomial theorem to the definition of the Bézier curve. The resulting polynomial form can be useful in certain applications, such as in the calculation of derivatives or integrals of the curve.

In the next section, we will explore the properties of curves and how they can be used to analyze and manipulate curves in differential geometry.
