### Subsection 1.1a Basics of Magnetic Materials

Magnetic materials are materials that exhibit magnetism, either due to their own inherent properties or through the influence of an external magnetic field. They can be classified into two main categories: ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic. Ferromagnetic materials, such as iron and nickel, have a high magnetic permeability and can be easily magnetized.

In this section, we will explore the fundamental principles of magnetism, including the concepts of magnetic domains, hysteresis, and magnetic anisotropy.

#### Magnetic Domains

Magnetic domains are regions within a ferromagnetic material where the magnetic moments of atoms are aligned in the same direction. These domains are separated by domain walls, where the magnetic moments are pointing in different directions. The size and orientation of these domains play a crucial role in the magnetic properties of a material.

#### Hysteresis

Hysteresis is a phenomenon where the magnetization of a material lags behind changes in the applied magnetic field. This means that even after the external magnetic field is removed, the material retains some magnetization. Hysteresis is an essential property of magnetic materials and is responsible for their ability to store and retrieve data in magnetic storage devices.

#### Magnetic Anisotropy

Magnetic anisotropy is the dependence of a material's magnetic properties on its orientation. This means that the magnetic properties of a material can vary depending on how it is oriented in space. This property is crucial in the design of magnetic materials for specific applications.

In the next section, we will discuss the properties of magnetic materials, such as coercivity, remanence, and saturation magnetization. These properties play a crucial role in determining the behavior and applications of magnetic materials.





### Subsection 1.2 Microscopic to Macroscopic Approach

In the study of magnetic materials, it is essential to understand the behavior of these materials at both the microscopic and macroscopic levels. This is because the properties and behavior of magnetic materials are influenced by their atomic and molecular structure, as well as their overall macroscopic properties.

The microscopic approach to studying magnetic materials involves examining the behavior of individual atoms and molecules. This can be done through techniques such as electron microscopy, which allows for the visualization of the atomic structure of a material. By studying the behavior of individual atoms and molecules, we can gain insight into the fundamental properties of magnetic materials, such as their magnetic moments and spin states.

On the other hand, the macroscopic approach involves studying the behavior of the material as a whole. This can be done through techniques such as magnetometry, which measures the magnetic properties of a material. By studying the macroscopic behavior of a material, we can gain insight into its overall magnetic properties, such as its magnetic permeability and coercivity.

The microscopic to macroscopic approach is crucial in understanding the behavior of magnetic materials. By combining the two approaches, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the properties and behavior of these materials. This approach is also essential in the development of new magnetic materials, as it allows us to manipulate and control the behavior of these materials at both the atomic and macroscopic levels.

### Subsection 1.3 Impact of Magnetism on Technology

Magnetism has played a crucial role in the development of technology, particularly in the field of data storage. The use of magnetic materials in data storage devices has revolutionized the way we store and access information. In this section, we will explore the impact of magnetism on technology, specifically in the context of magnetic-core memory.

#### 1.3a Magnetic-core memory

Magnetic-core memory, also known as magnetic core storage, was a type of random-access memory (RAM) that used tiny iron oxide cores to store data. Each core represented a bit of information, with a north or south magnetic pole corresponding to a 0 or 1. These cores were arranged in a two-dimensional array, with each core connected to a set of wires that could be magnetized in a specific direction.

The production of magnetic-core memory was a complex process that involved stringing wires through the cores and then magnetizing them in a specific direction. This process was made possible by the development of automated machines that could thread the wires through the cores and magnetize them in a specific direction. This technology was crucial in the development of modern data storage devices, such as hard drives and solid-state drives.

The cost of magnetic-core memory was dominated by the cost of stringing the wires through the cores. This process was time-consuming and required skilled labor, making it a costly process. However, with the development of automated machines, the cost of producing magnetic-core memory was significantly reduced. This led to a decrease in the overall cost of data storage devices, making them more accessible to the general public.

The use of magnetic-core memory also had a significant impact on the size and power consumption of data storage devices. As the size of the cores decreased, the power required to flip the magnetization of one core also decreased. This led to a decrease in the overall power consumption of data storage devices, making them more energy-efficient.

In conclusion, the impact of magnetism on technology, specifically in the context of magnetic-core memory, has been profound. The development of magnetic-core memory has revolutionized the way we store and access information, making it an essential component of modern technology. The continued research and development in the field of magnetism will only further enhance the capabilities of data storage devices and pave the way for future advancements in technology.





### Subsection 1.4 Basic Scientific Questions in Magnetism

Magnetism is a fundamental force of nature that has been studied for centuries. It is responsible for the behavior of magnetic materials and plays a crucial role in many modern technologies. In this section, we will explore some of the basic scientific questions in magnetism.

#### 1.4a What is magnetism?

Magnetism is a physical phenomenon that arises from the alignment of magnetic moments in a material. Magnetic moments are tiny magnets within a material that can align themselves in a particular direction. When these magnetic moments are aligned, they create a magnetic field that can attract or repel other magnetic materials.

The behavior of magnetic materials is governed by the laws of magnetism, which are similar to the laws of electricity. These laws describe how magnetic fields interact with each other and how they affect the behavior of charged particles.

One of the most fundamental questions in magnetism is how magnetic materials are created. The answer to this question lies in the concept of magnetization. Magnetization is the process by which a material becomes magnetized. This can occur through various means, such as exposure to a magnetic field or the presence of certain elements within the material.

Another important question in magnetism is how magnetic materials interact with each other. This is described by the concept of magnetic induction, which states that a changing magnetic field can induce an electric field, and vice versa. This phenomenon is responsible for many important technologies, such as transformers and generators.

The behavior of magnetic materials is also influenced by temperature. As the temperature of a material increases, the thermal energy can disrupt the alignment of magnetic moments, leading to a decrease in magnetization. This is known as the Curie's law, which states that the magnetization of a material is inversely proportional to the temperature.

In addition to these fundamental questions, there are many other aspects of magnetism that are still being studied and researched. These include the behavior of magnetic materials in different environments, the effects of magnetic fields on biological systems, and the potential applications of magnetism in fields such as medicine and energy production.

## Chapter 2: Classical Magnetism:




### Section 2.1 Classical Magnetic Moments

In the previous section, we discussed the classical theory of magnetism and its applications. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of magnetic moments and their role in magnetism.

#### 2.1a Magnetic Moment of a Dipole

A magnetic moment is a measure of the strength of a magnetic pole. It is defined as the product of the pole strength and the distance between the poles. In classical magnetism, the magnetic moment is represented by the symbol $\mu$. The magnetic moment of a dipole, which is the simplest magnetic system, is given by the equation:

$$
\mu = I A
$$

where $I$ is the current flowing through the dipole and $A$ is the area of the loop.

The magnetic moment of a dipole is a vector quantity, with the direction of the vector along the axis of the dipole. The magnitude of the magnetic moment is directly proportional to the current flowing through the dipole and the area of the loop. This means that increasing the current or the area of the loop will increase the magnetic moment of the dipole.

The magnetic moment of a dipole is also related to the magnetic field it produces. The magnetic field produced by a dipole is given by the equation:

$$
B = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{2I A}{r^3}
$$

where $r$ is the distance from the dipole. This equation shows that the magnetic field produced by a dipole is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance. This means that as the distance from the dipole increases, the magnetic field decreases rapidly.

In classical magnetism, the magnetic moment is often used to describe the behavior of magnetic materials. The magnetic moment of a material is a measure of its response to an external magnetic field. Materials with a high magnetic moment are said to be ferromagnetic, while materials with a low magnetic moment are said to be diamagnetic.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of magnetic domains and how they contribute to the overall magnetic behavior of a material.


#### 2.1b Magnetic Moment of a Sphere

In the previous section, we discussed the magnetic moment of a dipole. Now, we will extend our understanding to the magnetic moment of a sphere. This is an important concept in classical magnetism, as it allows us to understand the behavior of more complex magnetic systems.

The magnetic moment of a sphere is defined as the sum of the magnetic moments of all the dipoles within the sphere. This can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\mu = \sum_{i} \mu_i
$$

where $\mu_i$ is the magnetic moment of the $i$th dipole. This equation assumes that the dipoles are uniformly distributed throughout the sphere.

The magnetic moment of a sphere is also related to the magnetic field it produces. The magnetic field produced by a sphere is given by the equation:

$$
B = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{3(\mu \cdot r)r - \mu}{r^5}
$$

where $r$ is the distance from the center of the sphere. This equation shows that the magnetic field produced by a sphere is inversely proportional to the fifth power of the distance. This means that as the distance from the sphere increases, the magnetic field decreases rapidly.

In classical magnetism, the magnetic moment of a sphere is often used to describe the behavior of magnetic materials. The magnetic moment of a material is a measure of its response to an external magnetic field. Materials with a high magnetic moment are said to be ferromagnetic, while materials with a low magnetic moment are said to be diamagnetic.

The magnetic moment of a sphere is also related to the magnetization of a material. The magnetization of a material is defined as the magnetic moment per unit volume. For a sphere, the magnetization is given by the equation:

$$
M = \frac{\mu}{V}
$$

where $V$ is the volume of the sphere. This equation shows that the magnetization of a sphere is directly proportional to its magnetic moment. This means that increasing the magnetic moment of a sphere will increase its magnetization.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of magnetic domains and how they contribute to the overall magnetic behavior of a material.


#### 2.1c Magnetic Moment of a Cylinder

In the previous section, we discussed the magnetic moment of a sphere. Now, we will extend our understanding to the magnetic moment of a cylinder. This is an important concept in classical magnetism, as it allows us to understand the behavior of more complex magnetic systems.

The magnetic moment of a cylinder is defined as the sum of the magnetic moments of all the dipoles within the cylinder. This can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\mu = \sum_{i} \mu_i
$$

where $\mu_i$ is the magnetic moment of the $i$th dipole. This equation assumes that the dipoles are uniformly distributed throughout the cylinder.

The magnetic moment of a cylinder is also related to the magnetic field it produces. The magnetic field produced by a cylinder is given by the equation:

$$
B = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{3(\mu \cdot r)r - \mu}{r^5}
$$

where $r$ is the distance from the center of the cylinder. This equation shows that the magnetic field produced by a cylinder is inversely proportional to the fifth power of the distance. This means that as the distance from the cylinder increases, the magnetic field decreases rapidly.

In classical magnetism, the magnetic moment of a cylinder is often used to describe the behavior of magnetic materials. The magnetic moment of a material is a measure of its response to an external magnetic field. Materials with a high magnetic moment are said to be ferromagnetic, while materials with a low magnetic moment are said to be diamagnetic.

The magnetic moment of a cylinder is also related to the magnetization of a material. The magnetization of a material is defined as the magnetic moment per unit volume. For a cylinder, the magnetization is given by the equation:

$$
M = \frac{\mu}{V}
$$

where $V$ is the volume of the cylinder. This equation shows that the magnetization of a cylinder is directly proportional to its magnetic moment. This means that increasing the magnetic moment of a cylinder will increase its magnetization.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of magnetic domains and how they contribute to the overall magnetic behavior of a material.
