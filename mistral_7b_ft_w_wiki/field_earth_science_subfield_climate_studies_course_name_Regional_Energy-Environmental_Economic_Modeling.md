# Regional Energy-Environmental Economic Modeling: A Comprehensive Guide":


## Foreward

Welcome to "Regional Energy-Environmental Economic Modeling: A Comprehensive Guide". This book aims to provide a thorough understanding of the complex and interconnected fields of energy, environment, and economics, and how they interact at a regional level.

The book is structured around the POLES (Partial Equilibrium Long-term Energy System) model, a powerful tool for simulating and analyzing the world's energy sector up to 2050. The POLES model is a partial equilibrium model, meaning it focuses on a specific sector or market, in this case, energy. It operates on a yearly recursive simulation process, taking into account price-induced behavioral equations and a cost- and performance-based system for a large number of energy or energy-related technologies.

The model's structure is divided into three levels of analysis: international energy markets, regional energy balances, and national energy demand. This structure allows for a comprehensive understanding of the energy sector, from global markets to regional balances and national demand.

The POLES model breaks down the world into 66 regions, each with a detailed energy balance model. This level of detail is crucial for understanding the complexities of the energy sector and its impact on the environment and economy.

The book will delve into the various demand sectors modeled in POLES, each described with a high degree of detail. This includes activity indicators, short- and long-term energy prices and associated elasticities, and technological evolution trends. This level of detail allows for a strong economic consistency in the adjustment of supply and demand by region, as relative price changes at a sectoral level impact all key components of a region's sector.

The book will also explore the role of energy demand for each fuel in a sector, following a market share-based competition driven by energy prices and factors related to policy or development assumptions. This competitive dynamic is a key aspect of the POLES model and is crucial for understanding the future of the energy sector.

Finally, the book will delve into the economic implications of the POLES model, including sectoral value added and the impact of energy prices on the economy. This will provide a comprehensive understanding of the economic impact of energy decisions and policies.

This book is intended for advanced undergraduate students at MIT and anyone interested in understanding the complexities of the energy sector. It is our hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for understanding the future of energy and its impact on the environment and economy.

Thank you for joining us on this journey.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

### Subsection: 1.1a Introduction to Sustainable Energy

Sustainable energy is a crucial aspect of regional sustainable development. It refers to the use of energy sources that are environmentally friendly and have a minimal impact on the ecosystem. These sources include renewable energy, such as solar, wind, and hydro power, as well as energy efficiency measures that aim to reduce energy consumption.

The concept of sustainable energy is closely tied to the principles of sustainability, which emphasize the need to balance the needs of the present and future generations. In the context of energy, this means using energy sources that are not only abundant and affordable but also have a minimal impact on the environment. This is particularly important in the face of climate change, which is exacerbated by the use of fossil fuels.

One of the key challenges in promoting sustainable energy is the need to balance energy supply and demand. This is where energy modeling comes into play. Energy models are mathematical representations of energy systems that help us understand the complex interplay between energy supply, demand, and the environment. They allow us to explore different scenarios and policies, and to evaluate their potential impacts on the energy system.

There are various types of energy models, each with its own strengths and limitations. Some models focus on a specific aspect of the energy system, such as electricity or transportation, while others take a more holistic approach. Some models are also designed to incorporate environmental and economic considerations, providing a more comprehensive view of the energy system.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the world of energy modeling, exploring the different types of models, their applications, and their limitations. We will also discuss the role of energy modeling in promoting sustainable energy and contributing to regional sustainable development.




#### 1.1b Environmental Systems and Sustainability

Environmental systems and sustainability are two critical components of regional sustainable development. Environmental systems refer to the complex interactions between living organisms and their physical environment. These systems are dynamic and interconnected, and any changes in one part of the system can have cascading effects on other parts.

Sustainability, on the other hand, is about meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This concept is often referred to as the "three pillars of sustainability": environmental, economic, and social. These pillars are interconnected and must be balanced to achieve true sustainability.

In the context of regional sustainable development, understanding and managing environmental systems is crucial. This includes understanding the impacts of human activities on the environment, as well as the potential impacts of environmental changes on human societies. For example, climate change, which is largely driven by human activities, has the potential to significantly alter environmental systems and have profound impacts on human societies.

One of the key tools for understanding and managing environmental systems is environmental modeling. Environmental models are mathematical representations of environmental systems that help us understand the complex interactions between different components of the system. They can be used to simulate the behavior of the system under different conditions, and to explore the potential impacts of different policies or interventions.

There are various types of environmental models, each with its own strengths and limitations. Some models focus on a specific aspect of the environment, such as climate or ecosystems, while others take a more holistic approach. Some models are also designed to incorporate economic and social considerations, providing a more comprehensive view of the system.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the world of environmental modeling, exploring the different types of models, their applications, and their limitations. We will also discuss the role of environmental modeling in promoting sustainability and contributing to regional sustainable development.

#### 1.1c Role of Sustainable Energy and Environmental Systems in Regional Development

The role of sustainable energy and environmental systems in regional development is multifaceted and crucial. As we have seen in the previous sections, sustainable energy and environmental systems are integral to the three pillars of sustainability: environmental, economic, and social. In this section, we will explore how these systems contribute to regional development.

Sustainable energy systems play a pivotal role in regional development. They provide the necessary energy for economic activities, such as manufacturing, transportation, and communication. However, the traditional energy sources, such as fossil fuels, have been a major contributor to environmental degradation and climate change. Therefore, the transition to sustainable energy sources, such as renewable energy, is not only crucial for meeting the energy needs of the present but also for ensuring a sustainable future for generations to come.

Environmental systems, on the other hand, are the foundation of regional development. They provide the necessary resources for economic activities, such as agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. However, these resources are often under threat due to environmental degradation, such as deforestation, overfishing, and pollution. Therefore, managing and protecting these environmental systems is not only crucial for meeting the resource needs of the present but also for ensuring the long-term viability of these economic activities.

Environmental modeling plays a crucial role in understanding and managing these sustainable energy and environmental systems. By simulating the behavior of these systems under different conditions, we can identify potential risks and develop strategies to mitigate them. For example, climate models can help us understand the potential impacts of climate change on regional development and inform strategies to adapt to these changes. Similarly, energy models can help us understand the potential impacts of energy policies and inform the design of more sustainable energy systems.

In conclusion, sustainable energy and environmental systems are integral to regional development. They provide the necessary resources and energy for economic activities, but their sustainability is under threat due to environmental degradation and climate change. Therefore, understanding and managing these systems is crucial for ensuring a sustainable future for generations to come.




#### 1.1c Role of Regional Development in Sustainability

Regional development plays a crucial role in achieving sustainability. It is at the regional level that many of the environmental, economic, and social issues that affect sustainability are most acutely felt. Therefore, understanding and managing regional development is essential for achieving sustainability.

Regional development is about creating conditions that allow regions to grow and thrive in a sustainable manner. This includes promoting economic growth, improving social conditions, and protecting the environment. It also involves addressing regional disparities and promoting equity.

One of the key tools for understanding and managing regional development is regional economic modeling. Regional economic models are mathematical representations of regional economies that help us understand the complex interactions between different sectors of the economy. They can be used to simulate the behavior of the economy under different conditions, and to explore the potential impacts of different policies or interventions.

There are various types of regional economic models, each with its own strengths and limitations. Some models focus on a specific aspect of the economy, such as industry or labor, while others take a more holistic approach. Some models are also designed to incorporate environmental and social considerations, providing a more comprehensive view of regional development.

In the context of sustainability, regional economic modeling can be used to explore the potential impacts of different policies or interventions on the environment, economy, and society. This can help policymakers and other stakeholders make informed decisions about how to promote sustainable regional development.

For example, a regional economic model could be used to simulate the impacts of a new renewable energy policy on the regional economy. This could involve modeling the effects of the policy on employment, investment, and energy prices. The model could also be used to explore the potential environmental impacts of the policy, such as reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

Similarly, a regional economic model could be used to explore the impacts of a new transportation policy on the regional economy and environment. This could involve modeling the effects of the policy on traffic congestion, air quality, and energy consumption.

In conclusion, regional economic modeling is a powerful tool for understanding and managing regional development in the context of sustainability. It allows us to explore the potential impacts of different policies or interventions on the environment, economy, and society, and to make informed decisions about how to promote sustainable regional development.

In the previous section, we discussed the basics of Life-Cycle Assessments (LCAs) and their applications in environmental systems. In this section, we will delve deeper into advanced techniques used in LCAs, including the use of software tools and databases.

#### 3.2a.1 Software Tools for Life-Cycle Assessments

There are several software tools available for conducting LCAs. These tools can help to automate the process of data collection, analysis, and reporting, making it more efficient and accurate. One such tool is the SimaPro software, which is widely used for LCAs due to its comprehensive database of environmental impact data for various products and processes.

SimaPro uses a life-cycle inventory (LCI) approach to collect data on all inputs and outputs of a product system. This data is then used to calculate the environmental impacts of the product, including energy consumption, emissions, and waste generation. The software also allows for the comparison of different products or processes, providing insights into the environmental performance of each.

#### 3.2a.2 Databases for Life-Cycle Assessments

In addition to software tools, there are also several databases available for conducting LCAs. These databases contain a vast amount of data on environmental impacts for various products and processes, making it easier to conduct LCAs.

One such database is the ecoinvent database, which is a comprehensive database of life-cycle inventory data for products and processes. The database covers a wide range of sectors, including energy, transportation, and waste management, and provides data on over 1,000 products and processes.

Another useful database is the ELCD (European Life Cycle Database), which is a database of life-cycle inventory and impact assessment data for products and processes. The database covers a wide range of sectors and provides data on over 1,000 products and processes.

#### 3.2a.3 Advanced Techniques in Life-Cycle Assessments

In addition to using software tools and databases, there are also advanced techniques that can be used in LCAs. These techniques include:

- Multi-objective Life-Cycle Assessment (MOLCA): This technique allows for the consideration of multiple environmental impacts simultaneously, rather than just focusing on a single impact. This can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the environmental performance of a product or process.
- Life-Cycle Cost Assessment (LCCA): This technique takes into account not only the environmental impacts of a product or process, but also its economic costs. This can help to identify the most cost-effective solutions for reducing environmental impacts.
- Life-Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA): This technique goes beyond just considering environmental impacts and also takes into account social and economic factors. This can provide a more holistic understanding of the sustainability of a product or process.

In conclusion, advanced techniques in Life-Cycle Assessments, such as the use of software tools and databases, as well as techniques like MOLCA, LCCA, and LCSA, can greatly enhance the accuracy and comprehensiveness of LCAs. These techniques are essential for conducting effective and meaningful LCAs in environmental systems.

### Subsection: 4.1a Introduction to Energy-Efficiency Models

Energy-efficiency models are mathematical representations of energy systems that are used to analyze the impact of energy efficiency measures on regional economies. These models are essential tools for policymakers, energy planners, and researchers who are interested in understanding the complex interplay between energy efficiency and economic development.

Energy-efficiency models can be broadly classified into two types: deterministic and stochastic. Deterministic models make assumptions about future energy demand and supply, and then use these assumptions to calculate the optimal mix of energy sources and efficiency measures. Stochastic models, on the other hand, take into account the uncertainty and variability in energy demand and supply, and use probabilistic methods to explore a range of possible outcomes.

One of the key challenges in energy-efficiency modeling is the so-called "rebound effect". This refers to the phenomenon where improvements in energy efficiency can lead to increased energy consumption due to the lower cost of energy services. For example, more efficient vehicles can lead to increased driving, thereby offsetting some of the potential energy savings.

The rebound effect is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a variety of factors, including the price of energy, the cost of energy-efficient technologies, and consumer behavior. Estimates of the size of the rebound effect range from roughly 5% to 40%, with a median value of around 20%. However, these estimates are highly uncertain and depend on the specific assumptions and methodologies used in the models.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the principles and methodologies of energy-efficiency models, and explore how they can be used to analyze the impact of energy efficiency measures on regional economies. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of these models, and explore potential strategies for overcoming them.




### Subsection: 4.1b Regional Aspects of Energy-Efficiency Models

Regional energy-efficiency models are a crucial tool for understanding the impact of energy efficiency measures on regional economies. These models take into account the unique characteristics and constraints of a particular region, such as its energy demand, supply, and infrastructure, to predict the outcomes of energy efficiency policies.

One of the key aspects of regional energy-efficiency models is their ability to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy systems. For instance, the URBS model, developed by the Technical University of Munich, uses a time resolution of one hour and allows for the selection of technologies to meet a predetermined electricity demand. This level of detail is crucial for understanding the complex interplay between energy efficiency and economic development.

Another important aspect of regional energy-efficiency models is their ability to account for the rebound effect. As mentioned in the previous section, the rebound effect refers to the phenomenon where improvements in energy efficiency can lead to increased energy consumption due to the lower cost of energy services. Regional models can incorporate this effect by considering the price of energy, the cost of energy-efficient technologies, and consumer behavior.

However, regional energy-efficiency models also face several challenges. One of the main challenges is the lack of data. Energy systems are complex and involve a multitude of variables, many of which are not easily quantifiable. This makes it difficult to develop accurate models, especially for developing regions where data may be scarce.

Another challenge is the uncertainty and variability in energy demand and supply. Energy systems are subject to a wide range of factors, including economic growth, technological advancements, and policy changes, which can significantly impact energy demand and supply. This makes it challenging to predict the outcomes of energy efficiency policies with a high degree of certainty.

Despite these challenges, regional energy-efficiency models are an essential tool for policymakers, energy planners, and researchers. They provide valuable insights into the potential impacts of energy efficiency measures on regional economies, and can help inform energy policies that balance economic development with environmental sustainability.

Climate change models are powerful tools for understanding and predicting the effects of climate change. However, to fully understand their capabilities and limitations, it is important to examine case studies where these models have been applied. In this section, we will discuss some notable case studies in climate change modeling.

#### Case Study 1: The SRES A1B Scenario

The Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B scenario is a climate change scenario developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This scenario assumes a future world with very rapid economic growth, a shift towards a service and information economy, and a rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies. The SRES A1B scenario is often used as a baseline for climate change modeling studies due to its relatively moderate emissions trajectory.

Climate change models have been used to simulate the effects of the SRES A1B scenario on global and regional climate patterns. These studies have shown that under this scenario, global temperatures are expected to rise by 1.8 to 4.0 degrees Celsius by the end of the 21st century. The increase in temperature is expected to be accompanied by changes in precipitation patterns, sea level rise, and other climate impacts.

#### Case Study 2: The North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP)

NARCCAP uses a suite of climate models, including regional climate models and coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models, to project future climate scenarios for the region.

One of the key findings from NARCCAP is the projected increase in extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts, and floods, in response to climate change. These events are expected to have significant impacts on ecosystems, agriculture, and human health in North America.

#### Case Study 3: The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP)

The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) is an international effort to compare and evaluate climate models. The latest phase of CMIP, CMIP5, involved the participation of 26 climate models from 17 modeling centers around the world. These models were used to simulate the effects of the SRES A1B scenario on global and regional climate patterns.

The results from CMIP5 showed a wide range of model responses to the SRES A1B scenario, highlighting the need for further research and improvement of climate models. However, the overall consensus was a warmer and more variable climate in the future, with significant impacts on ecosystems, human societies, and the economy.

In conclusion, these case studies demonstrate the importance and potential of climate change models in understanding and predicting the effects of climate change.

### Section: 6.1 Linkage between Environmental and Energy Models Part 1:

### Subsection (optional): 6.1b Importance of Linkage in Regional Modeling

In the previous section, we discussed the basics of environmental and energy models and the different types of models used in these fields. In this section, we will delve deeper into the importance of linking these models in regional modeling.

Regional modeling is a crucial tool for understanding the complex interactions between energy and the environment in a specific region. It allows us to study the impact of energy production and consumption on the environment, as well as the impact of environmental factors on energy systems. However, to accurately capture these interactions, it is essential to link environmental and energy models.

One of the main reasons for linking these models is to account for the feedback loops between energy and the environment. For example, the production of energy can have a direct impact on the environment, such as air and water pollution. At the same time, environmental factors, such as weather patterns and natural resources, can also affect energy production and consumption. By linking environmental and energy models, we can better understand these feedback loops and their implications for the region.

Another reason for linking these models is to account for the interdependence between energy and the environment. Energy is not only used for human activities, but it also plays a crucial role in shaping the environment. For instance, the extraction and transportation of fossil fuels can have a significant impact on the environment, while renewable energy sources can help reduce environmental pollution. By linking environmental and energy models, we can better understand the complex interdependence between these two systems.

Furthermore, linking these models allows us to explore potential scenarios and policies that may impact both energy and the environment. By simulating different scenarios, we can assess the potential outcomes and make informed decisions about energy and environmental policies. For example, we can explore the impact of transitioning to renewable energy sources on the environment, or the impact of implementing stricter environmental regulations on energy production.

In conclusion, linking environmental and energy models is crucial for understanding the complex interactions between energy and the environment in a specific region. It allows us to account for feedback loops, interdependence, and explore potential scenarios and policies. In the next section, we will discuss the different techniques and methods used to link these models.





### Section: 6.1 Linkage between Environmental and Energy Models Part 1:

### Subsection (optional): 6.1c Case Studies in Model Linkage

In this subsection, we will explore some real-world case studies that demonstrate the importance of linking environmental and energy models in regional modeling.

#### Case Study 1: The Impact of Renewable Energy on the Environment in California

California has been a leader in the adoption of renewable energy sources, with a goal of achieving 100% clean energy by 2045. To achieve this goal, the state has implemented various policies and incentives to promote the use of renewable energy sources. However, the rapid adoption of renewable energy has also raised concerns about its potential impact on the environment.

To address these concerns, researchers have used linked environmental and energy models to study the potential environmental impacts of renewable energy in California. The models have shown that while renewable energy sources have a lower environmental impact compared to fossil fuels, their large-scale adoption can also have unintended consequences. For instance, the expansion of solar and wind farms can lead to habitat destruction and the displacement of wildlife.

By linking environmental and energy models, researchers have been able to identify potential trade-offs and develop strategies to mitigate the environmental impacts of renewable energy. This has helped policymakers make informed decisions and develop more sustainable energy policies.

#### Case Study 2: The Role of Energy in Climate Change Mitigation in the European Union
