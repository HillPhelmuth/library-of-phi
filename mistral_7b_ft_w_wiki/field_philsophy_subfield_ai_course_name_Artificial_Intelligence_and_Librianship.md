### Section: 0.1 Evolution of Librarianship

Librarianship has a rich history that dates back to ancient civilizations. The earliest known libraries were created by the Sumerians in Mesopotamia around 2000 BC. These libraries were primarily collections of clay tablets containing religious texts, historical records, and mathematical calculations. The Phoenicians, Egyptians, and Greeks also had their own libraries, which were often associated with temples or schools.

During the Middle Ages, monasteries became important centers of learning and knowledge, housing vast collections of manuscripts and books. The monks who tended these collections were responsible for copying and preserving the texts, and they became the first librarians.

The Renaissance saw a revival of interest in ancient learning, leading to the creation of public libraries. The first public library in the modern sense was the Biblioteca Marciana in Venice, Italy, founded in 1468. This library, along with other early public libraries, was primarily a collection of books for scholars and intellectuals.

The 19th and 20th centuries saw a significant evolution in librarianship. The rise of mass literacy and the printing press led to an explosion in the number of books and publications, necessitating the creation of larger and more complex libraries. This period also saw the development of new library services, such as interlibrary loan and reader's advisory.

The advent of the digital age has further transformed librarianship. The introduction of computers and the internet has allowed libraries to digitize their collections and provide online services, making information more accessible to the public. This has also led to the development of new skills and responsibilities for librarians, including information technology and data management.

## Chapter 1: Intellectual Background:




### Section 1.1b Birth of Artificial Intelligence:

The birth of artificial intelligence can be traced back to the 1950s, when a group of scientists from various fields began to explore the possibility of creating an artificial brain. This group, known as the "cybernetics group", was made up of mathematicians, psychologists, engineers, economists, and political scientists. They were all interested in the idea of creating a machine that could think and make decisions like a human.

The cybernetics group was inspired by the work of Norbert Wiener, who had developed the concept of cybernetics, which is the study of control and stability in systems. They also drew inspiration from Claude Shannon's information theory, which described digital signals and how they could be used to transmit information. These ideas, along with Alan Turing's theory of computation, led to the development of the first artificial intelligence systems.

One of the earliest examples of artificial intelligence was the development of the SNARC (Synthetic Navigational Apparatus for Rocket Control) by Marvin Minsky and Dean Edmonds in 1951. The SNARC was a neural net machine that used analog circuitry to control the movement of a rocket. This was a significant development, as it demonstrated the potential of using artificial intelligence to control complex systems.

Another important figure in the early days of artificial intelligence was Alan Turing, who published a landmark paper in 1950 titled "Computing Machinery and Intelligence". In this paper, Turing proposed the idea of a "thinking machine" that could perform tasks that were typically considered to require human intelligence. He also introduced the concept of the Turing test, which is a test for machine intelligence that involves a human judge interacting with a machine and trying to determine if it is a human or a machine.

The development of artificial intelligence in the 1950s also saw the creation of experimental robots, such as W. Grey Walter's turtles and the Johns Hopkins Beast. These robots were controlled by analog circuitry and did not use computers or digital electronics. They were able to navigate their environment and avoid obstacles, demonstrating the potential of artificial intelligence in creating autonomous systems.

In conclusion, the birth of artificial intelligence can be traced back to the 1950s, when a group of scientists from various fields came together to explore the possibility of creating an artificial brain. Their work led to the development of the first artificial intelligence systems and laid the foundation for the field of artificial intelligence as we know it today.
