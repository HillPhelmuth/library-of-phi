### Subsection 1.1a Introduction to Many Body Schrödinger Equation

The Many-Body Schrödinger Equation (MBSE) is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that describes the behavior of a system of interacting particles. It is a generalization of the single-particle Schrödinger equation and is essential for understanding the behavior of molecular and extended systems.

The MBSE is a differential equation that describes the time evolution of the wave function of a system of interacting particles. The wave function, denoted by $\Psi(x_1, x_2, ..., x_N, t)$, is a function of the coordinates of all the particles in the system and time. The equation is given by:

$$
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x_1, x_2, ..., x_N, t) = \hat{H}\Psi(x_1, x_2, ..., x_N, t)
$$

where $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, which represents the total energy of the system, and $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant.

The MBSE is a complex equation and solving it exactly for systems with more than two particles is generally not possible. Therefore, various approximation methods are used to solve the equation. These include mean-field methods, perturbation theory, and density functional theory.

In the context of molecular and extended systems, the MBSE is used to study the behavior of molecules and materials. It provides a framework for understanding the electronic structure of molecules, the properties of materials, and the dynamics of chemical reactions.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the MBSE and its applications in the study of molecular and extended systems. We will also discuss the various approximation methods used to solve the equation and their applications.




#### 1.1b Mathematical Formulation

The Many-Body Schrödinger Equation (MBSE) is a differential equation that describes the time evolution of the wave function of a system of interacting particles. The wave function, denoted by $\Psi(x_1, x_2, ..., x_N, t)$, is a function of the coordinates of all the particles in the system and time. The equation is given by:

$$
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x_1, x_2, ..., x_N, t) = \hat{H}\Psi(x_1, x_2, ..., x_N, t)
$$

where $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, which represents the total energy of the system, and $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant.

The MBSE is a complex equation and solving it exactly for systems with more than two particles is generally not possible. Therefore, various approximation methods are used to solve the equation. These include mean-field methods, perturbation theory, and density functional theory.

In the context of molecular and extended systems, the MBSE is used to study the behavior of molecules and materials. It provides a framework for understanding the electronic structure of molecules, the properties of materials, and the dynamics of chemical reactions.

#### 1.1b.1 Mean-Field Methods

Mean-field methods are a class of approximation methods used in quantum mechanics to solve the Many-Body Schrödinger Equation. These methods are based on the mean-field approximation, which assumes that the particles in the system are influenced by an average field created by all the other particles, rather than the individual fields of each particle.

The mean-field approximation is particularly useful for systems with a large number of particles, where the interactions between particles become too complex to handle analytically. It allows us to reduce the MBSE to a set of coupled one-body equations, which can be solved more easily.

#### 1.1b.2 Perturbation Theory

Perturbation theory is another approximation method used in quantum mechanics to solve the MBSE. It is based on the assumption that the system can be described by a simpler Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_0$ in the absence of certain interactions. The full Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ is then treated as a perturbation.

The perturbation theory provides a systematic way to calculate the effects of the perturbation on the system. It starts by solving the Schrödinger equation for the unperturbed system, and then corrects the solution by including terms that account for the perturbation.

#### 1.1b.3 Density Functional Theory

Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a computational method used to solve the MBSE. It is based on the concept of the one-body density matrix, which describes the probability distribution of the particles in the system.

The DFT provides a way to calculate the one-body density matrix of the system, which can then be used to calculate various properties of the system, such as the total energy, the electronic structure, and the response to external perturbations.

In the next sections, we will delve deeper into these approximation methods and discuss their applications in the study of molecular and extended systems.

#### 1.1c Applications and Examples

The Many-Body Schrödinger Equation (MBSE) is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that describes the behavior of a system of interacting particles. It is used in a wide range of applications, from the study of molecular systems to the analysis of extended systems. In this section, we will discuss some specific examples of how the MBSE is applied in computational quantum mechanics.

##### Molecular Systems

In the study of molecular systems, the MBSE is used to calculate the electronic structure of molecules. This is done by solving the Schrödinger equation for the molecule, which involves solving a set of coupled differential equations for the wave function of the system. The solutions to these equations provide information about the electronic orbitals of the molecule, which can be used to calculate properties such as the ionization energy, the electron affinity, and the heat of formation.

For example, consider the molecule H<sub>2</sub>. The MBSE for this system can be written as:

$$
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x_1, x_2, t) = \hat{H}\Psi(x_1, x_2, t)
$$

where $\Psi(x_1, x_2, t)$ is the wave function of the system, $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, and $i\hbar$ is the imaginary unit times the reduced Planck's constant. The Hamiltonian operator for this system can be written as:

$$
\hat{H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} - \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r}
$$

where $\mu$ is the reduced mass of the molecule, $e$ is the charge of the electron, $r$ is the distance between the electrons, and $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.

##### Extended Systems

In the study of extended systems, the MBSE is used to calculate the properties of materials. This is done by solving the Schrödinger equation for the material, which involves solving a set of coupled differential equations for the wave function of the system. The solutions to these equations provide information about the electronic band structure of the material, which can be used to calculate properties such as the conductivity, the optical properties, and the magnetic properties.

For example, consider a one-dimensional metal wire. The MBSE for this system can be written as:

$$
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x_1, x_2, ..., x_N, t) = \hat{H}\Psi(x_1, x_2, ..., x_N, t)
$$

where $\Psi(x_1, x_2, ..., x_N, t)$ is the wave function of the system, $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, and $i\hbar$ is the imaginary unit times the reduced Planck's constant. The Hamiltonian operator for this system can be written as:

$$
\hat{H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} - \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r}
$$

where $m$ is the mass of the electron, $e$ is the charge of the electron, $r$ is the distance between the electrons, and $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.

In the next section, we will discuss some specific examples of how the MBSE is applied in computational quantum mechanics.




#### 1.1c Physical Interpretation

The Many-Body Schrödinger Equation (MBSE) is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that describes the time evolution of a system of interacting particles. It is a complex equation, and its physical interpretation is crucial for understanding the behavior of molecular and extended systems.

The physical interpretation of the MBSE is rooted in the concept of wave-particle duality. The wave function, $\Psi(x_1, x_2, ..., x_N, t)$, is interpreted as a wave that propagates through space and time, carrying information about the state of the system. The square of the absolute value of the wave function, $|\Psi(x_1, x_2, ..., x_N, t)|^2$, gives the probability density of finding the particles at a given point in space and time.

The Hamiltonian operator, $\hat{H}$, in the MBSE represents the total energy of the system. It is a sum of the one-body Hamiltonian, which describes the energy of a single particle, and the two-body Hamiltonian, which describes the interaction energy between two particles. The one-body Hamiltonian is given by:

$$
\hat{H}_1 = \sum_{i=1}^N \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_i} \nabla^2_{x_i} - \sum_{j=1}^{N_e} \frac{Z_j e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r_{ij}} \right)
$$

and the two-body Hamiltonian is given by:

$$
\hat{H}_2 = \sum_{i<j}^N \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r_{ij}
$$

where $m_i$ is the mass of particle $i$, $Z_j$ is the nuclear charge of nucleus $j$, $e$ is the elementary charge, $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, and $r_{ij}$ is the distance between particles $i$ and $j$.

The MBSE is a powerful tool for studying molecular and extended systems. It allows us to calculate the energy of the system, the forces between particles, and the probability of finding particles at a given point in space and time. However, due to its complexity, it is often necessary to use approximation methods, such as mean-field methods and perturbation theory, to solve the MBSE.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into these approximation methods and their applications in computational quantum mechanics.




#### 1.2a Basics of Density Functional Theory

Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a computational method used in quantum mechanics to study the electronic structure of molecules and extended systems. It is based on the concept of the electron density, which is a fundamental quantity in quantum mechanics. The electron density, $\rho(\vec{r})$, is defined as the probability density of finding an electron at a point $\vec{r}$ in space.

The central equation of DFT is the Kohn-Sham equation, which is a set of coupled integro-differential equations. The Kohn-Sham equation is derived from the mean-field approximation of the Many-Body Schrödinger Equation (MBSE). The mean-field approximation assumes that the one-body potential experienced by each electron is determined by the average field of all the other electrons, rather than the instantaneous field of all the other electrons. This approximation greatly simplifies the problem, making it tractable for computational methods.

The Kohn-Sham equation can be written as:

$$
\left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V_{ext}(\vec{r}) + V_{H}(\vec{r}) + V_{XC}(\vec{r})\right]\phi_i(\vec{r}) = \epsilon_i \phi_i(\vec{r})
$$

where $V_{ext}(\vec{r})$ is the external potential, $V_{H}(\vec{r})$ is the Hartree potential, $V_{XC}(\vec{r})$ is the exchange-correlation potential, $\phi_i(\vec{r})$ is the Kohn-Sham orbital, and $\epsilon_i$ is the Kohn-Sham energy.

The Kohn-Sham equation is solved self-consistently, meaning that the potentials $V_{ext}(\vec{r})$, $V_{H}(\vec{r})$, and $V_{XC}(\vec{r})$ are determined by the electron density $\rho(\vec{r})$, which is calculated from the Kohn-Sham orbitals $\phi_i(\vec{r})$. This self-consistency ensures that the Kohn-Sham orbitals accurately describe the electronic structure of the system.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical formulation of DFT, including the definition of the exchange-correlation potential and the variational principle that underlies the Kohn-Sham equation.

#### 1.2b Exchange-Correlation Energy

The exchange-correlation energy, $E_{XC}$, is a key component of the Kohn-Sham equation. It accounts for the correlation between electrons, which is neglected in the mean-field approximation of the MBSE. The exchange-correlation energy is defined as:

$$
E_{XC} = T_{XC} - \frac{1}{2} \iint \frac{\rho(\vec{r}_1)\rho(\vec{r}_2)}{r_{12}} d\vec{r}_1 d\vec{r}_2
$$

where $T_{XC}$ is the exchange-correlation kinetic energy, $r_{12}$ is the distance between electrons at $\vec{r}_1$ and $\vec{r}_2$, and the integral is over all space.

The exchange-correlation kinetic energy, $T_{XC}$, is a non-local quantity that accounts for the antisymmetry of the wave function of a system of identical fermions. It is typically evaluated using a local approximation, such as the LDA or GGA, which introduces additional parameters that are adjusted to reproduce the properties of a reference system.

The exchange-correlation potential, $V_{XC}$, is defined as the functional derivative of the exchange-correlation energy with respect to the electron density:

$$
V_{XC}(\vec{r}) = \frac{\delta E_{XC}}{\delta \rho(\vec{r})}
$$

The exchange-correlation potential is used in the Kohn-Sham equation to account for the correlation between electrons. It is a key component of DFT, as it allows for the accurate description of the electronic structure of molecules and extended systems.

In the next section, we will discuss the variational principle that underlies the Kohn-Sham equation, and how it is used to solve the DFT equations of motion.

#### 1.2c Applications of Density Functional Theory

Density Functional Theory (DFT) has been widely applied in various fields of quantum mechanics, including molecular and extended systems. The theory has been particularly useful in the study of electronic structure, energy levels, and optical properties of molecules.

One of the most significant applications of DFT is in the field of computational chemistry. DFT has been used to calculate the electronic structure of molecules, including the ground state and excited states. This has been particularly useful in the study of molecular systems with complex electronic structures, such as transition metal complexes and organic molecules.

In the field of materials science, DFT has been used to study the electronic properties of materials, including semiconductors, metals, and insulators. The theory has been used to calculate the electronic band structure of materials, which provides information about the energy levels of the electrons in the material. This has been particularly useful in the design and optimization of materials for various applications, including solar cells, batteries, and catalysts.

DFT has also been applied in the field of condensed matter physics, where it has been used to study the electronic properties of systems with many interacting particles, such as liquids and solids. The theory has been used to calculate the electronic structure of these systems, including the ground state and excited states. This has been particularly useful in the study of phase transitions and critical phenomena in these systems.

In the field of quantum mechanics, DFT has been used to study the electronic structure of extended systems, including atoms, molecules, and materials. The theory has been used to calculate the electronic structure of these systems, including the ground state and excited states. This has been particularly useful in the study of the behavior of electrons in these systems under various conditions, such as external electric and magnetic fields.

In the next section, we will discuss the variational principle that underlies the DFT equations of motion, and how it is used to solve the DFT equations of motion.

#### 1.3a Basics of Hartree-Fock Method

The Hartree-Fock method is a mean-field method used in quantum mechanics to solve the equations of motion for a system of interacting particles. It is particularly useful in the study of molecular and extended systems, where the interactions between particles can be complex and difficult to calculate directly.

The Hartree-Fock method is based on the mean-field approximation, which assumes that each particle in the system is influenced by an average field created by all the other particles, rather than the instantaneous field created by all the other particles. This approximation greatly simplifies the equations of motion, making them tractable for numerical solution.

The Hartree-Fock method is based on the following assumptions:

1. The wave function of the system can be written as a single Slater determinant, which is a product of one-particle wave functions. This assumption is based on the antisymmetry principle of quantum mechanics for systems of identical fermions.
2. The one-particle wave functions are determined by minimizing the total energy of the system. This is achieved by solving the Hartree-Fock equations of motion.

The Hartree-Fock equations of motion can be written as:

$$
\left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V_{ext}(\vec{r}) + V_{H}(\vec{r}) + V_{XC}(\vec{r})\right]\phi_i(\vec{r}) = \epsilon_i \phi_i(\vec{r})
$$

where $V_{ext}(\vec{r})$ is the external potential, $V_{H}(\vec{r})$ is the Hartree potential, $V_{XC}(\vec{r})$ is the exchange-correlation potential, $\phi_i(\vec{r})$ is the one-particle wave function of particle $i$, and $\epsilon_i$ is the one-particle energy of particle $i$.

The Hartree-Fock method has been widely applied in various fields of quantum mechanics, including molecular and extended systems. It has been particularly useful in the study of electronic structure, energy levels, and optical properties of molecules.

In the next section, we will discuss the Hartree-Fock method in more detail, including the derivation of the Hartree-Fock equations of motion and the solution of these equations for various systems.

#### 1.3b Hartree-Fock Equations

The Hartree-Fock equations are a set of coupled integro-differential equations that describe the mean-field dynamics of a system of interacting particles. These equations are derived from the mean-field approximation of the many-body Schrödinger equation, which assumes that each particle in the system is influenced by an average field created by all the other particles, rather than the instantaneous field created by all the other particles.

The Hartree-Fock equations can be written as:

$$
\left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V_{ext}(\vec{r}) + V_{H}(\vec{r}) + V_{XC}(\vec{r})\right]\phi_i(\vec{r}) = \epsilon_i \phi_i(\vec{r})
$$

where $V_{ext}(\vec{r})$ is the external potential, $V_{H}(\vec{r})$ is the Hartree potential, $V_{XC}(\vec{r})$ is the exchange-correlation potential, $\phi_i(\vec{r})$ is the one-particle wave function of particle $i$, and $\epsilon_i$ is the one-particle energy of particle $i$.

The Hartree-Fock equations are solved self-consistently, meaning that the potentials $V_{H}(\vec{r})$ and $V_{XC}(\vec{r})$ are determined by the one-particle wave functions $\phi_i(\vec{r})$, which are in turn determined by the potentials. This self-consistency ensures that the Hartree-Fock equations accurately describe the mean-field dynamics of the system.

The Hartree-Fock equations can be solved numerically using various methods, such as the variational method, the perturbation method, or the density functional method. These methods provide a means to calculate the one-particle wave functions and energies of the system, which can then be used to study the electronic structure, energy levels, and optical properties of the system.

In the next section, we will discuss the Hartree-Fock equations in more detail, including the derivation of the equations and the solution of the equations for various systems.

#### 1.3c Applications of Hartree-Fock Method

The Hartree-Fock method is a powerful tool in computational quantum mechanics, with a wide range of applications in the study of molecular and extended systems. This method is particularly useful in systems where the interactions between particles are complex and difficult to calculate directly.

One of the most common applications of the Hartree-Fock method is in the study of electronic structure. The Hartree-Fock equations provide a means to calculate the one-particle wave functions and energies of the system, which can then be used to study the electronic structure of the system. This is particularly useful in the study of molecules, where the electronic structure plays a crucial role in determining the properties of the molecule.

The Hartree-Fock method is also used in the study of energy levels in systems. The one-particle energies calculated from the Hartree-Fock equations can be used to study the energy levels of the system. This is particularly useful in systems where the energy levels are closely spaced, such as in atoms and molecules.

The Hartree-Fock method is also used in the study of optical properties of systems. The one-particle wave functions calculated from the Hartree-Fock equations can be used to study the optical properties of the system, such as the absorption and emission spectra of molecules.

In addition to these applications, the Hartree-Fock method is also used in the study of phase transitions, the behavior of systems under external fields, and the dynamics of systems.

The Hartree-Fock method is implemented in a number of computational software packages, including the Gaussian suite of programs, the Spartan software, and the Turbomole software. These packages provide a user-friendly interface for performing Hartree-Fock calculations, and also include a range of other quantum chemistry features.

In the next section, we will discuss the Hartree-Fock method in more detail, including the derivation of the equations and the solution of the equations for various systems.
