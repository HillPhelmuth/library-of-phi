It is a multidisciplinary field that draws from various areas of chemistry, including organic chemistry, physical chemistry, and analytical chemistry, to study the chemical processes that are essential for life.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental concepts of biological chemistry, including the structure and function of biomolecules, the chemical reactions that occur within cells, and the techniques used to study these processes. We will also discuss the role of biological chemistry in various fields, such as medicine, agriculture, and environmental science.

### Subsection 1.1a: Basics of Biological Chemistry

Biological chemistry is a vast field that encompasses a wide range of topics. However, there are some fundamental concepts that are essential for understanding the rest of the book. In this subsection, we will cover these basics, including the structure and function of biomolecules, the principles of chemical equilibrium, and the techniques used to study biological processes.

#### Biomolecules

Biomolecules are the building blocks of life. They are the molecules that make up living organisms and are responsible for the structure and function of cells. Biomolecules can be broadly classified into four categories: proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids.

Proteins are large molecules that play a crucial role in many biological processes, including enzyme catalysis, cell signaling, and structural support. They are made up of long chains of amino acids, which are linked together by peptide bonds. The sequence of amino acids in a protein determines its structure and function.

Carbohydrates are another essential class of biomolecules. They are involved in energy storage and provide structural support to cells. Carbohydrates can be further classified into monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides, depending on their size and structure.

Lipids are hydrophobic molecules that are involved in energy storage and insulation. They are made up of hydrocarbons and are essential for maintaining the integrity of cell membranes. Lipids can be further classified into triglycerides, phospholipids, and steroids.

Nucleic acids are the molecules responsible for storing and transmitting genetic information. They are made up of nucleotides, which are composed of a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and a phosphate group. The two main types of nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA).

#### Chemical Equilibrium

Chemical equilibrium is a fundamental concept in biological chemistry. It refers to the state in which the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate, resulting in no net change in the concentrations of reactants and products. This state is governed by the principles of Le Chatelier's principle, which states that a system at equilibrium will respond to any disturbance by shifting in the direction that minimizes the effect of the disturbance.

In biological systems, chemical equilibrium plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis. For example, the equilibrium between carbon dioxide and bicarbonate ions in the blood is essential for maintaining the pH of the blood. Any disturbance in this equilibrium can have significant consequences for the organism.

#### Techniques in Biological Chemistry

Biological chemistry relies heavily on various techniques to study biological processes. These techniques include spectroscopy, chromatography, and mass spectrometry.

Spectroscopy is a technique used to study the interaction of light with matter. It is commonly used in biological chemistry to study the structure and function of biomolecules. Spectroscopy can provide information about the electronic structure of molecules, as well as their interactions with other molecules.

Chromatography is a technique used to separate mixtures of molecules based on their affinity for a stationary phase. It is commonly used in biological chemistry to purify biomolecules and to study their interactions with other molecules.

Mass spectrometry is a technique used to determine the mass and structure of molecules. It is essential in biological chemistry for identifying and characterizing biomolecules. Mass spectrometry can also provide information about the post-translational modifications of proteins, which are crucial for their function.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into these techniques and explore how they are used in biological chemistry research.

### Subsection 1.1a Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are a diverse group of organic compounds that play a crucial role in energy storage and providing structure in living organisms. They are made up of monosaccharides, which are simple sugars, and polysaccharides, which are long chains of monosaccharides. Carbohydrates are essential for life, and a deficiency in carbohydrates can lead to hypoglycemia, a condition characterized by abnormally low blood sugar levels.

#### Monosaccharides

Monosaccharides are simple sugars that are the building blocks of carbohydrates. They are typically six-carbon molecules, although some may have five or seven carbons. Monosaccharides can be classified into three types: aldoses, ketoses, and amino sugars. Aldoses and ketoses are the most common types and are essential for life. Amino sugars are less common and are found in proteins and nucleic acids.

The structure of monosaccharides is crucial for their function. The carbon atoms in a monosaccharide are chiral, meaning they have a three-dimensional shape that can be right-handed or left-handed. The configuration of these carbon atoms determines the type of monosaccharide. For example, aldoses have a hydroxyl group on the terminal carbon atom, while ketoses have a ketone group on the terminal carbon atom.

#### Polysaccharides

Polysaccharides are long chains of monosaccharides that are essential for energy storage and providing structure in living organisms. They are typically made up of glucose, fructose, or galactose, and are classified into two types: starch and glycogen.

Starch is the primary storage form of carbohydrates in plants. It is a branched polymer of glucose and is used as a source of energy for plants. Starch is also used as a food source for many animals, including humans.

Glycogen is the primary storage form of carbohydrates in animals, including humans. It is a branched polymer of glucose and is used as a source of energy for the body. Glycogen is stored in the liver and muscles and is essential for maintaining blood sugar levels.

#### Carbohydrate Metabolism

Carbohydrates are essential for life, and their metabolism is crucial for maintaining energy levels in the body. The breakdown of carbohydrates is a complex process that involves several enzymes and cofactors. The end product of carbohydrate metabolism is pyruvate, which is then used in the Krebs cycle to produce ATP, the energy currency of the cell.

In addition to their role in energy production, carbohydrates also play a crucial role in cell signaling and communication. For example, the binding of glucose to the insulin receptor triggers a signaling cascade that leads to the uptake of glucose into cells. This process is essential for maintaining blood sugar levels and is disrupted in diseases such as diabetes.

In conclusion, carbohydrates are essential for life and play a crucial role in energy storage, providing structure, and cell signaling. Understanding the structure and function of carbohydrates is crucial for understanding the complex processes that occur within living organisms. 





### Subsection 1.1b Lipids

Lipids are another essential group of macromolecules in living organisms. They are hydrophobic molecules, meaning they do not mix well with water. Lipids are made up of hydrocarbons and are the only macromolecules that are not made up of polymers. The three main types of lipids are triglycerides, phospholipids, and steroids.

#### Triglycerides

Triglycerides are the most common type of lipid and are the primary form of fat in the body. They are made up of three fatty acid molecules attached to a glycerol backbone. Triglycerides are a major source of energy for the body, providing 9 kcal/g compared to 4 kcal/g for carbohydrates and proteins. They are also important for insulation and cushioning of organs, as well as for making up the core of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), which transport cholesterol throughout the body.

#### Phospholipids

Phospholipids are another important type of lipid. They are found in the plasma membrane of cells and are essential for maintaining the structure and function of the cell. Phospholipids are made up of a glycerol backbone with two fatty acid molecules attached and a phosphate group. The phosphate group gives phospholipids a negative charge, making them polar and able to interact with water. This allows phospholipids to form a bilayer with other phospholipids, creating a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic outer layer. This structure is crucial for the function of the plasma membrane.

#### Steroids

Steroids are a type of lipid that are important for a variety of functions in the body. They are made up of a four-ring structure with a hydroxyl group attached. Steroids are involved in a wide range of processes, including hormone production, cell signaling, and immune response. Cholesterol is a type of steroid and is an important component of plasma membranes. It is also a precursor for the production of other steroids, such as estrogen and testosterone.

Lipids play a crucial role in the body, from providing energy and insulation to maintaining the structure and function of cells. However, consuming too many lipids can lead to obesity, high cholesterol, and other health issues. Therefore, it is important to consume lipids in moderation and to maintain a healthy balance of lipids in the body.





### Subsection 1.1c Proteins

Proteins are another essential group of macromolecules in living organisms. They are made up of long chains of amino acids and are the only macromolecules that contain nitrogen. Proteins play a crucial role in a wide range of processes, including enzyme catalysis, structural support, and cell signaling.

#### Amino Acids

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. They are organic compounds that contain an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxyl group (-COOH). The side chain of an amino acid determines its properties and function. There are 20 common amino acids found in proteins, each with a unique side chain.

#### Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary Structure

The structure of a protein is determined by the sequence of amino acids in its primary structure. The primary structure of a protein is the linear sequence of amino acids that make up the protein. This sequence is determined by the genetic code and can vary greatly between different proteins.

The secondary structure of a protein refers to the local folding of the protein chain. The most common secondary structures are the α-helix and the β-sheet. The Phyre 2 program predicts the secondary structure of OCC-1 to be 52% α-helices, 6% β-sheets, and 70% disordered.

The tertiary structure of a protein refers to the overall three-dimensional shape of the protein. This structure is determined by the interactions between different regions of the protein chain. The predicted tertiary structure of OCC-1 is shown in the figure below.

The quaternary structure of a protein refers to the arrangement of multiple protein chains in a complex. This structure is important for the function of many proteins, as it allows for the proper interactions between different regions of the protein.

#### Post-Translational Modifications

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are chemical modifications that occur after a protein is synthesized. These modifications can alter the structure and function of the protein. OCC-1 is predicted to undergo the post-translational modifications of O-glycosylation, phosphorylation, and myristoylation.

#### Subcellular Location

The k-NN tool places OCC-1 in the nucleus of the cell with 65.2% certainty, 13% in the mitochondria, 8.7% in the vesicles of the secretory system, 4.3% cytoplasm, and 4.3% vacuole. This location is important for the function of OCC-1, as it is involved in the regulation of gene expression.

#### Homology

OCC-1 has no known paralogs. Paralogs are genes that are similar in sequence and function, but are found in different locations in the genome. OCC-1 has been found in mammalia, reptilia, amphibian, aves, and actinopterygii. The gene is not found in plants, protists, fungi, archaea, or bacteria. The most distant ortholog is the Oryzias latipers or the Japanese rice fish, which diverged from the human gene approximately 436.5 million years ago.

#### Expression

OCC-1 has moderate to high expression throughout the body, therefore OCC-1 is ubiquitously expressed in humans. Notably high expression in the kidney, skeletal muscle and pancreas and low expression in the heart. OCC-1 is involved in the regulation of gene expression, making its ubiquitous expression crucial for the proper functioning of the body.





### Subsection 1.1d Nucleic Acids

Nucleic acids are another essential group of macromolecules in living organisms. They are made up of long chains of nucleotides and are the only macromolecules that contain phosphorus. Nucleic acids play a crucial role in storing and transmitting genetic information, as well as in protein synthesis.

#### Nucleotides

Nucleotides are the building blocks of nucleic acids. They are organic compounds that contain a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and a phosphate group. The nitrogenous base can be either a purine (adenine or guanine) or a pyrimidine (cytosine, thymine, or uracil). The pentose sugar in DNA is deoxyribose, while in RNA it is ribose.

#### Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Structure

The structure of a nucleic acid is determined by the sequence of nucleotides in its primary structure. The primary structure of a nucleic acid is the linear sequence of nucleotides that make up the nucleic acid. This sequence is determined by the genetic code and can vary greatly between different nucleic acids.

The secondary structure of a nucleic acid refers to the local folding of the nucleotide chain. The most common secondary structures are the double helix in DNA and the single helix in RNA. The Phyre 2 program predicts the secondary structure of OCC-1 to be 52% double helix, 6% single helix, and 70% disordered.

The tertiary structure of a nucleic acid refers to the overall three-dimensional shape of the nucleic acid. This structure is determined by the interactions between different regions of the nucleotide chain. The predicted tertiary structure of OCC-1 is shown in the figure below.

#### Post-Translational Modifications

Post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs) are chemical modifications that occur after a nucleic acid is synthesized. These modifications can alter the structure and function of the nucleic acid. For example, the addition of a methyl group to the nitrogenous base of a nucleotide can affect its ability to bind to other molecules.
