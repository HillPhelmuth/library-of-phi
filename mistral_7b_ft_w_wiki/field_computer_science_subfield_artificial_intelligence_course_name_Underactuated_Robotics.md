### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the fascinating world of nonlinear dynamics of the simple pendulum. The simple pendulum is a classic example of a mechanical system that exhibits complex and nonlinear behavior. It is a system that is widely studied in physics and engineering due to its simplicity and the wealth of insights it provides into the behavior of more complex systems.

The simple pendulum is a system that consists of a mass attached to a string or rod, which is free to swing back and forth. The behavior of the pendulum is governed by the laws of physics, specifically the laws of motion and gravity. However, the behavior of the pendulum is not always predictable, especially when the pendulum is swinging at high speeds or when it is disturbed by external forces.

In this chapter, we will delve into the mathematical models that describe the behavior of the simple pendulum. We will explore the equations of motion, which are derived from the principles of conservation of energy and angular momentum. We will also discuss the concept of stability and how it applies to the simple pendulum.

Furthermore, we will explore the nonlinear dynamics of the simple pendulum. Nonlinear dynamics is a branch of mathematics that deals with systems that do not obey the principle of superposition, meaning that the output is not directly proportional to the input. The simple pendulum is a prime example of a nonlinear system, and its behavior can be quite complex and unpredictable.

Finally, we will discuss the applications of the simple pendulum in various fields, including robotics. The simple pendulum is a fundamental building block in the design of many robotic systems, and understanding its behavior is crucial for designing and controlling these systems.

In summary, this chapter will provide a comprehensive introduction to the nonlinear dynamics of the simple pendulum. We will explore the mathematical models, the concept of stability, and the applications of the simple pendulum in robotics. By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the simple pendulum and its role in the field of underactuated robotics.




### Section: 1.1 Dynamic programming and value iteration:

#### 1.1a Grid World Example

In this section, we will explore the concept of dynamic programming and value iteration through the example of a grid world. The grid world is a simple model that is often used to illustrate these concepts. It is a two-dimensional grid where an agent moves from one cell to another, trying to reach a goal cell.

The grid world can be represented as a state space, where each cell is a state. The agent starts at a starting state and moves to adjacent states by taking actions. The actions available to the agent are typically moving up, down, left, or right. The goal is to reach the goal state, which is usually a special cell that is designated as the goal.

The agent's task is to find a policy that will guide it from the starting state to the goal state. A policy is a mapping from states to actions. The agent learns the policy by exploring the state space and updating its beliefs about the state space.

Dynamic programming is a method for solving problems that involve making a sequence of decisions. In the context of the grid world, the agent makes a decision at each state, choosing an action to take. The goal is to find a policy that maximizes the total reward, which is the sum of the rewards at each state.

Value iteration is a method for solving dynamic programming problems. It starts with an initial guess for the value of each state, which is the expected total reward starting from that state. Then, it iteratively updates the values until they converge to the true values. The updated values represent the optimal policy.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical formulation of dynamic programming and value iteration, and how they apply to the grid world example.

#### 1.1b Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a powerful method for solving complex problems that involve making a sequence of decisions. In the context of the grid world, the agent makes a decision at each state, choosing an action to take. The goal is to find a policy that maximizes the total reward, which is the sum of the rewards at each state.

The dynamic programming approach to solving the grid world problem involves defining a value function that represents the maximum total reward that can be achieved from each state. The value function is defined recursively, with the value at the goal state being the reward at that state, and the value at other states being the maximum of the reward at that state plus the value of the next state, over all possible actions.

The value function can be represented as a vector, with each element representing the value at a particular state. The dynamic programming algorithm then iteratively updates the value vector until it converges to the true value vector. The updated value vector represents the optimal policy.

The dynamic programming algorithm can be formulated as follows:

1. Initialize the value vector $V$ with an initial guess for the value at each state.
2. Repeat until the value vector converges:
    1. For each state $s$ in the state space:
        1. For each action $a$ available at state $s$:
            1. Calculate the expected reward $r(s,a)$ from taking action $a$ at state $s$.
            2. Update the value at state $s$ as $V(s) = \max(V(s), r(s,a) + V(s'))$, where $s'$ is the next state after taking action $a$ at state $s$.
    2. Normalize the value vector $V$ to ensure that it sums to 1.
3. The resulting value vector $V$ represents the optimal policy.

The dynamic programming approach can be extended to handle more complex scenarios, such as multiple goals, stochastic rewards, and continuous state spaces. It can also be combined with other techniques, such as reinforcement learning, to handle more complex problems.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of value iteration, another method for solving dynamic programming problems.

#### 1.1c Value Iteration

Value iteration is another method for solving dynamic programming problems. It is particularly useful when the state space is large and the transition probabilities are unknown or difficult to calculate. The value iteration method iteratively updates the value function until it converges to the true value function.

The value iteration algorithm can be formulated as follows:

1. Initialize the value vector $V$ with an initial guess for the value at each state.
2. Repeat until the value vector converges:
    1. For each state $s$ in the state space:
        1. For each action $a$ available at state $s$:
            1. Calculate the expected reward $r(s,a)$ from taking action $a$ at state $s$.
            2. Update the value at state $s$ as $V(s) = \max(V(s), r(s,a) + V(s'))$, where $s'$ is the next state after taking action $a$ at state $s$.
    2. Normalize the value vector $V$ to ensure that it sums to 1.
3. The resulting value vector $V$ represents the optimal policy.

The value iteration method is similar to the policy iteration method, but it updates the value function in a global manner, rather than updating the policy in a local manner. This can lead to faster convergence, but it also requires more computational resources.

The value iteration method can be extended to handle more complex scenarios, such as multiple goals, stochastic rewards, and continuous state spaces. It can also be combined with other techniques, such as reinforcement learning, to handle more complex problems.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of policy iteration, another method for solving dynamic programming problems.

#### 1.1d Policy Iteration

Policy iteration is another method for solving dynamic programming problems. It is particularly useful when the state space is large and the transition probabilities are unknown or difficult to calculate. The policy iteration method iteratively updates the policy until it converges to the true policy.

The policy iteration algorithm can be formulated as follows:

1. Initialize the policy $\pi$ with an initial guess for the policy at each state.
2. Repeat until the policy converges:
    1. For each state $s$ in the state space:
        1. For each action $a$ available at state $s$:
            1. Calculate the expected reward $r(s,a)$ from taking action $a$ at state $s$.
            2. Update the policy at state $s$ as $\pi(s) = \arg\max_a r(s,a)$.
    2. Normalize the policy $\pi$ to ensure that it sums to 1.
3. The resulting policy $\pi$ represents the optimal policy.

The policy iteration method is similar to the value iteration method, but it updates the policy in a local manner, rather than updating the value function in a global manner. This can lead to slower convergence, but it also requires less computational resources.

The policy iteration method can be extended to handle more complex scenarios, such as multiple goals, stochastic rewards, and continuous state spaces. It can also be combined with other techniques, such as reinforcement learning, to handle more complex problems.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of stochastic control, which is a generalization of the deterministic control problems we have been discussing so far.

#### 1.1e Convergence and Optimality

In the context of dynamic programming and value iteration, the concepts of convergence and optimality are crucial. Convergence refers to the property of the algorithm to reach a stable solution, while optimality refers to the quality of the solution.

The value iteration and policy iteration methods are both iterative algorithms that aim to find the optimal policy. The convergence of these algorithms is guaranteed under certain conditions. For instance, the value iteration algorithm converges if the state space is finite and the transition probabilities are positive. Similarly, the policy iteration algorithm converges if the state space is finite and the transition probabilities are positive and the policy is improved at each iteration.

The optimality of the solution found by these algorithms depends on the quality of the initial guess for the value function or policy. If the initial guess is close to the true value function or policy, the algorithms will converge quickly and the solution will be close to optimal. However, if the initial guess is far from the true value function or policy, the algorithms may converge slowly and the solution may be far from optimal.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of stochastic control, which is a generalization of the deterministic control problems we have been discussing so far.

#### 1.1f Applications in Robotics

The concepts of dynamic programming and value iteration have found extensive applications in the field of robotics. Robotics is a multidisciplinary field that involves the design, construction, operation, and use of robots. Robots are automated machines that can assist humans in a variety of tasks, from manufacturing and assembly to exploration and rescue operations.

One of the key challenges in robotics is the development of algorithms that can guide a robot through a complex environment to achieve a specific goal. This is where the concepts of dynamic programming and value iteration come into play. These algorithms can be used to find the optimal path for the robot to follow, taking into account the robot's capabilities and the environment's constraints.

For instance, consider a robot tasked with navigating through a cluttered environment to reach a target. The robot's task can be formulated as a dynamic programming problem, where the state space represents the robot's possible configurations, the actions represent the robot's possible movements, and the reward function represents the robot's progress towards the target.

The value iteration and policy iteration methods can then be used to find the optimal policy for the robot, i.e., the sequence of movements that maximizes the robot's progress towards the target. The convergence and optimality properties of these algorithms ensure that the robot will eventually reach the target, and that the solution found will be close to optimal if the initial guess for the value function or policy is close to the true value function or policy.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the application of these concepts in the field of robotics, exploring specific examples and discussing the challenges and opportunities that arise.




#### 1.1b Double Integrator Example

In this section, we will explore the concept of dynamic programming and value iteration through the example of a double integrator. The double integrator is a simple system that is often used to illustrate these concepts. It is a system with two integrators in series, and the goal is to control the system to reach a desired state.

The double integrator can be represented as a state space, where each state is a vector of the system's states. The system starts at a starting state and evolves over time by applying a control input. The control input is a vector of control values, one for each integrator. The goal is to find a control policy that will guide the system from the starting state to the desired state.

The system's dynamics can be described by the following differential equation:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \mathbf{x}(t) + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} u(t)
$$

where $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the state vector, $u(t)$ is the control input, and $\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t)$ is the derivative of the state vector.

The goal is to find a control policy that will drive the system from the starting state $\mathbf{x}_0$ to the desired state $\mathbf{x}_f$ in the shortest time. The control policy is a mapping from states to control values. The agent learns the policy by exploring the state space and updating its beliefs about the state space.

Dynamic programming is a method for solving problems that involve making a sequence of decisions. In the context of the double integrator, the agent makes a decision at each state, choosing a control value to apply. The goal is to find a policy that minimizes the total cost, which is the sum of the costs at each state.

Value iteration is a method for solving dynamic programming problems. It starts with an initial guess for the value of each state, which is the expected total cost starting from that state. Then, it iteratively updates the values until they converge to the true values. The updated values represent the optimal policy.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical formulation of dynamic programming and value iteration, and how they apply to the double integrator example.

#### 1.1c Value Iteration

Value iteration is a method used in dynamic programming to solve problems that involve making a sequence of decisions. It is particularly useful in the context of the double integrator, where the goal is to find a control policy that will guide the system from the starting state to the desired state.

The value iteration method starts with an initial guess for the value of each state, which is the expected total cost starting from that state. The values are then updated iteratively until they converge to the true values. The updated values represent the optimal policy.

The value iteration algorithm for the double integrator can be described as follows:

1. Initialize the value function $V(\mathbf{x})$ for all states $\mathbf{x}$ to a large positive value.
2. Repeat until convergence:
    1. For each state $\mathbf{x}$, calculate the expected cost $c(\mathbf{x})$ from that state.
    2. Update the value function $V(\mathbf{x})$ for that state to the expected cost.
3. The optimal policy is given by the state with the lowest value.

The expected cost $c(\mathbf{x})$ can be calculated using the system's dynamics and the current value function. The dynamics of the system are described by the differential equation:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \mathbf{x}(t) + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} u(t)
$$

The value function $V(\mathbf{x})$ represents the minimum cost from the state $\mathbf{x}$ to the desired state $\mathbf{x}_f$. It is updated iteratively until it converges to the true value. The optimal policy is then given by the state with the lowest value.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of dynamic programming and value iteration in the context of the simple pendulum.

## Chapter: Underactuated Robotics: Theory and Applications

### Introduction

In the realm of robotics, the concept of underactuation plays a pivotal role. Underactuation refers to the condition where the number of actuators (devices that cause motion) is less than the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) of the system. This chapter, titled "Underactuated Robotics: Theory and Applications," delves into the intricacies of underactuation, exploring its theoretical underpinnings and practical applications.

The chapter begins by providing a comprehensive overview of underactuation, explaining its significance in the field of robotics. It then proceeds to discuss the mathematical models that describe underactuated systems, using the popular TeX and LaTeX style syntax. For instance, the equation `$\Delta w = ...$` is used to represent the change in a variable `$w$`.

Following this, the chapter delves into the theory of underactuation, exploring the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of underactuated systems. This includes a discussion on the challenges posed by underactuation, such as the issue of instability, and the strategies used to overcome these challenges.

The latter part of the chapter focuses on the applications of underactuation in robotics. This includes a discussion on how underactuation is used in the design of robots with complex movements, as well as in the development of robots that can operate in challenging environments.

Throughout the chapter, real-world examples and case studies are used to illustrate the concepts discussed, providing a practical perspective on the theory of underactuation. By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the theory and applications of underactuation in robotics.




#### 1.1c Pendulum Example

In this section, we will explore the concept of dynamic programming and value iteration through the example of a pendulum. The pendulum is a classic example in physics and is often used to illustrate these concepts. It is a system with a mass attached to a string or rod, and the goal is to control the system to reach a desired state.

The pendulum can be represented as a state space, where each state is a vector of the system's states. The system starts at a starting state and evolves over time by applying a control input. The control input is a vector of control values, one for each degree of freedom. The goal is to find a control policy that will guide the system from the starting state to the desired state.

The system's dynamics can be described by the following differential equation:

$$
\ddot{\theta} = -\frac{g}{l} \sin(\theta)
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle of the pendulum, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $l$ is the length of the pendulum.

The goal is to find a control policy that will drive the system from the starting state $\theta_0$ to the desired state $\theta_f$ in the shortest time. The control policy is a mapping from states to control values. The agent learns the policy by exploring the state space and updating its beliefs about the state space.

Dynamic programming is a method for solving problems that involve making a sequence of decisions. In the context of the pendulum, the agent makes a decision at each state, choosing a control value to apply. The goal is to find a policy that minimizes the total cost, which is the sum of the costs at each state.

Value iteration is a method for solving dynamic programming problems. It starts with an initial guess for the value of each state, which is the expected total cost starting from that state. Then, it iteratively updates the values until they converge to the optimal values.

In the next section, we will explore the application of these concepts to the control of a real-world pendulum system.




#### 1.2a Controllability

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of dynamic programming and value iteration through the example of a pendulum. We saw how the pendulum can be represented as a state space, and how a control policy can be used to guide the system from the starting state to the desired state. In this section, we will explore the concept of controllability, which is a fundamental concept in control theory.

Controllability is a property of a system that describes whether it is possible to guide the system from any initial state to any final state in a finite time period. In other words, a system is controllable if it is possible to apply a control input that will drive the system from any initial state to any final state.

For a discrete-time linear state-space system, the state equation is given by:

$$
\mathbf{x}(k+1) = A\mathbf{x}(k) + B\mathbf{u}(k)
$$

where $A$ is an $n \times n$ matrix and $B$ is an $n \times r$ matrix (i.e., $\mathbf{u}$ is $r$ inputs collected in a $r \times 1$ vector). The test for controllability is that the $n \times nr$ matrix

$$
\mathcal C = [B \quad AB]
$$

has full row rank (i.e., $\operatorname{rank}(\mathcal C) = n$). That is, if the system is controllable, $\mathcal C$ will have $n$ columns that are linearly independent; if $n$ columns of $\mathcal C$ are linearly independent, each of the $n$ states is reachable by giving the system proper inputs through the variable $u(k)$.

### Derivation

Given the state $\mathbf{x}(0)$ at an initial time, arbitrarily denoted as "k"=0, the state equation gives $\mathbf{x}(1) = A\mathbf{x}(0) + B\mathbf{u}(0)$, then $\mathbf{x}(2) = A\mathbf{x}(1) + B\mathbf{u}(1)= A^2\mathbf{x}(0)+AB\mathbf{u}(0)+B\mathbf{u}(1)$, and so on with repeated back-substitutions of the state variable, eventually yielding

$$
\mathbf{x}(k) = A^k\mathbf{x}(0) + \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} A^iB\mathbf{u}(k-i-1)
$$

Imposing any desired value of the state vector $\mathbf{x}(n)$ on the left side, this can always be solved for the stacked vector of control vectors if and only if the matrix of matrices at the beginning of the right side has full row rank.

### Example

For example, consider the case when $n=2$ and $r=1$ (i.e., only one control input). Thus, $B$ and $AB$ are $2 \times 1$ vectors. If $\begin{bmatrix}B & AB\end{bmatrix}$ has rank 2 (full rank), and so $B$ and $AB$ are linearly independent and span the entire plane. If the rank is 1, then $B$ and $AB$ are collinear and do not span the entire plane, and the system is not controllable.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of observability, which is another fundamental concept in control theory.

#### 1.2b Observability

Observability is another fundamental concept in control theory that is closely related to controllability. While controllability deals with the ability to guide the system from any initial state to any final state, observability deals with the ability to determine the system's current state based on its past and present outputs.

For a discrete-time linear state-space system, the output equation is given by:

$$
\mathbf{z}(k) = C\mathbf{x}(k) + D\mathbf{u}(k)
$$

where $C$ is an $m \times n$ matrix and $D$ is an $m \times r$ matrix (i.e., $\mathbf{u}$ is $r$ inputs collected in a $r \times 1$ vector). The test for observability is that the $m \times n$ matrix

$$
\mathcal O = [C \quad AC]
$$

has full column rank (i.e., $\operatorname{rank}(\mathcal O) = m$). That is, if the system is observable, $\mathcal O$ will have $m$ rows that are linearly independent; if $m$ rows of $\mathcal O$ are linearly independent, each of the $n$ states can be determined by observing the system's outputs.

### Derivation

Given the output $\mathbf{z}(0)$ at an initial time, arbitrarily denoted as "k"=0, the output equation gives $\mathbf{z}(1) = C\mathbf{x}(0) + D\mathbf{u}(0)$, then $\mathbf{z}(2) = C\mathbf{x}(1) + D\mathbf{u}(1)= CA\mathbf{x}(0) + CD\mathbf{u}(0) + D\mathbf{u}(1)$, and so on with repeated back-substitutions of the output variable, eventually yielding

$$
\mathbf{z}(k) = CA^k\mathbf{x}(0) + \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} CA^iD\mathbf{u}(k-i-1)
$$

Imposing any desired value of the output vector $\mathbf{z}(n)$ on the left side, this can always be solved for the stacked vector of state vectors if and only if the matrix of matrices at the beginning of the right side has full column rank.

### Example

For example, consider the case when $n=2$ and $m=1$ (i.e., only one output). Thus, $C$ and $AC$ are $1 \times 2$ vectors. If $\begin{bmatrix}C & AC\end{bmatrix}$ has rank 1 (full rank), and so $C$ and $AC$ are linearly independent and span the entire column plane. If the rank is 0, then $C$ and $AC$ are collinear and do not span the entire column plane, and the system is not observable.

#### 1.2c Stability

Stability is a crucial concept in the study of nonlinear dynamics and control systems. It refers to the ability of a system to return to a state of equilibrium after being disturbed. In the context of underactuated robotics, stability is a key factor in determining the performance and reliability of the system.

For a discrete-time linear state-space system, the stability is determined by the eigenvalues of the state transition matrix $A$. If all the eigenvalues of $A$ have magnitudes less than 1, the system is said to be stable. This means that the system's state will decay to zero over time, indicating that the system has returned to its equilibrium state.

The stability of a system can be analyzed using the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion. This criterion provides a systematic way to determine the stability of a system by examining the signs of the elements in a Routh array. If all the elements in the Routh array have the same sign, the system is stable. If any element changes sign, the system is unstable.

The Routh array for a third-order system is given by:

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & a_3 & b_3 \\
a_2 & a_4 & b_4 \\
a_1 & a_5 & b_5
\end{array}
$$

where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are the coefficients of the characteristic equation $1 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3 = 0$. If all the elements in this array have the same sign, the system is stable.

In the context of underactuated robotics, stability is crucial for ensuring the smooth and reliable operation of the system. It allows the system to recover from disturbances and maintain its desired state.

#### 1.2b Partial Feedback Linearization

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of controllability and how it applies to discrete-time linear state-space systems. In this section, we will explore the concept of partial feedback linearization, which is a technique used to simplify the control of nonlinear systems.

Partial feedback linearization is a method of approximating a nonlinear system by a linear system around a specific operating point. This is achieved by linearizing the nonlinear system around the operating point, resulting in a linear system that approximates the behavior of the nonlinear system in the vicinity of the operating point.

The process of partial feedback linearization involves two main steps: finding the operating point and linearizing the system around this point. The operating point is typically chosen to be the equilibrium point of the system, where all inputs are set to zero. Once the operating point is determined, the system is linearized by approximating the nonlinear functions with their first-order Taylor series expansions.

The resulting linear system is then used to design a control law that stabilizes the system around the operating point. This control law is typically a feedback law, where the control input is determined based on the system's current state. The feedback law is designed such that the system's state is driven to the operating point, where it remains stable.

Partial feedback linearization is a powerful tool for controlling nonlinear systems. It allows us to approximate complex nonlinear systems with simpler linear systems, making it easier to design control laws that stabilize the system. However, it is important to note that the accuracy of the approximation depends on the choice of the operating point. If the operating point is not chosen carefully, the resulting linear system may not accurately represent the behavior of the nonlinear system, leading to poor control performance.

In the next section, we will explore the application of partial feedback linearization to the control of the acrobot and cart-pole systems.

#### 1.2c Stability Analysis

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of partial feedback linearization and how it can be used to simplify the control of nonlinear systems. In this section, we will explore the concept of stability analysis, which is a crucial aspect of understanding the behavior of a system.

Stability analysis is the process of determining whether a system is stable, marginally stable, or unstable. A system is said to be stable if its state remains bounded for all initial conditions. A system is marginally stable if its state approaches infinity for some initial conditions and remains bounded for others. A system is unstable if its state approaches infinity for all initial conditions.

The stability of a system can be analyzed using various methods, such as Lyapunov stability analysis, Bode stability analysis, and Nyquist stability analysis. These methods provide a systematic way to determine the stability of a system and can be used to design control laws that stabilize the system.

In the context of underactuated robotics, stability analysis is crucial for understanding the behavior of the system and designing control laws that can stabilize the system. For example, in the case of the acrobot and cart-pole systems, understanding the stability of the system can help us design control laws that can stabilize the system and prevent it from falling over.

In the next section, we will explore the application of stability analysis to the acrobot and cart-pole systems.

#### 1.2d Applications in Robotics

In this section, we will explore the applications of the concepts discussed in the previous sections to the field of robotics. Specifically, we will focus on the acrobot and cart-pole systems, which are classic examples of underactuated robotic systems.

The acrobot is a two-degree-of-freedom robot that can be used to study the dynamics of underactuated systems. It consists of a base joint that rotates about the vertical axis and a second joint that rotates about the horizontal axis. The acrobot can be controlled by applying torques to the joints, which can be used to move the robot in various ways.

The cart-pole system is another classic example of an underactuated system. It consists of a cart that can move along a horizontal track and a pole that is attached to the cart. The cart-pole system can be controlled by applying forces to the cart, which can be used to move the pole in various ways.

Both the acrobot and cart-pole systems are examples of underactuated systems, which are systems that have fewer actuators than degrees of freedom. This makes them inherently unstable and challenging to control. However, by understanding the dynamics of these systems and applying the concepts of partial feedback linearization and stability analysis, we can design control laws that can stabilize these systems and allow them to perform complex tasks.

One of the key advantages of adaptive control is its ability to handle uncertainties in the system dynamics. This makes it a powerful tool for controlling complex systems such as underactuated robots.

However, adaptive control also has some limitations. For instance, it requires a model of the system dynamics, which may not always be available. Additionally, the optimization problem may be difficult to solve, especially for nonlinear systems.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of adaptive control in the context of underactuated robotics. We will explore how this method can be used to control the motion of a robot in the presence of uncertainties in the system dynamics, and how it can be extended to handle nonlinear systems.

#### 1.3u Passivity-Based Control

Passivity-Based Control is a method of controlling a system that is designed to exploit the passivity properties of the system. It is often used in systems where the system dynamics are not known exactly or where there are disturbances that can affect the system dynamics. In this section, we will discuss the basics of passivity-based control and its application in underactuated robotics.

Passivity-based control involves designing a control law that ensures the system remains passive. A system is said to be passive if the system's energy cannot increase without an external input. The goal is to find a control law that optimizes the system's performance while satisfying certain constraints.

In the context of underactuated robotics, passivity-based control can be used to control the motion of the robot in the presence of uncertainties in the system dynamics. This is particularly useful in systems where the system dynamics are complex and difficult to model accurately.

#### 1.3v Sliding Mode Control

Sliding Mode Control (SMC) is a method of controlling a system that is designed to drive the system's state to a predefined sliding surface. Once the system's state reaches the sliding surface, it remains on the surface for all future time. This makes SMC a powerful tool for controlling systems with complex dynamics and multiple constraints.

The basic idea behind SMC is to design a control law that forces the system's state to move along a predefined sliding surface. The control law is typically designed using a Lyapunov function, which is a scalar function that provides a measure of the system's energy. The Lyapunov function is used to ensure that the system's state moves along the sliding surface and remains on the surface for all future time.

In the context of underactuated robotics, SMC can be used to control the motion of the robot in the presence of uncertainties in the system dynamics. This is particularly useful in systems where the system dynamics are complex and difficult to model accurately.

One of the key advantages of SMC is its ability to handle uncertainties in the system dynamics. This makes it a powerful tool for controlling complex systems such as underactuated robots.

However, SMC also has some limitations. For instance, it requires a model of the system dynamics, which may not always be available. Additionally, the control law is typically designed using a Lyapunov function, which can be difficult to find for complex systems.

#### 1.3b Direct Methods

Direct methods are a class of optimization algorithms that are used to solve optimization problems directly, without the need for an iterative process. These methods are particularly useful in the context of underactuated robotics, where the system dynamics are often nonlinear and complex.

One of the key advantages of direct methods is their ability to handle nonlinear systems. Unlike iterative methods, which often rely on linear approximations of the system dynamics, direct methods can handle nonlinear systems directly. This makes them a powerful tool for controlling complex systems such as underactuated robots.

There are several types of direct methods, including the simplex method, the branch and bound method, and the cutting plane method. Each of these methods has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of method depends on the specific characteristics of the optimization problem.

The simplex method, for example, is a popular direct method that is used to solve linear optimization problems. It works by starting at a feasible solution and iteratively moving to adjacent feasible solutions until an optimal solution is found. The branch and bound method, on the other hand, is a divide and conquer method that is used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. It works by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem, and then combining the solutions to find the optimal solution to the original problem.

The cutting plane method is another popular direct method that is used to solve linear optimization problems. It works by adding cutting planes to the problem until the optimal solution is found. A cutting plane is a constraint that is added to the problem to eliminate infeasible solutions.

In the context of underactuated robotics, direct methods can be used to solve a variety of optimization problems. For example, they can be used to determine the optimal control law for a robot, or to optimize the design of a robot to achieve a desired performance.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of direct methods in the context of underactuated robotics. We will explore how these methods can be used to solve various optimization problems in the field of underactuated robotics.

#### 1.3c Indirect Methods

Indirect methods are another class of optimization algorithms that are used to solve optimization problems. Unlike direct methods, which solve the problem directly, indirect methods use an iterative process to find the optimal solution. These methods are particularly useful in the context of underactuated robotics, where the system dynamics are often nonlinear and complex.

One of the key advantages of indirect methods is their ability to handle nonlinear systems. Unlike direct methods, which often rely on linear approximations of the system dynamics, indirect methods can handle nonlinear systems directly. This makes them a powerful tool for controlling complex systems such as underactuated robots.

There are several types of indirect methods, including the gradient descent method, the Newton's method, and the conjugate gradient method. Each of these methods has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of method depends on the specific characteristics of the optimization problem.

The gradient descent method, for example, is a popular indirect method that is used to solve nonlinear optimization problems. It works by iteratively moving in the direction of the steepest descent of the objective function until an optimal solution is found. The Newton's method, on the other hand, is a more advanced indirect method that uses the second derivative of the objective function to find the optimal solution. It is particularly useful for solving nonlinear optimization problems with a single variable.

The conjugate gradient method is another popular indirect method that is used to solve linear optimization problems. It works by iteratively solving a series of linear subproblems until the optimal solution is found. The conjugate gradient method is particularly useful for solving large-scale optimization problems, where the objective function is linear and the system dynamics are nonlinear.

In the context of underactuated robotics, indirect methods can be used to solve a variety of optimization problems. For example, they can be used to determine the optimal control law for a robot, or to optimize the design of a robot to achieve a desired performance. In the next section, we will discuss the application of indirect methods in the context of underactuated robotics.

#### 1.3d Stochastic Methods

Stochastic methods are a class of optimization algorithms that are used to solve optimization problems. Unlike deterministic methods, which use a fixed set of rules to find the optimal solution, stochastic methods use randomness to explore the solution space. These methods are particularly useful in the context of underactuated robotics, where the system dynamics are often nonlinear and complex.

One of the key advantages of stochastic methods is their ability to handle nonlinear systems. Unlike deterministic methods, which often rely on linear approximations of the system dynamics, stochastic methods can handle nonlinear systems directly. This makes them a powerful tool for controlling complex systems such as underactuated robots.

There are several types of stochastic methods, including the genetic algorithm, the simulated annealing method, and the ant colony optimization method. Each of these methods has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of method depends on the specific characteristics of the optimization problem.

The genetic algorithm, for example, is a popular stochastic method that is used to solve nonlinear optimization problems. It works by mimicking the process of natural selection to find the optimal solution. The algorithm starts with a population of potential solutions and then iteratively applies genetic operators such as mutation and crossover to generate new solutions. The best solutions are then selected to form the next generation. This process continues until an optimal solution is found.

The simulated annealing method, on the other hand, is a more advanced stochastic method that is used to solve nonlinear optimization problems. It works by mimicking the process of annealing in metallurgy to find the optimal solution. The algorithm starts with a high "temperature" and then iteratively makes small changes to the current solution. If the new solution is better, it is accepted. If it is worse, it may still be accepted with a certain probability, which decreases as the temperature decreases. This process continues until the temperature reaches a low value, at which point the algorithm converges to the optimal solution.

The ant colony optimization method is another popular stochastic method that is used to solve nonlinear optimization problems. It works by mimicking the behavior of ants to find the optimal solution. The algorithm starts with a population of ants, each of which has a position and a pheromone trail in the solution space. The ants then move through the solution space, leaving pheromone trails behind them. The ants are attracted to areas with high pheromone concentrations, and the pheromone trails evaporate over time. This process continues until an optimal solution is found.

In the context of underactuated robotics, stochastic methods can be used to solve a variety of optimization problems. For example, they can be used to determine the optimal control law for a robot, or to optimize the design of a robot to achieve a desired performance. In the next section, we will discuss the application of stochastic methods in the context of underactuated robotics.

#### 1.3c Indirect Methods

Indirect methods are another class of optimization algorithms that are used to solve optimization problems indirectly, often through the use of surrogate models or approximations. These methods are particularly useful in the context of underactuated robotics, where the system dynamics are often nonlinear and complex.

One of the key advantages of indirect methods is their ability to handle nonlinear systems. Unlike direct methods, which often rely on linear approximations of the system dynamics, indirect methods can handle nonlinear systems directly. This makes them a powerful tool for controlling complex systems such as underactuated robots.

There are several types of indirect methods, including the genetic algorithm, the simulated annealing method, and the particle swarm optimization method. Each of these methods has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of method depends on the specific characteristics of the optimization problem.

The genetic algorithm, for example, is a popular indirect method that is inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics. It works by creating a population of potential solutions and then iteratively applying genetic operators such as mutation and crossover to generate new solutions. The fittest solutions are then selected to form the next generation, and the process is repeated until an optimal solution is found.

The simulated annealing method, on the other hand, is a probabilistic method that is inspired by the process of annealing in metallurgy. It works by starting at a high temperature and then gradually cooling down while iteratively making small changes to the solution. The changes are accepted if they improve the solution, and are rejected with a certain probability if they worsen the solution. This allows the algorithm to escape local optima and potentially find the global optimum.

The particle swarm optimization method is another popular indirect method that is inspired by the behavior of bird flocks or fish schools. It works by creating a population of particles, each of which represents a potential solution. The particles move through the solution space, and their positions and velocities are updated based on their own best position and the best position of the entire swarm. This allows the algorithm to explore the solution space and potentially find the global optimum.

In the context of underactuated robotics, indirect methods can be used to solve a variety of optimization problems. For example, they can be used to determine the optimal control law for a robot, or to optimize the design of a robot to achieve a specific task. The choice of method depends on the specific characteristics of the problem, such as the complexity of the system dynamics and the desired solution quality.

The rimless wheel is a simple walking model that has been extensively studied in the field of underactuated robotics. It is a two-degree-of-freedom system that can be used to model a variety of walking behaviors, from stable walking to unstable walking.

The rimless wheel model is defined by the following equations of motion:

\ddot{\phi} &= \frac{g}{l}\sin(\theta) - \frac{u}{I}\cos(\theta)

$$

where $\theta$ is the angle of the wheel, $\phi$ is the angle of the rimless wheel, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $l$ is the length of the wheel, $u$ is the control input, and $I$ is the moment of inertia of the wheel.

The rimless wheel model is a nonlinear system, and its behavior can be quite complex. However, it can be stabilized using a variety of control strategies, including feedback linearization and backstepping. These control strategies are based on the principles of nonlinear control theory, which is a key aspect of underactuated robotics.

The rimless wheel model is also a useful tool for studying the effects of disturbances on walking behavior. By introducing disturbances into the system, we can study how the system responds and how it can be controlled to maintain stability. This is particularly relevant in the context of underactuated robotics, where the system often operates in a disturbed environment.

\end{align*}
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle of the pendulum, $\phi$ is the angle of the inverted pendulum, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $l$ is the length of the pendulum, $u$ is the control input, and $I$ is the moment of inertia of the pendulum.

#### 1.4b Compass Gait

The Compass Gait is a simple walking model that has been developed to mimic the walking behavior of animals such as birds and insects. It is a two-degree-of-freedom system that can be used to model a variety of walking behaviors, from stable walking to unstable walking.

The Compass Gait model is defined by the following equations of motion:

$$
\begin{align*}
\ddot{\theta} &= \frac{g}{l}\sin(\theta) - \frac{u}{I}\cos(\theta) \\
\ddot{\phi} &= \frac{g}{l}\sin(\theta) - \frac{u}{I}\cos(\theta)
\end{align*}
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle of the compass gait, $\phi$ is the angle of the compass gait, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $l$ is the length of the compass gait, $u$ is the control input, and $I$ is the moment of inertia of the compass gait.

The Compass Gait model is a nonlinear system, and its behavior can be quite complex. However, it can be stabilized using a variety of control strategies, including feedback linearization and backstepping. These control strategies are based on the principles of nonlinear control theory, which is a key aspect of underactuated robotics.

The Compass Gait model is also a useful tool for studying the effects of disturbances on walking behavior. By introducing disturbances into the system, we can study how the system responds and how it can be controlled to maintain stability. This is particularly relevant in the context of underactuated robotics, where the system often operates in a disturbed environment.

In the next section, we will discuss another simple walking model, the Inverted Pendulum, and how it can be used to study the effects of disturbances on walking behavior.

#### 1.4c Geometric Interpretation

The geometric interpretation of the Compass Gait model provides a visual understanding of the system's behavior. This interpretation is based on the concept of a compass gait as a two-dimensional rotational system.

The compass gait can be represented as a point moving on a unit circle in the plane. The angle $\theta$ represents the angle of the compass gait, and the angle $\phi$ represents the angle of the compass gait. The point on the circle represents the position of the compass gait.

The equations of motion for the compass gait can be visualized as the point moving on the circle under the influence of a force. The force is directed towards the center of the circle and is proportional to the sine of the angle $\theta$. This force represents the gravitational force acting on the compass gait.

The control input $u$ can be interpreted as a torque acting on the compass gait. This torque is directed perpendicular to the plane of the compass gait and is proportional to the cosine of the angle $\theta$. This torque represents the control input used to stabilize the compass gait.

The moment of inertia $I$ represents the resistance of the compass gait to changes in its angular velocity. This resistance is proportional to the square of the length of the compass gait.

The geometric interpretation of the compass gait provides a useful tool for understanding the behavior of the system. It allows us to visualize the effects of the gravitational force and the control input on the position of the compass gait. This interpretation is particularly useful for understanding the stabilization of the compass gait and the effects of disturbances on its behavior.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of the compass gait model in the design of underactuated robots.

#### 1.4d Stability Analysis

The stability of the Compass Gait model is a critical aspect of its performance. Stability refers to the ability of the system to return to a steady state after being disturbed. In the context of the Compass Gait model, stability is crucial for maintaining the desired walking behavior.

The stability of the Compass Gait model can be analyzed using the Lyapunov stability theory. According to this theory, a system is stable if there exists a Lyapunov function $V(\theta, \phi)$ such that $V(\theta, \phi) \geq 0$ for all $\theta, \phi$ and $V(\theta, \phi) = 0$ only at $(\theta, \phi) = (0, 0)$.

The Lyapunov function $V(\theta, \phi)$ can be defined as the sum of the squares of the angles $\theta$ and $\phi$:

$$
V(\theta, \phi) = \theta^2 + \phi^2
$$

This function is positive for all $\theta, \phi$ except at $(\theta, \phi) = (0, 0)$, where it is zero. Therefore, the Compass Gait model is stable according to the Lyapunov stability theory.

The stability of the Compass Gait model can also be analyzed using the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion. According to this criterion, a system is stable if the Routh array formed by the coefficients of the characteristic equation of the system has all positive elements.

The characteristic equation of the Compass Gait model is given by:

$$
\lambda^2 + \frac{g}{l}\lambda + \frac{u}{I} = 0
$$

The Routh array formed by the coefficients of this equation is:

$$
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & \frac{g}{l} \\
\frac{g}{l} & \frac{u}{I}
\end{array}
$$

Since all elements of this array are positive, the Compass Gait model is stable according to the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of the Compass Gait model in the design of underactuated robots.

#### 1.4e Applications in Robotics

The Compass Gait model, due to its simplicity and stability, has found applications in various areas of robotics. In this section, we will discuss some of these applications, focusing on the design of underactuated robots.

##### Underactuated Robots

Underactuated robots are robots that have fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom. This is in contrast to fully actuated robots, which have one actuator for each degree of freedom. The design of underactuated robots is challenging due to the presence of redundant degrees of freedom, which can lead to instability and poor performance.

The Compass Gait model can be used to design underactuated robots that can walk stably. The model provides a simple and intuitive way to control the robot's walking behavior. The control input $u$ can be used to adjust the robot's walking speed and direction. The stability of the model ensures that the robot can maintain a steady walking behavior even in the presence of disturbances.

##### Bionic Knee

The Compass Gait model can also be used to design bionic knees, which are devices that assist people with knee injuries or disabilities to walk. The model can be used to control the movement of the knee joint, mimicking the natural walking behavior of humans.

The stability of the model is crucial for the performance of the bionic knee. It ensures that the knee joint can maintain a steady walking behavior, even in the presence of disturbances such as uneven ground or sudden changes in walking speed.

##### Other Applications

The Compass Gait model has been used in various other applications, including the design of walking robots, the control of prosthetic limbs, and the study of human walking behavior. Its simplicity and stability make it a versatile tool for researchers and engineers in the field of robotics.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of the Compass Gait model in the study of human walking behavior.

#### 1.4c Kneed Compass Gait

The Kneed Compass Gait is a variation of the Compass Gait model that incorporates the effects of a knee joint. This model is particularly useful for studying the effects of a knee joint on walking behavior, and for designing control strategies that can account for these effects.

The Kneed Compass Gait model is defined by the following equations of motion:

$$
\begin{align*}
\ddot{\theta} &= \frac{g}{l}\sin(\theta) - \frac{u}{I}\cos(\theta) \\
\ddot{\phi} &= \frac{g}{l}\sin(\theta) - \frac{u}{I}\cos(\theta) \\
\ddot{\psi} &= \frac{g}{l}\sin(\theta) - \frac{u}{I}\cos(\theta)
\end{align*}
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle of the compass gait, $\phi$ is the angle of the compass gait, $\psi$ is the angle of the knee joint, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $l$ is the length of the compass gait, $u$ is the control input, and $I$ is the moment of inertia of the compass gait.

The Kneed Compass Gait model is a nonlinear system, and its behavior can be quite complex. However, it can be stabilized using a variety of control strategies, including feedback linearization and backstepping. These control strategies are based on the principles of nonlinear control theory, which is a key aspect of underactuated robotics.

The Kneed Compass Gait model is also a useful tool for studying the effects of disturbances on walking behavior. By introducing disturbances into the system, we can study how the system responds and how it can be controlled to maintain stability. This is particularly relevant in the context of underactuated robotics, where the system often operates in a disturbed environment.

In the next section, we will discuss another simple walking model, the Inverted Pendulum, and how it can be used to study the effects of disturbances on walking behavior.

#### 1.4d Stability Analysis

Stability analysis is a crucial aspect of understanding the behavior of the Compass Gait and Kneed Compass Gait models. It involves studying the system's response to small perturbations around an equilibrium point. In the case of these models, the equilibrium point is when the system is at rest, i.e., $\dot{\theta} = \dot{\phi} = \dot{\psi} = 0$.

The stability of the system can be determined by analyzing the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of the system. The Jacobian matrix, $J$, is a matrix of partial derivatives and is defined as:

$$
J = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial \dot{\theta}}{\partial \theta} & \frac{\partial \dot{\theta}}{\partial \phi} & \frac{\partial \dot{\theta}}{\partial \psi} \\
\frac{\partial \dot{\phi}}{\partial \theta} & \frac{\partial \dot{\phi}}{\partial \phi} & \frac{\partial \dot{\phi}}{\partial \psi} \\
\frac{\partial \dot{\psi}}{\partial \theta} & \frac{\partial \dot{\psi}}{\partial \phi} & \frac{\partial \dot{\psi}}{\partial \psi}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix, $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, and $\lambda_3$, are the roots of the characteristic equation:

$$
det(J - \lambda I) = 0
$$

where $I$ is the identity matrix. If all the eigenvalues have negative real parts, the system is stable. If at least one eigenvalue has a positive real part, the system is unstable. If an eigenvalue is zero, the system is marginally stable.

For the Compass Gait model, the Jacobian matrix is:

$$
J = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{g}{l}\sin(\theta) - \frac{u}{I}\cos(\theta) & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \frac{g}{l}\sin(\theta) - \frac{u}{I}\cos(\theta) & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac{g}{l}\sin(\theta) - \frac{u}{I}\cos(\theta)
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The eigenvalues of this matrix are:

$$
\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \lambda_3 = \frac{g}{l}\sin(\theta) - \frac{u}{I}\cos(\theta)
$$

For the Kneed Compass Gait model, the Jacobian matrix is:

$$
J = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{g}{l}\sin(\theta) - \frac{u}{I}\cos(\theta) & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \frac{g}{l}\sin(\theta) - \frac{u}{I}\cos(\theta) & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac{g}{l}\sin(\theta) - \frac{u}{I}\cos(\theta)
$$

The eigenvalues of this matrix are:

$$
\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \lambda_3 = \frac{g}{l}\sin(\theta) - \frac{u}{I}\cos(\theta)
$$

These results show that the Compass Gait and Kneed Compass Gait models are marginally stable, as the eigenvalues are zero. This means that small perturbations around the equilibrium point can cause the system to deviate significantly from the equilibrium state. This is a key factor to consider when designing control strategies for these systems.

In the next section, we will discuss how to design control strategies that can stabilize these systems.

#### 1.4e Applications in Robotics

The Compass Gait and Kneed Compass Gait models have found significant applications in the field of robotics, particularly in the design of walking robots. The ability of these models to accurately represent the dynamics of a walking system makes them invaluable tools in the design and control of walking robots.

One of the key applications of these models is in the design of bionic knees. Bionic knees are a type of prosthetic limb that mimics the natural movement of a human knee. The Kneed Compass Gait model, with its ability to accurately represent the dynamics of a knee joint, is particularly useful in the design of these devices.

The Kneed Compass Gait model can be used to design control strategies that mimic the natural movement of a human knee. This is achieved by designing a control law that can stabilize the system around the desired equilibrium point. The stability analysis performed in the previous section provides a guide for designing such control laws.

For example, consider a bionic knee that is designed to mimic the natural movement of a human knee when walking. The desired equilibrium point for this system is when the knee joint is at a 90-degree angle, i.e., $\psi = \frac{\pi}{2}$. The control law can be designed to drive the system towards this equilibrium point by applying a control input that is proportional to the difference between the current angle of the knee joint and the desired angle.

The control law can be written as:

$$
u = -K(\psi - \frac{\pi}{2})
$$

where $K$ is a positive constant that determines the rate at which the system is driven towards the equilibrium point.

The stability of this system can be analyzed by studying the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of the system with the control law applied. If the eigenvalues have negative real parts, the system is stable and the control law can successfully drive the system towards the desired equilibrium point.

In conclusion, the Compass Gait and Kneed Compass Gait models, with their ability to accurately represent the dynamics of a walking system, are powerful tools in the design and control of walking robots. Their applications in the field of robotics are vast and continue to expand as researchers find new ways to leverage their potential.

## Chapter: Chapter 2: Underactuated Robotics

### Introduction

In the realm of robotics, the concept of underactuation plays a pivotal role. This chapter, "Underactuated Robotics," delves into the intricacies of this concept, providing a comprehensive understanding of its principles and applications. 

Underactuation refers to the state of a robot where the number of actuators is less than the number of degrees of freedom. This condition is often encountered in the design of robots due to various constraints such as cost, size, and power consumption. The challenge lies in controlling these underactuated robots, which is a complex task due to the presence of nonlinearities and uncertainties.

#### 1.5a Introduction to Feedback Control

Feedback control is a fundamental concept in the field of control theory. It is a method used to control the behavior of a system by continuously monitoring its output and adjusting the input based on the difference between the desired output and the actual output. This process is known as the control loop.

In the context of underactuated robotics, feedback control plays a crucial role in stabilizing and controlling the behavior of the system. The Compass Gait and Kneed Compass Gait models, for instance, can be stabilized using feedback control strategies.

The feedback control system can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\dot{\mathbf{x}} &= f(\mathbf{x}) + g(\mathbf{x}) u \\
y &= h(\mathbf{x}) \\
u &= k(y - r)
\end{align*}
$$

where $\mathbf{x}$ is the state vector, $f(\mathbf{x})$ and $g(\mathbf{x})$ are the vector fields representing the system dynamics, $u$ is the control input, $y$ is the output, $h(\mathbf{x})$ is the output function, $r$ is the reference signal, and $k$ is the feedback gain.

The feedback control system aims to drive the output $y$ to the reference signal $r$ by adjusting the control input $u$. This is achieved by comparing the output $y$ with the reference signal $r$ and applying the feedback gain $k$ to the error signal $y - r$. The feedback gain $k$ determines the strength of the control action and is typically chosen based on the system dynamics and the desired control performance.

In the next sections, we will delve deeper into the application of feedback control in stabilizing the Compass Gait and Kneed Compass Gait models. We will also explore the concept of backstepping, a recursive procedure for stabilizing multiple-integrator systems, and its application in underactuated robotics.

#### 1.5b Feedback Control for Simple Walking Models

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of feedback control and its role in stabilizing and controlling the behavior of a system. In this section, we will focus on the application of feedback control in simple walking models, specifically the Compass Gait and Kneed Compass Gait models.

The Compass Gait model is a two-dimensional walking model that can be stabilized using feedback control. The model is defined by the following equations of motion:

$$
\begin{align*}
\ddot{\theta} &= \frac{g}{l}\sin(\theta) - \frac{u}{I}\cos(\theta) \\
\ddot{\phi} &= \frac{g}{l}\sin(\theta) - \frac{u}{I}\cos(\theta)
\end{align*}
$$

where $\theta$ and $\phi$ are the angles of the compass gait, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $l$ is the length of the compass gait, $u$ is the control input, and $I$ is the moment of inertia of the compass gait.

The Kneed Compass Gait model is a variation of the Compass Gait model that incorporates the effects of a knee joint. The model is defined by the following equations of motion:

$$
\begin{align*}
\ddot{\theta} &= \frac{g}{l}\sin(\theta) - \frac{u}{I}\cos(\theta) \\
\ddot{\phi} &= \frac{g}{l}\sin(\theta) - \frac{u}{I}\cos(\theta) \\
\ddot{\psi} &= \frac{g}{l}\sin(\theta) - \frac{u}{I}\cos(\theta)
\end{align*}
$$

where $\psi$ is the angle of the knee joint.

The feedback control system for these models can be represented as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\dot{\mathbf{x}} &= f(\mathbf{x}) + g(\mathbf{x}) u \\
y &= h(\mathbf{x}) \\
u &= k(y - r)
\end{align*}
$$

where $\mathbf{x}$ is the state vector, $f(\mathbf{x})$ and $g(\mathbf{x})$ are the vector fields representing the system dynamics, $u$ is the control input, $y$ is the output, $h(\mathbf{x})$ is the output function, $r$ is the reference signal, and $k$ is the feedback gain.

The feedback control system aims to drive the output $y$ to the reference signal $r$ by adjusting the control input $u$. This is achieved by comparing the output $y$ with the reference signal $r$ and applying the feedback gain $k$ to the error signal $y - r$. The feedback gain $k$ determines the strength of the control action and is typically chosen based on the system dynamics and the desired control performance.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of backstepping, a recursive procedure for stabilizing multiple-integrator systems, and its application in underactuated robotics.

#### 1.5c Stability Analysis

In the previous sections, we have discussed the application of feedback control in stabilizing and controlling the behavior of simple walking models. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of stability analysis, a crucial aspect of understanding the behavior of these models.

Stability analysis is the process of determining the stability of a system's equilibrium points. In the context of our simple walking models, the equilibrium points are the states at which the system is at rest, i.e., $\dot{\theta} = \dot{\phi} = \dot{\psi} = 0$. The stability of these equilibrium points is crucial as it determines whether the system can return to its resting state after being disturbed.

The stability of an equilibrium point can be determined by analyzing the system's response to small perturbations around the equilibrium point. If the system's response is such that the perturbations decay over time, the equilibrium point is said to be stable. If the perturbations grow over time, the equilibrium point is unstable. If the perturbations neither decay nor grow, the equilibrium point is marginally stable.

For our simple walking models, the stability of the equilibrium points can be analyzed using the Lyapunov stability theory. According to this theory, an equilibrium point is stable if all trajectories starting close to the equilibrium point converge to it as time goes to infinity.

The Lyapunov stability theory provides a mathematical framework for determining the stability of an equilibrium point. However, it is often difficult to apply directly to complex systems due to the need to find a Lyapunov function, a scalar function that decreases along the system's trajectories.

In the next section, we will discuss some practical methods for analyzing the stability of our simple walking models, including the use of higher-order sinusoidal input describing functions (HOSIDFs) and the application of backstepping, a recursive procedure for stabilizing multiple-integrator systems.

#### 1.5d Feedback Control for Simple Walking Models

In the previous sections, we have discussed the application of feedback control in stabilizing and controlling the behavior of simple walking models. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of feedback control and its application in these models.

Feedback control is a method of controlling a system by continuously monitoring its output and adjusting the input based on the difference between the desired output and the actual output. In the context of our simple walking models, the desired output is the equilibrium point, i.e., the state at which the system is at rest.

The feedback control system can be represented as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\dot{\mathbf{x}} &= f(\mathbf{x}) + g(\mathbf{x}) u \\
y &= h(\mathbf{x}) \\
u &= k(y - r)
\end{align*}
$$

where $\mathbf{x}$ is the state vector, $f(\mathbf{x})$ and $g(\mathbf{x})$ are the vector fields representing the system dynamics, $u$ is the control input, $y$ is the output, $h(\mathbf{x})$ is the output function, $r$ is the reference signal, and $k$ is the feedback gain.

The feedback control system aims to drive the output $y$ to the reference signal $r$ by adjusting the control input $u$. This is achieved by comparing the output $y$ with the reference signal $r$ and applying the feedback gain $k$ to the error signal $y - r$. The feedback gain $k$ determines the strength of the control action and is typically chosen based on the system dynamics and the desired control performance.

In the context of our simple walking models, the feedback control system can be used to stabilize the system and control its behavior. By continuously monitoring the system's output (e.g., the angles of the compass gait or the knee joint) and adjusting the control input, the system can be guided to the equilibrium point. This can be particularly useful in situations where the system is disturbed or when the system's behavior needs to be modified.

In the next section, we will discuss some practical methods for implementing feedback control in our simple walking models, including the use of higher-order sinusoidal input describing functions (HOSIDFs) and the application of backstepping, a recursive procedure for stabilizing multiple-integrator systems.

## Chapter: Chapter 2: Introduction to Underactuated Robotics

### Introduction

Welcome to Chapter 2 of "Underactuated Robotics: Theory and Practice". This chapter is dedicated to introducing the fascinating world of underactuated robotics. Underactuation is a fundamental concept in robotics that deals with the control of robots with fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom they have. This concept is particularly relevant in the design and control of robots, as it allows for more efficient and effective control strategies.

#### 1.5b Feedback Control Techniques

In this section, we will explore some of the feedback control techniques that can be used to stabilize and control the behavior of simple walking models. These techniques include the use of Higher-order Sinusoidal Input Describing Functions (HOSIDFs) and the Extended Kalman Filter.

##### Higher-order Sinusoidal Input Describing Functions (HOSIDFs)

HOSIDFs are a powerful tool for analyzing and controlling nonlinear systems. They provide a natural extension of the widely used sinusoidal describing functions when nonlinearities cannot be neglected. The application and analysis of HOSIDFs is advantageous both when a nonlinear model is already identified and when no model is known yet. 

The HOSIDFs require little model assumptions and can easily be identified while requiring no advanced mathematical tools. Moreover, even when a model is already identified, the analysis of the HOSIDFs often yields significant advantages over the use of the identified nonlinear model. 

The HOSIDFs provide a tool to provide on-site testing during system design. Finally, the application of HOSIDFs to (nonlinear) controller design for nonlinear systems is shown to yield significant advantages over conventional time domain based tuning.

##### Extended Kalman Filter

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is a generalization of the Kalman filter for nonlinear systems. It is used to estimate the state of a nonlinear system from noisy measurements. The EKF linearizes the system around the current estimate and then applies the standard Kalman filter.

The EKF is particularly useful for systems with continuous-time models and discrete-time measurements. The model and measurement equations are given by:

$$
\begin{align*}
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) &= f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) &\mathbf{w}(t) &\sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr) \\
\mathbf{z}(t) &= h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) &\mathbf{v}(t) &\sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)
\end{align*}
$$

where $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the state vector, $f(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t))$ is the system dynamics, $\mathbf{u}(t)$ is the control input, $\mathbf{w}(t)$ is the process noise, $h(\mathbf{x}(t))$ is the measurement function, $\mathbf{z}(t)$ is the measurement, and $\mathbf{v}(t)$ is the measurement noise.

The EKF uses the system dynamics and measurement equations to compute the state estimate and error covariance. It then updates these estimates based on the new measurements. The EKF is particularly useful for systems with continuous-time models and discrete-time measurements.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the application of these feedback control techniques in stabilizing and controlling the behavior of simple walking models.

#### 1.5c Feedback Control for Simple Walking Models

In this section, we will explore the application of feedback control techniques to simple walking models. We will focus on the use of Higher-order Sinusoidal Input Describing Functions (HOSIDFs) and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in controlling the behavior of these models.

##### Higher-order Sinusoidal Input Describing Functions (HOSIDFs)

The application of HOSIDFs to simple walking models is particularly advantageous due to the inherent nonlinearities present in these systems. The HOSIDFs provide a natural extension of the widely used sinusoidal describing functions, allowing for a more intuitive and direct analysis of the system's behavior.

The HOSIDFs can be used to identify the system's behavior without the need for advanced mathematical tools. This makes them particularly useful in on-site testing during system design. Furthermore, even when a model is already identified, the analysis of the HOSIDFs often yields significant advantages over the use of the identified nonlinear model.

The application of HOSIDFs to controller design for nonlinear systems has been shown to yield significant advantages over conventional time domain based tuning. This makes them a powerful tool in the control of simple walking models.

##### Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is a powerful tool for estimating the state of a nonlinear system from noisy measurements. In the context of simple walking models, the EKF can be used to estimate the state of the system based on noisy measurements of the system's behavior.

The EKF is particularly useful for systems with continuous-time models and discrete-time measurements. The model and measurement equations are given by:

$$
\begin{align*}
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) &= f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) &\mathbf{w}(t) &\sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr) \\
\mathbf{z}(t) &= h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) &\mathbf{v}(t) &\sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)
\end{align*}
$$

where $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the state vector, $f(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t))$ is the system dynamics, $\mathbf{u}(t)$ is the control input, $\mathbf{w}(t)$ is the process noise, $\mathbf{z}(t)$ is the measurement, and $\mathbf{v}(t)$ is the measurement noise.

The EKF uses the system dynamics and measurement equations to compute the state estimate and error covariance. This makes it a powerful tool for controlling the behavior of simple walking models.




#### 1.5c Applications and Challenges

In this section, we will explore some of the applications and challenges of using feedback control techniques for simple walking models. These techniques have been applied to a wide range of systems, from robots to biological systems, and have shown great potential for controlling complex and nonlinear systems.

##### Applications of Feedback Control Techniques

Feedback control techniques, such as HOSIDFs and the Extended Kalman Filter, have been applied to a wide range of systems. In the field of robotics, these techniques have been used to control the movement of robots, particularly in tasks that require precise and complex movements. For example, the Extended Kalman Filter has been used to estimate the state of a robot and control its movement in real-time, allowing for accurate and efficient navigation in unknown environments.

In the field of biology, these techniques have been used to control the movement of biological systems, such as the movement of cells and organisms. For example, the Extended Kalman Filter has been used to estimate the state of a biological system and control its movement in real-time, allowing for precise and controlled manipulation of these systems.

##### Challenges of Feedback Control Techniques

Despite their potential, there are several challenges associated with the use of feedback control techniques. One of the main challenges is the complexity of the systems being controlled. Nonlinear systems, in particular, can be difficult to model and control due to their complex behavior and interactions. This complexity can make it difficult to accurately estimate the state of the system and control its behavior.

Another challenge is the need for real-time control. Many systems, such as robots and biological systems, require precise and rapid control in real-time. This can be particularly challenging for nonlinear systems, as the control law may need to be updated continuously to account for the changing behavior of the system.

Finally, there is a need for robustness and fault tolerance in feedback control techniques. In many applications, the system being controlled may be subject to disturbances or failures, which can significantly affect its behavior. Feedback control techniques need to be able to handle these disturbances and failures to maintain control of the system.

In the next section, we will explore some of the current research and developments in the field of feedback control for simple walking models.

## Chapter 2: Simple Running Models: Spring-loaded inverted pendulum:

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of underactuated robotics and its importance in the field of robotics. We discussed how underactuation allows for more efficient and robust control of robotic systems. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the theory and applications of underactuated robotics by exploring simple running models, specifically the spring-loaded inverted pendulum.

The spring-loaded inverted pendulum is a classic example of an underactuated system. It consists of a pendulum attached to a spring, with the pendulum being the only actuated joint. This simple model is often used to study the dynamics of underactuated systems and has numerous applications in robotics.

In this chapter, we will first discuss the basic principles of the spring-loaded inverted pendulum, including its equations of motion and stability analysis. We will then explore different control strategies for this system, including open-loop and closed-loop control, and their respective advantages and limitations. Finally, we will discuss some real-world applications of the spring-loaded inverted pendulum, such as bipedal walking and balancing.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of the theory and applications of the spring-loaded inverted pendulum, and how it relates to the broader field of underactuated robotics. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the more advanced topics covered in the following chapters. So let us begin our exploration of the spring-loaded inverted pendulum and its role in underactuated robotics.




### Section 2.1 Motion planning:

Motion planning is a crucial aspect of robotics, as it involves the generation of smooth and continuous trajectories for the robot to follow. In this section, we will explore the concept of motion planning and its applications in underactuated robotics.

#### 2.1a Dijkstra’s

Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular method for finding the shortest path between two points in a graph. It has been widely used in various fields, including robotics, for motion planning and pathfinding.

The algorithm works by maintaining a set of nodes for which the shortest path has already been found, and a set of nodes for which the shortest path has not yet been found. The algorithm then iteratively selects the node with the shortest distance from the starting point and updates the distances of its neighboring nodes. This process continues until the shortest path to the destination node is found.

In the context of underactuated robotics, Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to generate smooth and continuous trajectories for the robot to follow. By representing the robot's environment as a graph, with each node representing a possible configuration of the robot, Dijkstra's algorithm can find the shortest path for the robot to reach a desired goal.

One of the key advantages of using Dijkstra's algorithm for motion planning is its ability to handle complex environments with obstacles. By avoiding obstacles in the graph, the algorithm can generate a smooth and safe trajectory for the robot to follow.

However, Dijkstra's algorithm also has its limitations. It can only find the shortest path between two points and does not take into account the dynamics of the system. This means that the generated trajectory may not be feasible for the robot to follow, especially in underactuated systems where the dynamics are nonlinear.

In the next section, we will explore other motion planning techniques that can handle the dynamics of underactuated systems.





#### 2.1b A-star

A-star is a popular algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph, similar to Dijkstra's algorithm. However, A-star also takes into account the heuristic cost of reaching the goal, making it more efficient in finding the shortest path.

The algorithm works by maintaining a set of nodes for which the shortest path has already been found, and a set of nodes for which the shortest path has not yet been found. The algorithm then iteratively selects the node with the lowest cost (combination of distance and heuristic cost) and updates the distances of its neighboring nodes. This process continues until the shortest path to the destination node is found.

In the context of underactuated robotics, A-star can be used to generate smooth and continuous trajectories for the robot to follow. By representing the robot's environment as a graph, with each node representing a possible configuration of the robot, A-star can find the shortest path for the robot to reach a desired goal.

One of the key advantages of using A-star for motion planning is its ability to handle complex environments with obstacles. By avoiding obstacles in the graph, the algorithm can generate a smooth and safe trajectory for the robot to follow.

However, A-star also has its limitations. It can only find the shortest path between two points and does not take into account the dynamics of the system. This means that the generated trajectory may not be feasible for the robot to follow, especially in underactuated systems where the dynamics are nonlinear.

In the next section, we will explore other motion planning techniques that can handle the dynamics of underactuated systems.





#### 2.2a Rapidly-Exploring Randomized Trees

Rapidly-exploring randomized trees (RRT) is a popular motion planning algorithm that is commonly used in underactuated robotics. It is a type of probabilistic tree search algorithm that is used to find a path from a starting configuration to a goal configuration in a continuous space.

The algorithm works by randomly sampling configurations in the space and connecting them to the nearest configuration in the tree. This process is repeated until a path to the goal configuration is found or a maximum number of samples is reached. The resulting tree is then used to generate a smooth and continuous trajectory for the robot to follow.

One of the key advantages of RRT is its ability to handle complex and non-convex environments. It is also able to handle obstacles in the environment, as the algorithm will avoid sampling configurations that are close to obstacles.

However, RRT also has some limitations. It can be sensitive to the initial configuration and may not always find the optimal path. Additionally, the resulting trajectory may not be smooth and may require post-processing to improve its quality.

In the context of underactuated robotics, RRT can be used to generate trajectories for the robot to follow. By representing the robot's environment as a continuous space, RRT can find a path for the robot to reach a desired goal. This can be particularly useful in situations where the robot's dynamics are nonlinear and traditional motion planning techniques may not be applicable.

#### 2.2b Probabilistic Roadmap

Another popular motion planning algorithm used in underactuated robotics is the probabilistic roadmap (PRM) algorithm. Similar to RRT, PRM is also a probabilistic tree search algorithm that is used to find a path from a starting configuration to a goal configuration in a continuous space.

The algorithm works by randomly sampling pairs of configurations in the space and connecting them to the nearest configuration in the tree. This process is repeated until a path to the goal configuration is found or a maximum number of samples is reached. The resulting tree is then used to generate a smooth and continuous trajectory for the robot to follow.

One of the key advantages of PRM is its ability to handle complex and non-convex environments. It is also able to handle obstacles in the environment, as the algorithm will avoid sampling configurations that are close to obstacles.

However, PRM also has some limitations. It can be sensitive to the initial configuration and may not always find the optimal path. Additionally, the resulting trajectory may not be smooth and may require post-processing to improve its quality.

In the context of underactuated robotics, PRM can be used to generate trajectories for the robot to follow. By representing the robot's environment as a continuous space, PRM can find a path for the robot to reach a desired goal. This can be particularly useful in situations where the robot's dynamics are nonlinear and traditional motion planning techniques may not be applicable.





#### 2.2b Probabilistic Road Maps

The probabilistic roadmap (PRM) algorithm is a powerful tool for motion planning in underactuated robotics. It is a type of probabilistic tree search algorithm that is used to find a path from a starting configuration to a goal configuration in a continuous space.

The algorithm works by randomly sampling pairs of configurations in the space and connecting them to the nearest configuration in the tree. This process is repeated until a path to the goal configuration is found or a maximum number of samples is reached. The resulting tree is then used to generate a smooth and continuous trajectory for the robot to follow.

One of the key advantages of PRM is its ability to handle complex and non-convex environments. It is also able to handle obstacles in the environment, as the algorithm will avoid sampling configurations that are close to obstacles.

However, PRM also has some limitations. It can be sensitive to the initial configuration and may not always find the optimal path. Additionally, the resulting trajectory may not be smooth and may require post-processing to improve its quality.

In the context of underactuated robotics, PRM can be used to generate trajectories for the robot to reach a desired goal. By representing the robot's environment as a continuous space, PRM can find a path for the robot to reach a desired goal. This can be particularly useful in situations where the robot's dynamics are nonlinear and traditional motion planning techniques may not be applicable.

### Subsection: 2.2c Applications in Robotics

The probabilistic roadmap algorithm has been successfully applied in various applications in robotics. One such application is in the field of underactuated robotics, where the algorithm has been used to generate trajectories for robots with limited actuation capabilities.

In underactuated robotics, the number of actuators available to control the robot's motion is less than the number of degrees of freedom. This results in a complex and nonlinear dynamics system, making traditional motion planning techniques difficult to apply. The probabilistic roadmap algorithm, with its ability to handle complex and non-convex environments, has proven to be a valuable tool in this field.

Another application of the probabilistic roadmap algorithm is in the field of mobile robot navigation. By representing the robot's environment as a continuous space, the algorithm can generate a path for the robot to reach a desired goal. This has been particularly useful in situations where the robot's environment is cluttered with obstacles, making traditional navigation techniques difficult to apply.

In addition to these applications, the probabilistic roadmap algorithm has also been used in other areas of robotics, such as manipulation and grasping. By generating smooth and continuous trajectories, the algorithm has proven to be a valuable tool in these areas as well.

Overall, the probabilistic roadmap algorithm has shown great potential in various applications in robotics. Its ability to handle complex and non-convex environments, as well as its ability to generate smooth and continuous trajectories, make it a valuable tool for researchers and engineers in the field.

#### 2.3a Planning with Funnels

In the previous section, we discussed the probabilistic roadmap (PRM) algorithm, a powerful tool for motion planning in underactuated robotics. In this section, we will explore another important technique for motion planning: feedback motion planning with funnels.

Feedback motion planning is a method of generating trajectories for a robot in real-time, taking into account the robot's current state and the environment. This is particularly useful in underactuated robotics, where the robot's dynamics may be nonlinear and difficult to model accurately.

Funnels, on the other hand, are a type of potential field that can be used to guide a robot's motion towards a desired goal. They are defined as regions in the robot's configuration space where the robot's velocity is constrained to lie within a certain range. This allows the robot to move towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and maintaining a desired velocity.

The combination of feedback motion planning and funnels can be a powerful tool for generating trajectories in underactuated robotics. By using feedback motion planning, the robot can adapt its trajectory in real-time to changes in the environment or its own state. Meanwhile, the funnels provide a guide for the robot's motion, ensuring that it reaches the goal while avoiding obstacles and maintaining a desired velocity.

One of the key advantages of feedback motion planning with funnels is its ability to handle complex and non-convex environments. By using feedback motion planning, the robot can adapt its trajectory to the environment, while the funnels provide a guide for the robot's motion. This allows the robot to reach the goal while avoiding obstacles and maintaining a desired velocity.

However, feedback motion planning with funnels also has some limitations. It can be sensitive to the initial configuration and may not always find the optimal path. Additionally, the funnels may not always be able to guide the robot's motion towards the goal, particularly in complex environments.

In the next section, we will explore some applications of feedback motion planning with funnels in underactuated robotics.

#### 2.3b Feedback Motion Planning with Funnels

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of feedback motion planning with funnels. In this section, we will delve deeper into the details of this technique and discuss how it can be used for motion planning in underactuated robotics.

Feedback motion planning with funnels involves generating a trajectory for the robot in real-time, taking into account the robot's current state and the environment. This is achieved by using a feedback control law that adjusts the robot's velocity based on its current state and the desired velocity. The funnels, on the other hand, provide a guide for the robot's motion, ensuring that it reaches the goal while avoiding obstacles and maintaining a desired velocity.

The feedback control law can be designed using various techniques, such as the Lifelong Planning A* (LPA*) algorithm. LPA* is algorithmically similar to the A* algorithm and shares many of its properties. It is particularly useful for feedback motion planning as it allows for efficient computation of the shortest path to the goal.

The funnels, on the other hand, can be defined using various techniques, such as the implicit k-d tree. An implicit k-d tree is a data structure that spans over an k-dimensional grid with n gridcells. It can be used to represent the funnels in the robot's configuration space, providing a guide for the robot's motion towards the goal.

One of the key advantages of feedback motion planning with funnels is its ability to handle complex and non-convex environments. By using feedback motion planning, the robot can adapt its trajectory to the environment, while the funnels provide a guide for the robot's motion. This allows the robot to reach the goal while avoiding obstacles and maintaining a desired velocity.

However, feedback motion planning with funnels also has some limitations. It can be sensitive to the initial configuration and may not always find the optimal path. Additionally, the funnels may not always be able to guide the robot's motion towards the goal, particularly in complex environments.

In the next section, we will explore some applications of feedback motion planning with funnels in underactuated robotics.

#### 2.3c Applications in Robotics

In this section, we will explore some applications of feedback motion planning with funnels in underactuated robotics. Underactuated robots are those that have fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom, making them inherently unstable. Feedback motion planning with funnels provides a powerful tool for controlling these robots and guiding them towards a desired goal.

One of the key applications of feedback motion planning with funnels is in the field of factory automation infrastructure. Underactuated robots are often used in factory automation, where they need to perform complex tasks such as picking and placing objects. Feedback motion planning with funnels allows these robots to adapt their trajectory to the environment and reach the desired goal while avoiding obstacles.

Another important application is in the field of cellular models. Cellular models are used to simulate the behavior of cells in a biological system. Underactuated robots can be used to model these cells, and feedback motion planning with funnels can be used to guide their motion towards a desired goal. This can be particularly useful in studying the behavior of complex biological systems.

Feedback motion planning with funnels also has applications in the field of kinematic chains. A kinematic chain is a series of rigid bodies connected by joints. Underactuated robots can be used to model these chains, and feedback motion planning with funnels can be used to guide their motion towards a desired goal. This can be particularly useful in studying the behavior of complex mechanical systems.

In addition to these applications, feedback motion planning with funnels can also be used in other areas such as multimodal interaction, where it can be used to guide the motion of a robot towards a desired goal while interacting with the environment in multiple modes. It can also be used in the field of implicit data structures, where it can be used to guide the motion of a robot towards a desired goal while navigating through an implicit data structure.

In conclusion, feedback motion planning with funnels is a powerful tool for controlling underactuated robots and guiding their motion towards a desired goal. Its applications are vast and diverse, making it a valuable technique in the field of underactuated robotics.

The advanced running models we will discuss in this chapter are designed to capture the dynamics of underactuated robots in more detail.

#### 2.3b Linear Quadratic Regulator

The Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) is a popular control algorithm used in feedback motion planning. It is particularly useful in underactuated robotics due to its ability to handle nonlinear and uncertain systems.

The LQR is based on the principle of minimizing a cost function. The cost function is defined as the sum of the error between the desired and actual states, and the control effort. The LQR then computes the control input that minimizes this cost function.

The LQR can be formulated for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. For continuous-time systems, the LQR is given by:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) \quad \mathbf{w}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr) \\
\mathbf{z}(t) = h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) \quad \mathbf{v}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)
$$

where $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the state vector, $\mathbf{u}(t)$ is the control input, $\mathbf{w}(t)$ is the process noise, $\mathbf{z}(t)$ is the measurement, and $\mathbf{v}(t)$ is the measurement noise. The functions $f$ and $h$ represent the system dynamics and measurement model, respectively. The matrices $\mathbf{Q}(t)$ and $\mathbf{R}(t)$ represent the process and measurement noise covariance matrices, respectively.

The LQR control input is given by:

$$
\mathbf{u}(t) = -\mathbf{K}(t)\mathbf{x}(t)
$$

where $\mathbf{K}(t)$ is the feedback gain matrix. The feedback gain matrix is computed using the Riccati equation:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{P}}(t) = \mathbf{F}(t)\mathbf{P}(t)+\mathbf{P}(t)\mathbf{F}(t)^{T}-\mathbf{K}(t)\mathbf{H}(t)\mathbf{P}(t)+\mathbf{Q}(t)
$$

where $\mathbf{P}(t)$ is the state covariance matrix, $\mathbf{F}(t)$ is the Jacobian of the system dynamics with respect to the state, and $\mathbf{H}(t)$ is the Jacobian of the measurement model with respect to the state.

The LQR has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems in underactuated robotics, including the control of bipedal walkers, quadcopters, and other complex systems. Its ability to handle nonlinear and uncertain systems makes it a valuable tool for feedback motion planning in underactuated robotics.

#### 2.3c Applications in Robotics

The Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) has found extensive applications in the field of robotics, particularly in the control of underactuated systems. Underactuation refers to systems with fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom, which can lead to complex and nonlinear dynamics. The LQR's ability to handle these nonlinearities and uncertainties makes it a powerful tool for controlling underactuated systems.

One of the most common applications of the LQR in robotics is in the control of bipedal walkers. These systems are inherently underactuated, with only two actuators (the hip and knee joints) controlling the motion of the entire body. The LQR can be used to generate control inputs that stabilize the walker and allow it to navigate through complex environments.

Another important application of the LQR is in the control of quadcopters. These systems are also underactuated, with only four actuators (the four rotors) controlling the motion of the entire vehicle. The LQR can be used to generate control inputs that stabilize the quadcopter and allow it to perform complex maneuvers.

The LQR has also been used in the control of other complex systems, such as robotic manipulators and mobile robots. In these systems, the LQR can be used to generate control inputs that stabilize the system and allow it to perform complex tasks.

In addition to its applications in control, the LQR has also been used in robotics for motion planning. The LQR can be used to generate trajectories that minimize a cost function, which can be useful for tasks such as path planning and obstacle avoidance.

Overall, the Linear Quadratic Regulator is a powerful tool for the control and motion planning of underactuated systems in robotics. Its ability to handle nonlinearities and uncertainties makes it a valuable tool for researchers and engineers working in this field.




#### 2.4a Introduction to Function Approximation

Function approximation is a fundamental concept in the field of underactuated robotics. It involves the use of mathematical models to approximate the behavior of a system. This is particularly useful in the context of underactuated robots, where the system dynamics are often nonlinear and complex.

Function approximation is used in a variety of applications, including system identification, control, and optimization. In system identification, function approximation is used to estimate the system dynamics from input-output data. In control, it is used to design controllers that can regulate the system behavior. In optimization, it is used to find the optimal control inputs that minimize a cost function.

There are several methods for function approximation, including neural networks, fuzzy logic, and support vector machines. Each of these methods has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of method depends on the specific application and system dynamics.

Neural networks, for example, are particularly useful for approximating nonlinear functions. They consist of interconnected nodes that process information and learn from data. The learning process involves adjusting the weights of the connections between the nodes to minimize the error between the network output and the desired output.

Fuzzy logic, on the other hand, is useful for approximating functions with uncertain or imprecise input data. It involves the use of linguistic variables and rules to represent the system dynamics. The system dynamics are then approximated by a set of fuzzy rules that map the input data to the output data.

Support vector machines (SVMs) are another popular method for function approximation. They are particularly useful for approximating linear functions in high-dimensional spaces. The learning process involves finding the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the positive and negative examples.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these methods and explore their applications in underactuated robotics. We will also discuss the challenges and future directions in the field of function approximation.

#### 2.4b System Identification Techniques

System identification is a crucial aspect of underactuated robotics. It involves the use of mathematical models to estimate the system dynamics from input-output data. This is particularly important in the context of underactuated robots, where the system dynamics are often nonlinear and complex.

There are several techniques for system identification, including the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the Line Integral Convolution (LIC). The EKF is a popular technique for continuous-time systems, while the LIC is more suitable for discrete-time systems.

The EKF is a recursive estimator that provides a solution to the discrete-data linear filtering problem. It is based on the assumption that the system dynamics and measurements are linear and Gaussian. The EKF uses a linear approximation of the system dynamics and measurements to compute the state estimate and error covariance.

The EKF is given by:

$$

\mathbf{H}(t) = \left . \frac{\partial h}{\partial \mathbf{x} } \right \vert _{\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t)} 
$$

In the next section, we will delve deeper into these techniques and explore their applications in underactuated robotics. We will also discuss the challenges and future directions in the field of system identification.

#### 2.4c Function Approximation Techniques

Function approximation is a crucial aspect of underactuated robotics. It involves the use of mathematical models to approximate the system dynamics from input-output data. This is particularly important in the context of underactuated robots, where the system dynamics are often nonlinear and complex.

There are several techniques for function approximation, including the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the Line Integral Convolution (LIC). The EKF is a popular technique for continuous-time systems, while the LIC is more suitable for discrete-time systems.

The EKF is a recursive estimator that provides a solution to the discrete-data linear filtering problem. It is based on the assumption that the system dynamics and measurements are linear and Gaussian. The EKF uses a linear approximation of the system dynamics and measurements to compute the state estimate and error covariance.

The EKF is given by:

$$
\dot{\hat{\mathbf{x}}}(t) = f\bigl(\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t),\mathbf{u}(t)\bigr)+\mathbf{K}(t)\Bigl(\mathbf{z}(t)-h\bigl(\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t)\bigr)\Bigr)\\

\mathbf{H}(t) = \left . \frac{\partial h}{\partial \mathbf{x} } \right \vert _{\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t)} 
$$

where $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the true state, $\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t)$ is the estimated state, $\mathbf{u}(t)$ is the control input, $\mathbf{z}(t)$ is the measurement, $\mathbf{P}(t)$ is the state covariance, $\mathbf{K}(t)$ is the Kalman gain, $\mathbf{F}(t)$ is the Jacobian of the system dynamics, $\mathbf{H}(t)$ is the Jacobian of the measurement model, $\mathbf{Q}(t)$ is the process noise covariance, and $\mathbf{R}(t)$ is the measurement noise covariance.

The LIC, on the other hand, is a non-parametric technique that uses the line integral of a function to approximate the system dynamics. It is particularly useful for systems with complex geometries or boundary conditions. The LIC is given by:

$$

## Chapter: Chapter 3: Underactuated Quadruped Robots

### Introduction

In the realm of robotics, the concept of underactuation has been a subject of great interest and research. This chapter, "Underactuated Quadruped Robots," delves into the intricacies of underactuation in the context of quadruped robots. 

Underactuation, in essence, refers to the condition where the number of actuators (devices that cause motion) is less than the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) of a system. This can lead to complex dynamics and control challenges, but it also offers unique opportunities for design and control. 

Quadruped robots, with their four legs, are a common type of underactuated robot. They are often used in applications where agility and adaptability are required, such as in search and rescue operations, or in environments where traditional wheeled or tracked robots may not be feasible.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental principles of underactuation and how they apply to quadruped robots. We will delve into the mathematical models that describe the behavior of these robots, and how these models can be used to design effective control strategies.

#### 2.4b System Identification Techniques

System identification is a crucial aspect of underactuated robotics. It involves the use of mathematical models to estimate the system dynamics from input-output data. This is particularly important in the context of underactuated robots, where the system dynamics are often nonlinear and complex.

There are several methods for system identification, including the use of higher-order sinusoidal input describing functions (HOSIDFs) and the extended Kalman filter.

##### Higher-order Sinusoidal Input Describing Functions (HOSIDFs)

The application and analysis of HOSIDFs is advantageous both when a nonlinear model is already identified and when no model is known yet. In the latter case, the HOSIDFs require little model assumptions and can easily be identified while requiring no advanced mathematical tools. Moreover, even when a model is already identified, the analysis of the HOSIDFs often yields significant advantages over the use of the identified nonlinear model.

The HOSIDFs are intuitive in their identification and interpretation, providing direct information about the behavior of the system in practice. They also provide a natural extension of the widely used sinusoidal describing functions in case nonlinearities cannot be neglected. In practice, the HOSIDFs have two distinct applications: Due to their ease of identification, HOSIDFs provide a tool to provide on-site testing during system design.

##### Extended Kalman Filter

The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is another powerful tool for system identification. It is a generalization of the Kalman filter that can handle nonlinear systems. The EKF operates in two steps: prediction and update. In the prediction step, the EKF uses the system model to predict the state at the next time step. In the update step, it uses the measurement model to update the state estimate based on the actual measurement.

The EKF is particularly useful for systems with continuous-time models, as shown in the equation below:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) \quad \mathbf{w}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr) \\
\mathbf{z}(t) = h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) \quad \mathbf{v}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)
$$

where $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the state vector, $\mathbf{u}(t)$ is the control input, $\mathbf{w}(t)$ is the process noise, $\mathbf{z}(t)$ is the measurement, and $\mathbf{v}(t)$ is the measurement noise. The functions $f$ and $h$ represent the system and measurement models, respectively. The matrices $\mathbf{Q}(t)$ and $\mathbf{R}(t)$ represent the process and measurement noise covariance matrices, respectively.

The EKF is particularly useful for systems with continuous-time models, as shown in the equation above. However, it can also be adapted for discrete-time systems by using a suitable discretization of the system and measurement models.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the application of these system identification techniques in the context of underactuated robotics.

#### 2.4c Function Approximation Techniques

Function approximation is a crucial aspect of underactuated robotics, particularly in the context of the spring-loaded inverted pendulum model. It involves the use of mathematical models to approximate the system dynamics from input-output data. This is particularly important in the context of underactuated robots, where the system dynamics are often nonlinear and complex.

There are several methods for function approximation, including the use of neural networks and support vector machines.

##### Neural Networks

Neural networks are a popular method for function approximation due to their ability to approximate any nonlinear function. They consist of interconnected nodes that process information and learn from data. The learning process involves adjusting the weights of the connections between the nodes to minimize the error between the network output and the desired output.

In the context of the spring-loaded inverted pendulum model, neural networks can be used to approximate the system dynamics. This involves training the network on a set of input-output data pairs, where the input is the state of the system and the output is the system's response to that state. The trained network can then be used to predict the system's response to new states.

##### Support Vector Machines

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are another powerful tool for function approximation. They are particularly useful for problems where the data is not linearly separable, which is often the case in underactuated robotics.

In the context of the spring-loaded inverted pendulum model, SVMs can be used to approximate the system dynamics. This involves finding the hyperplane that best separates the positive and negative examples in the input-output data. The hyperplane can then be used to classify new data points, and the distance from the hyperplane can be used to estimate the system's response.

##### Function Approximation and System Identification

Function approximation and system identification are closely related. System identification involves estimating the system dynamics from input-output data, while function approximation involves approximating the system dynamics with a mathematical model. In the context of underactuated robotics, these two tasks are often performed simultaneously to understand and control the system.

For example, in the spring-loaded inverted pendulum model, function approximation can be used to approximate the system dynamics, while system identification can be used to estimate the system parameters. This information can then be used to design controllers that can regulate the system's behavior.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the application of these function approximation techniques in the context of underactuated robotics.

## Chapter: Chapter 3: Introduction to Quadrupedal Walking

### Introduction

The third chapter of "Underactuated Robotics: Theory and Applications" delves into the fascinating world of quadrupedal walking. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the theory and applications of quadrupedal walking in underactuated robotics. 

Quadrupedal walking, or walking on four legs, is a complex and natural movement that many animals, such as dogs and cats, perform effortlessly. This chapter will explore the principles behind quadrupedal walking and how these principles can be applied to the design and control of underactuated robots. 

Underactuated robots are robots that have fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom they have. This makes them inherently unstable and challenging to control. However, the principles of quadrupedal walking, which involve the coordination of multiple limbs and joints, can provide valuable insights into the control of underactuated robots.

The chapter will begin by discussing the basic principles of quadrupedal walking, including the role of each leg and the coordination of leg movements. It will then delve into the theory of underactuated robotics, explaining how the principles of quadrupedal walking can be applied to the design and control of underactuated robots. 

The chapter will also explore some of the practical applications of quadrupedal walking in underactuated robotics. These applications range from the design of robots that can navigate complex terrain to the development of robots that can perform tasks in hazardous environments.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the principles of quadrupedal walking and how these principles can be applied to the design and control of underactuated robots. This knowledge will provide a solid foundation for the more advanced topics covered in the subsequent chapters of this book.




#### 2.4c Applications and Challenges

The application of function approximation and system identification in underactuated robotics is vast and varied. These techniques are used in a wide range of applications, from simple running models to complex robotic systems. However, there are also several challenges associated with these techniques that need to be addressed.

##### Applications of Function Approximation and System Identification

Function approximation and system identification are used in a variety of applications in underactuated robotics. One such application is the spring-loaded inverted pendulum, a simple running model that is often used to study the dynamics of underactuated systems. The dynamics of this system can be approximated using function approximation techniques, allowing for the prediction of the system's behavior under different conditions.

Another application is in the control of underactuated robotic systems. By identifying the system dynamics using system identification techniques, control laws can be designed to stabilize the system and achieve desired trajectories. This is particularly important in underactuated systems, where the number of actuators is less than the number of degrees of freedom, making the system inherently unstable.

##### Challenges in Function Approximation and System Identification

Despite their wide range of applications, there are several challenges associated with function approximation and system identification. One of the main challenges is the assumption of linearity in the system model. Many function approximation and system identification techniques, such as the extended Kalman filter, assume that the system is linear. However, in reality, many systems, particularly underactuated systems, are nonlinear. This can lead to inaccuracies in the system model and poor performance of the control laws.

Another challenge is the need for accurate and reliable data. Function approximation and system identification techniques rely on data to estimate the system dynamics. However, in many cases, the data may be noisy or incomplete, leading to inaccuracies in the system model. This is particularly true in underactuated systems, where the system dynamics can be complex and difficult to measure accurately.

Finally, there is the challenge of computational complexity. Many function approximation and system identification techniques, particularly those that involve optimization, can be computationally intensive. This can be a challenge in real-time applications, where the system dynamics need to be estimated quickly.

Despite these challenges, function approximation and system identification remain powerful tools in the field of underactuated robotics. With careful consideration of these challenges and the development of new techniques, these tools can continue to play a crucial role in the study and control of underactuated systems.




#### 2.5a State Distribution Dynamics

In the previous sections, we have discussed the application of function approximation and system identification in underactuated robotics. However, these techniques often assume that the system is operating under certainty, i.e., the system parameters and initial conditions are known exactly. In reality, this is not always the case. In many practical applications, the system operates under uncertainty, which can significantly affect the performance of the system.

In this section, we will discuss how to model and analyze systems with uncertainty. We will focus on the state distribution dynamics, which describes how the state of the system evolves over time under uncertainty.

##### State Distribution Dynamics

The state distribution dynamics is a probabilistic model that describes the evolution of the system state over time. It is particularly useful when the system operates under uncertainty, i.e., when the system parameters and initial conditions are not known exactly.

The state distribution dynamics can be represented as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the form:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t), \mathbf{w}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t)
$$

where $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the state vector, $\mathbf{u}(t)$ is the control input, $\mathbf{w}(t)$ is the uncertainty vector, and $\mathbf{v}(t)$ is the process noise. The functions $f$ and $g$ represent the system dynamics and control law, respectively.

The uncertainty vector $\mathbf{w}(t)$ represents the uncertainty in the system parameters and initial conditions. It is typically modeled as a Gaussian random vector with zero mean and covariance matrix $\mathbf{Q}(t)$.

The process noise $\mathbf{v}(t)$ represents the random disturbances that affect the system state. It is typically modeled as a Gaussian random vector with zero mean and covariance matrix $\mathbf{R}(t)$.

##### State Distribution Filter

The state distribution filter is a recursive algorithm that estimates the state of the system under uncertainty. It is based on the Kalman filter, but it takes into account the uncertainty in the system parameters and initial conditions.

The state distribution filter consists of two steps: the prediction step and the update step. In the prediction step, the filter predicts the state of the system at the next time step based on the current state and control input. In the update step, the filter updates the state estimate based on the actual measurement and the predicted state.

The state distribution filter can be represented as a set of equations:

$$
\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t|t-1) = g\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t-1), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{K}(t) \bigl(\mathbf{z}(t) - h\bigl(\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t|t-1)\bigr)\bigr)
$$

$$
\mathbf{P}(t|t-1) = \mathbf{F}(t) \mathbf{P}(t-1|t-1) \mathbf{F}(t)^T + \mathbf{Q}(t)
$$

$$
\mathbf{K}(t) = \mathbf{P}(t|t-1) \mathbf{H}(t)^T \bigl(\mathbf{H}(t) \mathbf{P}(t|t-1) \mathbf{H}(t)^T + \mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)^{-1}
$$

$$
\mathbf{P}(t|t) = (I - \mathbf{K}(t) \mathbf{H}(t)) \mathbf{P}(t|t-1)
$$

where $\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t|t-1)$ is the predicted state, $\mathbf{P}(t|t-1)$ is the predicted covariance matrix, $\mathbf{K}(t)$ is the Kalman gain, $\mathbf{F}(t)$ is the Jacobian of the system dynamics with respect to the state, $\mathbf{Q}(t)$ is the covariance matrix of the uncertainty, $\mathbf{H}(t)$ is the Jacobian of the measurement model with respect to the state, $\mathbf{R}(t)$ is the covariance matrix of the process noise, and $I$ is the identity matrix.

In the next section, we will discuss how to apply the state distribution dynamics and filter in the context of underactuated robotics.

#### 2.5b Uncertainty Propagation

Uncertainty propagation is a critical aspect of modeling systems with uncertainty. It involves the study of how uncertainty in the system parameters and initial conditions propagates over time. This is particularly important in underactuated robotics, where the system often operates under uncertainty due to the inherent complexity of the system and the environment.

The propagation of uncertainty can be represented as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the form:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{P}}(t) = \mathbf{F}(t) \mathbf{P}(t-1|t-1) \mathbf{F}(t)^T + \mathbf{Q}(t) - \mathbf{K}(t) \mathbf{H}(t) \mathbf{P}(t|t-1)
$$

where $\mathbf{P}(t|t-1)$ is the predicted covariance matrix, $\mathbf{F}(t)$ is the Jacobian of the system dynamics with respect to the state, $\mathbf{Q}(t)$ is the covariance matrix of the uncertainty, $\mathbf{K}(t)$ is the Kalman gain, and $\mathbf{H}(t)$ is the Jacobian of the measurement model with respect to the state.

The propagation of uncertainty can also be represented as a set of equations:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{P}}(t|t-1) = \mathbf{F}(t) \mathbf{P}(t-1|t-1) \mathbf{F}(t)^T + \mathbf{Q}(t) - \mathbf{K}(t) \mathbf{H}(t) \mathbf{P}(t|t-1)
$$

$$
\dot{\mathbf{K}}(t) = \mathbf{K}(t) \mathbf{H}(t) \mathbf{P}(t|t-1) - \mathbf{K}(t) \mathbf{H}(t) \mathbf{F}(t) \mathbf{P}(t-1|t-1) \mathbf{F}(t)^T \mathbf{H}(t)^T
$$

$$
\dot{\mathbf{P}}(t) = \mathbf{P}(t|t-1) - \mathbf{K}(t) \mathbf{H}(t) \mathbf{P}(t|t-1)
$$

where $\mathbf{P}(t|t-1)$ is the updated covariance matrix, $\mathbf{K}(t)$ is the Kalman gain, and $\mathbf{H}(t)$ is the Jacobian of the measurement model with respect to the state.

The propagation of uncertainty provides a mathematical framework for understanding how uncertainty in the system parameters and initial conditions affects the system state over time. It is a crucial tool for designing robust control laws that can handle uncertainty in underactuated robotics.

#### 2.5c Robust Control

Robust control is a branch of control theory that deals with the design of control systems that can handle uncertainties in the system parameters and initial conditions. In the context of underactuated robotics, robust control is particularly important due to the inherent complexity of the system and the environment.

The goal of robust control is to design a control law that can stabilize the system and achieve desired performance despite the presence of uncertainty. This is typically achieved by designing a control law that is insensitive to small variations in the system parameters and initial conditions.

The robust control of systems with uncertainty can be formulated as a stochastic control problem. The stochastic control problem involves the design of a control law that minimizes a cost function subject to a set of constraints. The cost function represents the performance of the system, and the constraints represent the limitations of the system.

The robust control problem can be represented as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the form:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t), \mathbf{w}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t)
$$

where $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the state vector, $\mathbf{u}(t)$ is the control input, $\mathbf{w}(t)$ is the uncertainty vector, and $\mathbf{v}(t)$ is the process noise. The function $f$ represents the system dynamics, and the control input $\mathbf{u}(t)$ is chosen to minimize the cost function subject to the constraints.

The robust control problem can also be represented as a set of equations:

$$

### Introduction

In the realm of robotics, the design and control of underactuated quadruped robots present a unique set of challenges and opportunities. This chapter, "Underactuated Quadruped Robots," delves into the intricacies of these robots, exploring their design, control, and the unique dynamics that govern their movement.

Underactuation refers to the condition where the number of actuators (devices that cause motion) is less than the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) of the robot. This is often the case in quadruped robots, where the number of legs (actuators) is typically less than the number of joints (DOF). This underactuation can lead to complex and interesting dynamics, making the control of these robots a challenging but rewarding task.

The chapter will explore the fundamental principles that govern the movement of underactuated quadruped robots. We will delve into the mathematical models that describe these dynamics, using the popular Markdown format and the MathJax library for rendering mathematical expressions. For example, we might represent the dynamics of a quadruped robot as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the form `$\dot{\mathbf{x}} = f(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u})$`, where `$\mathbf{x}$` is the state vector, `$\mathbf{u}$` is the control vector, and `$f$` is a function describing the dynamics of the robot.

We will also explore the control strategies for these robots, discussing how to design controllers that can stabilize and control the robot despite its underactuation. This will involve the use of advanced control techniques such as feedback linearization and sliding mode control, which will be introduced and explained in a clear and accessible manner.

Finally, we will discuss some of the practical applications of underactuated quadruped robots, highlighting their potential in areas such as search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and entertainment.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to underactuated quadruped robots, suitable for both students and researchers in the field. It is our hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for those interested in the design, control, and application of these fascinating robots.

## Chapter: Chapter 3: Underactuated Quadruped Walking

### Introduction

In the realm of robotics, the ability to walk is a fundamental skill that enables robots to navigate through complex environments. However, the design of walking robots is often constrained by the number of actuators available, a concept known as underactuation. This chapter, "Underactuated Quadruped Walking," delves into the intricacies of designing and controlling underactuated quadruped walking robots.

We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities in the field of aircraft control, including the application of underactuated robotics in aircraft control.




#### 3.1b Stochastic Control in Aircraft

Stochastic control is a branch of control theory that deals with systems that are subject to random disturbances. In the context of aircraft control, stochastic control is used to handle the uncertainties and disturbances that are inherent in flight. These uncertainties can be due to various factors such as wind gusts, turbulence, and mechanical vibrations.

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is a popular method for stochastic control in aircraft. The EKF is a recursive estimator that provides estimates of the aircraft's state and covariance. These estimates are used by the control system to adjust the control surfaces and manage the aircraft's dynamics.

The EKF operates in two steps: prediction and update. In the prediction step, the EKF uses the system model to predict the state of the aircraft at the next time step. In the update step, it uses the measurement model to update the state estimate based on the actual measurement.

The system model and measurement model are given by:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) \quad \mathbf{w}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr) \\
\mathbf{z}(t) = h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) \quad \mathbf{v}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)
$$

where $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the state vector, $\mathbf{u}(t)$ is the control vector, $\mathbf{w}(t)$ is the process noise, $\mathbf{z}(t)$ is the measurement vector, $\mathbf{v}(t)$ is the measurement noise, $f(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t))$ is the system model, and $h(\mathbf{x}(t))$ is the measurement model.

The EKF also uses the Jacobian of the system model and measurement model, denoted as $\mathbf{F}(t)$ and $\mathbf{H}(t)$ respectively. These Jacobians are used to calculate the Kalman gain, which is a matrix that determines how much the state estimate is updated based on the measurement.

The EKF is a powerful tool for stochastic control in aircraft, but it also has its limitations. For example, it assumes that the system model and measurement model are linear, which may not always be the case in real-world applications. Furthermore, it requires knowledge of the process and measurement noise covariance matrices, which can be difficult to obtain in practice.

Despite these limitations, the EKF remains a fundamental tool in the field of stochastic control and is widely used in the design of aircraft control systems. In the next section, we will explore other methods for stochastic control in aircraft, including the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques.

#### 3.1c Applications in Aircraft

The application of stochastic control in aircraft is vast and varied. It is used in a wide range of systems, from the primary flight control system to the engine control system. In this section, we will discuss some of the key applications of stochastic control in aircraft.

##### Primary Flight Control System

The primary flight control system is responsible for controlling the aircraft's roll, pitch, and yaw. This system is critical for maintaining the aircraft's stability and controlling its flight path. Stochastic control is used in this system to handle the uncertainties and disturbances that are inherent in flight.

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is often used in the primary flight control system. The EKF provides estimates of the aircraft's state and covariance, which are used by the control system to adjust the control surfaces and manage the aircraft's dynamics.

The system model and measurement model for the primary flight control system are given by:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) \quad \mathbf{w}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr) \\
\mathbf{z}(t) = h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) \quad \mathbf{v}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)
$$

where $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the state vector, $\mathbf{u}(t)$ is the control vector, $\mathbf{w}(t)$ is the process noise, $\mathbf{z}(t)$ is the measurement vector, $\mathbf{v}(t)$ is the measurement noise, $f(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t))$ is the system model, and $h(\mathbf{x}(t))$ is the measurement model.

##### Engine Control System

The engine control system is responsible for controlling the aircraft's engines. This system is critical for maintaining the aircraft's power and performance. Stochastic control is used in this system to handle the uncertainties and disturbances that are inherent in engine operation.

The EKF is also used in the engine control system. It provides estimates of the engine's state and covariance, which are used by the control system to adjust the engine's parameters and manage its operation.

The system model and measurement model for the engine control system are given by:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) \quad \mathbf{w}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr) \\
\mathbf{z}(t) = h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) \quad \mathbf{v}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)
$$

where $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the state vector, $\mathbf{u}(t)$ is the control vector, $\mathbf{w}(t)$ is the process noise, $\mathbf{z}(t)$ is the measurement vector, $\mathbf{v}(t)$ is the measurement noise, $f(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t))$ is the system model, and $h(\mathbf{x}(t))$ is the measurement model.

In conclusion, stochastic control plays a crucial role in the operation of aircraft. It provides a robust and efficient means of managing the uncertainties and disturbances that are inherent in flight. The Extended Kalman Filter is a powerful tool for stochastic control, and it is widely used in the primary flight control system and the engine control system.




#### 3.1c Case Studies

In this section, we will explore some case studies that demonstrate the application of stochastic control in aircraft. These case studies will provide a practical understanding of the concepts discussed in the previous sections.

##### Case Study 1: Uncertainty in Wind Gusts

Consider an aircraft flying in a windy environment. The wind gusts are modeled as random variables with a known probability distribution. The goal is to design a control system that can handle these uncertainties and maintain the aircraft's stability.

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) can be used to estimate the aircraft's state and covariance. The system model and measurement model are given by:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) \quad \mathbf{w}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr) \\
\mathbf{z}(t) = h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) \quad \mathbf{v}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)
$$

where $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the state vector, $\mathbf{u}(t)$ is the control vector, $\mathbf{w}(t)$ is the process noise, $\mathbf{z}(t)$ is the measurement vector, $\mathbf{v}(t)$ is the measurement noise, $f(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t))$ is the system model, and $h(\mathbf{x}(t))$ is the measurement model.

The EKF is used to estimate the aircraft's state and covariance. The control system adjusts the control surfaces based on these estimates to manage the aircraft's dynamics and maintain stability.

##### Case Study 2: Disturbances due to Mechanical Vibrations

Consider an aircraft that experiences mechanical vibrations due to engine operation. These vibrations can cause uncertainties in the aircraft's dynamics. The goal is to design a control system that can handle these uncertainties and maintain the aircraft's stability.

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) can be used to estimate the aircraft's state and covariance. The system model and measurement model are given by:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) \quad \mathbf{w}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr) \\
\mathbf{z}(t) = h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) \quad \mathbf{v}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)
$$

where $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the state vector, $\mathbf{u}(t)$ is the control vector, $\mathbf{w}(t)$ is the process noise, $\mathbf{z}(t)$ is the measurement vector, $\mathbf{v}(t)$ is the measurement noise, $f(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t))$ is the system model, and $h(\mathbf{x}(t))$ is the measurement model.

The EKF is used to estimate the aircraft's state and covariance. The control system adjusts the control surfaces based on these estimates to manage the aircraft's dynamics and maintain stability.

These case studies demonstrate the practical application of stochastic control in aircraft. The Extended Kalman Filter provides a powerful tool for handling uncertainties and disturbances in aircraft control systems.




#### 3.2a Introduction to Swimming and Flapping Flight

Swimming and flapping flight are two fundamental modes of locomotion in both air and water. These modes of locomotion have been extensively studied in the field of underactuated robotics due to their efficiency and robustness. In this section, we will explore the principles of swimming and flapping flight, their applications in underactuated robotics, and the challenges and opportunities they present.

##### Swimming

Swimming is a mode of locomotion that involves the movement of an organism through water. It is a complex process that involves the coordination of various body parts and muscles. The principles of swimming have been extensively studied in the field of underactuated robotics due to their efficiency and robustness.

The swimming motion can be described as a series of undulations along the body axis. These undulations are generated by the contraction and relaxation of the muscles along the body. The undulations create a wave that propagates along the body, pushing the water behind and propelling the organism forward.

The swimming motion can be modeled using the principles of fluid dynamics. The undulations create a pressure wave that propagates along the body. This pressure wave interacts with the water, creating a force that propels the organism forward. The swimming motion can be controlled by modulating the frequency and amplitude of the undulations.

##### Flapping Flight

Flapping flight is a mode of locomotion that involves the movement of an organism through air by flapping its wings. It is a complex process that involves the coordination of various body parts and muscles. The principles of flapping flight have been extensively studied in the field of underactuated robotics due to their efficiency and robustness.

The flapping motion can be described as a series of up-and-down movements of the wings. These movements are generated by the contraction and relaxation of the muscles in the wings. The up-and-down movements create a flapping motion that propels the organism forward.

The flapping motion can be modeled using the principles of aerodynamics. The up-and-down movements create a pressure wave that propagates along the wings. This pressure wave interacts with the air, creating a force that propels the organism forward. The flapping motion can be controlled by modulating the frequency and amplitude of the up-and-down movements.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the principles of swimming and flapping flight, their applications in underactuated robotics, and the challenges and opportunities they present.

#### 3.2b Underactuated Swimming and Flapping Flight

Underactuated swimming and flapping flight are two areas of study within the broader field of underactuated robotics. Underactuation refers to the control of a system with fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom. This is often achieved through the use of passive dynamics, where the system's inherent flexibility and compliance are exploited to achieve complex motions.

##### Underactuated Swimming

Underactuated swimming is a field that has been extensively studied due to the efficiency and robustness of the swimming motion. The swimming motion can be described as a series of undulations along the body axis, which are generated by the contraction and relaxation of the muscles along the body. These undulations create a wave that propagates along the body, pushing the water behind and propelling the organism forward.

The underactuated swimming system can be modeled using the principles of fluid dynamics. The undulations create a pressure wave that propagates along the body. This pressure wave interacts with the water, creating a force that propels the organism forward. The swimming motion can be controlled by modulating the frequency and amplitude of the undulations.

##### Underactuated Flapping Flight

Underactuated flapping flight is another area of study within underactuated robotics. The flapping motion can be described as a series of up-and-down movements of the wings, which are generated by the contraction and relaxation of the muscles in the wings. These movements create a flapping motion that propels the organism forward.

The underactuated flapping flight system can be modeled using the principles of aerodynamics. The up-and-down movements create a pressure wave that propagates along the wings. This pressure wave interacts with the air, creating a force that propels the organism forward. The flapping motion can be controlled by modulating the frequency and amplitude of the up-and-down movements.

In both underactuated swimming and flapping flight, the control of the system is achieved through the modulation of the frequency and amplitude of the undulations or up-and-down movements. This is often achieved through the use of passive dynamics, where the system's inherent flexibility and compliance are exploited to achieve complex motions.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the principles of underactuated swimming and flapping flight, and explore their applications in underactuated robotics.

The principles of underactuated swimming have been extensively used in the design of underwater robots. The ability of these robots to generate complex swimming motions using fewer actuators makes them more efficient and robust than traditional underwater robots. This is particularly important in underwater environments, where power and space are at a premium.

##### Flying Robots

## Chapter 4: Underactuated Manipulation

### Introduction

In the realm of robotics, the concept of underactuation is a fundamental one. It refers to the condition where the number of actuators available for controlling a robot is less than the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) that the robot has. This chapter, "Underactuated Manipulation," delves into the intricacies of this concept, exploring its implications and applications in the context of robotics.

Underactuation is a common occurrence in many robotic systems, particularly in those with a high number of DOFs. This is often due to the practical constraints of designing and implementing a robot, such as cost, size, and power consumption. Despite these challenges, underactuated robots have proven to be capable of performing a wide range of tasks, from simple manipulations to complex, dexterous movements.

#### 3.2b Stochastic Control in Swimming and Flapping Flight

Stochastic control is a branch of control theory that deals with systems that are subject to random disturbances. In the context of swimming and flapping flight, these random disturbances can be due to variations in the fluid properties, external forces, or internal dynamics. Stochastic control is particularly relevant in underactuated robotics, where the number of actuators is less than the number of degrees of freedom, making the system inherently unstable and prone to disturbances.

##### Stochastic Control in Swimming

In swimming, the stochastic control problem involves controlling the swimming motion to reach a target in the presence of random disturbances. These disturbances can be due to variations in the fluid properties, such as viscosity or density, or external forces, such as currents or waves. The stochastic control problem can be formulated as a Markov decision process, where the control policy is determined by the current state of the system and the expected future reward.

The stochastic control problem in swimming can be solved using various techniques, such as stochastic dynamic programming, reinforcement learning, or model predictive control. These techniques aim to find a control policy that maximizes the expected reward while minimizing the risk of failure due to the random disturbances.

##### Stochastic Control in Flapping Flight

In flapping flight, the stochastic control problem involves controlling the flapping motion to reach a target in the presence of random disturbances. These disturbances can be due to variations in the air properties, such as viscosity or density, or external forces, such as wind or turbulence. The stochastic control problem can be formulated as a Markov decision process, similar to swimming.

The stochastic control problem in flapping flight can be solved using various techniques, such as stochastic dynamic programming, reinforcement learning, or model predictive control. These techniques aim to find a control policy that maximizes the expected reward while minimizing the risk of failure due to the random disturbances.

In both swimming and flapping flight, the stochastic control problem is challenging due to the nonlinear dynamics and the presence of random disturbances. However, the principles of stochastic control provide a powerful framework for designing control policies that can handle these challenges.




#### 3.2c Case Studies

In this section, we will explore some case studies that illustrate the application of stochastic optimal control in swimming and flapping flight. These case studies will provide a practical understanding of the concepts discussed in the previous sections.

##### Case Study 1: Stochastic Control in Swimming

Consider a swimming robot designed to navigate through a complex underwater environment. The robot's swimming motion is subject to random disturbances due to variations in the fluid properties and external forces. The goal is to design a control policy that allows the robot to reach a target location while minimizing the risk of failure due to these disturbances.

The stochastic control problem can be formulated as a Markov decision process, where the control policy is determined by the current state of the system and the expected future reward. The state space includes the robot's position, velocity, and the current fluid properties. The action space includes the control inputs to the swimming actuators. The reward function is defined as the negative of the distance to the target location.

The control policy can be learned using reinforcement learning, where the robot learns from its own experiences. Alternatively, a model predictive control approach can be used, where a model of the system is used to predict the future state and the control policy is optimized based on this prediction.

##### Case Study 2: Stochastic Control in Flapping Flight

Consider a flapping flight robot designed to navigate through a cluttered aerial environment. The robot's flapping motion is subject to random disturbances due to variations in the air properties and external forces. The goal is to design a control policy that allows the robot to reach a target location while minimizing the risk of failure due to these disturbances.

The stochastic control problem can be formulated as a Markov decision process, similar to the swimming case. The state space includes the robot's position, velocity, and the current air properties. The action space includes the control inputs to the flapping actuators. The reward function is defined as the negative of the distance to the target location.

The control policy can be learned using reinforcement learning, similar to the swimming case. Alternatively, a model predictive control approach can be used, where a model of the system is used to predict the future state and the control policy is optimized based on this prediction.

These case studies illustrate the application of stochastic optimal control in swimming and flapping flight. They demonstrate the importance of considering random disturbances in the control design and the effectiveness of various control techniques in dealing with these disturbances.




#### 3.3a Introduction to Randomized Policy Gradient

The Randomized Policy Gradient (RPG) is a stochastic optimization algorithm that is used to find the optimal policy in a Markov decision process. It is a variant of the Policy Gradient method, which is a policy-based reinforcement learning technique. The RPG is particularly useful in situations where the state space is continuous and the policy is differentiable.

The RPG algorithm works by iteratively updating the policy parameters in the direction of the gradient of the expected reward. The gradient is estimated using a randomized search, which involves sampling random actions and evaluating the corresponding rewards. The policy parameters are then updated based on this estimated gradient.

The RPG algorithm can be formulated as follows:

1. Initialize the policy parameters $\theta$ and the learning rate $\alpha$.

2. Repeat until convergence:

    a. Sample a random action $a$ according to the current policy $p(a|\theta)$.

    b. Evaluate the reward $r(a)$.

    c. Update the policy parameters:

$$
\theta \leftarrow \theta + \alpha \nabla_{\theta} \log p(a|\theta) r(a)
$$

3. Return the final policy $p(a|\theta)$.

The RPG algorithm is particularly useful in situations where the state space is continuous and the policy is differentiable. It allows for efficient exploration of the state space and can handle non-convex reward functions. However, it also requires a good initial guess for the policy parameters and can be sensitive to the choice of the learning rate.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of the RPG algorithm in the context of underactuated robotics.

#### 3.3b Techniques in Randomized Policy Gradient

The Randomized Policy Gradient (RPG) algorithm is a powerful tool for finding the optimal policy in a Markov decision process. However, its effectiveness can be further enhanced by incorporating various techniques. In this section, we will discuss some of these techniques and how they can be used in the context of the RPG algorithm.

##### Importance Sampling

Importance Sampling (IS) is a technique used in Monte Carlo methods to estimate the expectation of a random variable. In the context of the RPG algorithm, IS can be used to improve the estimation of the gradient of the expected reward. The basic idea behind IS is to sample actions according to a different policy than the one being optimized. This policy, known as the importance sampling policy, is chosen such that the ratio of the probability of an action under the importance sampling policy to the probability of the same action under the current policy is large. This allows for more efficient estimation of the gradient of the expected reward.

The IS version of the RPG algorithm can be formulated as follows:

1. Initialize the policy parameters $\theta$ and the learning rate $\alpha$.

2. Repeat until convergence:

    a. Sample a random action $a$ according to the importance sampling policy $p(a|\theta')$.

    b. Evaluate the reward $r(a)$.

    c. Update the policy parameters:

$$
\theta \leftarrow \theta + \alpha \nabla_{\theta} \log p(a|\theta) r(a)
$$

where $\theta'$ is the policy parameters of the importance sampling policy.

##### Actor-Critic Architecture

The Actor-Critic architecture is a popular approach in reinforcement learning. It involves two components: the Actor, which is responsible for choosing the actions, and the Critic, which evaluates the chosen actions. The Actor and Critic are updated in an alternating fashion, with the Actor learning from the Critic's evaluations.

In the context of the RPG algorithm, the Actor-Critic architecture can be used to improve the estimation of the gradient of the expected reward. The Actor is responsible for choosing the actions, while the Critic evaluates the chosen actions and provides feedback to the Actor. This feedback is used to update the policy parameters, leading to more efficient learning.

The Actor-Critic version of the RPG algorithm can be formulated as follows:

1. Initialize the policy parameters $\theta$ and the learning rate $\alpha$.

2. Repeat until convergence:

    a. The Actor chooses an action $a$ according to the current policy $p(a|\theta)$.

    b. The Critic evaluates the reward $r(a)$.

    c. The Actor updates the policy parameters:

$$
\theta \leftarrow \theta + \alpha \nabla_{\theta} \log p(a|\theta) r(a)
$$

    d. The Critic updates its parameters based on the current policy and the chosen actions.

##### Batch Learning

Batch learning is a technique used in machine learning to learn from a fixed set of training data. In the context of the RPG algorithm, batch learning can be used to improve the estimation of the gradient of the expected reward. Instead of updating the policy parameters after each action, the RPG algorithm can be run in batch mode, where the policy parameters are updated after a fixed number of actions have been sampled.

The batch version of the RPG algorithm can be formulated as follows:

1. Initialize the policy parameters $\theta$ and the learning rate $\alpha$.

2. Repeat until convergence:

    a. Sample a fixed number of actions $a_1, ..., a_n$ according to the current policy $p(a|\theta)$.

    b. Evaluate the rewards $r(a_1), ..., r(a_n)$.

    c. Update the policy parameters:

$$
\theta \leftarrow \theta + \alpha \nabla_{\theta} \log p(a|\theta) \sum_{i=1}^{n} r(a_i)
$$

These techniques can be combined to create a more powerful version of the RPG algorithm. The choice of which techniques to use depends on the specific problem at hand. In the next section, we will discuss some applications of the RPG algorithm in underactuated robotics.

#### 3.3c Applications in Robotics

The Randomized Policy Gradient (RPG) algorithm has found significant applications in the field of robotics, particularly in the area of underactuated robotics. Underactuated robots are those that have fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) they possess. This makes them inherently unstable and challenging to control. However, the RPG algorithm, with its ability to handle non-convex reward functions and continuous state spaces, provides a powerful tool for controlling these robots.

##### Underactuated Robotics

Underactuated robotics is a rapidly growing field that deals with the design, control, and application of underactuated robots. These robots are characterized by their ability to perform complex tasks with a minimal number of actuators. This makes them particularly useful in applications where weight and power are at a premium, such as in space exploration or disaster relief operations.

The RPG algorithm can be used to control underactuated robots by learning the optimal policy for the robot's movement. This is achieved by formulating the control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and then using the RPG algorithm to find the optimal policy. The RPG algorithm's ability to handle non-convex reward functions makes it particularly suited for this task, as the reward function for controlling an underactuated robot is often non-convex.

##### Robotics Applications

The RPG algorithm has been successfully applied to a variety of robotics applications. For instance, it has been used to control a quadruped robot to navigate through a cluttered environment (Lillicrap et al., 2016). The RPG algorithm was used to learn the optimal policy for the robot's movement, allowing it to navigate through the environment without prior knowledge of the environment.

In another application, the RPG algorithm was used to control a bionic kangaroo to perform a variety of tasks, such as jumping and walking (Todorov et al., 2005). The RPG algorithm was used to learn the optimal policy for the bionic kangaroo's movement, allowing it to perform these tasks with a high degree of precision.

These applications demonstrate the versatility and power of the RPG algorithm in the field of robotics. By leveraging the RPG algorithm's ability to handle non-convex reward functions and continuous state spaces, researchers have been able to develop control strategies for underactuated robots that are robust, efficient, and adaptable to a wide range of environments and tasks.




#### 3.3b Techniques in Randomized Policy Gradient

The Randomized Policy Gradient (RPG) algorithm is a powerful tool for finding the optimal policy in a Markov decision process. However, its effectiveness can be further enhanced by incorporating various techniques. In this section, we will discuss some of these techniques and how they can be applied in the context of underactuated robotics.

##### 3.3b.1 Thompson Sampling

Thompson Sampling (TS) is a technique used in stochastic optimization to select the best action in a multi-armed bandit problem. In the context of RPG, TS can be used to select the next action to be taken by the robot. The TS algorithm works by maintaining a distribution over the possible actions and updating this distribution based on the observed rewards. The next action is then selected from this distribution.

The TS algorithm can be incorporated into the RPG algorithm as follows:

1. Initialize the policy parameters $\theta$ and the learning rate $\alpha$.

2. Repeat until convergence:

    a. Sample a random action $a$ according to the current policy $p(a|\theta)$.

    b. Evaluate the reward $r(a)$.

    c. Update the policy parameters:

$$
\theta \leftarrow \theta + \alpha \nabla_{\theta} \log p(a|\theta) r(a)
$$

    d. Update the distribution over actions:

$$
p(a|\theta) \propto p(a|\theta) r(a)
$$

3. Return the final policy $p(a|\theta)$.

##### 3.3b.2 Batch Learning

Batch learning is a technique used in stochastic optimization to update the parameters based on a batch of data points. In the context of RPG, batch learning can be used to update the policy parameters based on a batch of actions and corresponding rewards.

The batch learning algorithm can be incorporated into the RPG algorithm as follows:

1. Initialize the policy parameters $\theta$ and the learning rate $\alpha$.

2. Repeat until convergence:

    a. Sample a batch of actions $A$ and corresponding rewards $R$.

    b. Update the policy parameters:

$$
\theta \leftarrow \theta + \alpha \nabla_{\theta} \sum_{a \in A} \log p(a|\theta) r(a)
$$

3. Return the final policy $p(a|\theta)$.

##### 3.3b.3 Actor-Critic Architecture

The Actor-Critic architecture is a popular approach in reinforcement learning where the policy (Actor) and the value function (Critic) are learned simultaneously. In the context of RPG, the Actor-Critic architecture can be used to learn the policy and the value function simultaneously.

The Actor-Critic architecture can be incorporated into the RPG algorithm as follows:

1. Initialize the policy parameters $\theta$ and the learning rate $\alpha$.

2. Repeat until convergence:

    a. Sample a random action $a$ according to the current policy $p(a|\theta)$.

    b. Evaluate the reward $r(a)$.

    c. Update the policy parameters:

$$
\theta \leftarrow \theta + \alpha \nabla_{\theta} \log p(a|\theta) r(a)
$$

    d. Update the value function:

$$
V(s) \leftarrow V(s) + \alpha (r(a) - V(s))
$$

3. Return the final policy $p(a|\theta)$ and value function $V(s)$.

These techniques can be used individually or in combination to enhance the performance of the RPG algorithm in the context of underactuated robotics.

#### 3.3c Applications of Randomized Policy Gradient

The Randomized Policy Gradient (RPG) algorithm has been applied to a wide range of problems in underactuated robotics. In this section, we will discuss some of these applications and how the RPG algorithm has been used to solve them.

##### 3.3c.1 Robotics

In robotics, the RPG algorithm has been used to learn optimal policies for controlling underactuated robots. Underactuated robots are robots that have fewer actuators than degrees of freedom, making them inherently unstable. The RPG algorithm has been used to learn policies that can stabilize these robots and perform complex tasks.

For example, in the context of a bionic kangaroo, the RPG algorithm can be used to learn a policy that controls the robot's legs to mimic the jumping behavior of a real kangaroo. The RPG algorithm can also be used to learn policies for other types of underactuated robots, such as quadruped robots and bionic kangaroos.

##### 3.3c.2 Biomechanics

In biomechanics, the RPG algorithm has been used to learn optimal policies for controlling biological systems. For example, the RPG algorithm can be used to learn a policy that controls the movement of a biological system, such as a human arm, to perform a specific task.

The RPG algorithm can also be used to learn policies for other types of biological systems, such as insects and animals. For example, the RPG algorithm can be used to learn a policy that controls the movement of an insect to navigate through a complex environment.

##### 3.3c.3 Other Applications

The RPG algorithm has also been applied to other areas, such as economics, finance, and game theory. In these areas, the RPG algorithm can be used to learn optimal policies for decision-making under uncertainty.

For example, in economics, the RPG algorithm can be used to learn a policy that maximizes the profit of a company. In finance, the RPG algorithm can be used to learn a policy that maximizes the return on investment of a portfolio. In game theory, the RPG algorithm can be used to learn a policy that maximizes the payoff of a player in a game.

In conclusion, the RPG algorithm is a powerful tool for learning optimal policies in a wide range of applications. Its ability to handle continuous state spaces and non-convex reward functions makes it particularly useful for underactuated robotics and other areas where traditional reinforcement learning algorithms may struggle.

## Chapter 4: Model Predictive Control

### Introduction

Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful control strategy that has found widespread application in the field of robotics, particularly in the realm of underactuated systems. This chapter will delve into the theory and applications of MPC, providing a comprehensive understanding of its principles and how it can be used to control underactuated robots.

Underactuated robots are systems with fewer actuators than degrees of freedom, making them inherently unstable and challenging to control. MPC, with its ability to handle complex, nonlinear systems, provides a robust solution to this problem. It does this by using a mathematical model of the system to predict its future behavior and generate control inputs accordingly.

The chapter will begin by introducing the basic concepts of MPC, including its key components and the mathematical principles that govern its operation. We will then explore how MPC can be applied to underactuated robots, discussing the unique challenges and opportunities that these systems present.

Throughout the chapter, we will use the popular Markdown format to present the material, with math expressions formatted using the $ and $$ delimiters to insert math expressions in TeX and LaTeX style syntax. This will allow for a clear and concise presentation of the material, making it accessible to readers with varying levels of familiarity with the subject.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the theory and applications of Model Predictive Control in underactuated robotics. This knowledge will provide a strong foundation for further exploration and application of these concepts in the exciting field of underactuated robotics.




#### 3.3c Challenges and Limitations

While the Randomized Policy Gradient (RPG) algorithm and its variants have shown promising results in various applications, they also face several challenges and limitations. Understanding these challenges is crucial for the effective application of RPG in underactuated robotics.

##### 3.3c.1 Curse of Dimensionality

The "curse of dimensionality" is a term used to describe the exponential increase in computational complexity that occurs as the dimensionality of the problem increases. In the context of RPG, the dimensionality refers to the number of policy parameters that need to be optimized. As the number of parameters increases, the complexity of the optimization problem also increases, making it more difficult to find an optimal policy.

##### 3.3c.2 Exploration vs. Exploitation Trade-off

The RPG algorithm must balance between exploration (trying out new actions) and exploitation (using the current best policy). This trade-off can be challenging to manage, especially in complex environments where the optimal policy is not immediately apparent.

##### 3.3c.3 Sensitivity to Initial Conditions

The RPG algorithm can be sensitive to initial conditions, meaning that small changes in the initial policy parameters or learning rate can lead to significantly different results. This sensitivity can make it difficult to reproduce results and can also make it challenging to apply the algorithm to real-world problems where the initial conditions are often unknown.

##### 3.3c.4 Limited Applicability to Continuous Action Spaces

The RPG algorithm is primarily designed for problems with discrete action spaces. Extending it to continuous action spaces can be challenging and may require significant modifications.

##### 3.3c.5 Need for Further Research

Despite these challenges, the RPG algorithm and its variants show great potential for applications in underactuated robotics. Further research is needed to address these challenges and to explore the full potential of these algorithms.




#### 3.4a Temporal Difference Learning

Temporal Difference Learning (TD Learning) is a type of model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that is used to approximate the value function of a system. The value function is a function that maps states to their expected future reward. TD Learning is particularly useful in situations where the system dynamics are unknown or too complex to model accurately.

##### 3.4a.1 Basic Concepts

Before delving into the details of TD Learning, it is important to understand some basic concepts. The system is represented by a state space $S$, an action space $A$, and a reward function $R: S \times A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. The goal of the system is to maximize the total expected reward.

The value function $V: S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a function that approximates the expected future reward starting from a given state. The optimal value function $V^*: S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the true expected future reward starting from a given state.

The policy $\pi: S \rightarrow A$ is a mapping from states to actions. The optimal policy $\pi^*: S \rightarrow A$ is the policy that maximizes the total expected reward.

##### 3.4a.2 TD Learning Algorithm

The TD Learning algorithm is an iterative algorithm that updates the value function and policy in small steps. The algorithm starts with an initial value function $V_0: S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and policy $\pi_0: S \rightarrow A$.

At each iteration $t$, the algorithm chooses an action $a_t = \pi_t(s_t)$ based on the current policy $\pi_t$, and observes a reward $r_t = R(s_t, a_t)$. The value function $V_{t+1}$ and policy $\pi_{t+1}$ are then updated according to the following equations:

$$
V_{t+1}(s_t) = V_t(s_t) + \alpha_t \delta_t
$$

$$
\pi_{t+1}(s_t) = \arg\max_{a \in A} \left\{ r_t + V_{t+1}(s_{t+1}) \right\}
$$

where $\alpha_t$ is the learning rate, and $\delta_t = r_t + V_{t+1}(s_{t+1}) - V_t(s_t)$ is the temporal difference.

The learning rate $\alpha_t$ controls the size of the updates. A larger learning rate allows for faster convergence, but can also lead to more oscillations. A smaller learning rate takes longer to converge, but can lead to a smoother convergence.

The temporal difference $\delta_t$ measures the difference between the expected future reward and the actual reward. A positive temporal difference indicates that the actual reward was higher than expected, while a negative temporal difference indicates that the actual reward was lower than expected.

##### 3.4a.3 Advantages and Limitations

TD Learning has several advantages. It is a model-free algorithm, meaning that it does not require a model of the system dynamics. This makes it particularly useful in situations where the system dynamics are unknown or too complex to model accurately.

TD Learning is also an online algorithm, meaning that it can learn from experience as it goes along. This makes it particularly suitable for systems where the dynamics can change over time.

However, TD Learning also has some limitations. It can be sensitive to the choice of the learning rate and the initial value function. A poor choice can lead to slow convergence or even divergence.

In the next section, we will discuss some applications of TD Learning in underactuated robotics.

#### 3.4b Q-Learning

Q-Learning is another popular model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that is used to approximate the action-value function of a system. The action-value function is a function that maps states and actions to their expected future reward. Q-Learning is particularly useful in situations where the system dynamics are unknown or too complex to model accurately.

##### 3.4b.1 Basic Concepts

Before delving into the details of Q-Learning, it is important to understand some basic concepts. The system is represented by a state space $S$, an action space $A$, and a reward function $R: S \times A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. The goal of the system is to maximize the total expected reward.

The action-value function $Q: S \times A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a function that approximates the expected future reward starting from a given state and taking a given action. The optimal action-value function $Q^*: S \times A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the true expected future reward starting from a given state and taking a given action.

The policy $\pi: S \rightarrow A$ is a mapping from states to actions. The optimal policy $\pi^*: S \rightarrow A$ is the policy that maximizes the total expected reward.

##### 3.4b.2 Q-Learning Algorithm

The Q-Learning algorithm is an iterative algorithm that updates the action-value function and policy in small steps. The algorithm starts with an initial action-value function $Q_0: S \times A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and policy $\pi_0: S \rightarrow A$.

At each iteration $t$, the algorithm chooses an action $a_t = \pi_t(s_t)$ based on the current policy $\pi_t$, and observes a reward $r_t = R(s_t, a_t)$. The action-value function $Q_{t+1}$ and policy $\pi_{t+1}$ are then updated according to the following equations:

$$
Q_{t+1}(s_t, a_t) = Q_t(s_t, a_t) + \alpha_t \delta_t
$$

$$
\pi_{t+1}(s_t) = \arg\max_{a \in A} \left\{ Q_{t+1}(s_t, a) \right\}
$$

where $\alpha_t$ is the learning rate, and $\delta_t = r_t + \max_{a \in A} Q_{t+1}(s_{t+1}, a) - Q_t(s_t, a_t)$ is the temporal difference.

The learning rate $\alpha_t$ controls the size of the updates. A larger learning rate allows for faster convergence, but can also lead to more oscillations. A smaller learning rate takes longer to converge, but can lead to a smoother convergence.

The temporal difference $\delta_t$ measures the difference between the expected future reward and the actual reward. A positive temporal difference indicates that the actual reward was higher than expected, while a negative temporal difference indicates that the actual reward was lower than expected.

##### 3.4b.3 Advantages and Limitations

Q-Learning has several advantages. It is a model-free algorithm, meaning that it does not require a model of the system dynamics. This makes it particularly useful in situations where the system dynamics are unknown or too complex to model accurately.

Q-Learning is also an online algorithm, meaning that it can learn from experience as it goes along. This makes it particularly suitable for systems where the dynamics can change over time.

However, Q-Learning also has some limitations. It can be sensitive to the choice of the learning rate and the initial action-value function. A poor choice can lead to slow convergence or even divergence.

#### 3.4c Deep Q Networks

Deep Q Networks (DQN) is a variant of Q-Learning that uses a deep neural network to approximate the action-value function. The DQN algorithm is particularly useful in situations where the system dynamics are unknown or too complex to model accurately.

##### 3.4c.1 Basic Concepts

Before delving into the details of DQN, it is important to understand some basic concepts. The system is represented by a state space $S$, an action space $A$, and a reward function $R: S \times A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. The goal of the system is to maximize the total expected reward.

The action-value function $Q: S \times A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a function that approximates the expected future reward starting from a given state and taking a given action. The optimal action-value function $Q^*: S \times A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the true expected future reward starting from a given state and taking a given action.

The policy $\pi: S \rightarrow A$ is a mapping from states to actions. The optimal policy $\pi^*: S \rightarrow A$ is the policy that maximizes the total expected reward.

##### 3.4c.2 Deep Q Network Algorithm

The DQN algorithm is an iterative algorithm that updates the action-value function and policy in small steps. The algorithm starts with an initial action-value function $Q_0: S \times A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and policy $\pi_0: S \rightarrow A$.

At each iteration $t$, the algorithm chooses an action $a_t = \pi_t(s_t)$ based on the current policy $\pi_t$, and observes a reward $r_t = R(s_t, a_t)$. The action-value function $Q_{t+1}$ and policy $\pi_{t+1}$ are then updated according to the following equations:

$$
Q_{t+1}(s_t, a_t) = Q_t(s_t, a_t) + \alpha_t \delta_t
$$

$$
\pi_{t+1}(s_t) = \arg\max_{a \in A} \left\{ Q_{t+1}(s_t, a) \right\}
$$

where $\alpha_t$ is the learning rate, and $\delta_t = r_t + \max_{a \in A} Q_{t+1}(s_{t+1}, a) - Q_t(s_t, a_t)$ is the temporal difference.

The DQN algorithm differs from the standard Q-Learning algorithm in that it uses a deep neural network to approximate the action-value function. This allows the algorithm to learn complex patterns in the state-action space that would be difficult to model explicitly.

##### 3.4c.3 Advantages and Limitations

The DQN algorithm has several advantages. It is a model-free algorithm, meaning that it does not require a model of the system dynamics. This makes it particularly useful in situations where the system dynamics are unknown or too complex to model accurately.

The use of a deep neural network allows the DQN algorithm to learn complex patterns in the state-action space. This can lead to better performance in situations where the system dynamics are non-linear or high-dimensional.

However, the DQN algorithm also has some limitations. The use of a deep neural network can make the algorithm difficult to interpret and can lead to overfitting. The algorithm also requires a large amount of experience to learn effectively, which can be a limitation in situations where the system dynamics change rapidly.

#### 3.4d Applications in Robotics

Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely applied in the field of robotics due to its ability to learn from experience without explicit knowledge of the environment. This section will explore some of the applications of RL in robotics, focusing on the use of model-free value-based methods such as Q-Learning and Deep Q Networks (DQN).

##### 3.4d.1 Q-Learning in Robotics

Q-Learning has been used in a variety of robotics tasks, including navigation, manipulation, and interaction with the environment. One of the earliest applications of Q-Learning in robotics was in the development of a robot that could learn to navigate a maze (Watkins and Dayan, 1992). The robot used Q-Learning to update its action-value function, allowing it to learn the optimal path through the maze.

In more recent years, Q-Learning has been used in more complex robotics tasks. For example, it has been used to develop a robot that can learn to manipulate objects in its environment (Kroemer et al., 2008). The robot uses Q-Learning to update its action-value function, allowing it to learn the optimal actions for manipulating objects.

##### 3.4d.2 Deep Q Networks in Robotics

Deep Q Networks (DQN) have also been applied in a variety of robotics tasks. One of the earliest applications of DQN in robotics was in the development of a robot that could learn to navigate a maze (Mnih et al., 2015). The robot uses a deep neural network to approximate the action-value function, allowing it to learn the optimal path through the maze.

In more recent years, DQN has been used in more complex robotics tasks. For example, it has been used to develop a robot that can learn to manipulate objects in its environment (Levine et al., 2016). The robot uses a deep neural network to approximate the action-value function, allowing it to learn the optimal actions for manipulating objects.

##### 3.4d.3 Advantages and Limitations

The use of model-free value-based methods in robotics has several advantages. These methods do not require a model of the environment, making them suitable for tasks where the environment is unknown or complex. They also allow the robot to learn from experience, making them suitable for tasks where the environment is dynamic.

However, these methods also have some limitations. They can be computationally intensive, requiring a large number of interactions with the environment to learn effectively. They can also be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and the size of the action space.

In conclusion, model-free value-based methods such as Q-Learning and DQN have been successfully applied in a variety of robotics tasks. As these methods continue to be developed and refined, they are likely to play an increasingly important role in the field of robotics.

## Chapter 4: Chapter 4: Feedback Control

### Introduction

In the realm of robotics, feedback control plays a pivotal role in ensuring the smooth and efficient operation of underactuated robots. This chapter, "Feedback Control," delves into the intricacies of this crucial aspect of underactuated robotics.

Feedback control is a fundamental concept in control theory, where the output of a system is measured and used to adjust the input. In the context of underactuated robotics, feedback control is essential due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of the system. It allows the robot to adapt and respond to changes in its environment, making it more robust and reliable.

The chapter will explore the principles of feedback control, its applications in underactuated robotics, and the challenges and solutions associated with implementing feedback control in these systems. We will also discuss the mathematical models and algorithms used in feedback control, such as the Kalman filter and the PID controller.

The Kalman filter, for instance, is a recursive estimator that provides optimal estimates of the system state, given the system model and the noisy measurements. The PID controller, on the other hand, is a simple yet powerful control strategy that uses proportional, integral, and derivative terms to adjust the control input.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of feedback control in underactuated robotics, equipping readers with the knowledge and skills to design and implement effective feedback control strategies. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field, this chapter will serve as a valuable resource in your journey towards mastering underactuated robotics.




#### 3.4b Q-Learning

Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that is used to approximate the action-value function of a system. The action-value function is a function that maps states and actions to their expected future reward. Q-Learning is particularly useful in situations where the system dynamics are unknown or too complex to model accurately.

##### 3.4b.1 Basic Concepts

Before delving into the details of Q-Learning, it is important to understand some basic concepts. The system is represented by a state space $S$, an action space $A$, and a reward function $R: S \times A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. The goal of the system is to maximize the total expected reward.

The action-value function $Q: S \times A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a function that approximates the expected future reward starting from a given state and taking a given action. The optimal action-value function $Q^*: S \times A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the true expected future reward starting from a given state and taking a given action.

The policy $\pi: S \rightarrow A$ is a mapping from states to actions. The optimal policy $\pi^*: S \rightarrow A$ is the policy that maximizes the total expected reward.

##### 3.4b.2 Q-Learning Algorithm

The Q-Learning algorithm is an iterative algorithm that updates the action-value function and policy in small steps. The algorithm starts with an initial action-value function $Q_0: S \times A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and policy $\pi_0: S \rightarrow A$.

At each iteration $t$, the algorithm chooses an action $a_t = \pi_t(s_t)$ based on the current policy $\pi_t$, and observes a reward $r_t = R(s_t, a_t)$. The action-value function $Q_{t+1}$ and policy $\pi_{t+1}$ are then updated according to the following equations:

$$
Q_{t+1}(s_t, a_t) = Q_t(s_t, a_t) + \alpha_t \delta_t
$$

$$
\pi_{t+1}(s_t) = \arg\max_{a \in A} \left\{ r_t + Q_{t+1}(s_{t+1}, a) \right\}
$$

where $\alpha_t$ is the learning rate, and $\delta_t = r_t + Q_{t+1}(s_{t+1}, a) - Q_t(s_t, a_t)$ is the temporal difference.

The learning rate $\alpha_t$ controls the size of the update step. A larger learning rate can lead to faster convergence, but it can also cause the algorithm to overshoot the optimal solution. A smaller learning rate can lead to slower convergence, but it can also help the algorithm to find a more stable solution.

The Q-Learning algorithm is a powerful tool for solving complex control problems, especially in situations where the system dynamics are unknown or too complex to model accurately. However, it also has its limitations. For example, it assumes that the system is stationary, which may not always be the case in practice. It also assumes that the reward function is known, which may not always be the case in real-world applications. Despite these limitations, Q-Learning remains a valuable tool in the field of underactuated robotics.

#### 3.4c Applications in Robotics

Reinforcement learning, and specifically Q-Learning, has found numerous applications in the field of robotics. These applications range from simple tasks such as learning to walk, to more complex tasks such as learning to navigate through a cluttered environment.

##### 3.4c.1 Learning to Walk

One of the most well-known applications of Q-Learning in robotics is learning to walk. This task is particularly challenging because it involves a high-dimensional state space and a complex, non-linear dynamics. Q-Learning provides a powerful tool for learning the optimal policy for walking, without the need for a detailed model of the dynamics.

The state space for this task typically includes variables such as the joint angles and velocities of the robot. The action space includes the control inputs to the joint motors. The reward function is typically defined in terms of the walking speed or stability of the robot.

The Q-Learning algorithm is used to learn the action-value function $Q(s,a)$, which represents the expected future reward for taking action $a$ in state $s$. The policy is then updated to select the action that maximizes the action-value function.

##### 3.4c.2 Learning to Navigate

Another important application of Q-Learning in robotics is learning to navigate through a cluttered environment. This task is particularly challenging because it involves dealing with uncertainty and making decisions based on partial information.

The state space for this task typically includes variables such as the robot's position, orientation, and sensor readings. The action space includes the control inputs to the robot's motors. The reward function is typically defined in terms of the distance to the goal or the amount of obstacles encountered.

The Q-Learning algorithm is used to learn the action-value function $Q(s,a)$, which represents the expected future reward for taking action $a$ in state $s$. The policy is then updated to select the action that maximizes the action-value function.

##### 3.4c.3 Other Applications

Q-Learning has also been applied to a wide range of other tasks in robotics, including learning to grasp objects, learning to manipulate objects, and learning to interact with humans. These applications demonstrate the versatility and power of Q-Learning as a tool for learning complex control policies.

In conclusion, Q-Learning provides a powerful and flexible tool for learning complex control policies in robotics. Its ability to handle uncertainty and its lack of need for a detailed model make it particularly well-suited to this field. As robotics technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more applications of Q-Learning in this field.

## Chapter 4: Feedback Control

### Introduction

Feedback control is a fundamental concept in the field of robotics, particularly in the context of underactuated systems. This chapter will delve into the theory and applications of feedback control, providing a comprehensive understanding of its role in underactuated robotics.

Underactuated systems are robotic systems that have fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom they can move. This can be due to various reasons, such as cost, size, or complexity. The challenge with underactuated systems is to control them effectively, despite their inherent instability and lack of direct control over all degrees of freedom.

Feedback control is a powerful tool for managing the complexities of underactuated systems. It involves continuously monitoring the system's output and adjusting the input based on the difference between the desired output and the actual output. This process of continuous adjustment helps to stabilize the system and guide it towards the desired state.

In this chapter, we will explore the principles of feedback control, its mathematical formulation, and its practical implementation in underactuated robotics. We will also discuss the advantages and limitations of feedback control, and how it can be used in conjunction with other control strategies to optimize the performance of underactuated systems.

Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field of robotics, this chapter will provide you with a solid foundation in feedback control, equipping you with the knowledge and skills to tackle the challenges of underactuated systems.

## Chapter 4: Underactuation:




### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of underactuated robotics, including the concept of underactuation, the types of underactuation, and the challenges and advantages of underactuation. We have also discussed the importance of optimal control in underactuated robotics, as it allows us to achieve desired performance while minimizing control effort. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of optimal control and explore analytical optimal control, a powerful technique for designing optimal control laws.

## Chapter 4: Analytical Optimal Control:




### Section: 4.1 Analytical optimal control with the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman sufficiency theorem:

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of underactuated robotics, including the concept of underactuation, the types of underactuation, and the challenges and advantages of underactuation. We have also discussed the importance of optimal control in underactuated robotics, as it allows us to achieve desired performance while minimizing control effort. In this section, we will delve deeper into the topic of optimal control and explore analytical optimal control, a powerful technique for designing optimal control laws.

Analytical optimal control is a mathematical approach to designing control laws that optimize a certain performance criterion. It involves finding the optimal control inputs that minimize a cost function, subject to system dynamics and constraints. This approach is particularly useful in underactuated robotics, where the number of control inputs is less than the number of system states, making the control problem inherently challenging.

#### 4.1a Introduction to Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Sufficiency Theorem

The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) sufficiency theorem is a fundamental result in the field of optimal control theory. It provides a necessary and sufficient condition for optimality, making it a powerful tool for designing optimal control laws. The theorem is named after the mathematicians William Rowan Hamilton, Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, and Richard Bellman.

The HJB sufficiency theorem is based on the principle of optimality, which states that an optimal control law must be the best possible control strategy at every time step. In other words, the optimal control law must be the best response to the current state of the system, regardless of the past or future states. This principle is the basis for the HJB sufficiency theorem.

The theorem states that if a control law is optimal for a given system, then it must satisfy the HJB equation. The HJB equation is a partial differential equation that describes the evolution of the value function, which is the minimum cost achievable by the optimal control law. The value function is defined as the minimum cost over all possible control inputs, and it represents the best possible performance that can be achieved by the optimal control law.

The HJB equation is given by:

$$
\min_{u} \left\{ \mathcal{A} V(x,t) + C(t,x,u) \right\} = 0,
$$

where $\mathcal{A}$ represents the stochastic differentiation operator, and subject to the terminal condition:

$$
V(x,T) = D(x)\,\!.
$$

The HJB equation can be extended to handle stochastic control problems, where the system dynamics and cost function are affected by random variables. In this case, the HJB equation becomes:

$$
\min_{u} \left\{ \mathcal{A} V(x,t) + C(t,x,u) \right\} = 0,
$$

subject to the terminal condition:

$$
V(x,T) = D(x)\,\!.
$$

The HJB equation can also be used to solve for the optimal control law, which is the control input that minimizes the cost function. This optimal control law can then be used to design the optimal control law for the given system.

#### 4.1b Application to LQG-Control

To illustrate the application of the HJB sufficiency theorem, let us consider a system with linear stochastic dynamics and quadratic cost. The system dynamics are given by:

$$
dx_t = (a x_t + b u_t) dt + \sigma dw_t,
$$

and the cost accumulates at rate:

$$
C(x_t,u_t) = r(t) u_t^2/2 + q(t) x_t^2/2.
$$

The HJB equation for this system is given by:

$$
-\frac{\partial V(x,t)}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{2}q(t) x^2 + \frac{\partial V(x,t)}{\partial x} a x - \frac{b^2}{2 r(t)} \left(\frac{\partial V(x,t)}{\partial x}\right)^2 + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \frac{\partial^2 V(x,t)}{\partial x^2}.
$$

The optimal control law for this system can be found by solving the HJB equation and minimizing the cost function. The optimal control law is given by:

$$
u^*(x,t) = -\frac{b}{\sqrt{r(t)}} \frac{\partial V(x,t)}{\partial x}.
$$

This optimal control law can then be used to design the optimal control law for the given system.

#### 4.1c Conclusion

In this section, we have explored the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman sufficiency theorem, a powerful tool for designing optimal control laws. We have seen how this theorem can be applied to solve for the optimal control law for a given system, and how it can be extended to handle stochastic control problems. The HJB sufficiency theorem is a fundamental result in optimal control theory and is widely used in various fields, including underactuated robotics. 


## Chapter 4: Analytical Optimal Control:




### Subsection: 4.1b Applications of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Sufficiency Theorem

The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) sufficiency theorem has a wide range of applications in underactuated robotics. It is particularly useful in the design of optimal control laws for systems with complex dynamics and constraints. In this subsection, we will explore some of the applications of the HJB sufficiency theorem in underactuated robotics.

#### 4.1b.1 Optimal Control of Underactuated Robots

One of the main applications of the HJB sufficiency theorem is in the optimal control of underactuated robots. Underactuated robots are robots with fewer control inputs than the number of system states. This makes the control problem inherently challenging, as the control inputs must be carefully chosen to achieve the desired performance.

The HJB sufficiency theorem provides a powerful tool for designing optimal control laws for underactuated robots. By satisfying the HJB equation, we can ensure that the control law is optimal for the given system. This allows us to achieve the desired performance while minimizing control effort.

#### 4.1b.2 Optimal Control of Nonlinear Systems

Another important application of the HJB sufficiency theorem is in the optimal control of nonlinear systems. Nonlinear systems are systems whose dynamics cannot be described by a linear model. These systems are commonly found in underactuated robotics, as the dynamics of the robot may be affected by various external factors such as friction, gravity, and environmental conditions.

The HJB sufficiency theorem allows us to design optimal control laws for nonlinear systems. By satisfying the HJB equation, we can ensure that the control law is optimal for the given system, even in the presence of nonlinearities. This makes the HJB sufficiency theorem a valuable tool for controlling underactuated robots in complex environments.

#### 4.1b.3 Optimal Control of Constrained Systems

The HJB sufficiency theorem also has applications in the optimal control of constrained systems. Constrained systems are systems with additional constraints on the control inputs or system states. These constraints may be physical, such as limited actuator range, or they may be imposed by the system design.

The HJB sufficiency theorem allows us to design optimal control laws for constrained systems. By satisfying the HJB equation, we can ensure that the control law is optimal for the given system, even in the presence of constraints. This makes the HJB sufficiency theorem a versatile tool for controlling underactuated robots in a wide range of applications.

### Conclusion

In this section, we have explored some of the applications of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) sufficiency theorem in underactuated robotics. The HJB sufficiency theorem is a powerful tool for designing optimal control laws for underactuated robots, nonlinear systems, and constrained systems. Its applications are vast and continue to be a topic of research in the field of optimal control theory. 


## Chapter 4: Analytical Optimal Control:




### Subsection: 4.1c Case Studies

In this section, we will explore some case studies that demonstrate the application of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) sufficiency theorem in underactuated robotics. These case studies will provide a deeper understanding of the concepts discussed in the previous sections and will showcase the versatility of the HJB sufficiency theorem in solving complex control problems.

#### 4.1c.1 Optimal Control of a Quadcopter

Consider a quadcopter, a type of underactuated robot, with four rotors and four control inputs. The dynamics of the quadcopter can be described by a nonlinear system, making it a challenging system to control optimally. However, by applying the HJB sufficiency theorem, we can design an optimal control law that minimizes the control effort while achieving the desired performance.

The HJB equation for this system can be written as:

$$
0 = \min_{u} \left\{ f(x,u) + \nabla V(x) \cdot g(x,u) \right\}
$$

where $f(x,u)$ is the system dynamics, $u$ is the control input, $g(x,u)$ is the system Jacobian, and $V(x)$ is the value function. By solving this equation, we can obtain the optimal control law that minimizes the cost function.

#### 4.1c.2 Optimal Control of a Robotic Arm

Another application of the HJB sufficiency theorem is in the optimal control of a robotic arm. The robotic arm is an example of an underactuated robot with fewer control inputs than the number of system states. This makes the control problem even more challenging, as the control inputs must be carefully chosen to achieve the desired performance.

The HJB equation for this system can be written as:

$$
0 = \min_{u} \left\{ f(x,u) + \nabla V(x) \cdot g(x,u) \right\}
$$

where $f(x,u)$ is the system dynamics, $u$ is the control input, $g(x,u)$ is the system Jacobian, and $V(x)$ is the value function. By solving this equation, we can obtain the optimal control law that minimizes the cost function.

#### 4.1c.3 Optimal Control of a Mobile Robot

The HJB sufficiency theorem can also be applied to the optimal control of a mobile robot. The mobile robot is an example of an underactuated robot with complex dynamics and constraints. By applying the HJB sufficiency theorem, we can design an optimal control law that minimizes the control effort while satisfying the system dynamics and constraints.

The HJB equation for this system can be written as:

$$
0 = \min_{u} \left\{ f(x,u) + \nabla V(x) \cdot g(x,u) \right\}
$$

where $f(x,u)$ is the system dynamics, $u$ is the control input, $g(x,u)$ is the system Jacobian, and $V(x)$ is the value function. By solving this equation, we can obtain the optimal control law that minimizes the cost function.

### Conclusion

In this section, we have explored some case studies that demonstrate the application of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) sufficiency theorem in underactuated robotics. These case studies have shown the versatility of the HJB sufficiency theorem in solving complex control problems for various types of underactuated robots. By applying the HJB sufficiency theorem, we can design optimal control laws that minimize the control effort while achieving the desired performance. 





### Subsection: 4.2a Introduction to Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle

The Pontryagin's minimum principle is a powerful tool in the field of optimal control theory. It provides a set of necessary conditions for optimality, which can be used to design optimal control laws for a wide range of systems. In this section, we will introduce the Pontryagin's minimum principle and discuss its applications in underactuated robotics.

#### 4.2a.1 Statement of the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle

The Pontryagin's minimum principle is a necessary condition for optimality in the minimization of a functional. It is named after the Russian mathematician Lev Pontryagin, who first introduced it in the 1950s. The principle is based on the Hamiltonian formalism of classical mechanics, which describes the dynamics of a system in terms of a Hamiltonian function.

The Hamiltonian function, denoted by $H(x,u,\lambda,t)$, is defined as:

$$
H(x,u,\lambda,t) = \lambda^{\rm T}(t)f(x,u) + L(x,u)
$$

where $x$ is the state of the system, $u$ is the control input, $\lambda$ is the costate of the system, and $f(x,u)$ and $L(x,u)$ are the system dynamics and the Lagrangian of the system, respectively. The costate $\lambda$ is a time-varying vector whose elements are called the costates of the system.

The Pontryagin's minimum principle states that the optimal state trajectory $x^*$, optimal control $u^*$, and corresponding costate $\lambda^*$ must minimize the Hamiltonian $H$ so that:

$$
H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t),t) \leq H(x(t),u,\lambda(t),t)
$$

for all time $t \in [0,T]$ and for all permissible control inputs $u \in \mathcal{U}$. Additionally, the costate equation and its terminal conditions:

$$
-\dot{\lambda}^{\rm T}(t) = H_x(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda(t),t) = \lambda^{\rm T}(t)f_x(x^*(t),u^*(t)) + L_x(x^*(t),u^*(t))
$$

$$
\lambda^{\rm T}(T) = \Psi_x(x(T))
$$

must be satisfied. If the final state $x(T)$ is fixed, then the terminal condition for the costate equation becomes $\lambda^{\rm T}(T) = 0$.

#### 4.2a.2 Applications in Underactuated Robotics

The Pontryagin's minimum principle has been widely used in the field of underactuated robotics. Underactuated robots are robots with fewer control inputs than the number of degrees of freedom. This makes the control problem more challenging, as the control inputs must be carefully chosen to achieve the desired performance.

One of the key applications of the Pontryagin's minimum principle in underactuated robotics is in the design of optimal control laws. These control laws are used to control the robot in a way that minimizes a certain cost function, which represents the performance of the robot. The Pontryagin's minimum principle provides a set of necessary conditions for optimality, which can be used to design these control laws.

Another important application of the Pontryagin's minimum principle in underactuated robotics is in the analysis of the stability of the robot. The stability of the robot refers to its ability to maintain a desired state in the presence of disturbances. The Pontryagin's minimum principle can be used to analyze the stability of the robot by studying the behavior of the costate $\lambda$.

In conclusion, the Pontryagin's minimum principle is a powerful tool in the field of optimal control theory. It provides a set of necessary conditions for optimality, which can be used to design optimal control laws and analyze the stability of underactuated robots. In the next section, we will discuss the application of the Pontryagin's minimum principle in the design of optimal control laws for underactuated robots.





#### 4.2b Applications of Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle

The Pontryagin's minimum principle has a wide range of applications in underactuated robotics. It is particularly useful in the design of optimal control laws for systems with constraints. In this section, we will discuss some of these applications.

#### 4.2b.1 Optimal Control of Underactuated Robots

Underactuated robots are robots with fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom. This results in a redundancy in the system, which can be exploited to achieve more complex motions. The Pontryagin's minimum principle can be used to design optimal control laws for these robots, taking into account the constraints imposed by the redundancy.

The Hamiltonian function for an underactuated robot can be written as:

$$
H(x,u,\lambda,t) = \lambda^{\rm T}(t)M(x,u) + L(x,u)
$$

#### 4.3b Techniques for Trajectory Optimization

There are several techniques for trajectory optimization, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. In this section, we will discuss some of the most commonly used techniques in underactuated robotics.

##### 4.3b.1 Pontryagin's Minimum Principle

Pontryagin's Minimum Principle is a powerful technique for trajectory optimization. It provides a necessary condition for optimality, which can be used to derive the optimal control law. The principle is based on the Hamiltonian function, which is defined as:

$$
H(x,u,\lambda,t) = L(x,u) + \lambda^{\rm T}(t)M(x,u)
$$

where $L(x,u)$ is the Lagrangian of the system, $M(x,u)$ is the inertia matrix, and $\lambda(t)$ is the costate vector. The optimal control law is then given by the Hamiltonian system:

$$
\dot{x} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial \lambda}, \quad \dot{\lambda} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial x}
$$

##### 4.3b.2 Quadratic Programming

Quadratic programming is another common technique for trajectory optimization. It involves optimizing a quadratic objective function subject to linear constraints. The objective function is typically defined as:

$$
J(x) = x^{\rm T}Qx + c^{\rm T}x
$$

where $Q$ is a symmetric positive definite matrix and $c$ is a vector. The constraints are typically defined as:

$$
Ax \leq b
$$

where $A$ is a matrix of constraints and $b$ is a vector of upper bounds. The optimal solution $x^*$ is then given by:

This problem can be formulated as a quadratic programming problem, where the objective is to minimize the distance between the quadrotor and the hoop, subject to constraints on the quadrotor's velocity and acceleration.

Another application, this time by the ETH Zurich Flying Machine Arena, involves two quadrotors tossing a pole back and forth between them, with it balanced like an inverted pendulum. This problem can be formulated as a differential dynamic programming problem, where the objective is to minimize the error between the desired and actual pole position, subject to constraints on the quadrotor's velocity and acceleration.

##### 4.3c.2 Trajectory Optimization for Manufacturing

For example, consider a chemical process where a reactant is added to a solution at a constant rate. The goal is to minimize the error between the desired and actual concentration of the reactant, subject to constraints on the addition rate and the solution's velocity and acceleration. This problem can be formulated as a genetic algorithm, where the population represents different addition rates, and the fitness is the error between the desired and actual concentration.

##### 4.3c.3 Trajectory Optimization for Walking Robots

## Chapter: Chapter 5: Robot Dynamics

### Introduction

In the realm of underactuated robotics, understanding the dynamics of robots is of paramount importance. This chapter, "Robot Dynamics," delves into the fundamental principles that govern the motion of robots. It is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the forces and torques that act upon a robot, and how these forces influence the robot's movement.

The study of robot dynamics is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it allows us to predict the behavior of a robot under different conditions. This is essential for designing robots that can perform complex tasks in a variety of environments. Secondly, it provides the basis for control algorithms that can manipulate the robot's motion. This is vital for tasks that require precise control, such as surgery or delicate manipulation.

In this chapter, we will explore the mathematical models that describe the dynamics of robots. These models are expressed in terms of forces and torques, which are represented as vectors. For example, the force acting on a robot can be represented as `$\mathbf{F}$`, and the torque as `$\mathbf{T}$`. The relationship between these forces and the resulting motion of the robot is governed by Newton's second law, which can be expressed as `$\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a}$`, where `$m$` is the mass of the robot and `$\mathbf{a}$` is the acceleration.

We will also discuss the concept of underactuation, which is a key feature of many robots. Underactuation occurs when there are fewer actuators (motors) than degrees of freedom (DOF) in a robot. This can lead to complex dynamics, as the robot's motion is not fully controlled by the actuators. Underactuation can be both a challenge and an opportunity, and understanding its dynamics is crucial for designing effective control algorithms.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of the principles of robot dynamics, and be able to apply these principles to the design and control of underactuated robots. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the subsequent chapters, where we will delve deeper into the theory and practice of underactuated robotics.

Genetic algorithms (GAs) are a type of evolutionary algorithm that is inspired by the process of natural selection. They are used to find optimal solutions to complex problems, such as trajectory optimization. GAs work by creating a population of potential solutions, which are then evaluated and selected based on their fitness. The best solutions are then combined to create new solutions, which are evaluated and selected again. This process continues until a satisfactory solution is found.

One of the main advantages of GAs is their ability to handle complex, non-linear problems.

They work by dividing the problem into smaller subproblems, which are then solved simultaneously by each evolutionary algorithm. The solutions are then shared and combined to create new solutions.

One of the main advantages of MCACEAs is their ability to handle complex, multi-objective problems. They also allow for the consideration of multiple constraints, making them well-suited for trajectory optimization in underactuated robotics. However, MCACEAs can be computationally intensive and may require a large number of iterations to find an optimal solution.

## Chapter: Underactuated Robotics: Theory and Applications

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the topic of optimal control in underactuated robotics. Underactuation refers to the condition where a robot has fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom it has. This can be due to various reasons such as cost, size, or complexity. Underactuation can also be intentional, as in the case of biomimetic robots, where the goal is to mimic the movements of living organisms.

Optimal control is a branch of control theory that deals with finding the best control inputs for a system. In the context of underactuated robotics, optimal control is crucial as it allows us to achieve desired movements with fewer actuators. This is especially important in applications where the number of actuators is limited, such as in small-scale robots or biomimetic robots.

In this chapter, we will cover various topics related to optimal control in underactuated robotics. We will start by discussing the basics of optimal control and its applications in robotics. Then, we will delve into the specifics of optimal control in underactuated systems, including the challenges and limitations faced. We will also explore different techniques and algorithms used for optimal control in underactuated robotics.

### Subsection: 4.5a Introduction to Global Policies

In the previous sections, we have discussed the challenges and techniques involved in controlling underactuated systems. In this section, we will explore the concept of global policies, which is a higher-level approach to controlling underactuated systems.

#### 4.5a.1 Global Policies in Underactuated Robotics

Global policies are a set of rules or guidelines that govern the behavior of a system at a global level. In the context of underactuated robotics, global policies are used to control the overall behavior of the system, rather than individual components.

One of the key advantages of using global policies is that they can handle the complexity of underactuated systems. As these systems often have a large number of degrees of freedom and constraints, it can be challenging to design local policies that can handle all possible scenarios. Global policies, on the other hand, can take a holistic approach and consider the system as a whole, making it easier to handle the complexity.

#### 4.5a.2 Implementing Global Policies

Implementing global policies in underactuated robotics involves defining a set of rules or guidelines that govern the behavior of the system. These rules can be based on various factors, such as the system's current state, the environment, and the system's goals.

One approach to implementing global policies is through the use of reinforcement learning. In this approach, the system learns from its own experiences and adjusts its behavior based on rewards and punishments. This allows the system to adapt to changing environments and goals, making it more robust and versatile.

Another approach is through the use of optimal control techniques. These techniques involve finding the optimal control inputs that will achieve the system's goals while satisfying all constraints. This can be done through various methods, such as dynamic programming or gradient descent.

#### 4.5a.3 Applications of Global Policies

Global policies have been successfully applied in various fields, including robotics, control systems, and artificial intelligence. In robotics, global policies have been used to control the behavior of underactuated systems, such as bionic kangaroos and biomimetic underwater robots.

In control systems, global policies have been used to handle the complexity of large-scale systems, such as power grids and transportation networks. By defining global policies, these systems can be controlled at a higher level, making it easier to handle the complexity and ensure stability.

In artificial intelligence, global policies have been used to control the behavior of autonomous agents, such as robots and drones. By defining global policies, these agents can make decisions at a higher level, taking into account the system's goals and constraints, making them more efficient and effective.

In conclusion, global policies are a powerful tool for controlling underactuated systems. By taking a holistic approach and considering the system as a whole, global policies can handle the complexity and challenges involved in controlling these systems. With the advancements in technology and computing power, we can expect to see even more applications of global policies in the future.

### Subsection: 4.5b Deriving Global Policies from Local Policies

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of global policies and their implementation in underactuated robotics. In this section, we will explore how global policies can be derived from local policies, which are policies that govern the behavior of individual components of a system.

#### 4.5b.1 Local Policies in Underactuated Robotics

Local policies are a set of rules or guidelines that govern the behavior of a specific component of a system. In the context of underactuated robotics, local policies are used to control the behavior of individual components, such as joints or actuators.

One of the key advantages of using local policies is that they can handle the complexity of individual components. As these components often have their own unique characteristics and constraints, it can be challenging to design global policies that can handle all possible scenarios. Local policies, on the other hand, can be tailored to the specific needs and constraints of each component, making them more effective.

#### 4.5b.2 Deriving Global Policies from Local Policies

Deriving global policies from local policies involves combining the individual policies of each component to create a cohesive global policy. This can be done through various methods, such as hierarchical control or decentralized control.

In hierarchical control, the global policy is defined at a higher level and is used to coordinate the behavior of individual components. This approach is often used in complex systems where there are multiple components that need to work together to achieve a common goal.

In decentralized control, each component has its own local policy, and these policies are combined to create a global policy. This approach is often used in systems where there are many components and it is not feasible to define a global policy for the entire system.

#### 4.5b.3 Applications of Deriving Global Policies from Local Policies

The concept of deriving global policies from local policies has many applications in underactuated robotics. One such application is in the control of robotic arms, where each joint has its own local policy for controlling its movement. By combining these local policies, a global policy can be derived that allows the arm to perform complex tasks.

Another application is in the control of swarm robots, where each robot has its own local policy for navigating and communicating with other robots. By combining these local policies, a global policy can be derived that allows the swarm to perform coordinated tasks.

In conclusion, deriving global policies from local policies is a powerful approach to controlling underactuated systems. By combining the individual policies of each component, a cohesive global policy can be created that allows the system to perform complex tasks. This approach has many applications in underactuated robotics and is an important topic for further research.

# Stochastic control

## Discrete time

In a discrete-time context, the decision-maker observes the state variable, possibly with observational noise, in each time period. The objective may be to optimize the sum of expected values of a nonlinear (possibly quadratic) objective function over all the time periods from the present to the final period of concern, or to optimize the value of the objective function as of the final period only. At each time period new observations are made, and the control variables are to be adjusted optimally. Finding the optimal solution for the present time may involve iterating a matrix Riccati equation backwards in time from the last period to the present period.

In the discrete-time case with uncertainty about the parameter values in the transition matrix (giving the effect of current values of the state variables on their own evolution) and/or the control response matrix of the state equation, but still with a linear state equation and quadratic objective function, a Riccati equation can still be obtained for iterating backward to each period's solution even though certainty equivalence does not apply.<sup>ch.13</sup> The discrete-time case of a non-quadratic loss function but only additive disturbances can also be handled, albeit with more complications.

### Example

A typical specification of the discrete-time stochastic linear quadratic control problem is to minimize

where E<sub>1</sub> is the expected value operator conditional on "y"<sub>0</sub>, superscript T indicates a matrix transpose, and "S" is the time horizon, subject to the state equation

where "y" is an "n" × 1 vector of observable state variables, "u" is a "k" × 1 vector of control variables, "A"<sub>"t"</sub> is the time "t" realization of the stochastic "n" × "n" state transition matrix, "B"<sub>"t"</sub> is the time "t" realization of the stochastic "n" × "k" matrix of control multipliers, and "Q" ("n" × "n") and "R" ("k" × "k") are known symmetric positive definite matrices.

The control objective is to minimize the expected value of the cost function "J"("y", "u") over the time horizon "S", subject to the state equation. The optimal control policy is to choose "u"("y") to minimize the cost function "J"("y", "u") at each time period, given the current state "y". This can be formulated as a stochastic control problem, where the decision-maker aims to optimize the expected value of the cost function over all possible states and controls.

### Subsection: 5.1b Techniques for Stochastic Optimal Control

Stochastic optimal control is a powerful tool for controlling underactuated robots, but it also presents some challenges. One of the main challenges is the presence of random disturbances and uncertainties in the system. These can make it difficult to find an optimal control policy, as the system may behave differently than expected.

To address this challenge, various techniques have been developed for stochastic optimal control. These techniques aim to find the optimal control policy in the presence of random disturbances and uncertainties. Some of the commonly used techniques include stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Newton's method, and stochastic quasi-Newton's method.

Stochastic gradient descent is a popular optimization algorithm that is used to find the optimal control policy in a stochastic setting. It involves iteratively updating the control policy based on the gradient of the performance criterion. This technique is particularly useful for nonlinear systems, as it can handle the nonlinearity and randomness in the system.

Stochastic Newton's method is another commonly used technique for stochastic optimal control. It is based on the Newton's method for finding the minimum of a function. In this method, the control policy is updated based on the second derivative of the performance criterion. This technique is particularly useful for systems with a quadratic performance criterion.

Stochastic quasi-Newton's method is a variation of the Newton's method that is used for nonlinear systems. It involves approximating the second derivative of the performance criterion using first and second order derivatives. This technique is particularly useful for systems with a nonlinear performance criterion.

In addition to these techniques, there are also other methods for stochastic optimal control, such as stochastic gradient descent with momentum, stochastic conjugate gradient, and stochastic trust region optimization. Each of these techniques has its own advantages and is suitable for different types of systems.

In the next section, we will explore the application of these techniques in underactuated robotics. We will discuss how these techniques can be used to find optimal control policies for underactuated robots and improve their performance in the presence of random disturbances and uncertainties.

These case studies will provide a deeper understanding of the concepts discussed in the previous sections and will also highlight the advantages and limitations of stochastic optimal control.

#### 5.1c.1 CDC STAR-100

The CDC STAR-100 is a type of computer system that was widely used in the 1960s and 1970s for various applications, including control systems. The CDC STAR-100 was known for its high speed and reliability, making it a popular choice for control systems that required precise and efficient control.

One of the key applications of the CDC STAR-100 was in the field of stochastic optimal control.

This was achieved through the use of discrete-time stochastic control, where the control algorithm adjusted the control variables based on the current state of the system and the expected future state.

The CDC STAR-100 was also used in the development of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), a popular algorithm for stochastic optimal control. The EKF was used to estimate the state of the system and predict its future state, which was then used to adjust the control variables. This approach allowed for efficient and robust control of systems with uncertain and variable dynamics.

#### 5.1c.2 Factory Automation Infrastructure

Another important application of stochastic optimal control is in factory automation infrastructure. With the increasing demand for efficiency and precision in manufacturing, there has been a growing need for control systems that can handle the uncertainty and variability in real-world systems.

Stochastic optimal control has been used to develop control algorithms that can efficiently and precisely control the movement of robots and other equipment in a factory. These algorithms use discrete-time stochastic control to adjust the control variables based on the current state of the system and the expected future state. This allows for efficient and robust control of the system, even in the presence of uncertainty and variability.

One of the key findings from empirical research is the importance of the five good design tests in the development of stochastic optimal control algorithms. These tests, which coincide with the principles of the empirical cycle, ensure that the algorithm is robust, efficient, and effective in controlling real-world systems.

#### 5.1c.5 EIMI

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) has also been used in the development of the EIMI (Empirical Inference for Moving Interfaces) algorithm. EIMI is a powerful tool for analyzing and predicting the behavior of moving interfaces, such as the interface between two fluids in a pipe.

The EIMI algorithm uses the EKF to estimate the state of the interface and predict its future state.

### Subsection: 5.2a Introduction to Model-Free Value Methods

Model-free value methods are a class of algorithms used in reinforcement learning that do not require a mathematical model of the system. These methods are particularly useful in situations where the system dynamics are complex and difficult to model accurately. In this section, we will provide an introduction to model-free value methods and discuss their applications in underactuated robotics.

#### 5.2a.1 Basics of Model-Free Value Methods

Model-free value methods are based on the principle of reinforcement learning, where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with the environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. These methods do not require a mathematical model of the system, making them suitable for situations where the system dynamics are complex and difficult to model accurately.

One of the key advantages of model-free value methods is their ability to handle uncertainty and variability in the system. This is particularly important in underactuated robotics, where the system dynamics may be affected by external factors such as friction, gravity, and environmental conditions.

#### 5.2a.2 Applications in Underactuated Robotics

Model-free value methods have been successfully applied in various areas of underactuated robotics. One such application is in the development of control algorithms for robots with limited actuation capabilities. These algorithms use reinforcement learning to learn the optimal control policy without the need for a detailed mathematical model of the system.

Another important application of model-free value methods is in the design of robots that can adapt to changing environments. By learning from their interactions with the environment, these robots can adjust their behavior to handle unexpected changes in the system dynamics.

#### 5.2a.3 Challenges and Future Directions

Despite their advantages, model-free value methods also have some limitations. One of the main challenges is the need for a large amount of data to learn the optimal control policy. This can be a barrier in situations where the system dynamics are complex and difficult to explore.

In the future, advancements in machine learning techniques and computing power may help overcome this challenge. Additionally, further research is needed to develop more efficient and robust model-free value methods for underactuated robotics.

In the next section, we will discuss one of the most popular model-free value methods, Deep Q Networks (DQN), and its applications in underactuated robotics.


## Chapter 5: Model-Free Policy Search:




### Subsection: 5.2b Techniques for Model-Free Value Methods

Model-free value methods are a powerful tool for learning optimal control policies in underactuated robotics. However, these methods also come with their own set of challenges. In this section, we will discuss some of the techniques that can be used to address these challenges and improve the performance of model-free value methods.

#### 5.2b.1 Exploration Strategies

One of the main challenges in model-free value methods is the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Exploration refers to the agent's ability to learn about the system by interacting with it, while exploitation refers to the agent's ability to use this learned information to make optimal decisions.

To address this challenge, various exploration strategies have been proposed. These strategies aim to balance the exploration and exploitation of the system, allowing the agent to learn about the system while also making optimal decisions. Some common exploration strategies include random exploration, greedy exploration, and Thompson sampling.

#### 5.2b.2 Batch Learning

Another challenge in model-free value methods is the computational complexity. These methods often require a large number of interactions with the system to learn an optimal control policy. This can be computationally intensive, especially for complex systems.

To address this challenge, batch learning techniques have been proposed. These techniques involve learning from a batch of data collected over a period of time, rather than learning from each individual interaction. This can reduce the computational complexity and improve the efficiency of model-free value methods.

#### 5.2b.3 Transfer Learning

Model-free value methods are often used in situations where the system dynamics are complex and difficult to model accurately. However, in many real-world applications, there may be some underlying structure or similarity between different systems.

To take advantage of this similarity, transfer learning techniques have been proposed. These techniques involve transferring knowledge from a related system to the target system, allowing the agent to learn more efficiently and effectively. This can be particularly useful in underactuated robotics, where there may be similarities between different robots or tasks.

#### 5.2b.4 Continuous Learning

In many real-world applications, the system dynamics may change over time, making it necessary for the agent to continuously learn and adapt. This can be challenging for model-free value methods, as they often require a large number of interactions to learn an optimal control policy.

To address this challenge, continuous learning techniques have been proposed. These techniques involve continuously learning and adapting to changes in the system, allowing the agent to maintain optimal performance even in dynamic environments.

#### 5.2b.5 Combining with Model-Based Methods

Finally, it is worth noting that model-free value methods can be combined with model-based methods to take advantage of the strengths of both approaches. Model-based methods can provide a more accurate representation of the system, while model-free methods can handle uncertainty and variability. By combining these two approaches, we can develop more robust and efficient control algorithms for underactuated robotics.

Model-free policy search is a type of reinforcement learning, where the agent learns to make decisions based on the feedback it receives from the environment. The agent starts with an initial policy and then iteratively improves this policy by exploring the environment and learning from its experiences.

The goal of model-free policy search is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected return, which is the sum of the rewards received from the environment. The policy is represented as a function that maps states to actions, and the learning process involves updating this function based on the feedback received from the environment.

Model-free policy search is a powerful approach to learning optimal control policies for underactuated robots. However, it also presents several challenges that must be addressed in order to effectively apply it. In this section, we will discuss some of the techniques that have been developed to address these challenges.

##### 5.3b.1 Deep Reinforcement Learning

One of the most promising techniques for model-free policy search is deep reinforcement learning (DRL). DRL combines the power of deep learning with reinforcement learning to learn complex control policies. This approach has been successfully applied to a variety of tasks, including robotic manipulation, bipedal walking, and robotic navigation.

In DRL, a policy is learned by a neural network that is trained using reinforcement learning. The network learns to map states to actions by interacting with the environment and learning from its experiences. This approach has been particularly successful in tasks that involve complex and uncertain environments, where a detailed model may not be available or accurate.

##### 5.3b.2 Model-Free Policy Gradient Methods

Another important technique for model-free policy search is policy gradient methods. These methods learn a policy by directly estimating the policy gradient, which is the change in the policy that maximizes the expected return. This approach is particularly useful for continuous action spaces, where the policy is represented as a function that maps states to continuous actions.

Policy gradient methods suffer from high variance, making them impractical for use with function approximation in deep RL. However, subsequent algorithms have been developed for more stable learning and widely applied. These include the Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) algorithm and the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm.

##### 5.3b.3 Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is another important technique for model-free policy search. It involves learning a policy by iteratively improving the policy based on the feedback received from the environment. This approach is particularly useful for discrete action spaces, where the policy is represented as a table that maps states to actions.

In dynamic programming, the policy is learned by solving a Bellman equation, which expresses the expected return as a function of the current state and the current policy. This approach has been successfully applied to a variety of tasks, including robotic manipulation and bipedal walking.

##### 5.3b.4 Model-Free A*

Model-free A* is a variant of the A* algorithm that is used for model-free policy search. It shares many of the properties of A*, including optimality and completeness, but does not require a model of the environment. Instead, it learns the model implicitly by interacting with the environment and learning from its experiences.

Model-free A* has been successfully applied to a variety of tasks, including robotic navigation and bipedal walking. It is particularly useful for tasks that involve complex and uncertain environments, where a detailed model may not be available or accurate.

##### 5.3b.5 Lifelong Planning A*

Lifelong Planning A* (LPA*) is another variant of the A* algorithm that is used for model-free policy search. It shares many of the properties of A*, including optimality and completeness, but is designed to handle dynamic environments where the model may change over time.

LPA* learns the model implicitly by interacting with the environment and learning from its experiences. It then uses this learned model to plan a path to the goal, taking into account the uncertainty in the model. This approach has been successfully applied to a variety of tasks, including robotic navigation and bipedal walking.

##### 5.3b.6 Implicit Data Structure

The implicit data structure is a technique for representing the model in model-free policy search. It is particularly useful for tasks that involve complex and uncertain environments, where a detailed model may not be available or accurate.

The implicit data structure learns the model implicitly by interacting with the environment and learning from its experiences.

#### 5.4b Techniques for Real World Applications

In the context of real-world applications, model-free policy search can be implemented using a variety of techniques. These techniques can be broadly categorized into two types: direct policy search and indirect policy search.

##### Direct Policy Search

Direct policy search involves learning the optimal policy directly from experience. This is typically done using a trial-and-error approach, where the policy is iteratively updated based on the results of each trial. The policy is updated using a learning rule that minimizes the difference between the desired and actual policy.

One popular technique for direct policy search is the Gauss-Seidel method. This method involves updating the policy in a sequential manner, with each update depending on the previous update. This allows for efficient learning, as the policy is updated based on the results of each trial.

##### Indirect Policy Search

Indirect policy search involves learning the optimal policy indirectly, by optimizing a surrogate function that approximates the true policy. This is typically done using a gradient-based approach, where the surrogate function is updated in the direction of steepest descent.

One popular technique for indirect policy search is the Remez algorithm. This algorithm involves iteratively updating the surrogate function based on the results of each trial. The update is performed in the direction of steepest descent, with the step size being adjusted based on the results of each trial.

##### Hybrid Approaches

In practice, a combination of direct and indirect policy search techniques is often used. This allows for the benefits of both approaches to be leveraged. For example, the Gauss-Seidel method can be used for direct policy search, with the Remez algorithm being used for indirect policy search.

##### Real-World Applications

The techniques discussed above have been successfully applied to a variety of real-world applications. These include factory automation infrastructure, autonomous vehicles, and humanoid robots. The use of model-free policy search in these applications demonstrates its effectiveness in addressing complex control problems.

In the context of factory automation infrastructure, model-free policy search can be used to optimize the control of robotic arms and other machinery. This involves learning the optimal policy for performing a variety of tasks, such as picking up objects, placing them in a specific location, or assembling them.

In the context of autonomous vehicles, model-free policy search can be used to navigate through an unknown environment to reach a specific goal. This involves learning the optimal policy for tasks such as obstacle avoidance, lane keeping, and traffic signal detection.

In the context of humanoid robots, model-free policy search can be used to learn the optimal policy for performing a variety of tasks, such as grasping objects, walking, and interacting with humans. This involves learning the optimal policy for tasks such as object manipulation, locomotion, and social interaction.

#### 5.4c Challenges and Future Directions

Despite the success of model-free policy search in real-world applications, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed in order to further improve its performance. These challenges include the need for more efficient learning algorithms, the need for more robust and adaptable policies, and the need for more accurate and reliable performance evaluation.

##### Efficient Learning Algorithms

While the Gauss-Seidel method and the Remez algorithm have proven to be effective for direct and indirect policy search, respectively, they still suffer from the limitations of gradient-based methods. These methods can be slow to converge, especially when the policy space is high-dimensional or the objective function is non-convex. Therefore, there is a need for more efficient learning algorithms that can handle these challenges.

One promising direction is to incorporate machine learning techniques into the learning process. For example, deep reinforcement learning has shown promising results in learning complex policies from high-dimensional and non-convex objective functions. By incorporating these techniques into model-free policy search, we can potentially improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the learning process.

##### Robust and Adaptable Policies

Another challenge is to develop policies that are robust and adaptable to changes in the environment. In many real-world applications, the environment can be dynamic and unpredictable, making it difficult for the policy to perform optimally. Therefore, there is a need for policies that can adapt to these changes and maintain their performance.

One approach to address this challenge is to incorporate model-based reinforcement learning into model-free policy search. By combining these two approaches, we can potentially develop policies that can learn from both the environment and a model of the environment, allowing them to adapt to changes in the environment.

##### Accurate and Reliable Performance Evaluation

Finally, there is a need for more accurate and reliable performance evaluation. In many real-world applications, the performance of the policy is often evaluated based on a set of predefined metrics. However, these metrics may not always capture the true performance of the policy, especially when the policy is complex and the environment is dynamic.

One solution to this challenge is to incorporate human-in-the-loop evaluation into the performance evaluation process. By involving human evaluators in the evaluation process, we can potentially obtain more accurate and reliable performance evaluations. Furthermore, by incorporating feedback from the human evaluators into the learning process, we can potentially improve the performance of the policy.

In conclusion, while model-free policy search has shown great potential in real-world applications, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed in order to further improve its performance. By addressing these challenges and incorporating new techniques and approaches, we can potentially unlock the full potential of model-free policy search in real-world applications.

### Introduction

In the realm of robotics, the concept of underactuation is a critical one. It refers to the situation where a robot has fewer actuators (devices that cause motion) than the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) it has. This chapter, "Underactuated Robotics," delves into the intricacies of this concept, exploring its implications and the unique challenges it presents.

Underactuation is a common occurrence in robotics, particularly in the design of robots for complex environments. It is often a necessary compromise to keep the robot's size and weight manageable, while still allowing it to perform a wide range of tasks. However, underactuation also introduces a level of complexity in the control of the robot, as the number of control inputs is less than the number of independent variables that affect the robot's motion.

This chapter will explore the mathematical models that describe underactuated robots, including the equations of motion and the control laws. We will also discuss the various control strategies that can be used to manage underactuation, such as feedback linearization and sliding mode control. These strategies aim to overcome the limitations imposed by underactuation, enabling the robot to perform tasks that would otherwise be impossible.

#### 5.4a Introduction to Actor-Critic Methods

Actor-critic methods are a class of model-free policy search algorithms that combine elements of both stochastic control and reinforcement learning. These methods are particularly useful in underactuated robotics, where the control of the system is often complex and uncertain.

The basic idea behind actor-critic methods is to learn a control policy (the "actor") and a value function (the "critic") simultaneously. The actor learns to take actions that maximize the value function, while the critic learns to estimate the value of the current state. This process is repeated iteratively, with the actor and critic learning from each other in an interactive manner.

Actor-critic methods have been successfully applied to a wide range of problems in underactuated robotics, including robotic manipulation, bipedal walking, and robotic navigation. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the theory and applications of these methods.

#### 5.4b Actor-Critic Algorithms

Actor-critic algorithms are a type of stochastic control algorithm that combines elements of both stochastic control and reinforcement learning. They are particularly useful in underactuated robotics, where the control of the system is often complex and uncertain.

The basic idea behind actor-critic algorithms is to learn a control policy (the "actor") and a value function (the "critic") simultaneously. The actor learns to take actions that maximize the value function, while the critic learns to estimate the value of the current state. This process is repeated iteratively, with the actor and critic learning from each other in an interactive manner.

The actor-critic algorithm can be formulated as follows:

1. Initialize the actor and critic with random parameters.

2. Repeat until convergence:

    a. The actor takes an action $a$ in the current state $s$.

    b. The critic estimates the value of the current state $V(s)$ based on the action $a$.

    c. The actor updates its parameters to maximize the value function $V(s)$.

    d. The critic updates its parameters to minimize the difference between the estimated value and the true value.

This process is repeated iteratively, with the actor and critic learning from each other in an interactive manner. The actor learns to take actions that maximize the value function, while the critic learns to estimate the value of the current state. This process is repeated until the algorithm converges, i.e., until the actor and critic parameters no longer change significantly.

Actor-critic algorithms have been successfully applied to a wide range of problems in underactuated robotics, including robotic manipulation, bipedal walking, and robotic navigation. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the theory and applications of these methods.

#### 5.4c Applications in Robotics

Actor-critic methods have been widely applied in the field of robotics, particularly in the area of underactuated robotics. Underactuated robots are those that have fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) they have. This makes the control of these robots challenging, as the control inputs do not have a one-to-one correspondence with the DOFs. Actor-critic methods provide a powerful tool for learning control policies in these complex systems.

One of the key applications of actor-critic methods in robotics is in the control of bipedal robots. Bipedal robots have two legs and are designed to walk like humans. These robots are underactuated, as they typically have only three actuators (one for each hip and one for the knee) but have six DOFs (three for each leg). This makes the control of these robots particularly challenging.

Actor-critic methods can be used to learn control policies for bipedal robots that allow them to walk stably and efficiently. The actor learns to take actions that maximize the value function, while the critic learns to estimate the value of the current state. This process is repeated iteratively, with the actor and critic learning from each other in an interactive manner.

Another important application of actor-critic methods in robotics is in the control of robotic manipulators. Robotic manipulators are robots with multiple joints that are used to perform tasks such as grasping and placing objects. These robots are underactuated, as they typically have fewer actuators than the number of joints they have.

Actor-critic methods can be used to learn control policies for robotic manipulators that allow them to perform tasks such as grasping and placing objects. The actor learns to take actions that maximize the value function, while the critic learns to estimate the value of the current state. This process is repeated iteratively, with the actor and critic learning from each other in an interactive manner.

In conclusion, actor-critic methods provide a powerful tool for learning control policies in underactuated robotics. They have been successfully applied in a wide range of applications, including bipedal walking and robotic manipulation. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the theory and applications of these methods.

#### 5.4d Challenges and Future Directions

While actor-critic methods have shown great promise in the field of underactuated robotics, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed in order to fully realize their potential. One of the main challenges is the issue of convergence. The actor-critic algorithm relies on the actor and critic learning from each other in an interactive manner. However, in practice, this learning process can be slow and unstable, leading to difficulties in achieving convergence.

Another challenge is the issue of exploration. The actor-critic algorithm requires the actor to explore the state space in order to learn a control policy that maximizes the value function. However, this exploration can be time-consuming and may not always lead to the most efficient control policies.

In addition, there are still many open questions regarding the theoretical foundations of actor-critic methods. For example, it is still not fully understood how the actor and critic learn from each other, and how this learning process can be optimized.

Despite these challenges, there are several promising directions for future research. One direction is to incorporate more sophisticated learning algorithms into the actor-critic framework. For example, deep reinforcement learning, which uses neural networks to learn control policies, has shown great potential in various domains and could be applied to underactuated robotics.

Another direction is to explore the use of actor-critic methods in other areas of robotics. For example, actor-critic methods could be applied to the control of multi-legged robots, which are another type of underactuated robot.

Finally, there is a need for more empirical studies to validate the effectiveness of actor-critic methods in underactuated robotics. These studies could involve testing the performance of actor-critic methods on a variety of underactuated robots and comparing their results with other control methods.

In conclusion, while there are still many challenges to overcome, actor-critic methods offer a promising approach to learning control policies in underactuated robotics. With further research and development, these methods could play a crucial role in advancing the field of underactuated robotics.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the realm of model-free policy search, a critical aspect of underactuated robotics. We have explored the theoretical underpinnings of this approach, its applications, and the challenges it presents. The chapter has provided a comprehensive understanding of how model-free policy search can be used to control underactuated robots, offering a viable alternative to traditional model-based control methods.

We have seen how model-free policy search can be used to learn control policies directly from experience, without the need for a detailed model of the system. This approach is particularly useful in situations where the system dynamics are complex and difficult to model accurately. However, it also presents challenges in terms of sample efficiency and robustness to noise.

In conclusion, model-free policy search offers a powerful tool for controlling underactuated robots. While it presents challenges, these can be addressed through careful design and the use of advanced learning algorithms. As we continue to advance in the field of underactuated robotics, model-free policy search will undoubtedly play a crucial role in enabling the development of more sophisticated and efficient control systems.

## Chapter: Chapter 6: Model-Based Policy Search

### Introduction

In the realm of robotics, the ability to make decisions and act autonomously is a crucial aspect. This chapter, "Model-Based Policy Search," delves into the theory and applications of this critical area. The chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how model-based policy search can be used to control underactuated robots.

Model-based policy search is a method that combines the principles of model-based control and policy search. It is a powerful tool that allows robots to learn and adapt to their environment, making it an essential aspect of underactuated robotics. Underactuated robots, unlike fully actuated robots, have fewer actuators than the number of degrees of freedom they have. This makes their control more complex and challenging.

The chapter will explore the theoretical foundations of model-based policy search, including the mathematical models and algorithms that underpin this approach. It will also delve into the practical applications of this method, demonstrating how it can be used to control underactuated robots in a variety of scenarios.

The chapter will also discuss the challenges and limitations of model-based policy search, providing insights into how these can be addressed. It will also touch upon the future prospects of this method, highlighting its potential for further advancements in the field of underactuated robotics.

Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field of robotics, this chapter will provide you with a solid foundation in model-based policy search. It will equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to apply this method to control underactuated robots, opening up a world of possibilities for your research and practice.




#### 5.4b Techniques for Actor-Critic Methods

Actor-critic methods are a powerful tool for learning control policies in underactuated robotics. However, their effectiveness can be further enhanced by incorporating various techniques. In this section, we will discuss some of these techniques and how they can be applied to actor-critic methods.

##### 5.4b.1 Policy Gradient Descent

Policy gradient descent is a variant of stochastic gradient descent where the gradient of the policy is used to update the parameters. This technique is particularly useful in actor-critic methods as it allows for the direct optimization of the policy. The policy gradient can be calculated using the REINFORCE algorithm, which is based on the principle of policy evaluation.

The policy gradient descent update rule can be written as:

$$
\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t + \alpha \nabla_{\theta} \log \pi(\mathbf{a}_t | \mathbf{s}_t) Q(\mathbf{s}_t, \mathbf{a}_t)
$$

where $\theta$ are the parameters of the actor, $\pi(\mathbf{a}_t | \mathbf{s}_t)$ is the policy, $Q(\mathbf{s}_t, \mathbf{a}_t)$ is the Q-value, and $\alpha$ is the learning rate.

##### 5.4b.2 Actor-Critic Variants

There are several variants of actor-critic methods, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of these include:

- **Deterministic Policy Gradient (DPG)**: DPG is a variant of actor-critic methods that uses a deterministic policy for the actor. This eliminates the need for policy smoothing and can lead to faster convergence.

- **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)**: DDPG is a variant of DPG that uses a deep neural network for the actor and critic. This allows for the learning of complex policies and value functions.

- **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)**: SAC is a variant of actor-critic methods that uses a soft Q-value for the critic. This allows for the learning of a smooth and continuous policy.

##### 5.4b.3 Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)

Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) is a variant of actor-critic methods that uses a trust region to constrain the policy update. This helps to prevent the policy from diverging and can lead to more stable learning.

The TRPO update rule can be written as:

$$
\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t + \alpha \min\left(\frac{\lambda}{L}, 1\right) \nabla_{\theta} \log \pi(\mathbf{a}_t | \mathbf{s}_t) Q(\mathbf{s}_t, \mathbf{a}_t)
$$

where $\lambda$ is the trust region parameter and $L$ is the Lipschitz constant of the policy.

##### 5.4b.4 Actor-Critic with Experience Replay

Actor-critic methods can be combined with experience replay, a technique used in reinforcement learning to store and reuse past experiences. This can help to improve the learning efficiency and stability of the actor-critic methods.

The experience replay buffer can be updated as follows:

$$
\mathcal{D}_{t+1} = \mathcal{D}_t \cup \{(\mathbf{s}_t, \mathbf{a}_t, r_t, \mathbf{s}_{t+1})\}
$$

where $\mathcal{D}_t$ is the experience replay buffer at time $t$, and $r_t$ is the reward received at time $t$.

##### 5.4b.5 Actor-Critic with Gaussian Processes

Actor-critic methods can also be combined with Gaussian processes, a non-parametric Bayesian approach to regression and interpolation. This can help to provide a more flexible and robust representation of the value function and policy.

The Gaussian process for the critic can be defined as:

$$
f(\mathbf{s}_t) \sim \mathcal{GP}\left(0, k(\mathbf{s}_t, \mathbf{s}_t')\right)
$$

where $k(\mathbf{s}_t, \mathbf{s}_t')$ is the kernel function.

##### 5.4b.6 Actor-Critic with Deep Reinforcement Learning

Finally, actor-critic methods can be combined with deep reinforcement learning, a technique that uses deep neural networks for learning the policy and value function. This can help to handle complex and high-dimensional state and action spaces.

The deep reinforcement learning update rule can be written as:

$$
\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t + \alpha \nabla_{\theta} \log \pi(\mathbf{a}_t | \mathbf{s}_t) Q(\mathbf{s}_t, \mathbf{a}_t)
$$

where $\theta$ are the parameters of the deep neural network, and $Q(\mathbf{s}_t, \mathbf{a}_t)$ is the Q-value predicted by the deep neural network.

In conclusion, actor-critic methods are a powerful tool for learning control policies in underactuated robotics. By incorporating various techniques such as policy gradient descent, actor-critic variants, trust region policy optimization, actor-critic with experience replay, actor-critic with Gaussian processes, and actor-critic with deep reinforcement learning, the effectiveness of these methods can be further enhanced.

In this section, we will explore some case studies that demonstrate the application of actor-critic methods in underactuated robotics. These case studies will provide a practical understanding of how these methods are used in real-world scenarios.

##### 5.4c.1 Robotic Manipulation

One of the most common applications of actor-critic methods in underactuated robotics is in robotic manipulation. This involves the control of a robotic arm to perform tasks such as picking up objects, placing them in a specific location, or manipulating them in a certain way.

In this case study, we will use the DDPG variant of actor-critic methods to control a robotic arm. The actor will be a deep neural network that learns the policy for the robotic arm, while the critic will be another deep neural network that learns the Q-value. The policy gradient descent technique will be used to update the parameters of the actor.

The environment will be simulated using the OpenAI Gym library, which provides a variety of environments for testing reinforcement learning algorithms. The robotic arm will be controlled using the PyBullet physics engine, which allows for realistic and accurate simulations.

##### 5.4c.2 Bipedal Walking

Another important application of actor-critic methods in underactuated robotics is in bipedal walking. This involves the control of a bipedal robot to walk in a natural and human-like manner.

In this case study, we will use the SAC variant of actor-critic methods to control a bipedal robot. The actor will be a deep neural network that learns the policy for the bipedal robot, while the critic will be a Gaussian process that learns the Q-value. The policy gradient descent technique will be used to update the parameters of the actor.

The environment will be simulated using the OpenAI Gym library, and the bipedal robot will be controlled using the MuJoCo physics engine. This allows for more realistic and accurate simulations compared to the PyBullet engine used in the previous case study.

##### 5.4c.3 Underactuated Robotics in Real-World Scenarios

In addition to these case studies, actor-critic methods have been successfully applied in various real-world scenarios. For example, they have been used in the control of underactuated robots in factory automation infrastructure, where the robots need to perform complex tasks with limited actuation.

They have also been used in the control of underactuated robots in space exploration, where the robots need to navigate through complex environments with limited actuation.

In these scenarios, the actor-critic methods have shown great potential in learning control policies that can handle the challenges posed by underactuation. However, further research is needed to improve the performance of these methods and make them more robust and efficient.
