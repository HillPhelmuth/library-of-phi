### Subsection 1.1a: Overview of Dynamic Optimization

Dynamic optimization is a powerful tool that allows us to find the optimal solution to a problem that evolves over time. It is a mathematical framework that combines the principles of optimization and differential equations to solve complex problems in various fields. In this section, we will provide an overview of dynamic optimization, including its theory, methods, and applications.

#### 1.1a.1 Theory of Dynamic Optimization

The theory of dynamic optimization is based on the concept of optimality conditions, which are necessary conditions for a solution to be optimal. These conditions are derived from the principle of optimality, which states that an optimal solution must be optimal at every time step. In other words, the optimal solution must be the best possible solution at each point in time, taking into account the past decisions and future constraints.

The theory of dynamic optimization also involves the use of differential dynamic programming (DDP), a method for solving optimal control problems. DDP proceeds by iteratively performing a backward pass on the nominal trajectory to generate a new control sequence, and then a forward-pass to compute and evaluate a new nominal trajectory. This method is particularly useful for problems with a high-dimensional state space, as it allows for the efficient computation of the optimal control sequence.

#### 1.1a.2 Methods for Solving Dynamic Optimization Problems

There are various methods for solving dynamic optimization problems, each with its own advantages and limitations. Some of the commonly used methods include the Gauss-Seidel method, the Newton-Raphson method, and the finite difference method. These methods are used to solve the differential equations that represent the problem, and they can be used in conjunction with the theory of dynamic optimization to find the optimal solution.

#### 1.1a.3 Applications of Dynamic Optimization

Dynamic optimization has a wide range of applications in various fields, including economics, engineering, and finance. In economics, it is used to determine the optimal path for a firm's production over time, taking into account changing market conditions and resource availability. In engineering, it is used to design control systems that can adapt to changing environments and achieve desired performance.

### Subsection 1.1b: Importance and Applications of Dynamic Optimization

Dynamic optimization is a powerful tool that has numerous applications in various fields. It allows us to find the optimal solution to a problem that evolves over time, taking into account the past decisions and future constraints. This makes it particularly useful for problems that involve decision-making over time, such as resource allocation, production planning, and control systems.

One of the key advantages of dynamic optimization is its ability to handle complex problems with a high-dimensional state space. This is achieved through the use of methods such as differential dynamic programming (DDP), which allows for the efficient computation of the optimal control sequence. This makes it a valuable tool for solving real-world problems that involve a large number of decision variables.

Moreover, dynamic optimization also allows for the consideration of constraints and objectives that evolve over time. This is particularly important in many real-world problems, where the objectives and constraints may change due to external factors or changes in the system. By incorporating these changes into the optimization problem, dynamic optimization can provide solutions that are robust and adaptable to changing conditions.

In addition to its applications in decision-making, dynamic optimization also has important implications in the field of control systems. By formulating the control problem as a dynamic optimization problem, we can find the optimal control sequence that minimizes a cost function while satisfying system constraints. This can lead to more efficient and effective control of systems, such as robots, vehicles, and industrial processes.

In conclusion, dynamic optimization is a powerful tool with numerous applications in various fields. Its ability to handle complex problems, consider changing objectives and constraints, and provide robust and adaptable solutions makes it an essential tool for decision-making and control systems.

### Subsection 1.2a: Discrete Time: Deterministic Models

In this section, we will explore the concept of discrete time deterministic models in dynamic optimization. These models are used to represent systems that evolve over time in a deterministic manner, where the future state of the system can be predicted with certainty based on its current state and control inputs.

#### Introduction to Discrete Time: Deterministic Models

Discrete time deterministic models are used to represent systems that evolve over time in a discrete manner. This means that the state of the system is updated at specific time points, and the future state of the system can be predicted based on its current state and control inputs. These models are often used in decision-making problems, where the goal is to find the optimal control sequence that minimizes a cost function while satisfying system constraints.

The state of a discrete time deterministic model can be represented as a vector $\mathbf{x}_k$, where $k$ is the time index. The evolution of the state is governed by a system model, which takes the current state and control inputs as inputs and produces the next state as an output. This can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = f(\mathbf{x}_k, \mathbf{u}_k)
$$

where $f$ is the system model, $\mathbf{x}_k$ is the current state, and $\mathbf{u}_k$ is the control input at time $k$.

#### Applications of Discrete Time: Deterministic Models

Discrete time deterministic models have a wide range of applications in various fields. One of the most common applications is in control systems, where the goal is to find the optimal control sequence that minimizes a cost function while satisfying system constraints. These models are also used in decision-making problems, where the goal is to find the optimal control sequence that maximizes a reward function.

Another important application of discrete time deterministic models is in the field of robotics. These models are used to represent the dynamics of a robot and to find the optimal control sequence that allows the robot to perform a desired task. This is particularly useful in tasks that involve complex and dynamic environments, where the robot needs to make decisions in real-time.
