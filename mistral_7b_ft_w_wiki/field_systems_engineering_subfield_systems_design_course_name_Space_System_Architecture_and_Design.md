# Nanosat 01

## Body

The satellite has a prismatic body divided in two hemispheres, each with its own hexagonal base and six trapezoidal sides with an overall structure roughly shaped like a sphere. From base to base the satellite measures 600 mm with a maximum radius of 540 mm. Almost all of its surface is covered with GaAs/Ge solar panels in order to power the different systems (17 W by average, 20 W at most) which were glued to aluminum panels anchored to the structure. In addition it also carried Lithium-ion batteries capable of providing 4.8 Ah of energy operations without direct sunlight.

The inside of the Nanosat 01 was accessible by separating both "hemispheres" joined by means of a central hexagon bus connecting all the subsystems. These include: the OBDH (On-Board Data Handling) which provided all spacecraft control, processing power and interfacing (based on a DragonBall MC68332 microcontroller of 4 MB of storage capacity, 8 kB PROM, 512 kB EEPROM, 768 kB of protected RAM), the PDU (Power Distribution Unit), RF communications, the ACS (Attitude Control Subsystem) which employed solar cells and a magnetometer to determine attitude and provide spin stability.

To keep the dead weight to a minimum, INTA, in cooperation with ESA, developed an experimental replacement for traditional wiring using optical infrared arrays, known as OWLS, to exchange data between the different modules. The final weight of the satellite ended up being about 19 kg with a projected service life of 3 years. However most of its subsystems remained operational for 4 years.

### RF communications

The RF communications subsystem employed 4 omnidirectional antennas allocated on the top face. Two digital modems were implemented for experimentation purposes; one using a single DSP chip, the other based on an ASIC design. Communications with the outside were store and forward using UHF band (387.1 MHz downlink, 400 MHz uplink with GMSK modulation and Viterbi encoding). Ground access was provided by a 1200 bps modem and a 4800 bps modem.

### Section: 2.1 Applied Utility Theory:

In the previous chapter, we discussed the concept of MATE and its role in tradespace exploration. In this section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical foundations of MATE, specifically focusing on the concept of Applied Utility Theory.

#### 2.1a Basics of Applied Utility Theory

Applied Utility Theory is a mathematical framework used to model and evaluate decisions made by individuals or organizations. It is based on the principles of utility theory, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with the measurement of preferences. In the context of MATE, Applied Utility Theory is used to model and evaluate the preferences of decision-makers when faced with multiple design options or alternatives.

The basic premise of Applied Utility Theory is that individuals or organizations have preferences over different outcomes or alternatives. These preferences can be represented by a utility function, which assigns a numerical value to each alternative based on the decision-maker's preferences. The utility function is typically defined over a set of attributes or criteria, and the alternatives are evaluated based on how well they satisfy these attributes.

One of the key concepts in Applied Utility Theory is the idea of lexicographic preferences. This concept was first introduced by José Encarnación Jr. and has been found useful in describing choices under uncertainty. Lexicographic preferences allow decision-makers to prioritize different attributes or criteria when making decisions. For example, in the context of space systems, a decision-maker may prioritize the attribute of cost over the attribute of performance. This means that the decision-maker will always choose an alternative that has a lower cost, even if it has a lower performance.

To formally define lexicographic preferences, we use the concept of a criterion function. Let "w<sub>i</sub>" = "w<sub>i</sub>"("x", "p"("x")) be the "i"th utility from a vector of prospects "x" = ("x"<sub>1</sub>,…, "x<sub>k</sub>",…) which has associated probabilities "p"("x") = ("p"<sub>1</sub>("x<sub>1</sub>"),…,"p<sub>k</sub>"("x<sub>n</sub>")). Note that the criterion function "w<sub>i</sub>" depends explicitly not only on "x" but also on the probabilities associated with "x". One may then define "w<sub>¡</sub>"* as the satisficing level of "w<sub>¡</sub>" and proceed to define lexicographic preference in the customary manner, with "v"("x") = ["v"<sub>1</sub>("x"),"v"<sub>2</sub>(x),…] and "v"<sub>i</sub>("x") = min ("w<sub>i</sub>" ("x", "p"(x), "w<sub>i</sub>"*) for all "i". It is straightforward to reproduce expected utility as a particular case by defining some primitive utility function "u"(.) that depends only on the individual "x<sub>k</sub>". In this case, one may write "w"<sub>1</sub>("x", "p"("x")•"u"("x")), where "u"("x") = ["u"("x"<sub>1</sub>), "u"("x"<sub>2</sub>),…] and set "w"<sub>1</sub>* sufficiently high to obtain the usual subjective expected utility. If other criteria are allowed to come into play, on the other hand, different possibilities arise. For example, for some "i", "w<sub>i</sub>" may depend only on the probability of ruinous levels of "x", or on the maximal values of "x".

In the context of MATE, Applied Utility Theory is used to model and evaluate the preferences of decision-makers when faced with multiple design options or alternatives. By using utility functions and lexicographic preferences, decision-makers can prioritize different attributes or criteria and make informed decisions. This allows for a more systematic and efficient exploration of the tradespace, leading to better design decisions.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of Pareto optimality and its role in tradespace exploration.

Lexicographic preferences have also been found useful in describing choices under uncertainty. Let "w<sub>i</sub>" = "w<sub>i</sub>"("x", "p"("x")) be the "i"th utility from a vector of prospects "x" = ("x"<sub>1</sub>,…, "x<sub>k</sub>",…) which has associated probabilities "p"("x") = ("p"<sub>1</sub>("x<sub>1</sub>"),…,"p<sub>k</sub>"("x<sub>n</sub>")). Note that the criterion function "w<sub>i</sub>" depends explicitly not only on "x" but also on the probabilities associated with "x". One may then define "w<sub>¡</sub>"* as the satisficing level of "w<sub>¡</sub>" and proceed to define lexicographic preference in the customary manner, with "v"("x") = ["v"<sub>1</sub>("x"),"v"<sub>2</sub>(x),…] and "v"<sub>i</sub>("x") = min ("w<sub>i</sub>" ("x", "p"(x), "w<sub>i</sub>"*) for all "i".

If other criteria are allowed to come into play, on the other hand, different possibilities arise. For example, for some "i", "w<sub>i</sub>" may depend only on the probability of ruinous levels of "x", or on the maximal values of "x".
Encarnación [1987] uses preferences of this form in an ambitious attempt to reconstruct and explain all the apparent “paradoxes” in choice theory. Apart from lexicographic comparisons the new element introduced into the structure was the notion of significant differences in the values of criterion functions. Choice between two uncertain alternatives is then determined by the criterion function that is most significant to the decision maker. This concept of significance can be used to explain many of the paradoxes in choice theory, such as the Allais paradox and the Ellsberg paradox.

#### 2.1b Utility Theory in Tradespace Exploration

In the context of tradespace exploration, Utility Theory plays a crucial role in decision-making. As mentioned earlier, tradespace exploration involves evaluating and comparing different design options or alternatives. This is where Utility Theory comes into play, as it provides a mathematical framework for modeling and evaluating these alternatives.

One of the key concepts in Utility Theory is the idea of Pareto efficiency. This concept states that an allocation of resources is Pareto efficient if it is impossible to make any one individual better off without making at least one individual worse off. In the context of tradespace exploration, this means that a design option is Pareto efficient if it cannot be improved without sacrificing the performance of another design option.

Another important concept in Utility Theory is the idea of Pareto optimality. This concept states that an allocation of resources is Pareto optimal if it is not Pareto dominated by any other allocation. In other words, a design option is Pareto optimal if it cannot be improved without sacrificing the performance of another design option.

Utility Theory also plays a crucial role in decision-making under uncertainty. In tradespace exploration, there is often uncertainty surrounding the performance of different design options. This is where the concept of Expected Utility comes into play. Expected Utility is a measure of the overall utility of a decision, taking into account the probabilities of different outcomes. This allows decision-makers to make informed decisions in the face of uncertainty.

In conclusion, Utility Theory is a powerful tool in tradespace exploration, providing a mathematical framework for modeling and evaluating different design options. Its concepts of Pareto efficiency and Pareto optimality are crucial in decision-making, while its ability to handle uncertainty makes it a valuable tool in the face of uncertainty. 





### Subsection: 2.1c Practical Examples of Applied Utility Theory

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of Applied Utility Theory and its applications in decision-making. In this section, we will delve deeper into the practical examples of Applied Utility Theory, specifically focusing on the Merton's portfolio problem and its extensions.

#### Merton's Portfolio Problem and Its Extensions

Merton's portfolio problem is a classic example of a decision-making problem where Applied Utility Theory is applied. The problem involves an investor who wants to maximize their expected utility of wealth by choosing a portfolio of assets. The investor's utility function is typically assumed to be of the power utility form, where the utility of wealth is proportional to the inverse of the wealth.

Many variations of the problem have been explored, but most do not lead to a simple closed-form solution. However, some extensions of the problem have been studied, such as the case where the investor has endowments. Tao and Cole study the existence of PE and EF random allocations when the utilities are non-linear (can have complements). Yilmaz studies the random assignment problem where agents have endowments.

#### Market Equilibrium Computation and Online Computation

Another practical example of Applied Utility Theory is in the computation of market equilibrium. Recently, Gao, Peysakhovich and Kroer presented an algorithm for online computation of market equilibrium. This algorithm is based on the concept of lexicographic preferences, where the preferences of agents are defined in terms of their utility functions.

Lexicographic preferences have also been found useful in describing choices under uncertainty. Let "w<sub>i</sub>" = "w<sub>i</sub>"("x", "p"("x")) be the "i"th utility from a vector of prospects "x" = ("x"<sub>1</sub>,…, "x<sub>k</sub>",…) which has associated probabilities "p"("x") = ("p"<sub>1</sub>("x<sub>1</sub>"),…,"p<sub>k</sub>"("x<sub>n</sub>")). Note that the criterion function "w<sub>i</sub>" depends explicitly not only on "x" but also on the probabilities associated with "x". One may then define "w<sub>¡</sub>"* as the satisficing level of "w<sub>¡</sub>" and proceed to define lexicographic preference in the customary manner, with "v"("x") = ["v"<sub>1</sub>("x"),"v"<sub>2</sub>(x),…] and "v"<sub>i</sub>("x") = min ("w<sub>i</sub>" ("x", "p"(x), "w<sub>i</sub>"*) for all "i". It is straightforward to reproduce expected utility as a particular case by defining some primitive utility function "u"(.) that depends only on the individual "x<sub>k</sub>". In this case, one may write "w"<sub>1</sub>("x", "p"("x")•"u"("x")), where "u"("x") = ["u"("x"<sub>1</sub>), "u"("x"<sub>2</sub>),…] and set "w"<sub>1</sub>* sufficiently high to obtain the usual subjective expected utility. If other criteria are allowed to come into play, on the other hand, different possibilities arise. For example, for some "i", "w<sub>i</sub>" may depend only on the probability of ruinous levels of "x", or on the maximal values of "x".

#### Conclusion

In this section, we have explored some practical examples of Applied Utility Theory, specifically focusing on the Merton's portfolio problem and its extensions, as well as the computation of market equilibrium and online computation. These examples demonstrate the versatility and applicability of Applied Utility Theory in various decision-making scenarios. 


## Chapter 2: MATE: Tradespace Exploration:




### Subsection: 2.2a Introduction to Tradespace Modeling

Tradespace modeling is a crucial aspect of decision-making in the field of space systems. It involves the exploration of a tradespace, which is a multidimensional space that represents all possible design alternatives for a given system. This approach allows decision-makers to evaluate and compare different design alternatives based on their attributes, such as cost, performance, and risk.

The concept of tradespace modeling is closely related to the concept of Pareto optimality, which is a fundamental concept in economics and decision-making. A Pareto optimal solution is a design alternative that cannot be improved in one attribute without sacrificing another attribute. In tradespace modeling, Pareto optimal solutions are often referred to as "efficient" solutions.

Tradespace modeling is a powerful tool for decision-making because it allows decision-makers to explore the entire tradespace and identify Pareto optimal solutions. This approach is particularly useful in complex decision-making problems, where there are many design alternatives and attributes to consider.

#### The Role of Utility Theory in Tradespace Modeling

Utility theory plays a crucial role in tradespace modeling. It provides a mathematical framework for representing and evaluating preferences. In tradespace modeling, decision-makers often use utility functions to represent their preferences over different design alternatives.

For example, consider a decision-maker who wants to maximize the expected utility of a space system. The decision-maker's utility function might be of the power utility form, where the utility of a design alternative is proportional to the inverse of its cost. This utility function can be used to evaluate and compare different design alternatives in the tradespace.

#### Challenges and Future Directions

Despite its many advantages, tradespace modeling also faces several challenges. One of the main challenges is the computational complexity of exploring the entire tradespace. As the number of design alternatives and attributes increases, the tradespace becomes larger and more complex, making it difficult to explore and evaluate all possible solutions.

Another challenge is the lack of standardization in tradespace modeling. Different decision-makers may use different utility functions and preferences, making it difficult to compare and combine their results. This lack of standardization also makes it difficult to automate tradespace exploration, as different decision-makers may have different preferences and requirements.

In the future, advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning may help address these challenges. These technologies could be used to automate tradespace exploration and decision-making, making it more efficient and effective. They could also help standardize tradespace modeling by learning from past decisions and preferences.

In conclusion, tradespace modeling is a powerful tool for decision-making in the field of space systems. It allows decision-makers to explore the entire tradespace and identify Pareto optimal solutions. However, it also faces challenges that need to be addressed in order to fully realize its potential.





### Subsection: 2.2b Techniques for Tradespace Exploration

Tradespace exploration is a critical aspect of decision-making in the field of space systems. It involves the evaluation and comparison of different design alternatives based on their attributes, such as cost, performance, and risk. This section will discuss some of the techniques used for tradespace exploration.

#### Multi-Attribute Utility Theory

Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) is a decision-making technique that is often used in tradespace exploration. It provides a systematic approach to evaluating and comparing alternatives based on multiple attributes. The decision-maker specifies a utility function for each attribute, and the overall utility of an alternative is calculated as the weighted sum of the utilities for each attribute.

For example, consider a decision-maker who wants to maximize the expected utility of a space system. The decision-maker might use a utility function of the form:

$$
U(x) = w_1U_1(x) + w_2U_2(x) + \cdots + w_nU_n(x)
$$

where $U(x)$ is the overall utility of the alternative, $U_i(x)$ is the utility of the alternative for attribute $i$, $w_i$ is the weight of attribute $i$, and the weights sum to 1.

#### Analytic Hierarchy Process

The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is another decision-making technique that is often used in tradespace exploration. It provides a structured approach to decision-making, where the decision-maker breaks down a complex decision into a hierarchy of simpler decisions.

For example, consider a decision-maker who wants to select a space system. The decision-maker might break down the decision into a hierarchy of decisions, such as selecting the type of space system, selecting the components of the space system, and selecting the suppliers of the components. Each level of the hierarchy is represented by a pairwise comparison matrix, which is used to determine the relative importance of the alternatives at that level.

#### Decision Matrix

A decision matrix is a simple but powerful tool for tradespace exploration. It is a table that lists the alternatives and attributes, and assigns a score to each alternative for each attribute. The scores are then used to calculate a weighted score for each alternative, which can be used to rank the alternatives.

For example, consider a decision-maker who wants to select a space system. The decision-maker might create a decision matrix with the alternatives as rows and the attributes as columns. The attributes might include cost, performance, and risk. The decision-maker would assign a score to each alternative for each attribute, and the scores would be used to calculate a weighted score for each alternative.

In conclusion, tradespace exploration is a critical aspect of decision-making in the field of space systems. It involves the evaluation and comparison of different design alternatives based on their attributes. There are several techniques available for tradespace exploration, including Multi-Attribute Utility Theory, the Analytic Hierarchy Process, and decision matrices. Each of these techniques provides a systematic approach to decision-making, and can be used to support the decision-making process in the design and evaluation of space systems.




### Subsection: 2.2c Case Studies in Tradespace Exploration

In this section, we will explore some case studies that illustrate the application of tradespace exploration techniques in the field of space systems. These case studies will provide a practical understanding of how these techniques are used to make decisions in real-world scenarios.

#### Case Study 1: Destination: Deep Space

Destination: Deep Space is a game that involves the design and operation of a space system. The game provides a rich context for tradespace exploration, as it involves multiple attributes such as cost, performance, and risk.

The game is played on a field that is covered in grey carpet. The field is bounded by transparent polycarbonate guardrails on the longer sides and the Alliance Station walls on the shorter side. The field features two types of zones, one for each alliance. The hab zone contains robots at the start and end of each match, while the alliance station is where drivers control their robots.

Each alliance has their own Alliance Station that is positioned at one of the ends of the field. The Alliance Station is where drivers control their robots, human players deliver game pieces to robots, and coaches give advice to their team members. Each alliance station features two game piece holding areas on either side of their driver stations.

Depots are placed on the field next to the alliance stations, with two per alliance. Before the match starts, alliances are permitted to stage cargo in their respective depots for robots to retrieve during the match.

The sandstorm is installed above each alliance's alliance station, and is used to block the drive team's vision of the field during the sandstorm period. Once that period ends, the sandstorm retracts in order to allow drivers to see the field for the remainder of the match.

Each alliance features two loading stations near the edges of the alliance station. Human players use the loading stations to deliver hatch panels and cargo to robots through a chute, where they can be collected by a waiting robot.

The game also features four rockets on the field, two per alliance. Each rocket features three levels, made up of two bays, where game pieces can be scored. Two hatch panels and two pieces of cargo can be scored on each level.

In this case study, we will explore how tradespace exploration techniques can be used to design a space system that maximizes the expected utility of the game.

### Programming environment

Open Cobalt's software development environment enables programmers to enjoy the capabilities of a true late bound, message sending language. Because it is built on Squeak/Croquet, Open Cobalt is a purely object-oriented programming system that allows for significant flexibility in its design and implementation.

Within Open Cobalt, programmers may edit the source code of the 3D world from within the world, and immediately see the result while the world is still running. The running program does not have to be ended, and there is no compile-link-run-debug development loop. Any part of the program may be edited, down to the virtual machine (VM) and OpenGL calls. Open Cobalt's reliance on Squeak's generalized storage allocator and garbage collector makes it highly efficient in real-time and allows reshaping of objects to be done safely.

As with Squeak, Open Cobalt supports many non-English languages and fonts such as German, Spanish, French, and Japanese.

### Subsection: 3.2a Techniques for Efficient Tradespace Searches

In the previous section, we discussed the importance of tradespace exploration in the design and development of space systems. In this section, we will delve deeper into the techniques for efficient tradespace searches.

#### 3.2a.1 Pareto Frontier Analysis

Pareto Frontier Analysis is a mathematical concept that helps in identifying the most efficient solutions in a tradespace. The Pareto Frontier is the set of solutions that cannot be improved in one criterion without sacrificing another. In other words, it represents the best possible trade-offs between different design parameters.

In the context of space systems, Pareto Frontier Analysis can be used to identify the most efficient designs in terms of cost, performance, and risk. This can be particularly useful in the early stages of system design, where there are many design parameters to consider and a large number of potential solutions.

#### 3.2a.2 Multi-Objective Optimization

Multi-Objective Optimization is a mathematical technique used to optimize multiple objectives simultaneously. In the context of space systems, this can be particularly useful as there are often multiple objectives that need to be optimized, such as cost, performance, and risk.

One common approach to multi-objective optimization is the weighted sum method, where the different objectives are combined into a single objective function by assigning weights to each objective. The optimal solution is then found by adjusting the weights to balance the different objectives.

#### 3.2a.3 Genetic Algorithms

Genetic Algorithms are a type of evolutionary algorithm that can be used to explore large tradespaces efficiently. These algorithms are inspired by the process of natural selection and evolution, and they work by generating a population of potential solutions and then iteratively improving them through selection, crossover, and mutation.

In the context of space systems, Genetic Algorithms can be used to explore a large tradespace of design parameters and identify the most efficient solutions. This can be particularly useful when there are many design parameters and a large number of potential solutions.

#### 3.2a.4 Robust Design

Robust Design is a design approach that aims to minimize the impact of uncertainties and variations in the system design. This can be particularly useful in the context of space systems, where there are often many uncertainties and variations that can affect the system performance.

One approach to robust design is the Taguchi method, which uses a set of orthogonal arrays to systematically explore the design space and identify the most robust design. This can be particularly useful in the early stages of system design, where there are many design parameters and a large number of potential solutions.

#### 3.2a.5 Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity Analysis is a technique used to understand the impact of changes in the system design on the system performance. This can be particularly useful in the context of space systems, where there are often many design parameters and a large number of potential solutions.

One approach to sensitivity analysis is the one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method, which changes one design parameter at a time while keeping the others constant. This can help in understanding the individual impact of each design parameter on the system performance.

In conclusion, efficient tradespace searches are crucial in the design and development of space systems. The techniques discussed in this section, such as Pareto Frontier Analysis, Multi-Objective Optimization, Genetic Algorithms, Robust Design, and Sensitivity Analysis, can help in exploring large tradespaces efficiently and identifying the most efficient solutions.




### Subsection: 3.2b Application of Efficient Tradespace Searches

In the previous section, we discussed various techniques for efficient tradespace searches. In this section, we will explore how these techniques can be applied in the design and development of space systems.

#### 3.2b.1 Pareto Frontier Analysis in Space Systems

Pareto Frontier Analysis can be applied in the design of space systems to identify the most efficient solutions in terms of cost, performance, and risk. For example, in the design of a satellite, Pareto Frontier Analysis can be used to identify the most cost-effective design that meets certain performance requirements and minimizes risk.

This can be particularly useful in the early stages of system design, where there are many design parameters to consider and a large number of potential solutions. By using Pareto Frontier Analysis, engineers can quickly identify the most promising design solutions and focus their efforts on refining these solutions.

#### 3.2b.2 Multi-Objective Optimization in Space Systems

Multi-Objective Optimization can be applied in the design of space systems to optimize multiple objectives simultaneously. For example, in the design of a space mission, multi-objective optimization can be used to optimize the mission's cost, performance, and risk.

One common approach to multi-objective optimization is the weighted sum method, where the different objectives are combined into a single objective function by assigning weights to each objective. The optimal solution is then found by adjusting the weights to balance the different objectives.

This approach can be particularly useful in the design of complex space systems, where there are often multiple objectives that need to be optimized. By using multi-objective optimization, engineers can find solutions that balance these objectives and meet the system's overall requirements.

#### 3.2b.3 Genetic Algorithms in Space Systems

Genetic Algorithms can be applied in the design of space systems to explore large tradespaces efficiently. These algorithms can be used to generate a large number of potential solutions and then evaluate them based on their performance, cost, and risk.

This approach can be particularly useful in the design of complex space systems, where there are often many design parameters and a large number of potential solutions. By using genetic algorithms, engineers can quickly explore a large tradespace and identify the most promising solutions for further analysis.

In conclusion, efficient tradespace searches are crucial in the design and development of space systems. By using techniques such as Pareto Frontier Analysis, Multi-Objective Optimization, and Genetic Algorithms, engineers can efficiently explore tradespaces and identify the most efficient solutions for their systems.





### Subsection: 3.2c Case Studies of Efficient Tradespace Searches

In this section, we will explore some case studies that demonstrate the application of efficient tradespace searches in the design and development of space systems.

#### 3.2c.1 Case Study 1: Pareto Frontier Analysis in the Design of a Satellite

Consider the design of a satellite for a remote sensing mission. The satellite needs to meet certain performance requirements, such as a minimum data collection rate and a maximum power consumption. The design also needs to be cost-effective and minimize risk.

Using Pareto Frontier Analysis, engineers can identify the most cost-effective designs that meet the performance requirements and minimize risk. This can be achieved by plotting the design solutions in a two-dimensional space, with the cost on the x-axis and the risk on the y-axis. The Pareto Frontier represents the set of solutions that cannot be improved in one dimension without sacrificing the other. The optimal solution is then chosen from the Pareto Frontier based on the specific objectives of the mission.

#### 3.2c.2 Case Study 2: Multi-Objective Optimization in the Design of a Space Mission

Consider the design of a space mission to Mars. The mission needs to optimize its cost, performance, and risk. The cost includes the launch vehicle, the spacecraft, and the mission operations. The performance includes the mission duration and the scientific data collected. The risk includes the probability of mission failure and the impact of potential hazards.

Using multi-objective optimization, engineers can find solutions that balance these objectives and meet the mission's overall requirements. This can be achieved by assigning weights to each objective and finding the optimal solution using the weighted sum method. The optimal solution is then chosen based on the specific objectives of the mission.

#### 3.2c.3 Case Study 3: Genetic Algorithms in the Design of a Spacecraft

Consider the design of a spacecraft for a deep space exploration mission. The spacecraft needs to be robust and adaptable to various environmental conditions. The design also needs to be cost-effective and meet certain performance requirements.

Using genetic algorithms, engineers can explore a large design space and find robust and adaptable solutions that meet the performance requirements and minimize cost. This can be achieved by encoding the design solutions as strings of binary digits and using genetic operators such as mutation and crossover to generate new solutions. The fitness of each solution is evaluated based on its performance and cost. The optimal solution is then chosen from the set of solutions that have the highest fitness.

These case studies demonstrate the power of efficient tradespace searches in the design and development of space systems. By using techniques such as Pareto Frontier Analysis, multi-objective optimization, and genetic algorithms, engineers can find optimal solutions that balance multiple objectives and meet the requirements of complex space systems.
