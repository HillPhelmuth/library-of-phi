The primary goal of requirement analysis is to ensure that the system meets the needs and expectations of its stakeholders. This is achieved by understanding the system's mission objectives, environment, constraints, and measures of effectiveness and suitability (MOE/MOS). The customers, who perform the eight primary functions of systems engineering, play a crucial role in this process, particularly the operator as the key customer.

There are several types of requirements that are commonly categorized in technical management. These include business requirements, customer requirements, architectural requirements, structural requirements, behavioral requirements, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and performance requirements.

Business requirements are statements of business-level goals that do not refer to detailed functionality. These are usually high-level capabilities that are needed to achieve a business outcome.

Customer requirements, on the other hand, are statements of fact and assumptions that define the expectations of the system in terms of mission objectives, environment, constraints, and measures of effectiveness and suitability (MOE/MOS). The customers are those that perform the eight primary functions of systems engineering, with special emphasis on the operator as the key customer. Operational requirements will define the basic need and, at a minimum, answer the questions posed in the following listing:

- What is the mission objective?
- What is the operating environment?
- What are the constraints?
- What are the measures of effectiveness and suitability?

Architectural requirements explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary systems architecture of a system.

Structural requirements explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary structure of a system.

Behavioral requirements explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary behavior of a system.

Functional requirements explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary task, action, or activity that must be accomplished. Functional requirements analysis will be used as the top-level functions for functional analysis.

Non-functional requirements are requirements that specify criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors.

Performance requirements are the extent to which a mission or function must be executed. They are generally measured in terms of quantity, quality, coverage, timeliness, or readiness. During requirement analysis, these performance requirements are often expressed in terms of performance metrics.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the process of requirement analysis and discuss the various techniques and tools used to identify and analyze requirements.

MPC is a control strategy that uses a model of the system to predict its future behavior and calculate the control inputs necessary to achieve a desired trajectory. The MPC algorithm is particularly well-suited to formation flight, as it can handle the complex dynamics of the system and the constraints on the formation.

Another type of control algorithm used in formation flight is the adaptive control algorithm. Adaptive control is a technique that allows the control system to adapt to changes in the system dynamics or the environment. This is particularly important in formation flight, where the spacecraft may experience changes in their dynamics due to solar radiation pressure or other external forces.

The design of the control algorithm also involves the selection of the control law. The control law is the mathematical function that maps the control inputs to the control outputs. The choice of control law depends on the specific requirements of the formation, including the desired performance, the level of complexity of the system, and the available computational resources.

The design of the control algorithm also involves the selection of the control law. The control law is the mathematical function that maps the control inputs to the control outputs. The choice of control law depends on the specific requirements of the formation, including the desired performance, the level of complexity of the system, and the available computational resources.

In the next section, we will discuss the implementation of the control algorithm in the context of spacecraft formation flying.

#### 2.2b Formation Geometry

Formation geometry is a critical aspect of formation flight control. It refers to the spatial arrangement of the spacecraft in the formation. The choice of formation geometry depends on the specific requirements of the mission, including the objectives of the mission, the number of spacecraft, and the level of accuracy required.

One common type of formation geometry used in formation flight is the linear formation. In a linear formation, the spacecraft are arranged in a straight line. This formation is particularly well-suited to missions that require a high level of accuracy, such as precise pointing or formation keeping.

Another type of formation geometry used in formation flight is the triangular formation. In a triangular formation, the spacecraft are arranged in a triangle. This formation is particularly well-suited to missions that require a high level of maneuverability, such as formation changes or rendezvous operations.

The choice of formation geometry also involves the selection of the formation control law. The formation control law is the mathematical function that maps the control inputs to the desired formation geometry. The choice of formation control law depends on the specific requirements of the formation, including the desired performance, the level of complexity of the system, and the available computational resources.

The formation control law can be designed using various techniques, including model predictive control, adaptive control, and sliding mode control. These techniques allow the control system to achieve the desired formation geometry while compensating for disturbances and uncertainties.

In the next section, we will discuss the implementation of the formation control law in the context of spacecraft formation flying.

#### 2.2c Formation Keeping

Formation keeping is a critical aspect of formation flight control. It refers to the ability of the spacecraft to maintain the desired formation geometry in the presence of disturbances and uncertainties. The challenge of formation keeping is to ensure that the spacecraft maintain the desired formation while compensating for the effects of external forces and uncertainties in the system model.

One approach to formation keeping is the use of a sliding mode control law. A sliding mode control law is a type of control law that forces the system state to converge to a predefined sliding surface. Once the system state reaches the sliding surface, it remains on the surface for all future time. This property makes sliding mode control laws particularly well-suited to formation keeping, as it ensures that the formation geometry is maintained despite disturbances and uncertainties.

The sliding mode control law can be designed using various techniques, including the use of a sliding surface that represents the desired formation geometry. The sliding surface can be defined as a hyperplane in the state space, and the control law can be designed to drive the system state towards this hyperplane. Once the system state reaches the hyperplane, the control law ensures that the system state remains on the hyperplane for all future time.

Another approach to formation keeping is the use of a model predictive control (MPC) law. An MPC law is a type of control law that uses a model of the system to predict its future behavior and calculate the control inputs necessary to achieve a desired trajectory. The MPC law can be designed to maintain the desired formation geometry by incorporating the formation control law into the model used for prediction.

The choice of formation keeping technique depends on the specific requirements of the mission, including the objectives of the mission, the number of spacecraft, and the level of accuracy required. In the next section, we will discuss the implementation of these techniques in the context of spacecraft formation flying.

#### 2.2d Formation Changes

Formation changes are a critical aspect of formation flight control. They refer to the ability of the spacecraft to transition from one formation geometry to another. The challenge of formation changes is to ensure that the spacecraft can transition between different formation geometries while maintaining the desired performance and accuracy.

One approach to formation changes is the use of a model predictive control (MPC) law. An MPC law is a type of control law that uses a model of the system to predict its future behavior and calculate the control inputs necessary to achieve a desired trajectory. The MPC law can be designed to handle formation changes by incorporating the desired formation geometry into the model used for prediction.

The MPC law can be designed using various techniques, including the use of a cost function that penalizes deviations from the desired formation geometry. The cost function can be defined as a quadratic function of the state and control inputs, and the control law can be designed to minimize this cost function. This ensures that the control inputs are calculated in a way that minimizes the deviation from the desired formation geometry.

Another approach to formation changes is the use of a sliding mode control law. A sliding mode control law is a type of control law that forces the system state to converge to a predefined sliding surface. Once the system state reaches the sliding surface, it remains on the surface for all future time. The sliding surface can be defined as a hyperplane in the state space, and the control law can be designed to drive the system state towards this hyperplane. Once the system state reaches the hyperplane, the control law ensures that the system state remains on the hyperplane for all future time.

The choice of formation change technique depends on the specific requirements of the mission, including the objectives of the mission, the number of spacecraft, and the level of accuracy required. In the next section, we will discuss the implementation of these techniques in the context of spacecraft formation flying.

#### 2.2e Formation Breakup

Formation breakup is a critical aspect of formation flight control. It refers to the ability of the spacecraft to transition from a formation to individual spacecraft. The challenge of formation breakup is to ensure that the spacecraft can transition from a coordinated formation to individual spacecraft while maintaining the desired performance and accuracy.

One approach to formation breakup is the use of a model predictive control (MPC) law. An MPC law is a type of control law that uses a model of the system to predict its future behavior and calculate the control inputs necessary to achieve a desired trajectory. The MPC law can be designed to handle formation breakup by incorporating the desired individual spacecraft trajectories into the model used for prediction.

The MPC law can be designed using various techniques, including the use of a cost function that penalizes deviations from the desired individual spacecraft trajectories. The cost function can be defined as a quadratic function of the state and control inputs, and the control law can be designed to minimize this cost function. This ensures that the control inputs are calculated in a way that minimizes the deviation from the desired individual spacecraft trajectories.

Another approach to formation breakup is the use of a sliding mode control law. A sliding mode control law is a type of control law that forces the system state to converge to a predefined sliding surface. Once the system state reaches the sliding surface, it remains on the surface for all future time. The sliding surface can be defined as a hyperplane in the state space, and the control law can be designed to drive the system state towards this hyperplane. Once the system state reaches the hyperplane, the control law ensures that the system state remains on the hyperplane for all future time.

### Section: 2.2 Formation Flight Control:

Formation flight control is a critical aspect of space systems engineering, particularly in the context of spacecraft formation flying. It involves the coordination and control of multiple spacecraft to achieve a common objective, such as observing a celestial body or conducting a scientific experiment.

#### 2.2b Control Systems

Control systems are an integral part of formation flight control. They are responsible for generating the control inputs necessary to maintain the desired formation and to compensate for disturbances and uncertainties. The design of a control system involves the selection of the control algorithm, the design of the control law, and the implementation of the control system in the spacecraft.

One common type of control system used in formation flight is the model predictive control (MPC) system. MPC systems use a model of the system to predict its future behavior and calculate the control inputs necessary to achieve a desired trajectory. The MPC system is particularly well-suited to formation flight, as it can handle the complex dynamics of the system and the constraints on the formation.

Another type of control system used in formation flight is the adaptive control system. Adaptive control systems allow the control system to adapt to changes in the system dynamics or the environment. This is particularly important in formation flight, where the spacecraft may experience changes in their dynamics due to solar radiation pressure or other external forces.

The design of the control system also involves the selection of the control hardware. The control hardware includes the sensors, the actuators, and the control electronics. The selection of the control hardware depends on the specific requirements of the formation, including the number of spacecraft, the desired formation geometry, and the level of accuracy required.

The control system also needs to be robust to failures. This is particularly important in formation flight, where the failure of one spacecraft can have a significant impact on the entire formation. The control system needs to be designed to detect and respond to failures in a timely manner, and to continue to maintain the desired formation even in the presence of failures.

In the next section, we will discuss the role of communication systems in formation flight control.

#### 2.2c Formation Keeping

Formation keeping is a critical aspect of formation flight control. It involves maintaining the desired formation geometry and keeping the spacecraft within a specified distance of each other. This is particularly important in formation flight, where the spacecraft need to work together to achieve a common objective.

One common technique used for formation keeping is the use of virtual structure. A virtual structure is a mathematical representation of the desired formation geometry. The control system uses the virtual structure to calculate the control inputs necessary to maintain the desired formation. The virtual structure can be represented using various mathematical models, such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF).

The EKF is a popular choice for formation keeping due to its ability to handle non-linear systems. It uses a linear approximation of the system dynamics to calculate the control inputs. The UKF, on the other hand, is particularly well-suited to systems with non-linear dynamics. It uses a set of sigma points to approximate the system dynamics and to calculate the control inputs.

Another technique used for formation keeping is the use of relative navigation. Relative navigation involves the use of relative measurements between the spacecraft to maintain the desired formation. This can be achieved using various techniques, such as the use of laser ranging or the use of optical cameras.

The design of a formation keeping system also involves the selection of the control hardware. The control hardware includes the sensors, the actuators, and the control electronics. The selection of the control hardware depends on the specific requirements of the formation, including the number of spacecraft, the desired formation geometry, and the level of accuracy required.

The formation keeping system also needs to be robust to failures. This is particularly important in formation flight, where the failure of one spacecraft can have a significant impact on the entire formation. The formation keeping system needs to be designed to detect and respond to failures in a timely manner, and to continue to maintain the desired formation even in the presence of failures.

In the next section, we will discuss the role of communication systems in formation keeping.

#### 2.2d Formation Breakup

Formation breakup is a critical aspect of formation flight control that occurs when one or more spacecraft deviate from the desired formation geometry. This can be due to various factors, including sensor failures, actuator failures, or uncertainties in the system dynamics. Formation breakup can lead to a loss of the desired formation and can have significant implications for the overall mission.

One common cause of formation breakup is sensor failure. Sensors are used to measure the state of the spacecraft and to provide feedback to the control system. If a sensor fails, the control system may not be able to accurately determine the state of the spacecraft, leading to a deviation from the desired formation. This can be mitigated by using redundant sensors and by implementing fault detection and isolation techniques.

Another common cause of formation breakup is actuator failure. Actuators are used to generate the control inputs necessary to maintain the desired formation. If an actuator fails, the spacecraft may not be able to respond to the control inputs, leading to a deviation from the desired formation. This can be mitigated by using redundant actuators and by implementing fault detection and isolation techniques.

Uncertainties in the system dynamics can also lead to formation breakup. These uncertainties can be due to various factors, including modeling errors, external disturbances, or changes in the system dynamics over time. To mitigate these uncertainties, the control system can use adaptive control techniques, such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). These techniques use a probabilistic model of the system dynamics to estimate the state of the system and to calculate the control inputs necessary to maintain the desired formation.

In the event of formation breakup, the control system can use various techniques to try to re-establish the desired formation. These techniques can include the use of relative navigation, as discussed in the previous section, as well as the use of formation keeping laws, such as the Virtual Structure method or the Relative Navigation method.

In conclusion, formation breakup is a critical aspect of formation flight control that can have significant implications for the overall mission. By understanding the causes of formation breakup and implementing appropriate mitigation strategies, we can improve the reliability and robustness of formation flight control systems.

### Section: 3.1 Trade Analyses

Trade analyses are a crucial aspect of sub-system planning in space systems engineering. They involve the evaluation of different design options or alternatives to determine the best solution for a given set of requirements. This section will provide a comprehensive guide to understanding the principles and techniques involved in trade analyses, and how they are applied in the context of space systems engineering.

#### 3.1a Trade Space Exploration

Trade space exploration is a key step in the trade analysis process. It involves the identification and evaluation of a wide range of design options or alternatives. This is typically done using mathematical models and simulations to predict the performance of each option under a set of defined conditions.

For example, in the design of a space system, the trade space might include different types of propulsion systems, power sources, and communication systems. Each of these options would be evaluated based on a set of criteria, such as cost, performance, and risk.

The trade space is then explored by systematically evaluating each option against the criteria. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as decision matrices, cost-benefit analysis, and sensitivity analysis. The goal is to identify the options that offer the best balance of performance, cost, and risk.

#### 3.1b Decision Matrix

A decision matrix is a simple but powerful tool for evaluating and comparing different design options. It is a table that lists the options in one column and the criteria in another. Each option is then scored against each criterion, and the scores are summed to give a total score for each option.

For example, consider the design of a space system with three propulsion options: chemical rockets, ion engines, and nuclear pulse propulsion. The criteria might include cost, performance, and risk. The decision matrix might look like this:

| Propulsion Option | Cost | Performance | Risk | Total Score |
|-----------------|------|------------|------|------------|
| Chemical Rockets | 10   | 8         | 7    | 8.3        |
| Ion Engines     | 12   | 9         | 8    | 9.3        |
| Nuclear Pulse Propulsion | 15   | 10        | 9    | 10.3       |

Based on this matrix, nuclear pulse propulsion would be the best option, with a total score of 10.3. However, the decision matrix is just one tool among many, and the final decision should be based on a comprehensive analysis of all the options.

#### 3.1c Cost-Benefit Analysis

Cost-benefit analysis is another common technique for evaluating design options. It involves comparing the costs and benefits of each option. The costs might include development costs, operating costs, and risk mitigation costs. The benefits might include performance improvements, cost savings, and risk reduction.

For example, consider the decision between using chemical rockets and ion engines for a space system. The costs and benefits might be as follows:

| Option | Costs | Benefits |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Chemical Rockets | $10M | 80% performance |
| Ion Engines | $12M | 90% performance |

Based on this analysis, ion engines would be the better option, despite their higher cost. The additional performance would likely outweigh the extra cost.

#### 3.1d Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analysis is a technique for understanding how changes in the input parameters affect the output of a system. In the context of trade analyses, this can be used to understand how changes in the criteria or the scores affect the overall decision.

For example, consider the decision between nuclear pulse propulsion and ion engines. If the risk criterion is changed from 9 to 10, the total score for nuclear pulse propulsion would increase from 10.3 to 11.3. This would make nuclear pulse propulsion an even more attractive option.

In conclusion, trade analyses are a crucial aspect of sub-system planning in space systems engineering. They involve the evaluation of different design options or alternatives to determine the best solution for a given set of requirements. Techniques such as decision matrices, cost-benefit analysis, and sensitivity analysis are commonly used to facilitate this process.

#### 3.1e Risk Management

Risk management is a critical aspect of trade analyses in space systems engineering. It involves identifying, assessing, and controlling the risks associated with each design option. This is crucial because space missions are inherently risky, and a failure could have catastrophic consequences.

Risk management can be broken down into four main steps: risk identification, risk assessment, risk response planning, and risk monitoring and control.

##### Risk Identification

Risk identification is the process of identifying potential risks that could affect the success of a space mission. This includes risks related to the design, development, and operation of the space system, as well as external risks such as weather conditions, launch delays, and political instability.

For example, in the design of a space system, potential risks might include the failure of a critical component, a software bug, or a change in the mission requirements. These risks need to be identified and documented.

##### Risk Assessment

Risk assessment is the process of evaluating the potential impact and likelihood of each identified risk. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as expert judgment, historical data, and simulation models.

For example, the potential impact of a software bug might be assessed based on the criticality of the software, the complexity of the code, and the testing procedures. The likelihood might be assessed based on the reliability of the software, the testing procedures, and the experience of the development team.

##### Risk Response Planning

Risk response planning is the process of developing strategies to address the identified risks. This can include avoiding the risk (e.g., by changing the design), mitigating the risk (e.g., by adding redundancy), transferring the risk (e.g., by buying insurance), or accepting the risk (e.g., by allocating resources to handle the consequences).

For example, to address the risk of a software bug, the development team might decide to add redundancy by implementing a second, independent software system. This would increase the cost and complexity of the system, but it would also reduce the risk of a software failure.

##### Risk Monitoring and Control

Risk monitoring and control is the process of tracking the identified risks and implementing the risk response strategies. This involves monitoring the residual risks (i.e., the risks that remain after the risk response strategies have been implemented), identifying new risks, and updating the risk response strategies as necessary.

For example, during the development of a space system, the development team might regularly review the residual risks and update the risk response strategies as necessary. If a new risk is identified, the team might need to develop a new risk response strategy.

In conclusion, risk management is a crucial aspect of trade analyses in space systems engineering. It helps to ensure that the risks associated with each design option are properly identified, assessed, and managed. This is crucial for the success of space missions, which are inherently risky.

#### 3.1f Case Studies

To further illustrate the concepts discussed in this chapter, let's consider a few case studies. These examples will provide a practical perspective on trade analyses and risk management in space systems engineering.

##### Case Study 1: Europa Orbiter

The Europa Orbiter is a hypothetical mission targeting Jupiter's moon Europa. The mission aims to investigate the potential for life on Europa by studying its surface and subsurface environments.

###### Comparison of Notional NASA Missions

The Europa Orbiter is one of several notional NASA missions targeting Europa. These missions are compared based on their design, cost, and potential scientific return. The comparison is done using a decision matrix, which lists the missions in one column and the criteria in another. Each mission is then scored against each criterion, and the scores are summed to give a total score for each mission.

| Mission | Cost | Scientific Return |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| Europa Orbiter | $1B | 90% |
| Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer | $1.5B | 85% |
| Jupiter Europa Orbiter | $2B | 95% |

Based on this comparison, the Europa Orbiter is the most cost-effective mission, with a total score of 85%.

###### Risk Management

The Europa Orbiter mission faces several potential risks, including the failure of a critical component, a software bug, and a change in the mission requirements. These risks are managed using a risk response plan, which includes strategies to avoid, mitigate, transfer, and accept the risks.

For example, to address the risk of a software bug, the mission team might decide to implement a second, independent software system. This would increase the cost and complexity of the mission, but it would also reduce the risk of a software failure.

##### Case Study 2: Space Trade

The concept of space trade is another example of a trade analysis in space systems engineering. This involves the exploration of the trade space, which is the set of all possible design options for a space system.

###### The Motivator for Colonization of Mars

The motivator for colonization of Mars is a key factor in the trade space exploration. It is theorized that if different locations within the Solar System become inhabited by humans, they would need to transport valuable resources between different planets, moons, and asteroids. This creates a need for interplanetary trade, which in turn creates a need for space systems that can support this trade.

###### Building Commercial Spaceports

Building high-capacity commercial spaceports is another aspect of the trade space exploration. This involves the design and construction of spaceports that can handle a large volume of space traffic. The design of these spaceports is a complex trade analysis, involving decisions about the location, size, and capabilities of the spaceport.

In conclusion, these case studies illustrate the importance of trade analyses and risk management in space systems engineering. They show how these concepts are applied in practice, and how they can be used to make informed decisions about the design and operation of space systems.

#### 3.1b Trade-off Criteria

Trade-off criteria are the factors that are used to evaluate and compare different design options in a trade analysis. These criteria are typically based on the system requirements and constraints, and they are used to determine the best solution for the system.

In the context of space systems engineering, trade-off criteria might include factors such as cost, performance, risk, and reliability. These criteria are often conflicting, and finding the optimal solution requires a careful balance between them.

For example, in the design of a space system, a high-performance propulsion system might be desirable for its ability to deliver high thrust and maneuverability. However, this might come at the cost of increased complexity and risk, which could drive up the system cost. On the other hand, a low-cost propulsion system might be less risky and easier to implement, but it might also be less performant.

The trade-off criteria are used to evaluate and compare the different design options in the trade space. This is typically done using mathematical models and simulations, as well as expert judgment and experience. The goal is to identify the options that offer the best balance of performance, cost, and risk.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the techniques that are used to evaluate and compare the different design options in a trade analysis.

#### 3.1c Trade-off Studies

Trade-off studies are a critical part of the trade analysis process. They involve the detailed evaluation and comparison of different design options based on the trade-off criteria. This is typically done using mathematical models and simulations, as well as expert judgment and experience.

In the context of space systems engineering, trade-off studies might involve the detailed evaluation of different propulsion systems, power sources, and communication systems. For example, a trade-off study might involve the detailed evaluation of chemical rockets, ion engines, and nuclear pulse propulsion systems.

The study might start with the identification of the key performance parameters for each system, such as thrust, specific impulse, and power consumption. These parameters are then used to construct a performance model for each system. The models are then used to predict the performance of each system under a set of defined conditions.

The study might also involve the evaluation of the risk associated with each system. This might be done using techniques such as failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), which involves the identification and analysis of potential failure modes and their effects.

The results of the trade-off study are then used to make decisions about the design of the system. For example, if the study shows that ion engines offer better performance and lower risk than chemical rockets, the decision might be made to use ion engines in the system.

Trade-off studies are a powerful tool for making informed decisions about the design of space systems. They allow engineers to understand the trade-offs between different design options, and to make decisions that balance performance, cost, and risk.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the techniques that are used to conduct trade-off studies, including mathematical modeling, simulation, and expert judgment.

#### 3.1d Trade-off Analysis Examples

In this section, we will explore some examples of trade-off analyses in space systems engineering. These examples will illustrate the principles and techniques discussed in the previous sections.

##### Example 1: Propulsion System Selection

Consider the design of a space system that needs to deliver a payload to a specific orbit. The system has a mass limit of 1000 kg and a power limit of 10 kW. The system needs to be able to deliver a minimum thrust of 100 N.

The system engineer needs to select a propulsion system that meets these requirements. The engineer has identified three options: chemical rockets, ion engines, and nuclear pulse propulsion.

The engineer conducts a trade-off analysis to compare these options. The analysis involves the construction of performance models for each system, and the evaluation of the risk associated with each system.

The performance models are used to predict the performance of each system under a set of defined conditions. The models show that ion engines offer the best performance, with a specific impulse of 3000 s and a thrust of 150 N. Chemical rockets offer the next best performance, with a specific impulse of 2000 s and a thrust of 200 N. Nuclear pulse propulsion offers the worst performance, with a specific impulse of 1000 s and a thrust of 300 N.

The risk analysis involves the use of failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA). The FMEA shows that ion engines have the lowest risk, with only one potential failure mode (loss of ionization) and a low effect (loss of thrust). Chemical rockets have a higher risk, with three potential failure modes (loss of combustion, loss of thrust, and loss of stability) and a medium effect. Nuclear pulse propulsion has the highest risk, with four potential failure modes (loss of nuclear reaction, loss of thrust, loss of stability, and radiation hazard) and a high effect.

Based on these results, the engineer decides to use ion engines in the system. This decision balances the performance of the system with the risk associated with the propulsion system.

##### Example 2: Power System Selection

Consider the design of a space system that needs to operate for a period of one year. The system has a power limit of 10 kW and a mass limit of 50 kg. The system needs to be able to provide a minimum power of 5 W.

The system engineer needs to select a power system that meets these requirements. The engineer has identified three options: solar panels, nuclear power, and fuel cells.

The engineer conducts a trade-off analysis to compare these options. The analysis involves the construction of performance models for each system, and the evaluation of the risk associated with each system.

The performance models are used to predict the performance of each system under a set of defined conditions. The models show that solar panels offer the best performance, with a power output of 100 W and a mass of 20 kg. Nuclear power offers the next best performance, with a power output of 50 W and a mass of 30 kg. Fuel cells offer the worst performance, with a power output of 20 W and a mass of 40 kg.

The risk analysis involves the use of failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA). The FMEA shows that solar panels have the lowest risk, with only one potential failure mode (loss of sunlight) and a low effect (loss of power). Nuclear power has a higher risk, with two potential failure modes (loss of nuclear reaction and loss of cooling) and a medium effect. Fuel cells have the highest risk, with three potential failure modes (loss of fuel, loss of electrolyte, and loss of catalyst) and a high effect.

Based on these results, the engineer decides to use solar panels in the system. This decision balances the performance of the system with the risk associated with the power system.




#### 3.1c Trade-off Results

The results of a trade-off study are typically presented in a trade-off matrix, which is a table that compares the different design options based on the trade-off criteria. Each row in the matrix represents a design option, and each column represents a trade-off criterion. The cells in the matrix contain the values of the trade-off criteria for each design option.

For example, in the trade-off study of propulsion systems, the trade-off matrix might look like this:

| Propulsion System | Cost | Performance | Risk | Reliability |
|-----------------|------|------------|------|-------------|
| Chemical Rocket | $100M | 10,000 N | High | Medium |
| Ion Engine | $200M | 5,000 N | Medium | High |
| Electric Propulsion | $300M | 8,000 N | Low | High |

The trade-off matrix allows for a direct comparison of the different design options. For example, the Chemical Rocket and Ion Engine have similar performance, but the Chemical Rocket is less expensive and has lower risk. On the other hand, the Electric Propulsion system has higher performance and lower risk, but it is also more expensive.

The trade-off matrix can also be used to identify the Pareto optimal solutions, which are the design options that cannot be improved in one criterion without sacrificing another. In the example above, the Chemical Rocket and Ion Engine are Pareto optimal solutions, as improving one criterion would require sacrificing another.

The trade-off results can also be used to identify the best overall solution, which is the design option that offers the best balance of performance, cost, and risk. In the example above, the Electric Propulsion system might be the best overall solution, as it offers the highest performance and reliability, despite its higher cost and risk.

In conclusion, trade-off studies are a critical part of the trade analysis process. They allow for a detailed evaluation and comparison of different design options, and they can help identify the best overall solution for a space system.

### Section: 4.2 TARR Preparation:

#### 4.2a TARR Planning

The TARR (Time-Critical Application Real-Time Reference Model) is a critical component of real-time software systems. It provides a framework for understanding and managing the timing requirements of real-time applications. The TARR model is particularly useful in the context of space systems engineering, where timing requirements can be stringent and complex.

The TARR model is based on the concept of a time-critical application, which is an application that must meet specific timing requirements. These requirements can include deadlines for the completion of tasks, jitter (the variation in the completion time of a task), and worst-case execution time (WCET). The TARR model provides a structured approach to managing these timing requirements, ensuring that they are met in a reliable and predictable manner.

The first step in preparing for TARR is to identify the time-critical applications in the system. This involves understanding the functionality of the system and identifying those parts that have timing requirements. For example, in a space system, time-critical applications might include the control of critical subsystems, the processing of sensor data, and the execution of mission-critical tasks.

Once the time-critical applications have been identified, the next step is to define their timing requirements. This involves determining the deadlines for the completion of tasks, the acceptable levels of jitter, and the worst-case execution times. These requirements can be defined using the TARR model, which provides a set of metrics for characterizing the timing behavior of real-time applications.

The final step in preparing for TARR is to develop a plan for managing the timing requirements of the time-critical applications. This involves selecting the appropriate real-time scheduling algorithm, configuring the system to meet the timing requirements, and testing the system to verify that the requirements are met.

In the context of space systems engineering, TARR planning is a critical aspect of system design and management. It provides a structured approach to managing the timing requirements of real-time applications, ensuring that they are met in a reliable and predictable manner. By following the TARR model, engineers can design and manage space systems that meet their timing requirements, even in the face of uncertainties and disturbances.

#### 4.2b TARR Implementation

After the TARR planning phase, the next step is the implementation of the TARR model in the real-time software system. This involves configuring the system to meet the defined timing requirements and testing the system to verify that the requirements are met.

The implementation of TARR involves several key steps. The first step is to select the appropriate real-time scheduling algorithm. The scheduling algorithm is responsible for managing the execution of the time-critical applications, ensuring that they meet their timing requirements. The choice of scheduling algorithm depends on the specific characteristics of the system and the timing requirements of the time-critical applications.

For example, in a space system, a fixed-priority scheduler might be used to manage the execution of the time-critical applications. This type of scheduler assigns a fixed priority to each application and executes the applications with the highest priority first. This ensures that critical tasks are completed on time, even if there are other tasks competing for resources.

The next step in TARR implementation is to configure the system to meet the timing requirements. This involves setting the appropriate parameters in the scheduling algorithm and the real-time operating system. For example, the deadline for the completion of a task might be set in the scheduling algorithm, and the worst-case execution time might be set in the real-time operating system.

The final step in TARR implementation is to test the system to verify that the timing requirements are met. This involves running the system under a variety of conditions and verifying that the timing requirements are met. If the system does not meet the requirements, adjustments can be made to the system configuration or the scheduling algorithm.

In the context of space systems engineering, TARR implementation is a critical aspect of system design and management. It ensures that the real-time software system meets its timing requirements, which are often critical for the successful operation of the system. By following the TARR model, engineers can design and manage space systems that meet their timing requirements, even in the face of uncertainties and disturbances.

#### 4.2c TARR Verification

After the implementation of the TARR model, the next crucial step is the verification of the system. This involves testing the system to ensure that it meets the defined timing requirements. The verification process is a critical part of the TARR model as it provides confidence that the system will perform as expected in the real world.

The verification of TARR involves several key steps. The first step is to define the verification test suite. This is a set of tests that are used to verify the timing requirements of the system. The test suite should cover a range of operating conditions and should be designed to exercise the system in a way that is representative of its expected use.

For example, in a space system, the verification test suite might include tests for different levels of system load, different configurations of the system, and different types of disturbances. The tests should be designed to exercise the system in a way that is likely to reveal any timing issues.

The next step in TARR verification is to run the verification test suite. This involves executing the tests and monitoring the system performance. The system performance should be compared to the defined timing requirements. If the system does not meet the requirements, the system configuration or the scheduling algorithm may need to be adjusted.

The final step in TARR verification is to document the results of the verification process. This involves recording the results of the tests, the system performance, and any adjustments that were made to the system. This documentation should be stored with the system documentation and should be reviewed periodically to ensure that the system continues to meet its timing requirements.

In the context of space systems engineering, TARR verification is a critical aspect of system design and management. It provides confidence that the system will perform as expected in the real world, which is crucial for the successful operation of the system. By following the TARR model, engineers can design and manage space systems that meet their timing requirements, even in the face of uncertainties and disturbances.

The execution of the TARR model is a critical phase in the development of real-time software systems, as it ensures that the timing requirements of the system are met.

The execution of the TARR model involves several steps. The first step is to select the appropriate real-time scheduling algorithm. The scheduling algorithm is responsible for managing the timing requirements of the time-critical applications. It does this by allocating resources to the applications and ensuring that they meet their timing requirements. The choice of scheduling algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the system, including the number of applications, the complexity of the applications, and the available resources.

The next step in the execution of the TARR model is to configure the system to meet the timing requirements. This involves setting up the hardware and software components of the system to ensure that they can meet the timing requirements of the time-critical applications. This may involve adjusting the clock speed of the processor, configuring the memory system, or modifying the software code of the applications.

The final step in the execution of the TARR model is to test the system to verify that it meets the timing requirements. This involves running the system under a variety of conditions and monitoring its performance. The system is tested to ensure that it meets the deadlines for the completion of tasks, that the jitter is within the acceptable limits, and that the worst-case execution time is within the specified bounds.

The execution of the TARR model is a critical phase in the development of real-time software systems. It ensures that the timing requirements of the system are met, providing a reliable and predictable system that can handle the timing requirements of space systems engineering.




### Section: 4.2 TARR Preparation:

#### 5.1c Prototype Iteration

After the prototype has been tested, it may not meet all the system requirements and constraints. In such cases, the prototype is iterated, meaning that it is redesigned and rebuilt to address the issues that were discovered during testing. This section will discuss the process of prototype iteration, including the steps involved, the purpose of iteration, and the benefits of iterative design.

#### 5.1c.1 Steps in Prototype Iteration

The process of prototype iteration typically involves the following steps:

1. **Analyze Test Results:** The first step in prototype iteration is to analyze the results of the prototype tests. This involves identifying the areas where the prototype did not meet the system requirements and constraints.

2. **Identify Design Flaws:** The next step is to identify the design flaws that led to the areas of non-compliance. This may involve a thorough review of the design, as well as discussions with the design team.

3. **Revise Design:** Based on the analysis and identification of design flaws, the design of the prototype is revised. This may involve making changes to the design specifications, the choice of components, or the implementation of the design.

4. **Rebuild Prototype:** The revised design is then implemented in the form of a new prototype. This may involve building a new physical prototype, or making changes to an existing prototype.

5. **Repeat Testing:** The new prototype is then tested again to verify that the design flaws have been addressed and that the prototype now meets the system requirements and constraints.

#### 5.1c.2 Purpose of Prototype Iteration

The purpose of prototype iteration is to improve the quality and reliability of the system. By iterating on the prototype, any design flaws can be identified and addressed early in the development process, before they become more difficult and expensive to fix. This helps to ensure that the final system meets all the system requirements and constraints, and operates reliably and consistently.

#### 5.1c.3 Benefits of Iterative Design

Iterative design offers several benefits over traditional linear design processes. These include:

1. **Early Identification of Design Flaws:** By iterating on the prototype, design flaws can be identified and addressed early in the development process. This helps to prevent these flaws from propagating and causing more significant issues later on.

2. **Improved System Quality:** By addressing design flaws early, the quality and reliability of the system can be improved. This can lead to better performance, lower costs, and increased customer satisfaction.

3. **Flexibility in Design:** Iterative design allows for flexibility in the design process. Changes can be made and tested quickly, allowing for the exploration of different design options and the incorporation of new ideas.

4. **Reduced Development Time:** By identifying and addressing design flaws early, the overall development time can be reduced. This can lead to faster time to market and increased competitiveness.

In conclusion, prototype iteration is a crucial part of the sub-system design process. It allows for the identification and correction of design flaws, leading to improved system quality and reliability. By incorporating iterative design into the development process, space systems engineers can ensure that their systems meet all the system requirements and constraints, and operate reliably and consistently.

Once action items have been identified, they need to be prioritized. This involves determining the urgency and importance of each action item. Urgency refers to how soon the action item needs to be addressed, while importance refers to the impact of the action item on the overall project.

There are various methods for prioritizing action items, including the Eisenhower Matrix and the Pareto Principle. The Eisenhower Matrix, also known as the Urgent-Important Matrix, helps to categorize action items based on their urgency and importance. The Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, suggests that 80% of results can be achieved by focusing on the 20% of action items that are most important.

#### 7.2c Action Item Closure

After action items have been prioritized, they need to be closed. This involves completing the necessary tasks and verifying that the action items have been addressed. Action item closure is an important step in the PDR process, as it ensures that all necessary tasks have been completed and the design is ready to move on to the next phase.

The closure of action items can be done through various methods, including checklists, status reports, and design reviews. Checklists help to track the completion of tasks, while status reports provide a summary of the progress made on action items. Design reviews, conducted by the design team and review board, help to verify that the action items have been addressed and the design meets all requirements.

In conclusion, the Preliminary Design Review is a crucial step in the space systems engineering process. It allows the design team to validate their design, identify action items, and prioritize and close them to ensure the success of the project. By following a systematic approach and utilizing various tools and methodologies, the PDR can help to ensure the success of a space system design.

### Section: 10.1 Integration Planning:

Integration planning is a crucial step in the system integration process. It involves the coordination and planning of the integration of various subsystems and components to ensure that they work together seamlessly. In this section, we will discuss the key aspects of integration planning, including the different types of integration, the challenges faced during integration, and the techniques and tools used for integration.

#### 10.1a Integration Strategy

The integration strategy is a critical component of integration planning. It outlines the approach and methodology used for integrating the various subsystems and components of a space system. The integration strategy is typically developed based on the specific requirements and characteristics of the system, as well as the available resources and constraints.

There are several types of integration strategies that can be used in space systems engineering, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. These include vertical integration, star integration, and horizontal integration.

Vertical integration, also known as "functional integration," involves integrating subsystems according to their functionality by creating functional entities or silos. This method is quick and involves only the necessary vendors, making it cheaper in the short term. However, the cost-of-ownership can be substantially higher in the long term, as the only way to implement new or enhanced functionality is by implementing another silo. This method is not conducive to reusing subsystems to create new functionality.

Star integration, also known as "spaghetti integration," involves interconnecting each system to each of the remaining subsystems. This method allows for extreme flexibility in the reuse of functionality, but it can be costly due to the interfaces that subsystems are exporting. The cost and time needed for integration increase exponentially with the addition of each subsystem.

Horizontal integration or Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) is a method that involves the use of a specialized subsystem dedicated to communication between other subsystems. This allows for cutting the number of connections (interfaces) to only one per subsystem, which will connect directly to the ESB. The ESB is capable of translating the interface into another interface, providing extreme flexibility and reducing the cost of integration.

The choice of integration strategy depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the system, as well as the available resources and constraints. It is important to carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy before making a decision.

In the next section, we will discuss the challenges faced during integration and the techniques and tools used for integration.

#### Technical Risks

Technical risks are related to the system being validated. These risks can arise from the complexity of the system, the reliability of the system components, or the interaction between different system components. For example, the use of Adaptive Internet Protocol (AIP) in a system could pose a technical risk if the protocol is not fully understood or implemented correctly. Similarly, the use of the Simple Function Point method for system sizing could pose a risk if the method is not properly applied or if the system's complexity exceeds the method's assumptions.

#### Organizational Risks

Organizational risks are related to the organization conducting the validation. These risks can arise from the availability of resources, the skills of the validation team, or the organization's culture. For example, the use of the Rational Unified Process (RUP) for system development could pose an organizational risk if the organization does not have the necessary resources or skills to implement the process effectively. Similarly, the use of the CMMI model for process improvement could pose a risk if the organization's culture is not aligned with the model's principles.

#### Environmental Risks

Environmental risks are related to the external environment in which the system operates. These risks can arise from changes in the market, regulatory requirements, or technological advancements. For example, the use of the ISO 639:q standard for language identification could pose an environmental risk if the standard is updated or if new languages are added to the standard. Similarly, the use of the E number for product identification could pose a risk if the numbering system changes or if new products are introduced that do not have an assigned number.

To manage these validation risks, it is important to conduct a thorough risk assessment and to develop a risk management plan. The risk assessment should identify the potential risks, assess their likelihood and impact, and prioritize them based on their severity. The risk management plan should outline the strategies for mitigating or avoiding the identified risks. These strategies could include additional validation activities, training for the validation team, or changes to the system design.

In the next section, we will discuss the process of risk assessment and risk management in more detail.

### Section: 19.1 Auditing Planning:

Auditing planning is a crucial step in the system auditing process. It involves defining the scope of the audit, identifying the objectives and goals, and determining the methodology and tools to be used. This section will discuss the various aspects of auditing planning, including its importance, methodologies, and best practices.

#### 19.1a Auditing Strategy

The auditing strategy is a critical component of auditing planning. It outlines the approach and methodology to be used in the audit. The strategy should be aligned with the objectives and goals of the audit and should be flexible enough to adapt to any changes in the system or environment.

There are several published strategic approaches to auditing, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. These include the approaches of Burk and Horton, Orna, Quinn, and Worlock. Each of these approaches offers a unique perspective and methodology for auditing.

Burk and Horton's InfoMap methodology, developed in 1988, was one of the first IA methodologies designed for widespread use. It involves a 4-stage process: discovery, mapping, evaluation, and implementation. This bottom-up approach, while effective in inventorying all information resources (IR), may not provide a holistic view of the organisation and the steps are not always explicit.

Orna, on the other hand, offers a top-down approach that emphasises the importance of organisational analysis. This approach is particularly useful in identifying the relationships between various components of the system and mapping them to one another. However, it may not provide a clear path for the development of a corporate information strategy.

Quinn and Worlock both combine elements of Gillman and Henderson's methods to identify the purpose of existing IR and to position them within the organisation. Quinn's approach, however, also considers solutions outside of the current organisational structure, making it a more comprehensive approach.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the various auditing methodologies and their applications in space systems engineering.

#### 19.1b Audit Scheduling

Audit scheduling is a critical aspect of auditing planning. It involves determining the timeline for the audit, including the start and end dates, as well as the specific dates for each phase of the audit. This is important to ensure that the audit is conducted in a timely manner and does not disrupt the normal operations of the system.

The audit schedule should be aligned with the objectives and goals of the audit. For example, if the audit is aimed at identifying and addressing potential issues and risks, the schedule should be flexible enough to accommodate any changes that may arise during the audit.

There are several factors to consider when scheduling an audit. These include the size and complexity of the system, the availability of resources, and any potential constraints or limitations. It is also important to consider the impact of the audit on the system and its users.

One common approach to audit scheduling is the Critical Path Method (CPM), which involves identifying the critical path (the sequence of tasks that must be completed on time for the project to be completed on time) and then scheduling the tasks along this path. This ensures that the audit is completed in a timely manner without delaying other tasks or projects.

Another approach is the Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT), which involves breaking down the audit into smaller tasks and then scheduling these tasks based on their estimated duration. This allows for more flexibility in the schedule, as tasks can be completed in any order as long as they are completed within their estimated timeframe.

In the next section, we will discuss the role of auditing in system auditing and how it can help identify and address potential issues and risks.

#### 19.1c Audit Documentation

Audit documentation is a crucial aspect of auditing planning. It involves creating a detailed record of the audit, including the objectives, scope, methodology, and findings. This documentation serves as a reference for future audits and can also be used to communicate the results of the audit to stakeholders.

The audit documentation should be comprehensive and detailed, providing a clear and concise overview of the audit. It should include a description of the system being audited, the objectives of the audit, the methodology used, and the findings and recommendations. The documentation should also include any relevant diagrams, charts, or other visual aids to help illustrate the findings.

One common approach to audit documentation is the Information Audit (IA) methodology. This methodology, first published by Riley in 1976, involves conducting a cost-benefit analysis to determine the effectiveness of the system. It also involves identifying the relationships between various components of the system and mapping them to one another. This approach has been further developed by scholars such as Henderson, Gillman, Quinn, and Worlock, each offering a unique perspective and methodology for auditing.

Another approach to audit documentation is the use of software tools, such as the Audit Management System (AMS) developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). This system provides a standardized approach to auditing, including the creation and management of audit documentation.

In the next section, we will discuss the role of auditing in system auditing and how it can help identify and address potential issues and risks.

#### 19.1d Audit Reporting

Audit reporting is a critical step in the auditing process. It involves communicating the findings of the audit to stakeholders, including management, auditors, and other relevant parties. The report should be clear, concise, and comprehensive, providing a detailed overview of the audit and its results.

The audit report should include a summary of the objectives of the audit, the scope of the audit, and the methodology used. It should also provide a detailed description of the system being audited, including its components, processes, and functions. The report should also include a section on the findings of the audit, including any issues or risks identified, as well as recommendations for improvement.

One common approach to audit reporting is the use of a standardized format, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 19011:2018 standard. This standard provides a framework for conducting management system audits, including the preparation of audit reports. It also includes guidelines for the selection and training of auditors, as well as the conduct of audits.

Another approach to audit reporting is the use of software tools, such as the Audit Management System (AMS) developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). This system provides a standardized approach to auditing, including the creation and management of audit reports.

In the next section, we will discuss the role of auditing in system auditing and how it can help identify and address potential issues and risks.

#### 19.1e Audit Follow-up

Audit follow-up is a crucial step in the auditing process. It involves reviewing the recommendations made in the audit report and ensuring that they have been implemented. This step is important to ensure that the audit has been effective in identifying and addressing potential issues and risks.

The audit follow-up process should begin with a review of the audit report to ensure that all recommendations have been properly documented. This may involve conducting a second review of the system to verify that the recommendations have been implemented. It may also involve interviewing key stakeholders to confirm their understanding and implementation of the recommendations.

If any recommendations have not been implemented, the audit follow-up process should include a discussion with management to understand the reasons for non-implementation and to develop a plan for addressing any remaining issues. This may involve additional audits or other measures to ensure that the system is operating effectively.

The audit follow-up process should also include a review of the audit process itself. This may involve evaluating the effectiveness of the audit methodology, the selection and training of auditors, and the preparation and management of the audit report. This review can help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of future audits.

In the next section, we will discuss the role of auditing in system auditing and how it can help identify and address potential issues and risks.

#### 19.1f Audit Improvement

Audit improvement is a continuous process that aims to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of audits. It involves reviewing and refining the audit process, methodology, and tools to ensure that they are meeting the needs of the organization and achieving the desired outcomes.

The audit improvement process should begin with a review of the audit process itself. This may involve evaluating the effectiveness of the audit methodology, the selection and training of auditors, and the preparation and management of the audit report. This review can help to identify areas for improvement and develop a plan for addressing any issues.

One approach to audit improvement is the use of software tools, such as the Audit Management System (AMS) developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). This system provides a standardized approach to auditing, including the selection and training of auditors, the conduct of audits, and the management of audit reports. It also includes features for tracking and managing audit findings, recommendations, and follow-up activities.

Another approach to audit improvement is the use of best practices and benchmarking. This involves studying the practices of other organizations and adopting those that are deemed to be effective and efficient. It may also involve conducting a gap analysis to identify areas where the organization's audit process falls short of best practices and developing a plan for closing these gaps.

The audit improvement process should also involve a review of the audit objectives and scope. This may involve updating the audit objectives to reflect changes in the organization's goals and priorities, and reviewing the scope to ensure that it is still relevant and appropriate.

Finally, the audit improvement process should include a review of the audit findings and recommendations.
