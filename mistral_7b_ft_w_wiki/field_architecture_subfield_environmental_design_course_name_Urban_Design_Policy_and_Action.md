#### The 10 Melbourne Principles

The "Melbourne Principles" for Sustainable Cities are ten short statements on how cities can become more sustainable. They were developed in Melbourne (Australia) on 2 April 2002 during an international Charrette, sponsored by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives. Experts at the Charrette were drawn from developing and developed countries.

The Melbourne Principles were adopted at the Local Government Session of the Earth Summit 2002 in Johannesburg, as part of the final communique, known as Local Action 21 or the Johannesburg Call. They consist of ten short statements on how cities can become more sustainable. Each principle has a few paragraphs of elaboration that provides additional information on its meaning and application. The Principles are designed to be read by decision-makers, and provide a starting point on the journey towards sustainability. Additional tools will be needed to operationalize the Melbourne Principles.

#### The 10 Melbourne Principles

1. Provide a long-term vision for cities based on: sustainability; intergenerational, social, economic and political equity; and their individuality.

"A long-term vision is the starting point for catalysing positive change, leading to sustainability. The vision needs to reflect the distinctive nature and characteristics of each city. The vision should also express the shared aspirations of the people for their cities to become more sustainable. It needs to address equity, which means equal access to both natural and human resources, as well as shared responsibility for preserving the value of these resources for future generations. A vision based on sustainability will help align and motivate communities, governments, businesses and others around a common purpose, and will provide a basis for developing a strategy, an action programme and processes to achieve that vision."

2. Achieve long-term economic vitality.

"Economic vitality is a key component of sustainability. It ensures that cities have the resources to meet their needs and to invest in their future. Economic vitality is achieved by creating a diverse and resilient economy, promoting innovation and entrepreneurship, and ensuring equitable access to economic opportunities."

3. Foster social cohesion and equity.

"Social cohesion and equity are essential for sustainable cities. They ensure that all members of the community have equal access to opportunities and resources, and that they are able to participate in decision-making processes. Social cohesion and equity are achieved by promoting inclusivity, diversity, and respect for human rights."

4. Ensure effective governance and accountability.

"Effective governance and accountability are crucial for sustainable cities. They ensure that decisions are made in a transparent and accountable manner, and that resources are managed efficiently. Effective governance and accountability are achieved by promoting transparency, accountability, and citizen participation."
