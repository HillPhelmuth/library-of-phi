# Transport

### Means of transport

#### Animals

Animals used in transportation include pack animals and riding animals.

#### Vehicles

A vehicle is a non-living device that is used to move people and goods. Unlike the infrastructure, the vehicle moves along with the cargo and riders. Unless being pulled/pushed by a cable or muscle-power, the vehicle must provide its own propulsion; this is most commonly done through a steam engine, combustion engine, electric motor, jet engine, or rocket, though other means of propulsion also exist. Vehicles also need a system of converting the energy into movement; this is most commonly done through wheels, propellers, and pressure.

Vehicles are most commonly staffed by a driver. However, some systems, such as people movers and some rapid transits, are fully automated. For passenger transport, the vehicle must have a compartment, seat, or platform for the passengers. Simple vehicles, such as automobiles, bicycles, or simple aircraft, may have one of the passengers as a driver. Recently, the progress related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution has brought a lot of new emerging technologies for transportation and automotive fields such as Connected Vehicles and Autonomous Driving. These innovations are said to form future mobility, but concerns remain on safety and cybersecurity, particularly concerning connected and autonomous mobility. 

### Operation

Private transport is only subject to the owner of the vehicle, who operates the vehicle themselves. For public transport and freight transport, operations are done through private enterprise or by governments. The infrastructure and vehicles may be owned and operated by the same company, or they may be operated by different entities. Traditionally, many countries have had a national airline and national railway. Since the 1980s, many of these have been privatized. International shipping remains a highly competitive industry with little regulation, but ports can be public-owned.

The final stage of the policy analysis framework involves implementing the chosen policy option. This stage involves developing a detailed plan for implementing the policy, including identifying resources and stakeholders involved. It also involves monitoring and evaluating the policy's implementation to ensure its effectiveness and make any necessary adjustments.

#### 2.1a.2 Policy Analysis Approaches

There are various approaches to policy analysis, each with its own strengths and limitations. The analysis-centric approach focuses on individual problems and their solutions, while the policy process approach considers political processes and stakeholders. The meta-policy approach takes a broader perspective, examining the role of policy analysis itself in the policy process.

The analysis-centric approach is often used in technical fields, such as transportation planning, where the focus is on finding the most efficient and effective solution to a problem. This approach is particularly useful in the context of sustainable transportation planning, where technical solutions are often necessary to address complex issues.

The policy process approach, on the other hand, takes a more political perspective, considering the interests and goals of stakeholders in the policy process. This approach is crucial for understanding the political dynamics surrounding transportation policies and for identifying potential barriers to policy implementation.

The meta-policy approach takes a step back and examines the role of policy analysis itself in the policy process. This approach is useful for understanding the limitations and biases of policy analysis and for improving the overall policy analysis process.

#### 2.1a.3 Policy Analysis Tools

To aid in the policy analysis process, various tools and techniques have been developed. These tools can help policymakers evaluate the potential impacts of policies and make informed decisions. Some common policy analysis tools include cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, and sensitivity analysis.

Cost-benefit analysis is a technique used to evaluate the potential costs and benefits of a policy. It involves assigning a monetary value to the benefits and costs of a policy and comparing them to determine the overall net benefit.

Cost-effectiveness analysis, on the other hand, focuses on the relationship between costs and outcomes. It is often used when the outcomes of a policy are difficult to quantify in monetary terms.

Sensitivity analysis is a technique used to assess the robustness of a policy analysis. It involves testing the sensitivity of the analysis to changes in key assumptions and parameters.

It involves the use of mathematical models and statistical techniques to analyze data and make predictions about future trends. This approach is particularly useful in transportation planning as it allows planners to test different scenarios and policies, and to evaluate their potential impacts on the transportation system.

One of the key techniques used in quantitative analysis is the use of mathematical models. These models are used to represent the complex interactions between different components of the transportation system, such as traffic flow, travel behavior, and land use. By inputting data about the current state of the system, planners can use these models to predict how the system will respond to different changes or policies.

Another important aspect of quantitative analysis is the use of statistical techniques. These techniques are used to analyze data and to identify patterns and trends. They can also be used to test hypotheses and to make predictions about future behavior. For example, regression analysis can be used to predict the relationship between travel behavior and various factors, such as income, land use, and transportation policies.

However, quantitative analysis also has its limitations. One of the main challenges is the accuracy of the data. The effectiveness of quantitative analysis heavily relies on the quality and reliability of the data used. Incomplete or inaccurate data can lead to misleading results and predictions. Therefore, it is crucial for planners to ensure that the data used in quantitative analysis is accurate and reliable.

Another limitation of quantitative analysis is the complexity of the transportation system. Transportation systems are complex and dynamic, with many interacting components and factors that can influence their behavior. This complexity can make it difficult to accurately model and predict the system's behavior. Therefore, it is important for planners to continuously monitor and update their models as new data becomes available.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the various quantitative analysis techniques used in transportation planning, including their applications and limitations. We will also discuss how these techniques can be used in conjunction with other methods, such as qualitative analysis, to provide a comprehensive understanding of transportation systems.

#### Parking Pricing Strategies at MIT

MIT currently employs a combination of parking pricing strategies to manage parking demand. These include daily parking fees, monthly parking permits, and a pay-by-phone system.

Daily parking fees are charged for short-term parking at MIT. These fees are designed to discourage long-term parking and encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation. The daily parking fees are also used to cover the costs of maintaining and operating the parking facilities.

Monthly parking permits are available for those who require long-term parking at MIT. These permits are priced higher than daily parking fees to discourage long-term parking and encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation.

In addition to these strategies, MIT also employs a pay-by-phone system for parking. This system allows drivers to pay for parking using their smartphones, making it more convenient and efficient.

#### Impact of Parking Pricing on the Community

The current parking pricing strategies at MIT have had a significant impact on the community. By charging daily parking fees, MIT is able to manage parking demand and ensure that parking spaces are available for those who require long-term parking. This has also helped to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality.

The pay-by-phone system has also been well-received by the community. It allows for more convenient and efficient parking, reducing the time and effort required for drivers to find and pay for parking.

However, some members of the community have expressed concerns about the cost of monthly parking permits. They argue that these permits are too expensive and discourage the use of alternative modes of transportation. MIT is currently exploring ways to address these concerns and make parking more affordable for the community.

#### Future Parking Pricing Strategies

As MIT continues to grow and evolve, it is important to consider the future of parking pricing strategies. One potential strategy is to implement a dynamic pricing system, where parking fees are adjusted based on demand. This could help to manage parking demand more effectively and encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation.

Another strategy is to explore the use of technology, such as smart parking sensors, to optimize parking usage. This could help to reduce the need for additional parking facilities and make parking more efficient for the community.

In conclusion, parking pricing is a crucial aspect of sustainable transportation planning at MIT. By employing a combination of parking pricing strategies, MIT is able to manage parking demand and encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation. As the community continues to grow and evolve, it is important to consider the future of parking pricing strategies and how they can be optimized for a more sustainable and efficient transportation system.





### Subsection: 5.3b Analysis of Pricing Strategy

The pricing strategy employed by MIT is a crucial aspect of their sustainable transportation planning. By implementing a combination of daily parking fees, monthly parking permits, and a pay-by-phone system, MIT is able to manage parking demand and encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation.

#### Market Equilibrium Computation

The pricing strategy at MIT can be further analyzed using the concept of market equilibrium. Market equilibrium is the point at which the quantity demanded by consumers is equal to the quantity supplied by producers. In the case of parking at MIT, the market equilibrium can be calculated using the algorithm presented by Gao, Peysakhovich, and Kroer for online computation of market equilibrium.

#### Triple Bottom Line Cost-Benefit Analysis

The pricing strategy at MIT can also be evaluated using a triple bottom line cost-benefit analysis (TBL-CBA). TBL-CBA takes into account not only the financial costs and benefits, but also the social and environmental impacts of a project. By considering the TBL-CBA, MIT can ensure that their pricing strategy is not only profitable, but also sustainable and beneficial to the community.

#### Price Discrimination

One aspect of the pricing strategy at MIT that may be of concern is the potential for price discrimination. Price discrimination is the practice of charging different prices to different customers for the same product. In the case of MIT, this could potentially mean charging different prices for parking based on factors such as age or time of day. While price discrimination can be a profitable strategy, it must be carefully considered to ensure that it is not harming any particular group or causing unfair pricing.

#### Price Leadership

Another aspect of the pricing strategy at MIT is the potential for price leadership. Price leadership is a form of price discrimination where one company sets a price for a product and other companies follow suit. In the case of MIT, this could potentially mean that other institutions or businesses in the area may follow their pricing strategy for parking. While this can be a beneficial strategy for MIT, it must also be carefully considered to ensure that it is not harming competition or causing unfair pricing.

In conclusion, the pricing strategy at MIT is a complex and important aspect of their sustainable transportation planning. By considering market equilibrium, TBL-CBA, price discrimination, and price leadership, MIT can ensure that their pricing strategy is not only profitable, but also sustainable and fair to all members of the community. 





### Subsection: 5.3c Future Pricing Strategies

As MIT continues to evolve and adapt to the changing needs of its community, it is important to consider future pricing strategies that can further enhance the sustainability of transportation planning. In this subsection, we will explore some potential future pricing strategies that MIT can implement.

#### Dynamic Pricing

One potential future pricing strategy is dynamic pricing. Dynamic pricing involves adjusting the price of a product or service in response to changes in demand or market conditions. In the context of parking at MIT, dynamic pricing could involve adjusting the price of parking based on factors such as time of day, weather conditions, or special events. This could help to better manage parking demand and encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation during peak times.

#### Carbon Pricing

Another potential future pricing strategy is carbon pricing. Carbon pricing is a mechanism for putting a price on the carbon emissions associated with transportation. This could involve implementing a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system, where companies are required to pay for their carbon emissions or purchase emission credits. By incorporating carbon pricing into the cost of parking, MIT can incentivize the use of more sustainable modes of transportation and reduce its carbon footprint.

#### Shared Mobility Pricing

With the rise of shared mobility services such as ride-hailing and bike-sharing, it is important for MIT to consider how these services can be integrated into its parking pricing strategy. One potential approach is to offer discounted parking rates for individuals who use shared mobility services, encouraging the use of these more sustainable modes of transportation. Additionally, MIT could also consider implementing a congestion pricing scheme, where drivers are charged for entering certain areas during peak times. This could help to reduce traffic congestion and encourage the use of shared mobility services.

#### Triple Bottom Line Pricing

As mentioned in the previous section, TBL-CBA takes into account not only the financial costs and benefits, but also the social and environmental impacts of a project. In the future, MIT could consider implementing a TBL-pricing strategy, where the price of parking is determined based on its triple bottom line impact. This could involve considering the environmental impact of parking, the social impact on the community, and the financial impact on MIT. By incorporating TBL-pricing, MIT can ensure that its parking strategy is not only financially sustainable, but also socially and environmentally sustainable.

In conclusion, as MIT continues to evolve and adapt to the changing needs of its community, it is important to consider future pricing strategies that can further enhance the sustainability of transportation planning. By implementing dynamic pricing, carbon pricing, shared mobility pricing, and TBL-pricing, MIT can continue to improve its parking system and promote sustainable transportation practices.

### Section: 6.1 Setting Transportation Goals for MIT:

#### 6.1a Importance of Goal Setting

Goal setting is a crucial aspect of sustainable transportation planning at MIT. It provides a clear direction and purpose for our efforts, and helps us to measure our progress and success. In this section, we will discuss the importance of goal setting in the context of sustainable transportation planning at MIT.

#### 6.1b Goal Setting in Workplaces

In the business world, goal setting is a popular approach to align efforts, communicate objectives, and improve motivation and task performance. It encourages participants to put in substantial effort over and above a "do your best" condition. Furthermore, because every member has defined expectations for their role, little room is left for inadequate, marginal effort to go unnoticed (Locke & Latham, 1990).

#### 6.1c Employee Motivation

The more employees are motivated, the more they are stimulated and interested in accepting goals. These success factors are interdependent. For example, the expected outcomes of goals are positively influenced when employees are involved in the goal setting process. Not only does participation increase commitment in attaining the goals that are set, participation influences self-efficacy as well. Additionally, feedback is necessary to monitor one's progress. When feedback is not presented, an employee might think they are not making enough progress. This can reduce self-efficacy and thereby harm the performance outcomes in the long run (Latham & Baldes, 1975).

#### 6.1d Workplace Training

Goal setting is used to improve training outcomes. For example, Tomokazu Kishiki and colleagues performed a randomized controlled trial on surgical trainees to determine whether or not their participation in a goal-setting program would improve performance and testing scores; the addition of achievable goals appeared to be beneficial to the trainees (Kishiki et al., 2006). When goal setting is applied optimally during training processes, both employee motivation and organizational commitment can increase.

#### 6.1e Work-Life Balance

Goal setting is also used by some companies with a stated aim of ensuring that employee work life balance is maintained. The idea behind this is to ensure that employees are not overworked and that they have enough time for their personal lives. This can be achieved by setting realistic and achievable goals that do not require excessive overtime or work outside of normal working hours.

In the next section, we will discuss the specific goals and questions that are unique to MIT, taking into account the institution's unique characteristics and challenges.

#### 6.1b Techniques for Setting Goals

Setting transportation goals for MIT requires a systematic approach that involves several steps. Here are some techniques that can be used to set effective transportation goals:

##### 6.1b.1 SMART Goals

The SMART goal setting framework is a popular approach to setting goals. SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This framework provides a structured way to set clear and achievable goals. 

- **Specific**: The goal should be clear and specific, avoiding vague or ambiguous language. For example, instead of saying "reduce traffic congestion," a specific goal could be "reduce traffic congestion on Massachusetts Avenue by 20% by the end of 2025."

- **Measurable**: The goal should have measurable outcomes. This allows for the monitoring and evaluation of progress. For example, the goal of reducing traffic congestion on Massachusetts Avenue by 20% can be measured by tracking the average travel time on this road.

- **Achievable**: The goal should be realistic and attainable. It should challenge employees without being unattainable. For example, a goal of reducing traffic congestion by 20% may be achievable, but a goal of reducing it by 50% may not be.

- **Relevant**: The goal should be relevant to the organization's mission and strategic objectives. For example, a goal of reducing traffic congestion aligns with MIT's commitment to sustainability and reducing its environmental impact.

- **Time-bound**: The goal should have a specific deadline or timeframe. This creates a sense of urgency and motivates employees to take action. For example, the goal of reducing traffic congestion on Massachusetts Avenue by 20% by the end of 2025 provides a clear timeframe for achieving the goal.

##### 6.1b.2 Goal Cascading

Goal cascading is a technique that involves setting a top-level goal and then breaking it down into smaller, more manageable goals at lower levels. This approach helps to ensure that all goals are aligned and contribute to the overall strategic objectives. For example, the top-level goal of reducing traffic congestion could be broken down into smaller goals such as improving public transportation options, promoting alternative modes of transportation, and implementing traffic management strategies.

##### 6.1b.3 Goal Participation

Involving employees in the goal setting process can increase their commitment and motivation to achieve the goals. This can be achieved through participatory goal setting, where employees are involved in setting their own goals and are given the opportunity to provide input and feedback. This not only increases their ownership of the goals but also helps to ensure that the goals are achievable and relevant.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the key questions that need to be answered when setting transportation goals for MIT.

#### 6.1c Case Studies of Goal Setting

In this section, we will explore some case studies that illustrate the application of goal setting techniques in the context of sustainable transportation planning at MIT. These case studies will provide practical examples of how the SMART goal setting framework, goal cascading, and goal participation can be used to set and achieve transportation goals.

##### 6.1c.1 Case Study 1: Reducing Traffic Congestion on Massachusetts Avenue

As mentioned in the previous section, one of the key transportation goals at MIT is to reduce traffic congestion on Massachusetts Avenue. This goal was set using the SMART goal setting framework. It is specific (reduce traffic congestion on Massachusetts Avenue), measurable (by tracking the average travel time on this road), achievable (through various transportation strategies), relevant (aligns with MIT's commitment to sustainability), and time-bound (by the end of 2025).

To achieve this goal, MIT has implemented a goal cascading approach. The top-level goal of reducing traffic congestion has been broken down into smaller, more manageable goals such as improving public transportation options, promoting alternative modes of transportation, and implementing traffic management strategies. These smaller goals have been assigned to different departments within MIT, ensuring that all efforts are aligned towards achieving the overall goal.

Goal participation has also been a key aspect of this goal setting process. Employees from various departments have been involved in setting their own goals and providing input and feedback. This has increased their ownership of the goals and their commitment to achieving them.

##### 6.1c.2 Case Study 2: Increasing the Use of Alternative Modes of Transportation

Another key transportation goal at MIT is to increase the use of alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit, biking, and walking. This goal was set using the SMART goal setting framework. It is specific (increase the use of alternative modes of transportation), measurable (by tracking the percentage of trips made using alternative modes), achievable (through various transportation strategies), relevant (aligns with MIT's commitment to sustainability), and time-bound (by the end of 2025).

To achieve this goal, MIT has implemented a goal cascading approach. The top-level goal of increasing the use of alternative modes of transportation has been broken down into smaller, more manageable goals such as improving public transit options, promoting biking and walking, and implementing policies to encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation. These smaller goals have been assigned to different departments within MIT, ensuring that all efforts are aligned towards achieving the overall goal.

Goal participation has also been a key aspect of this goal setting process. Employees from various departments have been involved in setting their own goals and providing input and feedback. This has increased their ownership of the goals and their commitment to achieving them.

These case studies illustrate the practical application of goal setting techniques in the context of sustainable transportation planning at MIT. They demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques in setting and achieving transportation goals.

# Agreements on objectives

## The goal setting process

The goal setting process is usually very complex and vary from company to company in practice. This can be derived the following key points:

### Vertex 1

Agreements on objectives are arranged once a year, usually taken at the beginning of the business year. Clearly defined goals have to be formulated and agreed. The whole goal setting process requires that the employees understand the objectives and accept them. In general, for reasons of clarity and feasibility, no more than six goals are agreed. Often three to five business-related field goals are connected to a personal development goal (soft aim).
S.M.A.R.T. goals should continue to be formulated.
They should be:

Specific = Detailed description of the desired state (and easily understandable)

Measurable = Specification of criteria by which success can be verified (qualitative, quantitative)

Attractive = Active influenced and accessible. The goals take place in the area of responsibility of the employee and are not in elementary dependence on external, non-configurable criteria.

Relevant = Realistic in terms of corporate goals

Terminated = Specifying the target date of achieving completes the objective conditions.

### Vertex 2

During the second or third quarter, often a milestone meeting is held, at which a short feedback is given about the current level of achievement.

### Vertex 3

At the end of the agreed period the target outcome conversation occurs, in which the achievement of goals, set by an actual-theoretical comparison, is found.

### Vertex 4

The final goal statement takes place in the first quarter after the expiration of the agreed target period.

### Vertex 5

For the target assessment, various methods may be used. An effective tool is the balanced scorecard. Important in achieving objectives control is that it is transparent to the employee and is perceived as fair.
 # Social loafing

#### Set goals

Groups that set clear, challenging goals for themselves tend to outperform groups that do not set goals or set unchallenging goals. This is because goals provide a clear direction for the group's efforts and help to motivate members to work together towards a common objective. Additionally, when goals are set collaboratively, group members are more likely to be committed to them and to put in their best effort.

#### Involvement in Goal Setting

Involvement in goal setting is crucial for the success of any group. When group members are involved in the goal setting process, they are more likely to understand and accept the goals, leading to increased motivation and commitment. This is especially important in the context of sustainable transportation planning, where the goals may be complex and involve multiple stakeholders.

#### Feedback and Monitoring

Feedback and monitoring are essential for tracking progress and making necessary adjustments to the goals. This can be achieved through regular check-ins and evaluations, as well as through the use of tools such as the balanced scorecard. It is important for the feedback to be transparent and perceived as fair, in order to maintain motivation and commitment.

#### Challenging Goals

Challenging goals are crucial for pushing group members to perform at their best. However, it is important to ensure that the goals are achievable and realistic. Unachievable goals can lead to frustration and demotivation, while achievable goals can provide a sense of accomplishment and motivation for further progress.

#### Personal Development Goals

In addition to business-related goals, it is important for groups to also set personal development goals. These goals may focus on improving skills, knowledge, or personal growth. By setting personal development goals, group members can work towards their own individual growth while also contributing to the overall goals of the group.

#### SMART Goals

SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound) are a useful framework for setting effective goals. By ensuring that goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound, group members can have a clear understanding of what is expected of them and can work towards a common objective.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, goal setting is a crucial aspect of sustainable transportation planning at MIT. By setting clear, challenging, and achievable goals, and involving group members in the goal setting process, we can create a sense of direction and motivation for our efforts. Regular feedback and monitoring, as well as personal development goals, can also contribute to the success of our goals. By following these guidelines, we can effectively plan and implement sustainable transportation solutions at MIT.

#### 10.2b Assessing Transit Equity

Transit equity is a critical aspect of public transportation planning. It refers to the fair distribution of transportation services and benefits among all members of the community, regardless of their income, race, or other social or economic characteristics. In this section, we will discuss the methods for assessing transit equity and the key findings from such analyses.

##### Methods for Assessing Transit Equity

There are several methods for assessing transit equity. One common method is to use the Equity Index, which is a tool developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to measure the equity of transportation investments. The Equity Index takes into account several factors, including the location of transportation services, the quality of these services, and the needs and characteristics of the community.

Another method is to use the Transit Equity Audit (TEA), which is a systematic approach to evaluating the equity of public transportation services. The TEA involves a comprehensive review of the distribution of transportation services, the quality of these services, and the impact of these services on different communities.

#### 10.3a Measuring Service Quality

Measuring the quality of public transit services is a crucial step in understanding and improving the current use of public transit. This section will discuss the various methods and tools used to measure service quality and reliability.

##### The SERVQUAL Measurement

The SERVQUAL (Service Quality) measurement is a customer experience approach used to measure the customer's perception of the service. The dimensions of SERVQUAL are designed to measure the customer experience in both explicit and implicit measures. The dimensions are:

1. Reliability: The ability of the service to perform the promised service dependably and accurately.
2. Responsiveness: The willingness of the service to help customers and provide prompt service.
3. Assurance: The knowledge and courtesy of employees and their ability to convey trust and confidence.
4. Empathy: The service's ability to anticipate and fulfill customers' needs.
5. Tangibles: The appearance of physical facilities, equipment, and personnel.

The SERVQUAL measurement is a valuable tool for measuring service quality, but it has also been the subject of a debate about whether customer service should be measured in absolute terms or relative to expectations. Some argue that if high levels on all SERVQUAL dimensions are provided then the service is high quality. Others argue that ultimately the service result is judged by the customer relative to the customer's expectations and not by the service provider. If customer expectations are low, even low levels on SERVQUAL dimensions provides high quality.

##### Quality Management Approaches

Quality management practices for services have much in common with manufacturing, despite the fact that the product is intangible. The following approaches are widely used for quality improvement in both manufacturing and services:

1. Total Quality Management (TQM): A management approach to long-term success through customer satisfaction. TQM is based on the participation of all members of an organization in improving processes, products, services, and the culture in which they work.
2. Six Sigma: A set of techniques and tools for process improvement. It seeks to improve the quality of the output of a process by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes.
3. Lean: A systematic method for waste minimization within a manufacturing system without sacrificing productivity.

In addition to these approaches, there are two unique aspects of quality management in service operations.

##### Service Recovery

For manufactured products, quality problems are handled through warranties, returns, and repair after the product is delivered. In high contact services, there is no time to fix quality problems later; they must be handled immediately. This is known as service recovery, and it is a crucial aspect of maintaining customer satisfaction and loyalty.

##### Quality Improvement in Service Operations

Quality improvement in service operations involves not only improving the quality of the service but also the customer's perception of the service. This requires a focus on both the tangible aspects of the service (e.g., physical facilities, equipment, and personnel) and the intangible aspects (e.g., customer experience, employee behavior, and organizational culture). By using tools like SERVQUAL and quality management approaches like TQM, Six Sigma, and Lean, service providers can continuously improve the quality of their services and enhance the customer experience.

#### 10.3b Improving Service Reliability

Improving service reliability is a critical aspect of enhancing the quality of public transit services. Reliability refers to the ability of the service to perform the promised service dependably and accurately. In the context of public transit, this means ensuring that services are available when and where they are expected to be, and that they operate in a manner that is consistent with the promised service level.

##### The Role of Technology in Improving Service Reliability

Technology plays a crucial role in improving service reliability. With the advent of advanced technologies such as Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Advanced Public Transportation Systems (APTS), public transit services can be managed and monitored in real-time, allowing for timely and effective response to service disruptions.

ITS and APTS can provide real-time information about the location and status of vehicles, enabling transit agencies to make informed decisions about service operations. For instance, if a vehicle breaks down, the transit agency can quickly dispatch a replacement vehicle or re-route other vehicles to maintain service levels. Similarly, if there is heavy traffic or other delays, the transit agency can adjust service schedules to minimize disruptions.

##### The Role of Quality Management Approaches in Improving Service Reliability

Quality management approaches, such as Total Quality Management (TQM), Six Sigma, and Lean, can also contribute to improving service reliability. These approaches emphasize the importance of continuous improvement and the elimination of defects and variability in service processes.

TQM, for instance, encourages the participation of all members of an organization in improving processes, products, services, and the culture in which they work. This can help to identify and address the root causes of service disruptions, thereby improving service reliability.

Six Sigma, on the other hand, focuses on minimizing variability in service processes. By reducing variability, the likelihood of service disruptions can be reduced, thereby improving service reliability.

Lean, finally, emphasizes the elimination of waste in service processes. Waste can include unnecessary delays, rework, and other inefficiencies that can contribute to service disruptions. By eliminating waste, service reliability can be improved.

##### The Role of Service Recovery in Improving Service Reliability

Service recovery plays a crucial role in maintaining customer satisfaction and loyalty, even in the face of service disruptions. As mentioned earlier, service recovery involves handling quality problems immediately, rather than waiting until after the service is delivered.

In the context of public transit, service recovery can involve providing alternative transportation options, such as buses or taxis, when a train or bus is delayed or cancelled. It can also involve providing timely and accurate information about service disruptions, to help customers make informed decisions about their travel plans.

In conclusion, improving service reliability is a complex task that requires a combination of technology, quality management approaches, and service recovery strategies. By implementing these strategies, public transit agencies can enhance the quality of their services and improve customer satisfaction.

The goals and objectives of the transportation planning process also play a crucial role in choosing a transportation model. These goals and objectives may include reducing traffic congestion, improving air quality, or promoting sustainable transportation options. The transportation model should be able to help achieve these goals and objectives.

#### Evaluating Different Models

Once the characteristics of the transportation system and the goals and objectives of the planning process have been understood, the next step is to evaluate different models. This involves comparing and contrasting the different models based on their strengths and weaknesses, as well as their ability to meet the specific needs and goals of the transportation system.

#### Considering the Parking Price Structure

The parking price structure is another important factor to consider when choosing a transportation model. The parking price structure refers to the cost of parking in a particular area. It can have a significant impact on the transportation system, as it can influence the mode of transportation people choose and the volume of traffic on the roads.

#### Implementing the Model

After choosing a transportation model, it is important to consider how it will be implemented. This includes determining the resources and technology needed to run the model, as well as the potential challenges and limitations that may arise during the implementation process.

In conclusion, choosing the right transportation model is a complex and important step in the transportation planning process. It requires a thorough understanding of the transportation system, the goals and objectives of the planning process, and the potential challenges and limitations of the model. By carefully considering these factors, transportation planners can choose a model that best meets the needs of their transportation system and helps achieve their goals and objectives.





### Subsection: 11.1c Applying the Model

Once a transportation model has been chosen, it is important to understand how to apply it effectively. This involves understanding the model's assumptions, limitations, and how to interpret its results.

#### Understanding the Model's Assumptions

Each transportation model is based on a set of assumptions about the transportation system and its behavior. These assumptions may include the mode of transportation, the volume of traffic, and the patterns of travel. It is important to understand these assumptions and how they may impact the model's results.

#### Interpreting the Model's Results

The results of a transportation model can provide valuable insights into the transportation system. However, it is important to understand how to interpret these results. This may involve understanding the model's output variables, such as traffic flow or travel time, and how they relate to the goals and objectives of the planning process.

#### Using the Model to Make Decisions

The ultimate goal of a transportation model is to inform decision-making. By applying the model to different scenarios, planners can evaluate the potential impacts of different transportation policies and make informed decisions. This may involve using the model to simulate the effects of new infrastructure, changes in mode of transportation, or changes in the parking price structure.

#### Continuously Updating and Improving the Model

Transportation systems are constantly evolving, and it is important to continuously update and improve the transportation model. This may involve incorporating new data, adjusting the model's assumptions, or implementing new techniques. By continuously updating and improving the model, planners can ensure that it remains relevant and effective in addressing the transportation system's needs and goals.





### Subsection: 11.2a Overview of Pricing Models

Parking pricing models are an essential tool in transportation planning, as they help determine the optimal price for parking spaces in a given area. These models take into account various factors such as demand, supply, and market equilibrium to determine the most efficient price for parking.

#### Market Equilibrium Computation

One of the key components of parking pricing models is the computation of market equilibrium. This involves finding the point at which the supply of parking spaces equals the demand for them. Recently, Gao, Peysakhovich, and Kroer presented an algorithm for online computation of market equilibrium, which allows for real-time adjustments to parking prices based on changing demand.

#### Retail Price Index

Another important factor in parking pricing models is the Retail Price Index (RPI). This index takes into account changes in the cost of living and is used to adjust parking prices accordingly. Variations of the RPI, such as the RPIX, RPIY, and RPIJ, are also used in some models to account for specific factors such as mortgage interest payments and indirect taxes.

#### Challenges in Glass Recycling Optimization

While parking pricing models are crucial in transportation planning, there are also challenges in optimizing glass recycling. These challenges include the high cost of recycling and the difficulty in predicting demand for recycled glass. As a result, many models do not include glass recycling as a factor in their calculations.

#### Split Payment

Another aspect to consider in parking pricing models is the concept of split payment. This refers to the practice of splitting the cost of parking between the driver and the point of sale (POS) system. Many POS systems implement split payment, which can impact the overall cost of parking and therefore affect the demand for parking spaces.

#### Adaptive Internet Protocol

The Adaptive Internet Protocol (AIP) is a relatively new concept that is being explored in parking pricing models. AIP allows for real-time adjustments to parking prices based on changing demand, similar to the online computation of market equilibrium. However, there are also disadvantages to using AIP, such as the expense for the necessary licenses.

#### Merton's Portfolio Problem

Merton's portfolio problem is a classic problem in finance that has been extended to parking pricing models. This problem involves finding the optimal allocation of resources between different options, and has been applied to parking pricing models to determine the most efficient use of parking spaces.

#### Internet-Speed Development

The overall data model for parking pricing models is complex and involves multiple concepts and relations. This data model, as shown in Figure 7, is crucial in understanding the various factors that influence parking prices and demand.

#### Fair Deal

The concept of a "Fair Deal" has been explored in parking pricing models, with the goal of finding a balance between the interests of drivers and parking space owners. This involves considering factors such as market equilibrium and the cost of living, as well as potential solutions such as split payment and the use of AIP.

#### Further Reading

For more information on parking pricing models and their applications, readers are encouraged to explore the works of Harry S. Fair, as well as other publications on the topic. Additionally, the use of AIP is being further explored in the field of transportation planning, and readers can stay updated on its developments through publications and conferences.

As mentioned earlier, the market equilibrium computation is a crucial component of parking pricing models. This involves finding the point at which the supply of parking spaces equals the demand for them. By analyzing the current pricing structure, we can determine if this equilibrium is being achieved.

Another important factor to consider is the Retail Price Index (RPI). This index takes into account changes in the cost of living and is used to adjust parking prices accordingly. By analyzing the current pricing structure, we can determine if the RPI is being properly accounted for and if any adjustments need to be made.

#### Challenges in Glass Recycling Optimization

As mentioned earlier, there are challenges in optimizing glass recycling. These challenges include the high cost of recycling and the difficulty in predicting demand for recycled glass. By analyzing the current pricing structure, we can determine if these challenges are being adequately addressed and if any improvements can be made.
