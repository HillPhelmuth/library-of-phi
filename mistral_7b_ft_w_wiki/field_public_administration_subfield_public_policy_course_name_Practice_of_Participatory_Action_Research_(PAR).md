## Foreward

Welcome to the "Practice of Participatory Action Research (PAR) Textbook". This book is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of PAR, a powerful approach to research that emphasizes participation and action by those directly affected by the research. PAR is a collaborative and reflective process that seeks to understand the world by trying to change it. It is grounded in experience and social history, and it values collective inquiry and experimentation.

PAR is not a monolithic body of ideas and methods, but rather a pluralistic orientation to knowledge making and social change. It is a method that is deeply rooted in the principles of democracy, engagement with experience and history, and the growth of knowledge. These three aspects - participation, action, and research - are organically united in PAR, with action uniting with research through collective processes of self-investigation.

In this book, we will explore the various aspects of PAR, including its history, principles, and applications. We will also delve into the practical aspects of conducting PAR, including the challenges and opportunities that come with this approach. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of PAR, not just as a method, but as a way of thinking and being in the world.

PAR has been used in a variety of fields, including education, health, and social justice. It has been particularly effective in addressing issues of literacy, education, and youth. By involving those directly affected by the research in the process, PAR can provide a more nuanced and accurate understanding of these issues, and can lead to more effective solutions.

This book is intended for advanced undergraduate students at MIT, but it is also a valuable resource for anyone interested in PAR. We hope that it will serve as a guide and inspiration for your own PAR projects, and that it will contribute to your understanding of the world and your ability to make a positive difference in it.

Thank you for joining us on this journey into the world of PAR. We hope that you will find this book informative, challenging, and inspiring.
