# Title: Vision Science: Exploring Perception and Imaging":

## Foreward

Welcome to "Vision Science: Exploring Perception and Imaging"! In this book, we will delve into the fascinating world of vision science, exploring the complex processes that allow us to perceive and interpret the visual world around us.

As we embark on this journey, it is important to acknowledge the contributions of those who have paved the way before us. One such figure is David Marr, a pioneer in the field of vision science. Marr's work, particularly his multi-level theory of vision, has been instrumental in shaping our understanding of vision.

Marr's theory, as outlined in his book "Vision: A Computational Investigation into the Human Representation and Processing of Visual Information", proposes that vision occurs at three levels of analysis: the computational, algorithmic, and implementational levels. This theory has been further developed and expanded upon by many vision scientists, including Tomaso Poggio, who has used these levels of analysis to further characterize vision from a computational perspective.

At the computational level, Marr's theory addresses the high-level problems that the visual system must overcome. At the algorithmic level, it attempts to identify the strategy used to solve these problems. Finally, at the implementational level, it seeks to explain how these solutions are realized in neural circuitry.

Marr's theory also proposes a series of stages through which vision occurs, starting with the two-dimensional visual array on the retina and ending with a three-dimensional description of the world. This theory has been influential in shaping our understanding of vision, but it is not without its limitations. For instance, Marr's 2<frac|1|2>D sketch assumes that a depth map is constructed, and that this map is the basis of 3D shape perception. However, empirical evidence suggests that 3D shape perception occurs prior to the perception of depth, and that perceptual organizing constraints play a crucial role in the production of 3D shape percepts.

In this book, we will explore these and other aspects of vision science, delving into the intricacies of perception and imaging. We will also look at the latest advancements in the field, including the use of computational models to simulate and understand visual processes.

As we journey through the world of vision science, we hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of vision and its underlying processes. We invite you to join us on this exciting journey, as we explore the fascinating world of perception and imaging.

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we explored the fundamental concepts of vision science, including the principles of perception and imaging. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of surface reflectance, a crucial aspect of vision science that plays a significant role in how we perceive and interpret the world around us.

Surface reflectance refers to the amount and distribution of light that is reflected from a surface. It is a fundamental property of objects in our environment, influencing how we perceive their color, shape, and texture. Understanding surface reflectance is essential for a wide range of applications, from computer vision and robotics to color science and image processing.

In this chapter, we will explore the mathematical models that describe surface reflectance, including the Lambertian and non-Lambertian models. We will also discuss the role of surface reflectance in color perception and how it influences the appearance of objects under different lighting conditions. Furthermore, we will examine the techniques used to measure and model surface reflectance, such as spectrophotometry and the Kubelka-Munk model.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of surface reflectance and its importance in vision science. You will also be equipped with the knowledge to apply these concepts in practical applications, such as image processing and color science. So, let's embark on this journey to explore the fascinating world of surface reflectance.




### Subsection: 2.1 Lightness Perception

Lightness perception is a fundamental aspect of vision science that plays a crucial role in how we perceive and interpret the world around us. It is the perceived brightness of a color, which is influenced by the amount of light reflected from a surface. In this section, we will explore the concept of lightness perception, its mathematical models, and its role in color perception.

#### The Role of Lightness Perception in Color Perception

Lightness perception is a key component of color perception. The perceived lightness of a color is determined by the amount of light reflected from a surface. This reflected light is then processed by the photoreceptor cells in the retina, which transmit this information to the brain. The brain then interprets this information to determine the perceived lightness of the color.

The perceived lightness of a color is not directly proportional to the amount of light reflected from a surface. This is due to the non-linear nature of the photoreceptor cells in the retina. The photoreceptor cells are more sensitive to small changes in light intensity at low levels of illumination, and less sensitive at high levels of illumination. This non-linear response is known as the Weber-Fechner law, which states that the perceived brightness of a stimulus is proportional to the logarithm of its physical intensity.

#### Mathematical Models of Lightness Perception

There are several mathematical models that describe lightness perception. One of the most commonly used models is the CIECAM97s model, which is based on the CIE 1997 color space. This model takes into account the non-linear response of the photoreceptor cells, as well as the effects of surround and adaptation.

The CIECAM97s model uses a weighted addition of cone responses to calculate the perceived lightness of a color. This is represented by the equation:

$$
L = \sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i \cdot C_i
$$

where $L$ is the perceived lightness, $w_i$ is the weight of the $i$th cone response, and $C_i$ is the cone response of the $i$th cone. The weights $w_i$ are determined by the CIECAM97s model, and are based on the relative sensitivities of the three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina.

#### Improvements to the CIECAM97s Model

While the CIECAM97s model was successful in spurring and directing colorimetric research, it was found to have some limitations for practical applications. To address these limitations, Fairchild proposed several changes to the model, including allowing for linear interpolation of the surround factor $c$ and simplifying the $z$ term.

Hunt, Li, Juan, and Luo also proposed several improvements to the model, including lowering the value of $z$ slightly. This resulted in a more perceptually uniform color space, with better preservation of hue and saturation at low luminance levels.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, lightness perception plays a crucial role in color perception. The CIECAM97s model, with its subsequent improvements, provides a mathematical framework for understanding and predicting lightness perception. By understanding the role of lightness perception in color perception, we can better understand how we perceive and interpret the world around us.





### Subsection: 2.2a Simultaneous Contrast

Simultaneous contrast is a phenomenon in vision science where the perceived lightness of a color is influenced by the surrounding colors. This effect was first described by the 11th century physicist Ibn al-Haytham, who noted that spots of paint on a white background appeared almost black and conversely paler than their true color on black. This effect has been studied extensively since then, and it has been found that the size of the surrounding field, the separation between color and surround, similarity of chromaticity, luminance difference, and the structure of the surround all play a role in the degree of simultaneous contrast.

#### The Role of Simultaneous Contrast in Color Perception

Simultaneous contrast plays a crucial role in color perception. It is one of the mechanisms by which the perceived lightness of a color is determined. The surrounding colors can either enhance or reduce the perceived lightness of a color, depending on their similarity in hue and luminance. This effect is particularly noticeable when the surrounding colors are of similar hue but different luminance.

#### Mathematical Models of Simultaneous Contrast

There are several mathematical models that describe simultaneous contrast. One of the most commonly used models is the CIECAM97s model, which is based on the CIE 1997 color space. This model takes into account the effects of surround and adaptation, as well as the non-linear response of the photoreceptor cells.

The CIECAM97s model uses a weighted addition of cone responses to calculate the perceived lightness of a color. This is represented by the equation:

$$
L = \sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i \cdot C_i
$$

where $L$ is the perceived lightness, $w_i$ is the weight of the $i$th cone response, and $C_i$ is the cone response of the $i$th cone. The weights $w_i$ are determined by the surround and adaptation terms in the model.

#### Successive Contrast

Successive contrast is another phenomenon in vision science where the perception of currently viewed stimuli is modulated by previously viewed stimuli. This effect is particularly noticeable when the previously viewed stimuli are of similar hue and luminance to the currently viewed stimuli. The perceived lightness of the currently viewed stimuli can be either enhanced or reduced depending on the similarity of the stimuli.

The CIECAM97s model also takes into account the effects of successive contrast. The model includes terms that represent the adaptation of the photoreceptor cells to previously viewed stimuli. These terms are represented by the equations:

$$
A = \sum_{i=1}^{3} a_i \cdot C_i
$$

and

$$
B = \sum_{i=1}^{3} b_i \cdot C_i
$$

where $A$ and $B$ are the adaptation terms, $a_i$ and $b_i$ are the adaptation weights, and $C_i$ is the cone response of the $i$th cone. The adaptation weights $a_i$ and $b_i$ are determined by the surround and adaptation terms in the model.




### Subsection: 2.2b Luminance Constancy

Luminance constancy is another important aspect of vision science that is closely related to simultaneous contrast. It refers to the phenomenon where the perceived brightness of a color remains constant despite changes in the luminance of the surrounding colors. This effect is particularly noticeable when the surrounding colors are of similar hue but different luminance.

#### The Role of Luminance Constancy in Color Perception

Luminance constancy plays a crucial role in color perception. It is one of the mechanisms by which the perceived brightness of a color is determined. The surrounding colors can either enhance or reduce the perceived brightness of a color, depending on their similarity in hue and luminance. This effect is particularly noticeable when the surrounding colors are of similar hue but different luminance.

#### Mathematical Models of Luminance Constancy

There are several mathematical models that describe luminance constancy. One of the most commonly used models is the CIECAM97s model, which is based on the CIE 1997 color space. This model takes into account the effects of surround and adaptation, as well as the non-linear response of the photoreceptor cells.

The CIECAM97s model uses a weighted addition of cone responses to calculate the perceived brightness of a color. This is represented by the equation:

$$
L = \sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i \cdot C_i
$$

where $L$ is the perceived brightness, $w_i$ is the weight of the $i$th cone response, and $C_i$ is the cone response of the $i$th cone. The weights $w_i$ are determined by the surround and adaptation terms in the model.

#### Luminance Constancy and Simultaneous Contrast

Luminance constancy and simultaneous contrast are closely related. In fact, the phenomenon of simultaneous contrast can be seen as a manifestation of luminance constancy. When the surrounding colors are of similar hue but different luminance, the perceived brightness of the central color remains constant, despite changes in the luminance of the surrounding colors. This is due to the non-linear response of the photoreceptor cells, which leads to a decrease in the perceived brightness of the central color when the surrounding colors are brighter.

In conclusion, luminance constancy is an important aspect of vision science that is closely related to simultaneous contrast. It refers to the phenomenon where the perceived brightness of a color remains constant despite changes in the luminance of the surrounding colors. This effect is particularly noticeable when the surrounding colors are of similar hue but different luminance.

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we explored the fundamentals of vision science, focusing on the perception of light and color. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the world of vision science, specifically focusing on stereo. Stereo, or the perception of depth, is a crucial aspect of human vision. It allows us to perceive the world in three dimensions, providing a more realistic and immersive experience.

In this chapter, we will explore the mechanisms behind stereo perception, including the role of the brain and the visual system. We will also discuss the concept of stereo imaging, which is the process of creating images that appear three-dimensional. This is achieved through various techniques, such as the use of anaglyphs and 3D glasses.

We will also touch upon the applications of stereo in different fields, such as medicine, architecture, and entertainment. Stereo has revolutionized these industries, providing new ways of visualizing and interacting with the world.

As we delve deeper into the world of stereo, we will also touch upon the challenges and limitations of stereo perception and imaging. While stereo has greatly enhanced our understanding and experience of the world, there are still many unanswered questions and areas for improvement.

Join us as we explore the fascinating world of stereo, and discover the wonders of depth perception and imaging. 


## Chapter 3: Stereo:




### Section: 3.1 Binocular Vision

Binocular vision is a fundamental aspect of human vision that allows us to perceive depth and distance in the world around us. It is the process by which the brain combines the slightly different images received from each eye to create a single, three-dimensional image. This section will explore the mechanisms behind binocular vision and how it contributes to our perception of depth.

#### Subsection: 3.1a Binocular Vision Mechanisms

The human visual system is designed to process visual information from both eyes simultaneously. This is achieved through the use of specialized cells in the brain, known as binocular cells, which are responsible for processing the information received from both eyes. These cells are located in the primary visual cortex, which is responsible for processing visual information from the entire visual field.

The process of binocular vision begins with the eyes. Each eye receives a slightly different image of the same scene, due to the slight difference in the position of the eyes. This difference is known as the interocular distance, and it is crucial for the perception of depth. The brain then uses this difference to calculate the depth of the scene, allowing us to perceive objects as being at different distances from us.

One of the key mechanisms behind binocular vision is the process of stereopsis. Stereopsis is the ability to perceive depth from the slight differences in the images received from each eye. This is achieved through the use of binocular cells, which are sensitive to these differences. When the brain receives two slightly different images, it is able to combine them to create a single, three-dimensional image.

Another important mechanism behind binocular vision is the process of fusion. Fusion is the ability of the brain to combine the images received from each eye into a single image. This is achieved through the use of binocular cells, which are able to process the information from both eyes simultaneously. Fusion is crucial for binocular vision, as it allows us to perceive the world in three dimensions.

### Subsection: 3.1b Binocular Vision Disorders

Despite the complexity of the binocular vision system, there are several disorders that can affect its functioning. One such disorder is strabismus, which is a misalignment of the eyes. This can occur in one or both eyes, and can cause the eyes to point in different directions. Strabismus can lead to a loss of binocular vision, as the brain may suppress the image from one eye in order to avoid double vision.

Another disorder that can affect binocular vision is amblyopia, also known as lazy eye. Amblyopia occurs when one eye is unable to develop normal vision due to a problem with the visual system. This can be caused by strabismus, but can also be due to other factors such as cataracts or corneal abnormalities. Amblyopia can lead to a loss of binocular vision, as the brain may favor the other eye for processing visual information.

### Subsection: 3.1c Binocular Vision Training

In some cases, binocular vision disorders can be treated through vision therapy, also known as binocular vision training. This involves a series of exercises and activities designed to improve the functioning of the binocular vision system. These exercises can help to improve the alignment of the eyes, as well as the ability of the brain to process visual information from both eyes.

One type of binocular vision training is orthoptic exercises, which are designed to improve the near-point convergence of the eyes. This is particularly useful for patients with convergence insufficiency or decompensating exophoria, as it can help to reduce symptoms and improve the ability to fuse images from both eyes.

Another type of binocular vision training is perceptual learning, which involves training the brain to process visual information from both eyes more effectively. This can be achieved through various exercises and activities, and has been shown to be effective in improving stereoacuity in some patients.

In conclusion, binocular vision is a complex and crucial aspect of human vision. It allows us to perceive depth and distance in the world around us, and is essential for our daily functioning. However, there are several disorders that can affect binocular vision, and in some cases, vision therapy can be an effective treatment option.

### Section: 3.2 Depth Perception

Depth perception is a crucial aspect of human vision that allows us to perceive the distance and depth of objects in our environment. It is a complex process that involves the integration of information from both our visual and non-visual senses. In this section, we will explore the mechanisms behind depth perception and how it contributes to our perception of the world.

#### Subsection: 3.2a Depth Perception Mechanisms

The human visual system is designed to process visual information from both eyes simultaneously. This is achieved through the use of specialized cells in the brain, known as binocular cells, which are responsible for processing the information received from both eyes. These cells are located in the primary visual cortex, which is responsible for processing visual information from the entire visual field.

One of the key mechanisms behind depth perception is the process of stereopsis. Stereopsis is the ability to perceive depth from the slight differences in the images received from each eye. This is achieved through the use of binocular cells, which are sensitive to these differences. When the brain receives two slightly different images, it is able to combine them to create a single, three-dimensional image.

Another important mechanism behind depth perception is the process of fusion. Fusion is the ability of the brain to combine the images received from each eye into a single image. This is achieved through the use of binocular cells, which are able to process the information from both eyes and create a unified image. This allows us to perceive objects as being at different distances from us.

In addition to visual information, depth perception also relies on non-visual information, such as proprioception and vestibular information. Proprioception is the ability to perceive the position and movement of our own body in space. This information is crucial for depth perception, as it allows us to estimate the distance to objects by comparing our own body position to the position of the object. Vestibular information, on the other hand, comes from the inner ear and provides information about our head position and movement. This information is also used in depth perception, particularly in situations where visual information is limited, such as in low light or when objects are far away.

#### Subsection: 3.2b Depth Perception in Robotics and Computer Vision

Depth perception is a crucial aspect of robotics and computer vision, as it allows robots and computers to perceive and interact with their environment in a more natural and human-like way. In these fields, depth perception is often achieved using sensors such as RGBD cameras, which combine color and depth information to create a three-dimensional image.

One of the key challenges in depth perception for robotics and computer vision is dealing with occlusions, where objects are partially or completely hidden from view. This can be caused by objects being in front of or behind other objects, or by objects being in motion. To address this challenge, researchers have developed algorithms that use multiple sensors, such as cameras and lidar, to fuse information and create a more complete and accurate depth map.

Another challenge in depth perception for robotics and computer vision is dealing with dynamic scenes, where objects are constantly moving and changing. This requires the use of real-time depth estimation algorithms that can accurately track and update the depth of moving objects.

In conclusion, depth perception is a complex and crucial aspect of human vision and is essential for our perception of the world. It involves the integration of visual and non-visual information and is a key area of research in robotics and computer vision. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more sophisticated depth perception algorithms being developed for a wide range of applications.





### Section: 3.3 Stereoscopic Imaging

Stereoscopic imaging is a technique used to create and view three-dimensional images. It is based on the principle of stereopsis, which is the ability of the human visual system to perceive depth from the slight differences in the images received from each eye. In this section, we will explore the principles and applications of stereoscopic imaging.

#### Subsection: 3.3a Binocular Disparity

Binocular disparity is the difference in the position of an object as seen by the two eyes. This disparity is caused by the slight difference in the position of the eyes, which results in each eye receiving a slightly different image of the same object. This disparity is crucial for depth perception, as it allows the brain to combine the two images and create a three-dimensional perception of the object.

In stereoscopic imaging, binocular disparity is used to create the illusion of depth. By presenting two slightly different images to the left and right eyes, the brain is tricked into perceiving the images as being at different distances. This creates the illusion of depth, allowing the viewer to perceive the images as being three-dimensional.

Binocular disparity can be calculated using digital stereo images. The disparity of features between two stereo images is usually computed as a shift to the left of an image feature when viewed in the right image. For example, a single point that appears at the "x" coordinate "t" (measured in pixels) in the left image may be present at the "x" coordinate "t" − 3 in the right image. In this case, the disparity at that location in the right image would be 3 pixels.

However, stereo images may not always be correctly aligned to allow for quick disparity calculation. For example, the set of cameras may be slightly rotated off level. To address this issue, a process known as image rectification is used. This involves rotating both images to allow for disparities in only the horizontal direction, resulting in a more accurate disparity calculation.

#### Subsection: 3.3b Stereoscopic Displays

Stereoscopic displays are devices that allow for the viewing of three-dimensional images. These displays use various techniques to separate the left and right images, such as polarized filters, shutter glasses, or anaglyph glasses. By wearing the appropriate glasses, the viewer is able to see the left and right images separately, creating the illusion of depth.

One of the most common types of stereoscopic displays is the autostereoscopic display. These displays do not require the use of glasses, as they use multiple cameras and screens to create a three-dimensional image that can be viewed from different angles. However, autostereoscopic displays can exhibit vergence-accommodation conflict, which is the mismatch between the focal depth of the displayed image and the viewer's eye movements. This can cause discomfort or fatigue for the viewer.

In conclusion, stereoscopic imaging is a powerful technique for creating and viewing three-dimensional images. By understanding the principles of binocular disparity and using advanced algorithms, we can create realistic and immersive stereoscopic images. With the development of new technologies, stereoscopic displays are becoming more accessible and comfortable for viewers, making them an important tool in the field of vision science.





### Subsection: 3.3b Stereopsis and Vergence

Stereopsis and vergence are two fundamental concepts in stereoscopic imaging. Stereopsis refers to the ability of the human visual system to perceive depth from the slight differences in the images received from each eye. Vergence, on the other hand, refers to the ability of the eyes to align their optical axes to focus on a single point in space.

#### Subsection: 3.3b Stereopsis and Vergence

Stereopsis and vergence are closely related. Vergence is necessary for stereopsis, as it allows the eyes to align their optical axes and receive similar images of the same object. This alignment is crucial for the brain to combine the two images and create a three-dimensional perception of the object.

In stereoscopic imaging, vergence is manipulated to create the illusion of depth. By presenting two slightly different images to the left and right eyes, the brain is tricked into perceiving the images as being at different distances. This creates the illusion of depth, allowing the viewer to perceive the images as being three-dimensional.

Vergence can be controlled by adjusting the interocular distance, which is the distance between the two eyes. This can be achieved using various techniques, such as anaglyphs, polarized 3D, and autostereoscopic displays.

Anaglyphs, for example, use color filters to separate the left and right images. The left image is filtered with a red filter and the right image with a cyan filter. When viewed through corresponding red and cyan glasses, the images are separated and the brain perceives them as being at different distances, creating the illusion of depth.

Polarized 3D, on the other hand, uses polarizing filters to separate the left and right images. The left image is filtered with a horizontal polarizer and the right image with a vertical polarizer. When viewed through corresponding circular polarizers, the images are separated and the brain perceives them as being at different distances, creating the illusion of depth.

Autostereoscopic displays, such as lenticular and parallax barrier displays, use physical barriers to separate the left and right images. These displays do not require the viewer to wear special glasses, making them more accessible. However, they can exhibit vergence-accommodation conflict, which is the mismatch between the focal depth of the stereoscopic content and the viewer's vergence and accommodation. This can cause discomfort and fatigue in some viewers.

In conclusion, stereopsis and vergence are crucial for creating the illusion of depth in stereoscopic imaging. By manipulating vergence, we can create the illusion of depth and allow the viewer to perceive the images as being three-dimensional. However, it is important to consider the potential side effects of vergence-accommodation conflict in autostereoscopic displays.

So, let's dive in and explore the world of textural analysis and synthesis.




### Subsection: 4.1 Texture Perception

Texture perception is a fundamental aspect of visual perception, as it allows us to distinguish between different surfaces and objects in our environment. In this section, we will explore the mechanisms behind texture perception and how it is influenced by various factors.

#### The Role of Texture in Visual Perception

Texture plays a crucial role in visual perception, as it provides information about the surface properties of objects and surfaces in our environment. This information is essential for our perception of objects and surfaces, as it helps us to distinguish between different objects and surfaces. For example, the texture of a fruit can help us to identify it as an apple or an orange.

Texture is also important for our perception of depth and distance. Our brains use texture information to estimate the distance between objects and surfaces, which is crucial for our perception of depth and distance. This is known as texture depth cueing, and it is one of the mechanisms behind our perception of depth and distance.

#### Texture Perception and Ambiguous Images

Ambiguous images, such as those found in optical illusions, can also provide insights into the mechanisms behind texture perception. These images often contain multiple textures that can be perceived in different ways, leading to ambiguity in our perception of the image. For example, in the famous Ponzo illusion, the lines appear to be different lengths, even though they are actually the same length. This is due to the texture of the lines, which can be perceived as either parallel or converging, leading to a difference in perceived length.

#### Texture Perception and Gestalt Principles

The Gestalt principles, which describe how our brains perceive and organize visual information, also play a role in texture perception. These principles include the principles of proximity, similarity, and closure, which can influence how we perceive texture in an image. For example, the principle of proximity states that objects that are close together are likely to be grouped together, which can influence how we perceive texture in an image.

#### Texture Perception and Image Processing

Texture perception is also important in image processing, as it allows us to extract information about the surface properties of objects and surfaces from images. This information can then be used for various purposes, such as object recognition, segmentation, and synthesis. For example, texture analysis can be used to identify the presence of certain textures in an image, which can then be used for object recognition.

In conclusion, texture perception is a crucial aspect of visual perception, as it provides information about the surface properties of objects and surfaces in our environment. It is influenced by various factors, including the Gestalt principles and image processing techniques. By understanding the mechanisms behind texture perception, we can gain a deeper understanding of how our brains perceive and interpret the world around us.





### Subsection: 4.2 Texture Synthesis

Texture synthesis is a crucial aspect of vision science, as it allows us to create and manipulate textures in images. This is important for a variety of applications, including image editing, animation, and computer graphics. In this section, we will explore the different methods and techniques used for texture synthesis.

#### Texture Synthesis Techniques

There are several techniques for texture synthesis, each with its own advantages and limitations. One of the most commonly used techniques is texture mapping, which involves mapping a 2D texture onto a 3D surface. This is useful for creating realistic textures on 3D objects, such as in computer graphics.

Another technique is texture painting, which involves painting a texture onto a 2D image. This is useful for creating detailed textures, such as in digital art and animation. Texture painting can also be used for texture editing, where existing textures can be modified and enhanced.

#### Texture Synthesis and Image Manipulation

Texture synthesis is also closely related to image manipulation, as it allows for the creation and manipulation of textures in images. This is important for tasks such as image enhancement, restoration, and retouching. For example, texture synthesis can be used to fill in missing or damaged areas of an image, or to enhance the texture of an image for better visual quality.

#### Texture Synthesis and Computer Graphics

In computer graphics, texture synthesis is used to create realistic textures for 3D objects. This is important for creating lifelike and visually appealing scenes in computer-generated images. Texture synthesis is also used in video game development, where it is used to create textures for 3D objects and environments.

#### Texture Synthesis and Animation

Texture synthesis is also used in animation, particularly in the creation of animated textures. This involves creating a sequence of textures that appear to move smoothly over a surface. This is useful for creating realistic and lifelike animations, such as the movement of water or the fluttering of a flag.

#### Texture Synthesis and Image Retrieval

Texture synthesis is also used in content-based image retrieval, where it is used to compare the similarity of two images. This is achieved by computing a distance measure between the images, which can then be used to sort and rank images based on their similarity. This is useful for tasks such as image search and retrieval, where users can search for images based on their texture properties.

#### Texture Synthesis and Image Compression

Texture synthesis is also used in image compression, where it is used to reduce the size of images while maintaining their visual quality. This is achieved by synthesizing textures that are similar to the original texture, but with a lower resolution or bit depth. This is useful for applications such as video streaming and image storage, where large amounts of data need to be compressed for efficient transmission and storage.

#### Texture Synthesis and Image Restoration

Texture synthesis is also used in image restoration, where it is used to reconstruct damaged or incomplete images.

It is designed to be accessible to both students and researchers in the field, and to provide a solid foundation for further exploration and research. We hope that this chapter will inspire you to delve deeper into this exciting field and to contribute to our understanding of how we perceive and interact with the world around us.




### Subsection: 5.1 Specular Reflections

Specular reflections are a fundamental aspect of perception and imaging. They occur when light is reflected from a smooth surface in a direction that is determined by the angle of incidence. This phenomenon is governed by the laws of reflection, which state that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. This principle is the basis for many optical devices, such as mirrors and lenses, which are designed to manipulate light through specular reflections.

#### 5.1a Specular Reflections in Perception

In perception, specular reflections play a crucial role in our perception of objects and scenes. They are responsible for the bright, shiny appearance of smooth surfaces, which can significantly influence our perception of an object's size, shape, and distance. For example, a small object can appear larger if it is reflecting a lot of light, or if the light is coming from a direction that makes the object appear brighter than it actually is. Similarly, an object can appear closer if it is reflecting light towards us, or if the light is coming from a direction that makes the object appear more brightly lit than the background.

Specular reflections also play a key role in our perception of depth. When light is reflected from a smooth surface, it can create a specular highlight that appears as a bright spot on the surface. The size and shape of this highlight can provide important cues about the shape and orientation of the surface. For example, a smooth, curved surface will produce a small, round highlight, while a flat surface will produce a larger, more elongated highlight.

In addition to their role in perception, specular reflections also play a crucial role in imaging. They are responsible for the bright, shiny appearance of objects in images, which can significantly influence the visual quality of the image. In photography, for example, specular reflections can be used to create highlights that add depth and interest to the image. In computer graphics, specular reflections are used to create realistic images of objects and scenes.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the role of specularity in imaging, exploring how it influences the appearance of objects and scenes in images.

#### 5.1b Specular Reflections in Imaging

In the realm of imaging, specular reflections play a pivotal role in the creation of realistic images. They are responsible for the shiny, reflective appearance of objects in images, which can significantly enhance the visual quality of the image. In this section, we will explore the role of specular reflections in imaging, focusing on their impact on the appearance of objects and scenes in images.

##### Specular Highlights

As mentioned earlier, specular reflections can create bright spots on the surface of an object, known as specular highlights. These highlights can provide important cues about the shape and orientation of the surface, making them a crucial element in the perception of depth. In imaging, specular highlights can add depth and interest to an image, making it more visually engaging.

For example, consider a photograph of a shiny apple. The specular highlights on the apple's surface can create a sense of depth, making the apple appear more three-dimensional. Similarly, in computer graphics, specular highlights can be used to create realistic images of objects, adding a sense of depth and realism to the scene.

##### Specular Reflections and Lighting

Specular reflections also play a crucial role in the lighting of an image. The direction and intensity of specular reflections can significantly influence the appearance of an object in an image. For instance, if a light source is reflected towards the camera, it can create a bright, shiny appearance on the object, making it appear more illuminated. Conversely, if the light source is reflected away from the camera, it can create a darker, less illuminated appearance.

In photography, specular reflections can be used to create interesting lighting effects. For example, a photographer might use a specular reflection to create a highlight on a subject's face, adding a sense of drama and interest to the image.

In computer graphics, specular reflections are used to simulate the effects of lighting on objects. By calculating the direction and intensity of specular reflections, computer graphics software can create realistic images of objects under various lighting conditions.

##### Specular Reflections and Surface Appearance

Finally, specular reflections can significantly influence the appearance of a surface in an image. A smooth, shiny surface will produce a different set of specular reflections than a rough, matte surface. By manipulating the specular reflections, an artist can create different surface appearances, from smooth and shiny to rough and matte.

In photography, specular reflections can be used to create a sense of texture on a surface. For example, a photographer might use a specular reflection to create a sense of smoothness on a subject's skin, or a sense of roughness on a piece of fabric.

In computer graphics, specular reflections are used to create a variety of surface appearances. By adjusting the properties of the surface, such as its smoothness and shininess, an artist can create different surface appearances, from smooth and shiny to rough and matte.

In conclusion, specular reflections play a crucial role in imaging, influencing the appearance of objects and scenes in images. By understanding the principles of specular reflections, artists can create more realistic and visually engaging images.

#### 5.1c Specular Reflections in Vision Science

In the field of vision science, specular reflections play a crucial role in our perception of the world around us. They are responsible for the shiny, reflective appearance of objects, which can significantly influence our perception of depth and distance. In this section, we will explore the role of specular reflections in vision science, focusing on their impact on our perception of objects and scenes.

##### Specular Highlights and Depth Perception

As mentioned earlier, specular highlights can provide important cues about the shape and orientation of a surface, making them a crucial element in our perception of depth. In vision science, this is known as the depth cue of light and dark. The brighter the highlight, the closer the surface appears to be. This is because our brain interprets the brightness of the highlight as a measure of the distance to the surface. The darker the highlight, the further away the surface appears to be.

For example, consider a scene with a table and a ball. If the ball is placed on the table, the specular highlight on the ball will be brighter than the highlight on the table. This is because the ball is closer to the light source than the table, and therefore reflects more light. Our brain interprets this as the ball being closer to us than the table.

##### Specular Reflections and Lighting

Specular reflections also play a crucial role in our perception of lighting. The direction and intensity of specular reflections can significantly influence our perception of the brightness and darkness of a scene.

For instance, if a light source is reflected towards us, it can create a bright, shiny appearance on the surface, making it appear more illuminated. Conversely, if the light source is reflected away from us, it can create a darker, less illuminated appearance.

In vision science, this is known as the depth cue of lightness. The brighter the surface appears, the closer it appears to be. This is because our brain interprets the brightness of the surface as a measure of the distance to the light source. The darker the surface appears, the further away it appears to be.

##### Specular Reflections and Surface Appearance

Finally, specular reflections can significantly influence our perception of the appearance of a surface. A smooth, shiny surface will produce a different set of specular reflections than a rough, matte surface. By manipulating the specular reflections, we can create different surface appearances, from smooth and shiny to rough and matte.

For example, consider a scene with a smooth, shiny apple and a rough, matte orange. The specular reflections on the apple will be brighter and more concentrated than the reflections on the orange. This is because the apple has a smoother surface, which reflects light more uniformly. The orange, on the other hand, has a rougher surface, which reflects light in a more scattered manner. Our brain interprets this as the apple being smoother and shinier than the orange.

In conclusion, specular reflections play a crucial role in our perception of the world around us. They provide important cues about the depth, distance, and appearance of objects and scenes. Understanding the principles of specular reflections is therefore essential for understanding how we perceive the world.




### Subsection: 5.2 Glossy Surfaces

Glossy surfaces are another important aspect of perception and imaging. Unlike matte surfaces, which absorb light and have a diffuse reflection, glossy surfaces reflect light in a more focused manner. This results in a more specular reflection, but with some degree of scattering. This scattering can create a sense of depth and texture, making glossy surfaces appear more three-dimensional and realistic.

#### 5.2a Glossy Surfaces in Perception

In perception, glossy surfaces can create a sense of depth and texture. The scattering of light from a glossy surface can create a sense of depth, as the light is reflected in multiple directions. This can make the surface appear more three-dimensional. Additionally, the texture of the surface can be perceived through the scattering of light. This can be particularly important in the perception of objects in the real world, where many surfaces are glossy.

The perception of glossy surfaces can also be influenced by the angle of incidence of the light. As with matte surfaces, the angle of incidence can affect the perceived brightness and distance of the surface. However, with glossy surfaces, the angle of incidence can also affect the degree of specularity. A glossy surface can appear more or less specular depending on the angle of incidence.

#### 5.2b Glossy Surfaces in Imaging

In imaging, glossy surfaces can create a sense of depth and texture in images. The scattering of light from a glossy surface can create a sense of depth, as the light is reflected in multiple directions. This can make the surface appear more three-dimensional in images. Additionally, the texture of the surface can be perceived through the scattering of light. This can be particularly important in photography, where many surfaces are glossy.

The perception of glossy surfaces in imaging can also be influenced by the angle of incidence of the light. As with perception, the angle of incidence can affect the perceived brightness and distance of the surface. However, with imaging, the angle of incidence can also affect the degree of specularity. A glossy surface can appear more or less specular depending on the angle of incidence, which can be used to create different effects in images.

### Subsection: 5.2c Glossy Surfaces in Imaging

Additionally, the texture of the surface can be perceived through the scattering of light. This can be particularly important in photography, where many surfaces are glossy.

The perception of glossy surfaces in imaging can also be influenced by the angle of incidence of the light. As with perception, the angle of incidence can affect the perceived brightness and distance of the surface. However, with imaging, the angle of incidence can also affect the degree of specularity. A glossy surface can appear more or less specular depending on the angle of incidence, which can be used to create different effects in images.

In addition to their role in perception, glossy surfaces also play a crucial role in imaging. They can create a sense of depth and texture in images, making them appear more realistic. The scattering of light from glossy surfaces can also create interesting patterns and reflections, which can be used to create visually appealing images.




### Subsection: 5.3a BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function)

The Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) is a mathematical function that describes the distribution of reflected light from a surface. It is a fundamental concept in computer graphics and vision science, as it provides a mathematical model for how light is reflected from surfaces.

The BRDF is a function of two directions: the direction of the incoming light, denoted as $\omega_i$, and the direction of the reflected light, denoted as $\omega_r$. It is also a function of the surface properties, denoted as $\mathbf{x}$. The BRDF is defined as:

$$
f_r(\omega_i, \omega_r, \mathbf{x})
$$

The BRDF is a probability density function, meaning that it gives the probability of a photon being reflected in a particular direction. It is normalized such that the total probability of reflection is 1.

The BRDF is a crucial concept in computer graphics and vision science, as it provides a mathematical model for how light is reflected from surfaces. It is used in a variety of applications, including image-based rendering, shading models, and surface reconstruction.

#### 5.3a.1 Image-based Rendering

Image-based rendering is a technique used in computer graphics to generate realistic images. It involves using a set of images, or "textures", to represent the surface of an object. The BRDF is used in image-based rendering to determine how light is reflected from the surface of an object.

In image-based rendering, the BRDF is often approximated using a simplified model, such as the Lambertian BRDF or the Phong BRDF. These models are based on the assumption that the surface is diffuse or specular, respectively. However, more advanced models, such as the Cook-Torrance model, can provide more accurate results.

#### 5.3a.2 Shading Models

Shading models are used in computer graphics to determine the color of a surface. The BRDF is used in shading models to calculate the reflected light at a given point on a surface.

In shading models, the BRDF is often combined with other functions, such as the Spatially Varying Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (SVBRDF) or the Bidirectional Texture Function (BTF). These functions provide a more accurate representation of how light is reflected from surfaces, taking into account factors such as surface texture and non-local scattering effects.

#### 5.3a.3 Surface Reconstruction

Surface reconstruction is a technique used in computer vision to reconstruct the surface of an object from a set of images. The BRDF is used in surface reconstruction to estimate the surface properties of an object.

In surface reconstruction, the BRDF is often estimated from a set of images using techniques such as photometric stereo or shape from shading. These techniques use the BRDF to determine the surface properties of an object, such as its albedo or specularity.

In conclusion, the BRDF is a fundamental concept in computer graphics and vision science. It provides a mathematical model for how light is reflected from surfaces, and is used in a variety of applications, including image-based rendering, shading models, and surface reconstruction. Understanding the BRDF is crucial for anyone working in these fields.





### Subsection: 5.3b Specular Highlight Detection

Specular highlights are a crucial aspect of image-based rendering. They are the bright spots that appear on a surface when light is reflected in a particular direction. In this section, we will explore the concept of specular highlights and how they are detected in image-based rendering.

#### 5.3b.1 Specular Highlights

Specular highlights are a result of the law of reflection. When light is incident on a surface, it is reflected in a direction that is determined by the angle of incidence. If the surface is smooth and the incident light is not too oblique, the reflected light will be concentrated in a small region around the direction of reflection. This is known as a specular highlight.

In image-based rendering, specular highlights are often used to create a sense of realism. They can add depth and texture to a scene, and can even be used to create the illusion of three-dimensionality. However, detecting and rendering specular highlights can be a challenging task.

#### 5.3b.2 Specular Highlight Detection

The detection of specular highlights is a crucial step in image-based rendering. It involves identifying the regions of a surface where specular highlights are likely to occur. This is typically done by analyzing the local surface normals and the incident light direction.

One common approach to specular highlight detection is the use of the Phong shading model. This model assumes that the surface is specular, and that the reflected light is concentrated in a single direction. The Phong shading model can be used to calculate the specular component of the reflected light, which can then be used to identify the regions of the surface where specular highlights are likely to occur.

Another approach to specular highlight detection is the use of the Cook-Torrance model. This model is more complex than the Phong model, and it can provide more accurate results. However, it also requires more computational resources.

#### 5.3b.3 Specular Highlight Rendering

Once the specular highlights have been detected, they can be rendered in the image. This involves calculating the color and intensity of the specular highlight for each pixel. This can be done using the BRDF, which describes how light is reflected from the surface.

In image-based rendering, the BRDF is often approximated using a simplified model, such as the Lambertian BRDF or the Phong BRDF. These models are based on the assumption that the surface is diffuse or specular, respectively. However, more advanced models, such as the Cook-Torrance model, can provide more accurate results.

In conclusion, specular highlights are an important aspect of image-based rendering. They can add depth and texture to a scene, and can even be used to create the illusion of three-dimensionality. However, detecting and rendering specular highlights can be a challenging task. In the next section, we will explore another important aspect of image-based rendering: texture mapping.

### Section: 6.1 Image Formation

The process of image formation is a complex one, involving a series of steps that transform light into a digital image. This section will delve into the intricacies of this process, exploring the mathematical principles and computer algorithms that underpin it.

#### 6.1a Photographic Image Formation

Photographic image formation is a fundamental aspect of digital image construction. It involves the capture of an image by a camera, which is a device that records light onto photosensitive material. The process begins with the lens of the camera, which focuses light onto the photosensitive material, known as the film or sensor.

The light that is focused onto the film or sensor is a combination of light from all points in the scene that is being photographed. This light is modulated by the aperture of the lens, which controls the amount of light that reaches the film or sensor. The aperture also affects the depth of field of the image, with larger apertures resulting in shallower depth of field.

The photosensitive material in the camera, whether it is film or a digital sensor, responds to light by changing its electrical properties. This process is known as photoelectric effect. The amount of change in electrical properties is proportional to the amount of light that is incident on the material.

The image on the film or sensor is then developed, a process that involves the conversion of the latent image into a visible image. This is done by a chemical process that amplifies the changes in electrical properties caused by the photoelectric effect.

The developed image is then scanned, a process that involves the conversion of the image into a digital representation. This is done by a scanner, which reads the image on the film or sensor and converts it into a series of digital values.

The digital image is then processed, a process that involves the application of various algorithms to enhance the quality of the image. This can include processes such as noise reduction, image enhancement, and image restoration.

Finally, the processed image is stored, a process that involves the conversion of the digital image into a digital file. This can be done in various formats, such as JPEG, PNG, or TIFF.

In the next section, we will delve into the mathematical principles that underpin this process, exploring the equations and algorithms that are used to transform light into a digital image.

#### 6.1b Image Formation in Computer Graphics

In the realm of computer graphics, image formation is a complex process that involves the application of mathematical principles and computer algorithms. This process is used to create digital images that are realistic and visually appealing.

The process of image formation in computer graphics begins with the creation of a 3D model of the scene. This model is a mathematical representation of the objects in the scene, their positions, and their properties such as color and texture. The 3D model is then rendered, a process that involves the transformation of the 3D model into a 2D image.

The rendering process begins with the calculation of the color of each pixel in the image. This is done by tracing the path of light from each pixel to the objects in the scene. The color of the pixel is determined by the color of the objects that the light intersects.

The color of the objects in the scene is determined by their material properties. For example, a metal object might reflect light in a different way than a plastic object. These material properties are represented in the 3D model.

The light in the scene is also represented in the 3D model. This includes the direction of the light, its intensity, and its color. The light is then simulated, a process that involves the calculation of how the light interacts with the objects in the scene.

The final image is then created by combining the colors of the pixels. This can be done in various ways, such as by averaging the colors of the pixels, or by blending them.

The process of image formation in computer graphics is a complex one, involving a series of mathematical calculations and computer algorithms. However, the results can be stunningly realistic, making it a powerful tool for creating digital images.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical principles and computer algorithms that underpin the process of image formation in computer graphics.

#### 6.1c Image Formation in Imaging Systems

In imaging systems, image formation is a critical process that involves the transformation of a scene into a digital image. This process is governed by the principles of optics and mathematics, and it is implemented using computer algorithms.

The process of image formation in imaging systems begins with the capture of the scene by a sensor. This sensor could be a camera, a radar, or a sonar. The sensor captures the light (or other electromagnetic waves) that is reflected from the objects in the scene.

The captured light is then processed by the imaging system. This processing involves the conversion of the light into an electrical signal, the amplification of this signal, and the digitization of the signal. The digitized signal is then stored in a digital image.

The digital image is a mathematical representation of the scene. It is a two-dimensional array of pixels, each of which represents a small part of the scene. The color of each pixel is determined by the color of the light that was reflected from the corresponding part of the scene.

The process of image formation in imaging systems is a complex one, involving a series of mathematical calculations and computer algorithms. However, the results can be stunningly realistic, making it a powerful tool for capturing and analyzing the world around us.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical principles and computer algorithms that underpin the process of image formation in imaging systems.




### Section: 6.2 Image Reconstruction

Image reconstruction is a critical aspect of digital image construction. It involves the process of creating a complete image from incomplete or partial information. This can be achieved through various methods, including interpolation, extrapolation, and the use of mathematical models.

#### 6.2a Image Reconstruction Techniques

There are several techniques for image reconstruction, each with its own advantages and limitations. Some of the most common techniques include:

    $$
    y = a + bx
    $$

    where $y$ is the value of the missing pixel, $a$ is the value of the pixel above the missing pixel, $b$ is the value of the pixel to the left of the missing pixel, and $x$ is the distance from the missing pixel to the pixel above it.

2. **Quadratic Interpolation**: This algorithm is more complex than linear interpolation, but it can provide more accurate results. It involves estimating the values of the missing pixels by quadratically interpolating between the known pixels. The formula for quadratic interpolation is given by:

    $$
    y = a + bx + cx^2
    $$

    where $y$ is the value of the missing pixel, $a$ is the value of the pixel above the missing pixel, $b$ is the value of the pixel to the left of the missing pixel, and $c$ is the value of the pixel above and to the left of the missing pixel.

3. **Cubic Interpolation**: This is the most complex and accurate interpolation algorithm. It involves estimating the values of the missing pixels by cubically interpolating between the known pixels. The formula for cubic interpolation is given by:

    $$
    y = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3
    $$

    where $y$ is the value of the missing pixel, $a$ is the value of the pixel above the missing pixel, $b$ is the value of the pixel to the left of the missing pixel, $c$ is the value of the pixel above and to the left of the missing pixel, and $d$ is the value of the pixel above, to the left, and diagonally above the missing pixel.

4. **Inpainting Algorithm**: This algorithm involves filling in the missing parts of an image by copying the pixels from a nearby source region of the image. The algorithm works by finding the best match for the missing pixels in the source region and copying the pixels from there. This can be done manually using a clone tool, or automatically using exemplar-based image inpainting.

5. **Model-based Reconstruction Algorithm**: This algorithm involves using a mathematical model of the image to reconstruct it from incomplete or partial information. This can be done using various methods, such as Bayesian inference, variational inference, or differential equations.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into each of these algorithms, exploring their principles, applications, and limitations.

These imaging techniques produce incomplete or partial information about the internal structures of the body. Image reconstruction algorithms, such as backprojection and filtered backprojection, are used to reconstruct the images from the incomplete data.

2. **Remote Sensing**: In remote sensing, image reconstruction techniques are used to reconstruct images of the Earth's surface from satellite data. This is particularly useful in areas where ground-based measurements are difficult or impossible.

3. **Image Restoration**: Image reconstruction is also used in image restoration, where the goal is to recover an image from a degraded version. This can be due to noise, blurring, or other distortions. Image reconstruction algorithms, such as total variation minimization and Wiener filtering, are used to restore the image.

4. **Image Compression**: Image reconstruction is used in image compression, where the goal is to reduce the amount of data needed to represent an image while still preserving its essential features. This is achieved by discarding some of the image information and then using image reconstruction algorithms to reconstruct the image from the remaining information.

5. **Image Synthesis**: Image reconstruction is used in image synthesis, where the goal is to create an image from a set of features or constraints. This can be useful in tasks such as image inpainting, where the goal is to fill in missing parts of an image.

6. **Image Enhancement**: Image reconstruction is used in image enhancement, where the goal is to improve the quality of an image. This can be achieved by using image reconstruction algorithms to fill in missing or damaged parts of the image.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical principles behind image reconstruction and discuss some of the key challenges and future directions in this field.

### Subsection: 6.3b Image Deconvolution

Image deconvolution is a technique used to restore an image that has been degraded by a point spread function (PSF). The PSF is a function that describes the blurring effect of an imaging system. By convolving the original image with the PSF, an image can be degraded. Image deconvolution aims to reverse this process and recover the original image.

#### 6.3b Image Deconvolution Techniques

There are several techniques for image deconvolution, each with its own advantages and limitations. Some of the most common techniques include:

1. **Linear Least Squares Deconvolution**: This technique involves solving a linear least squares problem to recover the original image. The PSF is assumed to be known and the image is convolved with the PSF to create the degraded image. The original image is then estimated by solving the linear least squares problem.

2. **Non-Linear Least Squares Deconvolution**: This technique involves solving a non-linear least squares problem to recover the original image. The PSF is assumed to be known and the image is convolved with the PSF to create the degraded image. The original image is then estimated by solving the non-linear least squares problem.

3. **Bayesian Deconvolution**: This technique involves using Bayesian methods to estimate the original image. The PSF is assumed to be known and the image is convolved with the PSF to create the degraded image. The original image is then estimated by using Bayesian methods.

4. **Iterative Deconvolution**: This technique involves using an iterative algorithm to estimate the original image. The PSF is assumed to be known and the image is convolved with the PSF to create the degraded image. The original image is then estimated by using an iterative algorithm.

5. **Combination of Techniques**: In many cases, a combination of these techniques may be used to achieve the best results. For example, linear least squares deconvolution and non-linear least squares deconvolution can be used together to improve the accuracy of the deconvolution.

### Subsection: 6.3c Image Restoration

Image restoration is a technique used to recover an image that has been degraded by noise, blurring, or other distortions. This can be achieved through various methods, such as deblurring, denoising, and deblurring and denoising.

## Chapter 8: Chapter 8: Perceptual Organization

### Introduction

The human visual system is a complex and intricate system that allows us to perceive and interpret the world around us. One of the key aspects of this system is perceptual organization, which refers to the process by which we group and categorize visual information. This chapter will delve into the fascinating world of perceptual organization, exploring how we perceive and organize visual information, and the implications of this process for vision science.

Perceptual organization is a fundamental aspect of human perception. It is the process by which we group and categorize visual information, based on similarities and differences in shape, color, and other visual properties. This process is crucial for our perception of the world, as it allows us to make sense of the vast amount of visual information that we encounter every day.

In this chapter, we will explore the various theories and models of perceptual organization, including the Gestalt theory, the Bayesian theory, and the connectionist models. We will also discuss the role of perceptual organization in various visual tasks, such as object recognition, depth perception, and visual search.

We will also delve into the implications of perceptual organization for vision science. Perceptual organization plays a crucial role in many aspects of vision, including visual perception, visual attention, and visual memory. Understanding the mechanisms of perceptual organization can provide valuable insights into these aspects of vision.

This chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of perceptual organization, covering both theoretical and empirical aspects. It will also discuss the implications of perceptual organization for various fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.

### Section: 7.2 Shape Discrimination

Shape discrimination is a fundamental aspect of human perception. It refers to the ability to distinguish one shape from another. This ability is crucial for our perception of the world around us, as it allows us to identify and categorize objects.

#### 7.2a Shape Completion

Shape completion is a phenomenon in human perception where we perceive a shape as complete, even when it is only partially presented. This is particularly evident when the shape is closed, meaning that its contour forms a complete loop. When a shape is closed, we tend to perceive it as a complete object, even if only a part of it is presented.

The effect of shape completion on shape discrimination has been extensively studied. Research has shown that closed shapes are more easily discriminated than open shapes. This is because closed shapes provide a more complete and coherent visual stimulus, which is easier for the visual system to process. This effect is particularly pronounced when the shapes are small and complex, as in the case of two-dimensional shapes.

The phenomenon of shape completion can be explained in terms of the Bayesian framework for perception. According to this framework, perception is a process of Bayesian inference, where the visual system uses prior knowledge about the world to interpret the sensory input. In the case of shape completion, the prior knowledge is that shapes are typically closed, and this knowledge is used to complete the shape when only a part of it is presented.

The Bayesian framework also provides a mathematical model for shape completion. According to this model, the probability of perceiving a shape as closed is given by the Bayesian posterior probability, which is proportional to the product of the prior probability and the likelihood. The prior probability is the probability of a shape being closed, which is typically high for small and complex shapes. The likelihood is the probability of the sensory input given the shape, which is typically high when the shape is closed.

In conclusion, shape completion plays a crucial role in shape discrimination. It allows us to perceive shapes as complete objects, even when only a part of them is presented. This phenomenon can be explained and modeled in terms of the Bayesian framework for perception.

#### 7.2b Shape Discrimination in Different Domains

Shape discrimination is not limited to two-dimensional shapes. It also applies to three-dimensional shapes, as well as to shapes in other domains such as time and frequency. In these domains, the principles of shape discrimination are similar, but the specific mechanisms and processes may differ.

In the domain of three-dimensional shapes, shape discrimination is influenced by factors such as depth, distance, and perspective. For example, when presented with two three-dimensional shapes, we may have to consider not only their two-dimensional projections, but also their depth and distance. This can be particularly challenging when the shapes are viewed from an oblique angle, or when they are superimposed on each other.

In the domain of time, shape discrimination is influenced by factors such as duration, rhythm, and tempo. For example, when presented with two sequences of events, we may have to consider not only their individual events, but also their duration, rhythm, and tempo. This can be particularly challenging when the sequences are fast-paced, or when they contain many similar events.

In the domain of frequency, shape discrimination is influenced by factors such as bandwidth, modulation, and harmonicity. For example, when presented with two frequency spectra, we may have to consider not only their individual frequencies, but also their bandwidth, modulation, and harmonicity. This can be particularly challenging when the spectra are complex, or when they contain many similar frequencies.

The principles of shape discrimination in these domains can be understood in terms of the Bayesian framework for perception. According to this framework, shape discrimination is a process of Bayesian inference, where the visual system uses prior knowledge about the world to interpret the sensory input. In these domains, the prior knowledge is about the properties of three-dimensional shapes, time sequences, and frequency spectra, respectively.

The Bayesian framework also provides a mathematical model for shape discrimination in these domains. For example, in the domain of three-dimensional shapes, the probability of perceiving a shape as a certain three-dimensional shape is given by the Bayesian posterior probability, which is proportional to the product of the prior probability and the likelihood. The prior probability is the probability of a shape being a certain three-dimensional shape, which is typically high for familiar shapes. The likelihood is the probability of the sensory input given the shape, which is typically high when the shape is consistent with the sensory input.

Similarly, in the domain of time, the probability of perceiving a sequence as a certain time sequence is given by the Bayesian posterior probability, which is proportional to the product of the prior probability and the likelihood. The prior probability is the probability of a sequence being a certain time sequence, which is typically high for familiar sequences. The likelihood is the probability of the sensory input given the sequence, which is typically high when the sequence is consistent with the sensory input.

Finally, in the domain of frequency, the probability of perceiving a spectrum as a certain frequency spectrum is given by the Bayesian posterior probability, which is proportional to the product of the prior probability and the likelihood. The prior probability is the probability of a spectrum being a certain frequency spectrum, which is typically high for familiar spectra. The likelihood is the probability of the sensory input given the spectrum, which is typically high when the spectrum is consistent with the sensory input.

#### 7.2c Shape Discrimination in Different Tasks

Shape discrimination is not only influenced by the domain of perception, but also by the task at hand. Different tasks can require different strategies for shape discrimination, depending on the specific demands of the task.

In tasks that require rapid discrimination, such as in the study by Sagi and Julesz (1984), the task is to discriminate between two shapes as quickly as possible. This task requires a different strategy than tasks that allow for more deliberate discrimination. In rapid discrimination tasks, the visual system may rely more on low-level features, such as the number of edges or the orientation of edges, to make a quick decision. This is consistent with the findings of Sagi and Julesz, who found that participants were able to discriminate between two shapes based on their global structure, even when the shapes were presented for only 17 milliseconds.

In contrast, tasks that allow for more deliberate discrimination, such as in the study by Hershberger et al. (1997), may require a different strategy. In these tasks, the visual system may rely more on higher-level features, such as the overall shape or the arrangement of edges. This is consistent with the findings of Hershberger et al., who found that participants were able to discriminate between two shapes based on their local structure, even when the shapes were presented for only 17 milliseconds.

The strategy for shape discrimination can also be influenced by the context in which the shapes are presented. For example, in tasks that require discrimination between shapes in a cluttered scene, the visual system may need to use a different strategy than in tasks that present shapes in isolation. In cluttered scenes, the visual system may need to rely more on higher-level features, such as the overall shape or the arrangement of edges, to discriminate between shapes. This is because lower-level features, such as the number of edges or the orientation of edges, may be more difficult to extract from a cluttered scene.

In conclusion, shape discrimination is a complex process that is influenced by a variety of factors, including the domain of perception, the task at hand, and the context in which the shapes are presented. Understanding these factors can provide insights into the mechanisms and processes underlying shape discrimination.

## Chapter 8: The Role of Contour in Shape Recognition

### Introduction

The human visual system is an intricate and complex mechanism that allows us to perceive and interpret the world around us. One of the fundamental aspects of this system is the ability to recognize shapes. This chapter, "The Role of Contour in Shape Recognition," delves into the intriguing world of shape recognition, focusing on the crucial role of contour in this process.

Contour, in the context of vision science, refers to the boundary between two regions of different color, brightness, or texture. It is a fundamental element in shape perception, as it provides the outline of an object, delineating it from its background. The human visual system is particularly adept at detecting and interpreting contours, a skill that is essential for shape recognition.

In this chapter, we will explore the role of contour in shape recognition, examining how the human visual system processes and interprets contour information. We will also delve into the computational models that have been developed to simulate this process, providing a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying shape recognition.

We will also discuss the implications of this research for various fields, including computer vision, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science. Understanding the role of contour in shape recognition can inform the design of more effective and efficient algorithms for tasks such as object detection and recognition.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of contour in shape recognition, combining theoretical discussions with practical examples and case studies. It is designed to be accessible to both students and researchers in the field, providing a solid foundation for further exploration and research.

As we journey through the world of shape recognition, we will discover the intricate interplay between contour and shape, and how this interplay shapes our perception of the world around us.




#### 7.2b Contour Integration

Contour integration is another important aspect of shape discrimination. It refers to the process by which the visual system integrates the information along the contour of a shape. This process is crucial for the perception of shape, as it allows us to distinguish one shape from another.

The effect of contour integration on shape discrimination has been extensively studied. Research has shown that contour integration can enhance the discriminability of shapes, particularly when the shapes are small and complex. This is because contour integration can help to fill in the missing information when only a part of a shape is presented, thereby improving the coherence of the visual stimulus.

The phenomenon of contour integration can be explained in terms of the Bayesian framework for perception. According to this framework, the visual system uses prior knowledge about the world to interpret the sensory input. In the case of contour integration, the prior knowledge is that shapes typically have smooth and continuous contours. This knowledge is used to integrate the information along the contour when only a part of the shape is presented.

The Bayesian framework also provides a mathematical model for contour integration. According to this model, the probability of perceiving a shape as complete is given by the Bayesian posterior probability, which is proportional to the product of the prior probability and the likelihood. The prior probability is the probability of a shape having a smooth and continuous contour, which is typically high for small and complex shapes. The likelihood is the probability of the sensory input given the shape, which is typically high when the shape is presented in a coherent and complete manner.

In the next section, we will discuss the role of contour closure and contour integration in the rapid discrimination of two-dimensional shapes.

#### 7.2c Shape Discrimination in Different Tasks

Shape discrimination is not only important for perception but also plays a crucial role in various tasks. In this section, we will explore how shape discrimination is used in different tasks and how it is influenced by factors such as contour closure and contour integration.

##### Shape Discrimination in Object Recognition

Object recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision and human perception. It involves identifying and classifying objects based on their shape. Shape discrimination is a key component of this task, as it allows us to distinguish one object from another.

In the context of object recognition, contour closure and contour integration can significantly enhance shape discrimination. Contour closure, by completing the shape, can increase the discriminability of the object. Contour integration, by integrating the information along the contour, can improve the coherence of the shape and thereby enhance shape discrimination.

##### Shape Discrimination in Decision Making

Shape discrimination is also involved in decision making. In many decision-making tasks, we need to discriminate between different shapes to make a choice. For example, in a visual search task, we need to discriminate between a target shape and distractor shapes to locate the target.

In these tasks, the effect of contour closure and contour integration on shape discrimination can be particularly pronounced. Contour closure can help to complete the shape and thereby improve shape discrimination. Contour integration can enhance the discriminability of the shape by filling in the missing information.

##### Shape Discrimination in Learning

Shape discrimination is also important in learning. In many learning tasks, we need to discriminate between different shapes to learn new concepts. For example, in a categorization task, we need to discriminate between different categories based on their shape.

In these tasks, the effect of contour closure and contour integration on shape discrimination can be significant. Contour closure can help to complete the shape and thereby improve shape discrimination. Contour integration can enhance the discriminability of the shape by integrating the information along the contour.

In conclusion, shape discrimination plays a crucial role in various tasks, and its effectiveness can be significantly enhanced by factors such as contour closure and contour integration. Understanding these factors can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of perception and imaging.

The human visual system is a complex and intricate system that allows us to perceive and interpret the world around us. One of the fundamental aspects of this system is the perception of shapes. In this chapter, we will delve into the role of contour closure in the perception of two-dimensional shapes.

Contour closure, a concept that has been extensively studied in the field of vision science, refers to the phenomenon where a closed shape is perceived as a single entity, even when it is presented in a fragmented or incomplete manner. This is in contrast to open shapes, which are perceived as multiple separate entities. The concept of contour closure is crucial in understanding how we perceive and interpret two-dimensional shapes.

In this chapter, we will explore the various aspects of contour closure, including its psychological and physiological implications. We will also discuss the role of contour closure in the perception of different types of shapes, such as simple and complex shapes, and how it influences our perception of these shapes.

We will also delve into the computational models that have been developed to explain the phenomenon of contour closure. These models, which are based on principles of Bayesian inference and Bayesian decision theory, provide a mathematical framework for understanding how we perceive shapes.

Finally, we will discuss the implications of contour closure for imaging and perception. We will explore how the concept of contour closure can be used to improve imaging techniques, and how it can be used to enhance our understanding of perception.

In summary, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of contour closure in the perception of two-dimensional shapes. By the end of this chapter, readers should have a deeper understanding of how contour closure influences our perception of shapes, and how this knowledge can be applied in the field of vision science.




### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the effect of contour closure on the rapid discrimination of two-dimensional shapes. We have seen that contour closure plays a crucial role in shape perception and can greatly influence our ability to quickly discriminate between different shapes. This is due to the fact that contour closure can provide important information about the shape's boundaries and internal structure, which can aid in shape recognition.

We have also discussed the concept of shape constancy, which is the ability to perceive a shape as being the same even when its size or position changes. We have seen that contour closure can contribute to shape constancy by providing a stable frame of reference for the shape. This is because the closure of the contour can help to maintain the shape's boundaries and internal structure, even when the shape's size or position changes.

Furthermore, we have examined the role of contour closure in the perception of depth and distance. We have seen that contour closure can provide important cues for depth perception, as it can help to establish the relative distances between different parts of a shape. This is because the closure of the contour can create a sense of depth and distance, which can aid in the perception of the shape's three-dimensional structure.

Overall, the study of contour closure has provided valuable insights into the mechanisms of shape perception and discrimination. It has shown that contour closure can play a crucial role in our ability to quickly and accurately discriminate between different shapes, and can also contribute to shape constancy and depth perception.

## Chapter 8: Visual Perception and Imaging:




### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamental concepts of vision science, including perception and imaging. We have delved into the intricacies of how we perceive and interpret the world around us, and how imaging techniques allow us to capture and analyze visual information. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the concept of occlusion and its role in our perception of solid shape.

Occlusion is a fundamental concept in vision science, and it refers to the phenomenon where one object blocks our view of another. This can occur in both the real world and in images. In the real world, occlusion can be caused by physical objects, such as a hand blocking our view of a face. In images, occlusion can be caused by various factors, such as the position of the camera or the presence of other objects in the scene.

The concept of occlusion is closely related to the concept of depth. In fact, occlusion is often used as a cue for depth perception. When an object is occluded by another object, we perceive it as being closer to us. This is because our brain assumes that the occluding object is closer to us, and therefore, the occluded object must be even closer.

In this chapter, we will explore the various factors that influence our perception of occlusion and depth. We will also discuss how these factors can be manipulated to create illusions of depth and distance. Finally, we will examine how occlusion can be used in imaging techniques to extract information about the shape and structure of objects.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a deeper understanding of the role of occlusion in our perception of solid shape. You will also have a better understanding of how occlusion can be used in imaging techniques to extract valuable information about the world around us. So let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of occlusion and depth perception.




### Subsection: 8.1 Shape from Contours

The concept of shape from contours is a fundamental aspect of vision science, as it allows us to understand the three-dimensional structure of objects in our environment. In this section, we will explore the various methods and techniques used to extract shape information from contours, including the use of principal curvature-based region detectors.

#### 8.1a Contour Integration

Contour integration is a process by which we combine information from different parts of a contour to infer the shape of an object. This process is based on the assumption that the contour of an object is a closed curve, and that the shape of the object is determined by the properties of this curve.

One of the key properties of a contour is its curvature. The curvature of a contour at a given point is defined as the rate of change of the angle of the tangent to the contour at that point. This curvature can be represented as a function of the coordinates of the point on the contour, and can be used to extract information about the shape of the object.

The principal curvature-based region detector is a structure-based detector that uses the curvature of a contour to detect regions in an image. This detector operates in two steps: curvilinear structure detection and region detection.

In the first step, curvilinear structure detection, the detector generates a single response for both lines and edges, producing a clearer structural sketch of an image than is usually provided by the gradient magnitude image. This is achieved by using the Steger's algorithm, which calculates the principal curvature images. The principal curvature is adopted as the name of this detector, and is calculated using the Hessian matrix.

In the second step, region detection, the detector seeks characteristics and robustness in scale space. This is achieved by simulating the process of David Lowe's SIFT detector, and detecting principal curvilinear structure in scale space. Local maximum images of principal curvature values are used to define regions, and the traditional watershed algorithm is applied to acquire these regions.

Finally, the detector defines stable regions by cleaning the principal curvature images using morphological closing and eigenvector-flow guided hysteresis thresholding. This results in a set of regions that accurately represent the shape of the object.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of shape from contours in more detail, and discuss how it can be used to understand the three-dimensional structure of objects in our environment.

#### 8.1b Contour Completion

Contour completion is another important aspect of shape from contours. It involves the process of inferring the shape of an object beyond the visible contour. This is a challenging problem, as it requires the integration of information from both visible and invisible parts of the object.

One approach to contour completion is the use of implicit surface representations. These representations describe the surface of an object as the zero level set of a continuous function. The function is typically defined in terms of the properties of the object, such as its curvature or normal vector.

The implicit surface representation can be used to complete the contour of an object by extending the surface beyond the visible contour. This is achieved by solving the equation $f(x,y,z) = 0$ for $z$, where $f(x,y,z)$ is the implicit surface representation of the object. The solution to this equation represents the surface of the object beyond the visible contour.

Another approach to contour completion is the use of shape priors. These are assumptions about the shape of the object that are used to guide the completion process. For example, a common shape prior is the assumption that the object is smooth and continuous. This can be represented as a regularization term in the completion process, which penalizes solutions that deviate from this assumption.

In the context of the principal curvature-based region detector, contour completion can be achieved by extending the principal curvature images beyond the visible contour. This can be done by solving the equation $H(x,y) = 0$ for $y$, where $H(x,y)$ is the Hessian matrix of the image. The solution to this equation represents the principal curvature images beyond the visible contour, which can be used to define regions in the image.

In conclusion, contour completion is a crucial aspect of shape from contours, as it allows us to infer the shape of an object beyond the visible contour. This can be achieved using various methods, such as implicit surface representations and shape priors. The principal curvature-based region detector provides a powerful tool for contour completion, by extending the principal curvature images beyond the visible contour.

#### 8.1c Contour Interpretation

Contour interpretation is a critical step in the process of shape from contours. It involves the interpretation of the contour information to extract meaningful shape information about the object. This process is often challenging due to the inherent ambiguity in the contour information.

One approach to contour interpretation is the use of shape priors. As mentioned in the previous section, shape priors are assumptions about the shape of the object that are used to guide the interpretation process. These priors can be used to constrain the interpretation of the contour information, and to resolve ambiguities in the contour.

For example, consider a simple shape such as a circle. The contour of a circle is a closed curve, and the shape prior for a circle is that it is smooth and symmetric. This shape prior can be used to interpret the contour information. If the contour information is ambiguous, the shape prior can be used to guide the interpretation process, and to resolve the ambiguity.

Another approach to contour interpretation is the use of implicit surface representations. As mentioned in the previous section, these representations describe the surface of an object as the zero level set of a continuous function. The function is typically defined in terms of the properties of the object, such as its curvature or normal vector.

The implicit surface representation can be used to interpret the contour of an object by finding the surface of the object that passes through the contour. This can be achieved by solving the equation $f(x,y,z) = 0$ for $z$, where $f(x,y,z)$ is the implicit surface representation of the object. The solution to this equation represents the surface of the object that passes through the contour, which can be used to extract meaningful shape information about the object.

In the context of the principal curvature-based region detector, contour interpretation can be achieved by using the principal curvature images to interpret the contour information. The principal curvature images provide information about the curvature of the object at different points on the contour. This information can be used to interpret the contour information, and to extract meaningful shape information about the object.

In conclusion, contour interpretation is a crucial step in the process of shape from contours. It involves the interpretation of the contour information to extract meaningful shape information about the object. This process is often challenging due to the inherent ambiguity in the contour information. However, various approaches, such as shape priors and implicit surface representations, can be used to guide the interpretation process, and to resolve ambiguities in the contour.

#### 8.2a Shape from Shading

Shape from shading is a technique used in computer vision to estimate the 3D shape of an object from a single image. This technique is based on the assumption that the shading of an object is determined by the lighting conditions and the surface properties of the object. By analyzing the shading information, we can infer the shape of the object.

The basic idea behind shape from shading is to find the surface normal of the object at each point. The surface normal is a vector that points outward from the surface of the object. The shading of an object is determined by the dot product of the surface normal and the light vector. If the dot product is positive, the point is lit, and if the dot product is negative, the point is in shadow.

The shape from shading problem can be formulated as a minimization problem. The goal is to find the surface normal that minimizes the difference between the observed shading and the shading predicted by the surface normal. This can be written as:

$$
\min_{n} \sum_{i} (I_i - I_i(n))^2
$$

where $I_i$ is the observed shading at point $i$, and $I_i(n)$ is the shading predicted by the surface normal $n$.

There are several methods to solve this minimization problem. One of the most common methods is the gradient descent method. This method iteratively updates the surface normal to minimize the difference between the observed shading and the predicted shading.

Another approach to shape from shading is the use of implicit surface representations. As mentioned in the previous section, these representations describe the surface of an object as the zero level set of a continuous function. The function is typically defined in terms of the properties of the object, such as its curvature or normal vector.

The implicit surface representation can be used to interpret the shading information. By finding the surface of the object that passes through the shading information, we can extract meaningful shape information about the object. This can be achieved by solving the equation $f(x,y,z) = 0$ for $z$, where $f(x,y,z)$ is the implicit surface representation of the object. The solution to this equation represents the surface of the object that passes through the shading information.

In the next section, we will discuss another technique for shape estimation, called shape from texture.

#### 8.2b Shape from Texture

Shape from texture is another technique used in computer vision to estimate the 3D shape of an object from a single image. This technique is based on the assumption that the texture of an object is determined by the surface properties of the object. By analyzing the texture information, we can infer the shape of the object.

The basic idea behind shape from texture is to find the surface normal of the object at each point. The surface normal is a vector that points outward from the surface of the object. The texture of an object is determined by the distribution of colors on the surface of the object. By analyzing the distribution of colors, we can infer the surface normal and hence the shape of the object.

The shape from texture problem can be formulated as a minimization problem. The goal is to find the surface normal that minimizes the difference between the observed texture and the texture predicted by the surface normal. This can be written as:

$$
\min_{n} \sum_{i} (T_i - T_i(n))^2
$$

where $T_i$ is the observed texture at point $i$, and $T_i(n)$ is the texture predicted by the surface normal $n$.

There are several methods to solve this minimization problem. One of the most common methods is the gradient descent method. This method iteratively updates the surface normal to minimize the difference between the observed texture and the predicted texture.

Another approach to shape from texture is the use of implicit surface representations. As mentioned in the previous section, these representations describe the surface of an object as the zero level set of a continuous function. The function is typically defined in terms of the properties of the object, such as its curvature or normal vector.

The implicit surface representation can be used to interpret the texture information. By finding the surface of the object that passes through the texture information, we can extract meaningful shape information about the object. This can be achieved by solving the equation $f(x,y,z) = 0$ for $z$, where $f(x,y,z)$ is the implicit surface representation of the object. The solution to this equation represents the surface of the object that passes through the texture information.

#### 8.2c Shape from Silhouette

Shape from silhouette is a technique used in computer vision to estimate the 3D shape of an object from a single image. This technique is based on the assumption that the silhouette of an object is determined by the occlusion of the object. By analyzing the silhouette information, we can infer the shape of the object.

The basic idea behind shape from silhouette is to find the surface normal of the object at each point. The surface normal is a vector that points outward from the surface of the object. The silhouette of an object is determined by the occlusion of the object. By analyzing the occlusion information, we can infer the surface normal and hence the shape of the object.

The shape from silhouette problem can be formulated as a minimization problem. The goal is to find the surface normal that minimizes the difference between the observed silhouette and the silhouette predicted by the surface normal. This can be written as:

$$
\min_{n} \sum_{i} (S_i - S_i(n))^2
$$

where $S_i$ is the observed silhouette at point $i$, and $S_i(n)$ is the silhouette predicted by the surface normal $n$.

There are several methods to solve this minimization problem. One of the most common methods is the gradient descent method. This method iteratively updates the surface normal to minimize the difference between the observed silhouette and the predicted silhouette.

Another approach to shape from silhouette is the use of implicit surface representations. As mentioned in the previous section, these representations describe the surface of an object as the zero level set of a continuous function. The function is typically defined in terms of the properties of the object, such as its curvature or normal vector.

The implicit surface representation can be used to interpret the silhouette information. By finding the surface of the object that passes through the silhouette information, we can extract meaningful shape information about the object. This can be achieved by solving the equation $f(x,y,z) = 0$ for $z$, where $f(x,y,z)$ is the implicit surface representation of the object. The solution to this equation represents the surface of the object that passes through the silhouette information.

## Chapter: Chapter 9: Perception of Motion

### Introduction

The perception of motion is a fundamental aspect of human vision. It is the process by which we interpret and understand the movement of objects in our environment. This chapter, "Perception of Motion," delves into the intricacies of this fascinating topic, exploring how we perceive and interpret motion in our visual field.

The human visual system is a complex and sophisticated system, capable of processing a vast amount of information in real-time. One of the key aspects of this system is our ability to perceive and interpret motion. This ability is crucial for our survival and daily functioning, as it allows us to track and predict the movements of objects in our environment.

In this chapter, we will explore the various theories and models that attempt to explain how we perceive motion. We will delve into the role of the visual system in motion perception, and how it processes information about the movement of objects. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of motion perception, and how these can be overcome.

We will also explore the role of motion perception in various fields, such as computer vision and robotics. Understanding how we perceive motion can help us develop more effective and efficient algorithms for tasks such as object tracking and recognition.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the perception of motion, combining theoretical discussions with practical examples and applications.

### Subsection: 8.2 Occlusion and Depth Perception

Occlusion is a fundamental concept in vision science, as it provides a means to infer the depth and distance of objects in our environment. In this section, we will explore the role of occlusion in depth perception, and how it is influenced by various factors such as occluding contours and surface properties.

#### 8.2a Depth Ordering

Depth ordering is a crucial aspect of depth perception, as it allows us to determine the relative depth of objects in our environment. This is achieved by comparing the occluding contours of objects, with the assumption that objects closer to us will occlude objects further away.

The depth ordering process begins with the detection of occluding contours. These contours are defined as the boundaries between objects and the background, and they provide crucial information about the depth and distance of objects. The depth ordering process then involves comparing the occluding contours of different objects, with the assumption that objects closer to us will occlude objects further away.

The depth ordering process can be influenced by various factors, including the properties of the occluding contours and the surface properties of the objects. For example, the depth ordering process can be affected by the curvature of the occluding contours, with more curved contours indicating greater depth. Similarly, the depth ordering process can be influenced by the surface properties of objects, with rougher surfaces indicating greater depth.

In addition to these factors, the depth ordering process can also be influenced by the presence of texture on the surfaces of objects. Texture provides additional information about the depth and distance of objects, and can be used to refine the depth ordering process.

The depth ordering process is not always accurate, and can be influenced by various factors such as occlusion, texture, and surface properties. However, it provides a crucial means to infer the depth and distance of objects in our environment, and is a fundamental aspect of depth perception.

#### 8.2b Depth Perception Techniques

Depth perception techniques are methods used to estimate the depth and distance of objects in our environment. These techniques are crucial for our perception of the world, as they allow us to navigate and interact with our environment effectively. In this section, we will explore some of the most common depth perception techniques, including stereopsis, motion parallax, and depth from focus.

##### Stereopsis

Stereopsis is a depth perception technique that relies on the difference in the images received by each eye. This technique is based on the principle of parallax, which states that objects closer to us will appear to move more when viewed from different angles. In stereopsis, the brain combines the slightly different images received by each eye to create a three-dimensional image of the scene. This technique is particularly effective for objects that are close to us, but can also be used to estimate the depth of objects at greater distances.

##### Motion Parallax

Motion parallax is a depth perception technique that relies on the movement of the observer's head. This technique is based on the principle of parallax, similar to stereopsis. However, in motion parallax, the observer's head is moved, rather than the eyes. This technique is particularly effective for estimating the depth of objects that are far away, as the movement of the head allows for a larger difference in the images received by each eye.

##### Depth from Focus

Depth from focus is a depth perception technique that relies on the focus of the eyes. This technique is based on the principle that objects that are closer to us will appear to be in sharper focus than objects that are further away. The brain uses this information to estimate the depth of objects in the scene. This technique is particularly effective for objects that are close to us, but can also be used to estimate the depth of objects at greater distances.

In addition to these techniques, depth perception can also be influenced by other factors such as occlusion, texture, and surface properties, as discussed in the previous section. These factors can provide additional information about the depth and distance of objects, and can be used to refine the depth perception process.

#### 8.2c Applications of Depth Perception

Depth perception plays a crucial role in various applications, particularly in the field of computer vision. In this section, we will explore some of the key applications of depth perception, including depth filtering, depth ordering, and depth estimation.

##### Depth Filtering

Depth filtering is a technique used in computer vision to remove unwanted depth information from an image. This technique is particularly useful in applications where the depth information is not relevant, such as in image compression or object detection. Depth filtering can be achieved using various methods, including depth thresholding, depth blurring, and depth segmentation.

Depth thresholding involves setting a threshold on the depth information, and removing all depth values that are above or below this threshold. This technique is useful for removing depth information that is outside of a certain range, such as in image compression where only a certain depth range is relevant.

Depth blurring involves blurring the depth information in an image. This technique is useful for reducing the impact of noise or errors in the depth information. By blurring the depth information, the impact of these errors can be reduced, leading to a more accurate depth estimation.

Depth segmentation involves dividing the depth information into different segments. This technique is useful for grouping depth information into different categories, such as foreground and background. This can be particularly useful in applications such as object detection, where the depth information can be used to identify and track objects in a scene.

##### Depth Ordering

Depth ordering is a technique used in computer vision to determine the relative depth of objects in an image. This technique is particularly useful in applications such as object detection and tracking, where the depth information can be used to identify and track objects in a scene.

Depth ordering can be achieved using various methods, including depth sorting and depth estimation. Depth sorting involves sorting the objects in an image based on their depth, with objects closer to the camera appearing first. This technique can be useful for applications such as object detection, where the depth information can be used to identify and track objects in a scene.

Depth estimation involves estimating the depth of objects in an image. This technique can be achieved using various methods, including stereopsis, motion parallax, and depth from focus. These techniques rely on different principles, such as the difference in images received by each eye (stereopsis), the movement of the observer's head (motion parallax), and the focus of the eyes (depth from focus). By combining these techniques, accurate depth estimation can be achieved, leading to improved object detection and tracking.

##### Depth Estimation

Depth estimation is a crucial aspect of depth perception, as it allows us to determine the distance of objects in our environment. This technique is particularly useful in applications such as autonomous vehicles, where accurate depth estimation is essential for tasks such as obstacle avoidance and navigation.

Depth estimation can be achieved using various methods, including monocular depth estimation and stereo depth estimation. Monocular depth estimation involves estimating the depth of objects from a single image, while stereo depth estimation involves estimating the depth of objects from two images taken from slightly different perspectives.

Monocular depth estimation can be achieved using various techniques, such as depth from focus, depth from texture, and depth from motion. These techniques rely on different principles, such as the focus of the eyes (depth from focus), the texture of the scene (depth from texture), and the motion of objects in the scene (depth from motion). By combining these techniques, accurate depth estimation can be achieved, leading to improved object detection and tracking.

Stereo depth estimation, on the other hand, involves estimating the depth of objects from two images taken from slightly different perspectives. This technique relies on the principle of parallax, where objects closer to the camera will appear to move more when viewed from different angles. By comparing the images taken from different perspectives, the depth of objects can be estimated, leading to improved depth perception.

In conclusion, depth perception plays a crucial role in various applications, particularly in the field of computer vision. By understanding the principles behind depth perception and the various techniques used to achieve it, we can develop more accurate and efficient depth estimation methods for applications such as object detection, tracking, and autonomous vehicles.

## Chapter: Chapter 9: What Does the Occluding Contour Tell Us about Shape?

### Introduction

In the realm of vision science, the concept of occlusion plays a pivotal role in understanding the shape of objects. Occlusion, in its simplest form, refers to the phenomenon where one object blocks our view of another. This chapter, "What Does the Occluding Contour Tell Us about Shape?", delves into the intricacies of occlusion and its implications on the perception of shape.

The occluding contour, the boundary of an object that is blocking our view, is a crucial aspect in this context. It provides us with valuable information about the shape of the occluding object. This chapter will explore how this information is extracted and interpreted by our visual system.

We will also discuss the challenges and complexities involved in the process. For instance, the occluding contour may not always be visible, especially in cases where the occluding object is transparent or has a similar color to the background. Furthermore, the shape of the occluding contour may not always correspond to the shape of the occluding object, particularly in cases of perspective distortion.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of occlusion in shape perception. It will equip readers with the knowledge and tools to analyze and interpret the information conveyed by the occluding contour. This understanding is not only crucial for vision scientists but also for anyone interested in the workings of our visual system.

As we delve into the world of occlusion and shape perception, we will be guided by the principles of vision science, supported by empirical evidence, and illustrated with examples and case studies. This chapter will not only enhance your understanding of vision science but also stimulate your curiosity and inspire you to explore this fascinating field further.




### Subsection: 8.2b Occlusion Boundary Detection

Occlusion boundary detection is a crucial aspect of depth perception, as it allows us to determine the boundaries of objects in our environment. This is achieved by detecting the occluding contours of objects, which are the boundaries between objects and the background.

The process of occlusion boundary detection begins with the detection of occluding contours. These contours are defined as the boundaries between objects and the background, and they provide crucial information about the depth and distance of objects. The occlusion boundary detection process then involves identifying the pixels along these contours, which can be achieved using various techniques such as edge detection and line integral convolution.

One of the key challenges in occlusion boundary detection is dealing with occlusions. Occlusions occur when one object obscures another, making it difficult to detect the occluding contours. To address this challenge, various techniques have been developed, such as the use of multiple focus images and the use of a multi-focus image fusion algorithm.

The use of multiple focus images involves capturing images at different focus settings, which can help to improve the detection of occluding contours. This is because each image will have a different set of pixels in focus, and by combining these images, we can improve the detection of occluding contours.

The use of a multi-focus image fusion algorithm involves combining the multiple focus images into a single image. This can be achieved using various techniques, such as the use of a weighted average or a maximum likelihood estimation. The goal of this process is to create a single image that combines the information from all the focus images, which can help to improve the detection of occluding contours.

In addition to these techniques, there are also various algorithms that can be used for occlusion boundary detection. For example, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is a popular algorithm for tracking the boundaries of objects in a scene. The EKF uses a mathematical model of the scene to predict the location of the boundaries, and then updates these predictions based on the observed data. This allows for the detection of occluding contours even when they are not directly observable.

Another popular algorithm for occlusion boundary detection is the Line Integral Convolution (LIC) method. This method involves convolving an image with a kernel function that is sensitive to the orientation of edges. This can help to detect the occluding contours, as they are often characterized by strong edges.

In conclusion, occlusion boundary detection is a crucial aspect of depth perception, and it involves the detection of occluding contours. This can be achieved using various techniques, such as edge detection, line integral convolution, and the use of multiple focus images. Additionally, there are also various algorithms that can be used for occlusion boundary detection, such as the Extended Kalman Filter and the Line Integral Convolution method.

# Vision Science: Exploring Perception and Imaging

## Chapter 9: Visual Perception and Imaging




### Introduction

Visual perception is a complex process that involves the transformation of light into mental representations of the environment. This process is constructed through a series of stages, each of which plays a crucial role in how we perceive the world around us. In this chapter, we will explore the various stages of visual perception, from the initial capture of light by photoreceptors in the retina to the final interpretation of this information by the brain. We will also discuss the role of imaging techniques in studying these stages and how they have advanced our understanding of visual perception.

The first stage of visual perception is the capture of light by photoreceptors in the retina. These photoreceptors, which include rods and cones, are responsible for converting light into electrical signals that are then transmitted to the brain. The properties of these photoreceptors, such as their sensitivity to different wavelengths of light, play a crucial role in how we perceive color and light.

The next stage of visual perception is the processing of this information by the brain. This involves the transformation of the electrical signals from the retina into mental representations of the environment. This process is complex and involves multiple stages, including the processing of information by different areas of the brain.

Finally, we will explore the role of imaging techniques in studying visual perception. These techniques, which include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), allow us to observe the brain in action and provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of visual perception.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a deeper understanding of the stages involved in constructing visual perception and the role of imaging techniques in studying this process. This knowledge will provide a solid foundation for further exploration into the fascinating world of vision science.




### Section: 9.1 Visual Illusions

Visual illusions are a fascinating aspect of vision science that have been studied extensively by researchers. These illusions occur when our perception of a visual stimulus is different from its actual physical properties. This can be due to a variety of factors, including the way our brain processes information, the properties of the stimulus itself, and the context in which it is presented.

#### 9.1a Ponzo Illusion

The Ponzo illusion is a classic example of a visual illusion that has been extensively studied. It was first described by Italian psychologist Mario Ponzo in 1913. The illusion occurs when two lines of the same length are presented, one above the other, with a grating in between. The upper line is perceived as longer than the lower line, even though they are actually the same length.

The Ponzo illusion can be explained by the concept of perceived visual angle. As discussed in the previous chapter, the perceived visual angle, "θ′", can change for a viewed target that subtends a constant physical visual angle "θ". This is due to a variety of factors, including the size and brightness of the target, the contrast between the target and its background, and the context in which the target is presented.

In the case of the Ponzo illusion, the grating in between the two lines creates a context that leads to an increase in the perceived visual angle of the upper line. This is due to the principle of assimilation, where the upper line is assimilated to the larger grating, leading to an increase in its perceived size.

The Ponzo illusion has been extensively studied by researchers, and various experiments have revealed most of the factors responsible for this illusion. These include the size and brightness of the target, the contrast between the target and its background, and the context in which the target is presented.

However, despite the extensive research on the Ponzo illusion, there are still some aspects of it that are not fully understood. For example, the exact mechanisms by which the grating in between the two lines leads to an increase in the perceived visual angle of the upper line are still not fully understood. This is an area of ongoing research in vision science.

In the next section, we will explore another classic visual illusion, the Ebbinghaus illusion, and discuss how it can be explained in terms of perceived visual angle.

#### 9.1b Ebbinghaus Illusion

The Ebbinghaus illusion, named after German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus, is another classic example of a visual illusion. It occurs when a central disk appears larger or smaller depending on the size of surrounding disks. This illusion is particularly interesting because it demonstrates the influence of context on perception.

In the Ebbinghaus illusion, a central disk is surrounded by a series of disks of varying sizes. The central disk is actually the same size in all presentations, but it appears larger when surrounded by smaller disks and smaller when surrounded by larger disks. This illusion is due to the principle of contrast, where the central disk is contrasted with the surrounding disks.

The Ebbinghaus illusion can be explained in terms of the perceived visual angle, similar to the Ponzo illusion. The perceived visual angle, "θ′", of the central disk changes depending on the size of the surrounding disks. This is due to the principle of contrast, where the central disk is assimilated to the larger or smaller disks, leading to an increase or decrease in its perceived size.

The Ebbinghaus illusion has been extensively studied by researchers, and various experiments have revealed most of the factors responsible for this illusion. These include the size and number of the surrounding disks, the contrast between the central disk and the surrounding disks, and the context in which the central disk is presented.

However, despite the extensive research on the Ebbinghaus illusion, there are still some aspects of it that are not fully understood. For example, the exact mechanisms by which the size of the surrounding disks leads to an increase or decrease in the perceived size of the central disk are still not fully understood. This is an area of ongoing research in vision science.

In the next section, we will explore another classic visual illusion, the Poggendorff illusion, and discuss how it can be explained in terms of perceived visual angle.

#### 9.1c Poggendorff Illusion

The Poggendorff illusion, named after German physicist and mathematician Christian Friedrich Georg Poggendorff, is a visual illusion that occurs when a line appears longer or shorter depending on the presence of a second line. This illusion is particularly interesting because it demonstrates the influence of context on perception.

In the Poggendorff illusion, a line is presented along with a second line that is either parallel or intersecting with the first line. The first line is actually the same length in all presentations, but it appears longer when presented with a parallel line and shorter when presented with an intersecting line. This illusion is due to the principle of assimilation, where the first line is assimilated to the longer or shorter line, leading to an increase or decrease in its perceived length.

The Poggendorff illusion can be explained in terms of the perceived visual angle, similar to the Ebbinghaus and Ponzo illusions. The perceived visual angle, "θ′", of the first line changes depending on the presence and orientation of the second line. This is due to the principle of assimilation, where the first line is assimilated to the longer or shorter line, leading to an increase or decrease in its perceived length.

The Poggendorff illusion has been extensively studied by researchers, and various experiments have revealed most of the factors responsible for this illusion. These include the orientation of the second line, the length of the first line, and the context in which the first line is presented.

However, despite the extensive research on the Poggendorff illusion, there are still some aspects of it that are not fully understood. For example, the exact mechanisms by which the orientation of the second line leads to an increase or decrease in the perceived length of the first line are still not fully understood. This is an area of ongoing research in vision science.

In the next section, we will explore another classic visual illusion, the Müller-Lyer illusion, and discuss how it can be explained in terms of perceived visual angle.

#### 9.1d Müller-Lyer Illusion

The Müller-Lyer illusion, named after German physicist and mathematician Christian Friedrich Georg Poggendorff, is a visual illusion that occurs when a line appears longer or shorter depending on the presence of a second line. This illusion is particularly interesting because it demonstrates the influence of context on perception.

In the Müller-Lyer illusion, a line is presented along with a second line that is either converging or diverging with the first line. The first line is actually the same length in all presentations, but it appears longer when presented with a converging line and shorter when presented with a diverging line. This illusion is due to the principle of assimilation, where the first line is assimilated to the longer or shorter line, leading to an increase or decrease in its perceived length.

The Müller-Lyer illusion can be explained in terms of the perceived visual angle, similar to the Ebbinghaus, Ponzo, and Poggendorff illusions. The perceived visual angle, "θ′", of the first line changes depending on the presence and orientation of the second line. This is due to the principle of assimilation, where the first line is assimilated to the longer or shorter line, leading to an increase or decrease in its perceived length.

The Müller-Lyer illusion has been extensively studied by researchers, and various experiments have revealed most of the factors responsible for this illusion. These include the orientation of the second line, the length of the first line, and the context in which the first line is presented.

However, despite the extensive research on the Müller-Lyer illusion, there are still some aspects of it that are not fully understood. For example, the exact mechanisms by which the orientation of the second line leads to an increase or decrease in the perceived length of the first line are still not fully understood. This is an area of ongoing research in vision science.

In the next section, we will explore another classic visual illusion, the Ponzo illusion, and discuss how it can be explained in terms of perceived visual angle.




### Section: 9.2 Perceptual Organization

Perceptual organization is a fundamental aspect of vision science that refers to the process by which we group visual elements into meaningful units. This process is crucial for our perception of the world, as it allows us to make sense of the vast amount of visual information that is constantly bombarding our senses.

#### 9.2a Grouping

Grouping is a key aspect of perceptual organization. It refers to the process by which we group visual elements into meaningful units based on their similarities or proximity. This can be seen in the Ponzo illusion, where the upper line is grouped with the larger grating, leading to an increase in its perceived size.

The principles of grouping can be understood in terms of the Gestalt laws of organization, which were first proposed by German psychologist Max Wertheimer in the early 20th century. These laws describe how we perceive visual patterns and group visual elements into meaningful units.

The first Gestalt law, the law of proximity, states that elements that are close together in space are likely to be grouped together. This can be seen in the Ponzo illusion, where the upper line is grouped with the larger grating due to their proximity.

The second Gestalt law, the law of similarity, states that elements that are similar to each other are likely to be grouped together. This can be seen in the Ponzo illusion, where the upper line is grouped with the larger grating due to their similarity in size and brightness.

The third Gestalt law, the law of closure, states that we tend to group visual elements into closed figures. This can be seen in the Ponzo illusion, where the upper line is grouped with the larger grating due to the closure created by the grating.

The fourth Gestalt law, the law of common fate, states that elements that move in the same direction are likely to be grouped together. This can be seen in the Ponzo illusion, where the upper line is grouped with the larger grating due to the common fate of both elements moving in the same direction.

The fifth Gestalt law, the law of good continuation, states that we tend to group visual elements that continue in a smooth and continuous manner. This can be seen in the Ponzo illusion, where the upper line is grouped with the larger grating due to the good continuation created by the grating.

In conclusion, grouping is a crucial aspect of perceptual organization that allows us to make sense of the vast amount of visual information that is constantly bombarding our senses. The principles of grouping can be understood in terms of the Gestalt laws of organization, which describe how we perceive visual patterns and group visual elements into meaningful units.

#### 9.2b Segregation

Segregation is another important aspect of perceptual organization. It refers to the process by which we separate visual elements into distinct units based on their differences. This can be seen in the Ponzo illusion, where the upper line is separated from the lower line due to their differences in size and brightness.

The principles of segregation can also be understood in terms of the Gestalt laws of organization. The first Gestalt law, the law of proximity, can be applied to segregation as well. Elements that are far apart in space are likely to be segregated into separate units. This can be seen in the Ponzo illusion, where the upper line is segregated from the lower line due to their distance.

The second Gestalt law, the law of similarity, can also be applied to segregation. Elements that are different from each other are likely to be segregated into separate units. This can be seen in the Ponzo illusion, where the upper line is segregated from the lower line due to their differences in size and brightness.

The third Gestalt law, the law of closure, can also be applied to segregation. We tend to segregate visual elements into separate units when there is no closure created by the elements. This can be seen in the Ponzo illusion, where the upper line is segregated from the lower line due to the lack of closure created by the grating.

The fourth Gestalt law, the law of common fate, can also be applied to segregation. Elements that move in different directions are likely to be segregated into separate units. This can be seen in the Ponzo illusion, where the upper line is segregated from the lower line due to their different movements.

The fifth Gestalt law, the law of good continuation, can also be applied to segregation. We tend to segregate visual elements into separate units when there is no good continuation between the elements. This can be seen in the Ponzo illusion, where the upper line is segregated from the lower line due to the lack of good continuation created by the grating.

In conclusion, both grouping and segregation are crucial aspects of perceptual organization. They allow us to make sense of the vast amount of visual information that is constantly bombarding our senses by grouping similar elements and segregating different elements. These processes can be understood in terms of the Gestalt laws of organization, which provide a framework for understanding how we perceive visual patterns and group visual elements into meaningful units.

#### 9.2c Organization in Space

The organization of visual elements in space is a crucial aspect of perceptual organization. It refers to the process by which we arrange visual elements in our mental representation of the visual scene. This process is influenced by various factors, including the physical properties of the visual elements, the context in which they are presented, and our prior knowledge and expectations.

The Ponzo illusion provides a clear example of how visual elements can be organized in space. In this illusion, two lines of the same length are presented, one above the other, with a grating in between. The upper line is perceived as longer than the lower line, even though they are actually the same length. This illusion can be explained in terms of the principles of grouping and segregation. The upper line is grouped with the larger grating due to their proximity and similarity, leading to an increase in its perceived size. The lower line, on the other hand, is segregated from the grating due to their differences in size and brightness, leading to a decrease in its perceived size.

The organization of visual elements in space can also be understood in terms of the Gestalt laws of organization. The first Gestalt law, the law of proximity, can be applied to the organization of visual elements in space. Elements that are close together in space are likely to be grouped together, leading to an increase in their perceived size. This can be seen in the Ponzo illusion, where the upper line is grouped with the larger grating due to their proximity.

The second Gestalt law, the law of similarity, can also be applied to the organization of visual elements in space. Elements that are similar to each other are likely to be grouped together, leading to an increase in their perceived size. This can be seen in the Ponzo illusion, where the upper line is grouped with the larger grating due to their similarity in size and brightness.

The third Gestalt law, the law of closure, can also be applied to the organization of visual elements in space. We tend to group visual elements into closed figures, leading to an increase in their perceived size. This can be seen in the Ponzo illusion, where the upper line is grouped with the larger grating due to the closure created by the grating.

The fourth Gestalt law, the law of common fate, can also be applied to the organization of visual elements in space. Elements that move in the same direction are likely to be grouped together, leading to an increase in their perceived size. This can be seen in the Ponzo illusion, where the upper line is grouped with the larger grating due to the common fate of both elements moving in the same direction.

The fifth Gestalt law, the law of good continuation, can also be applied to the organization of visual elements in space. We tend to group visual elements that continue in a smooth and continuous manner, leading to an increase in their perceived size. This can be seen in the Ponzo illusion, where the upper line is grouped with the larger grating due to the good continuation created by the grating.

In conclusion, the organization of visual elements in space is a crucial aspect of perceptual organization. It is influenced by various factors, including the physical properties of the visual elements, the context in which they are presented, and our prior knowledge and expectations. The principles of grouping and segregation, as well as the Gestalt laws of organization, provide a framework for understanding how visual elements are organized in space.

#### 9.2d Organization in Time

The organization of visual elements in time is another crucial aspect of perceptual organization. It refers to the process by which we arrange visual elements in our mental representation of the visual scene over time. This process is influenced by various factors, including the physical properties of the visual elements, the context in which they are presented, and our prior knowledge and expectations.

The Ponzo illusion provides a clear example of how visual elements can be organized in time. In this illusion, two lines of the same length are presented, one above the other, with a grating in between. The upper line is perceived as longer than the lower line, even though they are actually the same length. This illusion can be explained in terms of the principles of grouping and segregation. The upper line is grouped with the larger grating due to their proximity and similarity, leading to an increase in its perceived size. The lower line, on the other hand, is segregated from the grating due to their differences in size and brightness, leading to a decrease in its perceived size.

The organization of visual elements in time can also be understood in terms of the Gestalt laws of organization. The first Gestalt law, the law of proximity, can be applied to the organization of visual elements in time. Elements that are close together in time are likely to be grouped together, leading to an increase in their perceived size. This can be seen in the Ponzo illusion, where the upper line is grouped with the larger grating due to their proximity in time.

The second Gestalt law, the law of similarity, can also be applied to the organization of visual elements in time. Elements that are similar to each other in terms of their physical properties or context are likely to be grouped together, leading to an increase in their perceived size. This can be seen in the Ponzo illusion, where the upper line is grouped with the larger grating due to their similarity in size and brightness.

The third Gestalt law, the law of closure, can also be applied to the organization of visual elements in time. We tend to group visual elements into closed figures, leading to an increase in their perceived size. This can be seen in the Ponzo illusion, where the upper line is grouped with the larger grating due to the closure created by the grating.

The fourth Gestalt law, the law of common fate, can also be applied to the organization of visual elements in time. Elements that move in the same direction or have a similar trajectory are likely to be grouped together, leading to an increase in their perceived size. This can be seen in the Ponzo illusion, where the upper line is grouped with the larger grating due to their common fate of moving in the same direction.

The fifth Gestalt law, the law of good continuation, can also be applied to the organization of visual elements in time. We tend to group visual elements that continue in a smooth and continuous manner, leading to an increase in their perceived size. This can be seen in the Ponzo illusion, where the upper line is grouped with the larger grating due to the good continuation created by the grating.

In conclusion, the organization of visual elements in time is a crucial aspect of perceptual organization. It is influenced by various factors, including the physical properties of the visual elements, the context in which they are presented, and our prior knowledge and expectations. The principles of grouping and segregation, as well as the Gestalt laws of organization, provide a framework for understanding how visual elements are organized in time.

## Chapter: Chapter 10: Visual Perception

### Introduction

The human visual system is a complex and intricate network that allows us to perceive and interpret the world around us. It is a system that is constantly adapting and evolving, and one that is deeply intertwined with our cognitive processes. In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of visual perception, exploring the mechanisms and processes that govern how we see and understand the visual world.

Visual perception is not just about the physical properties of light and color. It is also about how we interpret and make sense of these properties. This interpretation is not just a passive process, but an active one, where our brains use a variety of strategies and algorithms to make sense of the visual information we receive.

We will explore the concept of visual perception from both a physiological and psychological perspective. We will look at how the physical properties of light and color are processed by the photoreceptor cells in our retinas, and how this information is then transmitted to the brain. We will also look at how the brain interprets this information, and how this interpretation can be influenced by a variety of factors, including our expectations, our past experiences, and our cognitive processes.

We will also explore the concept of visual illusions, and how these illusions can provide insights into the mechanisms of visual perception. We will look at how these illusions are created, and how they can be used to study the processes of visual perception.

Finally, we will look at the role of visual perception in various fields, including art, design, and technology. We will explore how our understanding of visual perception can be used to create more effective and engaging visual experiences, and how it can be used to develop new technologies and tools.

In this chapter, we will use a variety of tools and techniques to explore the world of visual perception. We will use mathematical models to describe the processes of visual perception, and we will use computer simulations to visualize these models. We will also use a variety of experimental techniques, including psychophysical experiments and neurophysiological recordings, to study the processes of visual perception.

So, let's embark on this journey into the world of visual perception, and discover the fascinating ways in which we see and understand the visual world.




### Section: 9.3 Gestalt Principles

The Gestalt principles of organization are a set of psychological principles that describe how we perceive visual patterns. These principles were first proposed by German psychologist Max Wertheimer in the early 20th century and have since been refined and expanded upon by other researchers.

#### 9.3a Illusory Contours

Illusory contours are a type of visual illusion that is created by the Gestalt principles of organization. They are perceived boundaries between regions of similar color or brightness, even when there is no actual boundary present. This phenomenon is often referred to as the "illusory contour effect".

One of the most well-known examples of illusory contours is the Kanizsa triangle, a geometric figure composed of three isosceles right triangles. The figure is constructed from three PACs (pink, aqua, and cyan) and three white regions. The PACs are arranged in a way that creates the illusion of a larger triangle, even though there are only three actual triangles present.

The illusory contour effect is also evident in the Ponzo illusion, where the upper line is grouped with the larger grating due to its proximity and similarity, creating the illusion of a larger line.

The perception of illusory contours is thought to be a result of the Gestalt laws of organization, particularly the law of closure. This law states that we tend to group visual elements into closed figures, and in the case of illusory contours, our perception of a closed figure is created by the PACs and white regions.

The illusory contour effect has been studied extensively in the field of vision science, and it has been found to have implications for our understanding of visual perception and imaging. For example, the perception of illusory contours has been linked to the processing of visual information in the early visual cortex, specifically in the primary visual cortex (V1) and the secondary visual cortex (V2).

In addition, the illusory contour effect has been used to study the neural basis of perception. Studies using human neuroimaging techniques have found that illusory contours are associated with activity in the deep layers of primary visual cortex, suggesting that these regions play a crucial role in the perception of illusory contours.

Furthermore, the illusory contour effect has been applied in the field of computer vision, particularly in the development of algorithms for image segmentation and object detection. These algorithms use the principles of illusory contours to identify and extract objects from complex visual scenes.

In conclusion, the illusory contour effect is a fascinating phenomenon that has been studied extensively in the field of vision science. It provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of visual perception and imaging, and it has practical applications in various fields, including computer vision.

#### 9.3b Phantom Contours

Phantom contours are another type of visual illusion that is created by the Gestalt principles of organization. They are perceived boundaries between regions of similar color or brightness, even when there is no actual boundary present. This phenomenon is often referred to as the "phantom contour effect".

Phantom contours are typically observed in moving or flickering images with contrast reversal. The rapid, continuous alternation between opposing, but correlated, adjacent images creates the perception of a contour that is not physically present in the still images. This effect is particularly pronounced when the images are presented in a specific temporal frequency range, typically between 4 and 8 Hz.

The phantom contour effect is a result of the Gestalt laws of organization, particularly the law of closure. This law states that we tend to group visual elements into closed figures, and in the case of phantom contours, our perception of a closed figure is created by the alternating images.

The perception of phantom contours has been studied extensively in the field of vision science, and it has been found to have implications for our understanding of visual perception and imaging. For example, the perception of phantom contours has been linked to the processing of visual information in the early visual cortex, specifically in the primary visual cortex (V1) and the secondary visual cortex (V2).

In addition, the phantom contour effect has been used to study the neural basis of perception. Studies using human neuroimaging techniques have found that phantom contours are associated with activity in the deep layers of primary visual cortex, similar to the illusory contour effect.

The phantom contour effect has also been applied in the field of computer vision. For instance, Quaid et al. have authored a PhD thesis on the phantom contour effect and its implications for image processing and computer vision. Their work has led to the development of algorithms for image segmentation and object detection that exploit the phantom contour effect.

In conclusion, the phantom contour effect, like the illusory contour effect, is a fascinating phenomenon that has been studied extensively in the field of vision science. It provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of visual perception and imaging, and it has practical applications in various fields, including computer vision.

#### 9.3c Laws of Organization

The Gestalt principles of organization, including the laws of proximity, similarity, closure, and common fate, play a crucial role in the perception of illusory and phantom contours. These laws describe how we group visual elements into meaningful units, and they are fundamental to our understanding of visual perception and imaging.

The law of proximity, as mentioned earlier, states that elements that are close together in space are likely to be grouped together. This law is particularly relevant in the perception of illusory contours, where the proximity of PACs (pink, aqua, and cyan) and white regions creates the illusion of a closed figure.

The law of similarity, on the other hand, states that elements that are similar to each other are likely to be grouped together. This law is evident in the perception of phantom contours, where the alternating images create a sense of similarity that leads to the perception of a closed figure.

The law of closure, as we have seen, is crucial in the perception of both illusory and phantom contours. It states that we tend to group visual elements into closed figures, and this law is fundamental to our perception of the world.

Finally, the law of common fate, which states that elements that move in the same direction are likely to be grouped together, is also relevant in the perception of phantom contours. The rapid, continuous alternation between opposing, but correlated, adjacent images creates a sense of common fate that leads to the perception of a contour.

These laws of organization are not only theoretical constructs but have practical implications in various fields. For instance, in computer vision, these laws are used to develop algorithms for image segmentation and object detection. Understanding these laws can help us design more effective algorithms and improve our understanding of visual perception.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the neural basis of these phenomena and explore how they are processed in the brain.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the fascinating world of visual perception, exploring how we construct our understanding of the visual world. We have examined the various processes that contribute to our perception of visual stimuli, including the role of the retina, the visual pathways in the brain, and the cognitive processes that interpret and make sense of visual information.

We have also explored the concept of imaging in vision science, discussing how imaging techniques can be used to study the visual system and provide insights into the mechanisms of visual perception. We have seen how imaging can be used to visualize the structure and function of the visual system, and how it can be used to study the effects of various visual disorders and diseases.

In conclusion, the study of visual perception and imaging is a complex and multifaceted field, involving a wide range of disciplines and techniques. By understanding the processes involved in constructing visual perception, we can gain a deeper understanding of how we see the world around us, and how we can use imaging techniques to study and improve our visual system.

In the case of figure-ground segmentation, the Gestalt principles of closure, similarity, and proximity play a crucial role.

#### 9.3b.2 The Gestalt Principles of Organization

The Gestalt principles of organization are a set of psychological principles that describe how we perceive visual patterns. These principles were first proposed by German psychologist Max Wertheimer in the early 20th century and have since been refined and expanded upon by other researchers.

The Gestalt principles of organization include the principles of closure, similarity, and proximity. These principles describe how we perceive visual elements as belonging to a group or unit. In the case of figure-ground segmentation, these principles are used to group visual elements into objects and their backgrounds.

#### 9.3b.3 The Role of Figure-Ground Segmentation in Visual Imaging

Figure-ground segmentation plays a crucial role in visual imaging. It allows us to create accurate representations of visual scenes, which are essential for tasks such as object recognition and tracking.

In visual imaging, figure-ground segmentation is often achieved through techniques such as edge detection and region growing. These techniques use mathematical algorithms to identify the boundaries between objects and their backgrounds, and to group visual elements into objects.

#### 9.3b.4 The Challenges of Figure-Ground Segmentation

Despite its importance, figure-ground segmentation is not always straightforward. In many cases, the boundaries between objects and their backgrounds are not well-defined, and the visual elements may be ambiguous. This can make it difficult to accurately segment a visual scene.

Furthermore, figure-ground segmentation is influenced by a variety of factors, including the properties of the visual elements, the context of the visual scene, and the observer's expectations and knowledge.

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamental concepts of vision science, including perception and imaging. We have delved into the intricacies of how the human eye processes visual information, and how imaging technologies have revolutionized the way we capture and analyze visual data. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the realm of motion segmentation and tracking, a crucial aspect of vision science that has wide-ranging applications in various fields.

Motion segmentation and tracking is a complex process that involves identifying and separating moving objects from a background, and then tracking their movement over time. This process is essential in a variety of applications, from sports analysis to medical imaging, and from robotics to computer animation. It is also a key component in the development of autonomous vehicles, where accurate motion segmentation and tracking are crucial for safe and efficient navigation.

In this chapter, we will explore the concept of normalized cuts, a powerful mathematical technique used for motion segmentation and tracking. Normalized cuts, first introduced by Shi and Malik in 1997, provide a systematic approach to partitioning a graph into subsets, each representing a different object or region. This technique has been widely used in various fields, including computer vision, image processing, and data mining.

We will begin by providing a brief overview of normalized cuts, discussing its mathematical foundations and its applications in motion segmentation and tracking. We will then delve into the details of how normalized cuts can be used to segment and track moving objects in a video sequence. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of this technique, and how they can be addressed.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of the principles and applications of normalized cuts in motion segmentation and tracking. They will also gain insights into the complexities of this process and the potential for further research in this exciting field.




### Subsection: 10.1 Motion Perception

Motion perception is a fundamental aspect of vision science that involves the ability to infer the speed and direction of elements in a scene based on visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive inputs. This process is crucial for our daily interactions with the environment, as it allows us to navigate and interact with objects in our surroundings.

#### 10.1a Motion Perception and Vision Science

The study of motion perception is a multidisciplinary field that includes psychology, neurology, neurophysiology, engineering, and computer science. It is a complex process that involves the integration of sensory information from various sources, including the visual system, the vestibular system, and the proprioceptive system.

The visual system plays a crucial role in motion perception. It is responsible for detecting and processing visual information about the motion of objects in the environment. This process involves the transformation of light into neural signals that are then processed by the brain to extract information about the motion of objects.

The vestibular system, on the other hand, is responsible for detecting and processing information about the motion of the head and the body. It provides a reference frame for the perception of motion and helps to integrate sensory information from the visual and proprioceptive systems.

The proprioceptive system is responsible for detecting and processing information about the position and movement of the body. It provides a sense of the body's position in space and helps to integrate sensory information from the visual and vestibular systems.

The integration of sensory information from these three systems is crucial for accurate motion perception. Any disruption in this process can lead to deficits in motion perception, as seen in conditions such as akinetopsia.

#### 10.1b Motion Perception and Normalized Cuts

Normalized cuts provide a mathematical framework for motion segmentation and tracking, which are crucial for accurate motion perception. They allow us to partition a video sequence into different regions, each representing a moving object. This is achieved by minimizing the normalized cut, which is a measure of the similarity between regions.

The normalized cut is defined as the ratio of the cut size (the number of edges between regions) to the sum of the cut size and the total number of edges in the graph. It is a measure of the strength of the connection between regions, with a higher normalized cut indicating a stronger connection.

By minimizing the normalized cut, we can partition the video sequence into different regions, each representing a moving object. This allows us to track the motion of these objects over time, providing a detailed understanding of the motion in the scene.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical foundations of normalized cuts and discuss how they can be used for motion segmentation and tracking.

#### 10.1b Motion Perception and Imaging

Imaging plays a crucial role in the study of motion perception. It allows us to capture and analyze the motion of objects in the environment, providing a wealth of information about the dynamics of the scene. This information can then be used to improve our understanding of motion perception and to develop more accurate models of the process.

One of the key techniques used in imaging for motion perception is motion capture. This involves the use of cameras to track the motion of objects in the environment. The cameras capture images of the objects at regular intervals, and these images are then analyzed to determine the motion of the objects between successive frames.

Motion capture can be used to study the motion of objects at different scales, from the large-scale motion of vehicles and pedestrians in a city to the small-scale motion of cells and molecules in a biological sample. It can also be used to study the motion of objects in a variety of environments, from the controlled conditions of a laboratory to the complex, dynamic environments found in the real world.

Another important technique used in imaging for motion perception is motion estimation. This involves the use of algorithms to estimate the motion of objects in a video sequence. These algorithms use information about the motion of objects in successive frames to estimate their motion between frames.

Motion estimation can be used to improve the quality of video sequences, by removing or reducing the effects of motion blur and camera shake. It can also be used to extract information about the motion of objects in the scene, which can then be used to improve our understanding of motion perception.

In the next section, we will discuss how imaging techniques can be used in conjunction with normalized cuts to study motion perception in more detail.

#### 10.1c Motion Perception and Applications

Motion perception has a wide range of applications in various fields, including computer vision, robotics, and human-computer interaction. In this section, we will explore some of these applications in more detail.

##### Computer Vision

In computer vision, motion perception is used for tasks such as object tracking, gesture recognition, and activity analysis. For example, in object tracking, the motion of an object can be estimated using motion capture or motion estimation techniques. This information can then be used to track the object over time, even when it is partially occluded or its appearance changes.

Gesture recognition is another important application of motion perception in computer vision. By analyzing the motion of a person's hands and arms, it is possible to recognize a wide range of gestures. This can be used in human-computer interaction to control devices or applications using natural gestures.

Activity analysis involves the analysis of the motion of multiple objects in a scene. This can be used for tasks such as crowd analysis, where the behavior of a large group of people is analyzed, or for sports analysis, where the motion of players and the ball is tracked.

##### Robotics

In robotics, motion perception is used for tasks such as localization, navigation, and manipulation. Localization involves the estimation of the robot's position and orientation in the environment. This can be achieved using motion capture or motion estimation techniques, which provide information about the robot's motion and the motion of objects in the environment.

Navigation involves the planning and execution of a path for the robot to follow. This can be achieved using information about the motion of objects in the environment, which can be used to avoid obstacles and to reach a desired destination.

Manipulation involves the interaction of the robot with objects in the environment. This can be achieved using information about the motion of objects, which can be used to plan and execute movements of the robot's end-effector.

##### Human-Computer Interaction

In human-computer interaction, motion perception is used for tasks such as gesture recognition and natural interaction. Gesture recognition, as mentioned earlier, allows users to control devices or applications using natural gestures. Natural interaction involves the use of natural movements and behaviors, such as speech and body language, to interact with a computer.

In conclusion, motion perception plays a crucial role in various fields, providing a wealth of information about the dynamics of the environment. By combining this information with techniques such as motion capture and motion estimation, it is possible to develop more accurate models of motion perception and to improve our understanding of this fundamental aspect of vision science.




### Subsection: 10.2 Motion Segmentation

Motion segmentation is a crucial aspect of vision science that involves the process of dividing a scene into different moving objects. This process is essential for tasks such as object tracking, recognition, and interaction. In this section, we will explore the concept of motion segmentation and its applications in vision science.

#### 10.2a Motion Segmentation Techniques

There are several techniques for motion segmentation, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. These techniques can be broadly classified into two categories: global and local methods.

Global methods, such as the mean-shift algorithm, use a global model of the scene to segment moving objects. These methods are robust to occlusions and can handle complex backgrounds. However, they can be computationally expensive and may not be suitable for real-time applications.

Local methods, on the other hand, use local information to segment moving objects. These methods are typically faster than global methods but may not be as robust to occlusions and complex backgrounds. One example of a local method is the normalized cuts algorithm, which we will explore in more detail in the next section.

#### 10.2b Motion Segmentation and Normalized Cuts

Normalized cuts (NC) is a powerful technique for motion segmentation that has been widely used in various applications. It is based on the concept of graph cuts, which is a method for partitioning a graph into subsets. In the context of motion segmentation, the graph represents the pixels in the image, and the edges represent the similarity between neighboring pixels.

The goal of normalized cuts is to find a partition of the graph that minimizes the cut between the foreground and background, while maximizing the cut between different moving objects. This is achieved by normalizing the cut function, which is defined as the sum of the edge weights between the foreground and background pixels.

The normalized cut function can be written as:

$$
NC(F,B) = \frac{cut(F,B)}{ass(F)} + \frac{cut(F,B)}{ass(B)}
$$

where $F$ and $B$ represent the foreground and background pixels, respectively, and $cut(F,B)$ and $ass(F)$ are the cut and assignment functions, respectively.

The normalized cut function can be minimized using various optimization techniques, such as linear programming or graph cuts. The resulting partition of the graph represents the segmented moving objects in the scene.

#### 10.2c Applications of Motion Segmentation

Motion segmentation has a wide range of applications in vision science. Some of the most common applications include object tracking, recognition, and interaction.

Object tracking involves the process of tracking the movement of a specific object or object group in a scene. This is crucial for tasks such as surveillance, robotics, and human-computer interaction. Motion segmentation techniques, such as normalized cuts, can be used to segment the moving object from the background, making it easier to track its movement.

Object recognition involves the process of identifying and classifying objects in a scene. This is essential for tasks such as image retrieval, object detection, and scene understanding. Motion segmentation techniques can be used to segment moving objects from the background, making it easier to recognize and classify them.

Interaction with moving objects is another important application of motion segmentation. This involves the process of interacting with moving objects in a scene, such as catching a ball or avoiding a moving obstacle. Motion segmentation techniques can be used to segment the moving object from the background, allowing for more accurate and efficient interaction.

In conclusion, motion segmentation is a crucial aspect of vision science that has numerous applications. Techniques such as normalized cuts have proven to be effective for this task and have been widely used in various applications. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more sophisticated motion segmentation techniques being developed.





#### 10.3a Optical Flow

Optical flow is a technique used in computer vision to estimate the motion between two image frames. It is based on the assumption that the brightness of a pixel in an image remains constant over time, known as the brightness constancy constraint. This assumption allows us to estimate the motion between two image frames by calculating the optical flow of each pixel.

The optical flow methods try to calculate the motion between two image frames which are taken at times $t$ and $t+\Delta t$ at every voxel position. These methods are called differential since they are based on local Taylor series approximations of the image signal; that is, they use partial derivatives with respect to the spatial and temporal coordinates.

For a (2D + "t")-dimensional case (3D or "n"-D cases are similar) a voxel at location $(x,y,t)$ with intensity $I(x,y,t)$ will have moved by $\Delta x$, $\Delta y$ and $\Delta t$ between the two image frames, and the following "brightness constancy constraint" can be given:

$$
I(x,y,t) = I(x+\Delta x,y+\Delta y,t+\Delta t)
$$

Assuming the movement to be small, the image constraint at $I(x,y,t)$ with Taylor series can be developed to get:

$$
I(x+\Delta x,y+\Delta y,t+\Delta t) = I(x,y,t) + \frac{\partial I}{\partial x}\Delta x + \frac{\partial I}{\partial y}\Delta y + \frac{\partial I}{\partial t}\Delta t
$$

By truncating the higher order terms (which performs a linearization) it follows that:

$$
\frac{\partial I}{\partial x}\Delta x + \frac{\partial I}{\partial y}\Delta y + \frac{\partial I}{\partial t}\Delta t = 0
$$

or, dividing by $\Delta t$,

$$
\frac{\partial I}{\partial x}V_x + \frac{\partial I}{\partial y}V_y + \frac{\partial I}{\partial t} = 0
$$

where $V_x$,$V_y$ are the $x$ and $y$ components of the velocity or optical flow of $I(x,y,t)$ and $\frac{\partial I}{\partial x}$, $\frac{\partial I}{\partial y}$ and $\frac{\partial I}{\partial t}$ are the derivatives of the image at $(x,y,t)$ in the corresponding directions. $I_x$,$I_y$ and $I_t$ can be written for the derivatives in the following.

Thus:

$$
\frac{\partial I}{\partial x}V_x + \frac{\partial I}{\partial y}V_y + \frac{\partial I}{\partial t} = 0
$$

This is an equation in two unknowns and cannot be solved as such. This is known as the "aperture problem" in optical flow estimation. Various methods have been proposed to solve this problem, including the use of constraints and regularization techniques.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of object tracking, which is a key application of optical flow estimation.

#### 10.3b Tracking Techniques

Object tracking is a fundamental problem in computer vision that involves the estimation of the motion of an object over time. It is a crucial component in many applications, including video surveillance, robotics, and human-computer interaction. In this section, we will explore some of the techniques used for object tracking.

##### Kalman Filter

The Kalman filter is a recursive estimator that provides the optimal estimate of the state of a dynamic system. It is widely used in tracking applications due to its ability to handle noisy measurements and non-linear systems. The Kalman filter operates in two steps: prediction and update. In the prediction step, the filter predicts the state of the system at the next time step. In the update step, it updates this prediction based on the actual measurement.

The Kalman filter is particularly useful for tracking objects in a noisy environment. It can handle both linear and non-linear systems, making it a versatile tool for object tracking.

##### Particle Filter

The particle filter is a non-parametric approach to state estimation. It represents the state of the system by a set of particles, each with a weight that represents its importance. The particles are propagated over time according to the system dynamics, and their weights are updated based on the likelihood of the measurements.

The particle filter is particularly useful for tracking objects in non-linear and non-Gaussian systems. It can handle a wide range of system dynamics and measurement models, making it a powerful tool for object tracking.

##### Mean-Shift Tracking

Mean-shift tracking is a non-parametric method for object tracking. It operates by iteratively moving the estimate of the object's location to the mode of the probability density function of the object's appearance.

Mean-shift tracking is particularly useful for tracking objects with a well-defined appearance. It can handle non-linear and non-Gaussian systems, making it a versatile tool for object tracking.

##### Optical Flow

Optical flow is a technique for estimating the motion of an object over time. It operates by tracking the movement of pixels in a video sequence.

Optical flow is particularly useful for tracking objects with a well-defined boundary. It can handle non-linear and non-Gaussian systems, making it a versatile tool for object tracking.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of optical flow and explore some of its applications in object tracking.

The study of human perception is a key area of vision science. It involves understanding how the brain processes visual information to recognize objects and interpret the environment. Techniques like the Kalman filter and particle filter have been used to model the process of perception. For instance, the Kalman filter can be used to model the process of object recognition, where the state of the system represents the object's location and orientation, and the measurements represent the visual information about the object.

##### Imaging Techniques

Imaging techniques play a crucial role in medical diagnosis. These techniques involve capturing images of the body's internal structures for diagnosis and treatment planning. Techniques like mean-shift tracking and optical flow have been used to develop imaging techniques for medical diagnosis. For instance, mean-shift tracking can be used to track the movement of a tumor in a video sequence captured by an endoscope, providing valuable information for diagnosis and treatment planning.

##### Motion Segmentation

Motion segmentation is a key problem in computer vision. It involves dividing a video sequence into different moving objects. Techniques like normalized cuts and optical flow have been used to solve this problem. For instance, normalized cuts can be used to segment a video sequence into different moving objects by minimizing the cut between different objects.

In conclusion, the techniques discussed in this chapter have found numerous applications in the field of vision science. They have been used to model human perception, develop imaging techniques for medical diagnosis, and solve problems in computer vision. As the field of vision science continues to grow, these techniques will undoubtedly play an increasingly important role in advancing our understanding of vision and imaging.

## Chapter: Chapter 11: Visual Attention and Scene Perception

### Introduction

The human visual system is a complex and intricate mechanism that allows us to perceive and interpret the world around us. It is a system that is constantly adapting and evolving, and one of the key aspects of this system is visual attention and scene perception. In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of visual attention and scene perception, exploring how we perceive and interpret the visual information that surrounds us.

Visual attention is a cognitive process that allows us to selectively focus on specific aspects of our visual environment while ignoring others. It is a crucial aspect of perception, as it allows us to prioritize and process the information that is most relevant to us. We will explore the mechanisms behind visual attention, including the role of top-down and bottom-up processes, and how these processes interact to guide our perception.

Scene perception, on the other hand, refers to our ability to perceive and interpret the visual information in our environment. It involves the integration of sensory information from our visual system with our knowledge and expectations about the world. We will explore the various factors that influence scene perception, including the role of context, prior knowledge, and attentional processes.

Throughout this chapter, we will also discuss the implications of visual attention and scene perception for various fields, including computer vision, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction. We will explore how understanding these processes can help us design more effective and intuitive interfaces, and how it can inform the development of artificial systems that can perceive and interpret the world around them.

In the end, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of visual attention and scene perception, shedding light on the complex processes that underlie our perception of the visual world. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or simply someone with a keen interest in the human visual system, we hope that this chapter will provide you with a deeper understanding of these fascinating topics.




#### 10.3b Tracking-by-Detection

Tracking-by-detection is a method used in computer vision to track the movement of objects in a video sequence. This method is based on the concept of detection, where the object of interest is detected in each frame of the video sequence. The detected objects are then used to estimate the motion between consecutive frames, which is used to track the object's movement over time.

The tracking-by-detection method is particularly useful when dealing with non-rigid objects, where the assumption of constant shape and size, as in optical flow, may not hold. It is also useful when dealing with occlusions, where the object may be partially or completely hidden from view for a period of time.

The basic steps of tracking-by-detection are as follows:

1. **Object detection**: The first step in tracking-by-detection is to detect the object of interest in each frame of the video sequence. This can be done using various techniques such as template matching, edge detection, or machine learning algorithms.

2. **Motion estimation**: Once the object is detected in each frame, the motion between consecutive frames is estimated. This is typically done using optical flow techniques, as discussed in the previous section.

3. **Object tracking**: The estimated motion is then used to track the object's movement over time. This is typically done by predicting the object's location in the next frame based on its current location and the estimated motion.

4. **Object update**: If the predicted location does not match the actual location of the object in the next frame, the object's location and motion parameters are updated to better match the actual motion.

5. **Repeat**: The process is repeated for each frame in the video sequence, updating the object's location and motion parameters as needed.

Tracking-by-detection is a powerful method for tracking the movement of objects in a video sequence. However, it is important to note that it relies on the accuracy of the object detection and motion estimation steps. Therefore, the performance of tracking-by-detection can be significantly affected by the quality of these steps.

### Subsection: 12.1 Advanced Lightness Perception

#### 12.1a Advanced Lightness Perception

Lightness perception is a complex aspect of vision science that involves the interpretation of the brightness of objects in our environment. It is a crucial component of our perception of color, as it influences how we perceive the hue and saturation of objects. In this section, we will delve deeper into the advanced topics related to lightness perception, building upon the foundational knowledge established in earlier chapters.

The CIECAM97s color appearance model, proposed by Fairchild, was a significant step forward in the study of lightness perception. However, it had some limitations that needed to be addressed. For instance, the model predicted a non-zero lightness for absolute black, which was not in line with our perception. To fix this, Li, Luo, and Hunt suggested subtracting 3.05 instead of 2.05 from the cone responses, thereby ensuring that the scale starts at zero.

Further improvements were proposed by Hunt, Li, Juan, and Luo. One of these was to lower the value of z slightly. This was found to result in a more perceptually uniform color space when used as one of the coordinates.

The shape of the cone response S-curve also plays a role in lightness perception. As the luminance of a color is reduced, even if its spectral composition remains the same, the different cone responses do not quite change at the same rate with respect to each other. This can result in changes in perceived hue and saturation at low luminance levels. To address this, Hunt, Li, and Luo suggested using a cone response curve that approximates a power curve for a larger range of stimuli.

These proposals, along with others relating to chromaticity, resulted in a new color appearance model, CIECAM02. In this model, the formula for lightness remains the same, but all the quantities that feed into this formula have been modified to improve the model's predictions of lightness perception.

In the next section, we will explore the role of lightness perception in imaging techniques, such as photography and computer vision. We will discuss how these techniques rely on the properties of lightness perception to capture and process visual information.

#### 12.1b Advanced Lightness Perception

In the previous section, we discussed the CIECAM02 color appearance model and its improvements over the CIECAM97s model. In this section, we will delve deeper into the advanced topics related to lightness perception, focusing on the role of surround conditions and the impact of luminance on perceived lightness.

The CIECAM02 model, like its predecessor, takes into account the surround conditions under which a color is perceived. The surround factor c, which represents the ratio of the luminance of the surround to the luminance of the test field, is used to adjust the lightness of the test field. However, unlike the CIECAM97s model, the CIECAM02 model allows for linear interpolation of c, thereby enabling its use under intermediate surround conditions.

The impact of luminance on perceived lightness is another important aspect of lightness perception. As the luminance of a color is reduced, its perceived lightness also decreases. This is due to the shape of the cone response S-curve, which causes the different cone responses to change at different rates with respect to each other. This can result in changes in perceived hue and saturation at low luminance levels.

To address this issue, the CIECAM02 model proposes the use of a cone response curve that approximates a power curve for a larger range of stimuli. This allows for better preservation of hue and saturation at low luminance levels.

In addition to these improvements, the CIECAM02 model also proposes a simplification of the z term, which is used to account for the size of the stimulus. This simplification is based on the assumption that the z term is irrelevant for imaging applications.

Overall, the CIECAM02 model represents a significant advancement in the study of lightness perception. Its improvements over the CIECAM97s model, along with its ability to account for surround conditions and the impact of luminance, make it a valuable tool for understanding and predicting how we perceive the lightness of objects in our environment.

In the next section, we will explore the role of lightness perception in imaging techniques, focusing on how the CIECAM02 model can be used to improve the accuracy of color reproduction in digital images.

#### 12.1c Applications of Advanced Lightness Perception

The CIECAM02 model, with its improved understanding of lightness perception, has found numerous applications in the field of vision science. In this section, we will explore some of these applications, focusing on the use of the CIECAM02 model in color reproduction and imaging.

##### Color Reproduction

One of the primary applications of the CIECAM02 model is in color reproduction. The model is used to predict the perceived lightness of a color, which is crucial in the process of color printing and digital image processing. By accurately predicting the perceived lightness of a color, the CIECAM02 model can help in the design of color spaces that are more perceptually uniform, leading to better color reproduction.

For instance, the CIECAM02 model can be used to design a color space where the perceived lightness of a color is directly proportional to its luminance. This would result in a color space where colors with the same luminance are perceived as having the same lightness, leading to better color reproduction.

##### Imaging

The CIECAM02 model also finds applications in imaging. The model is used to predict the perceived lightness of a color in an image, which is crucial in the process of image enhancement and restoration. By accurately predicting the perceived lightness of a color, the CIECAM02 model can help in the design of image processing algorithms that can enhance the perceived lightness of an image.

For instance, the CIECAM02 model can be used to design an image processing algorithm that can enhance the perceived lightness of an image by adjusting the luminance of the image. This would result in an image where the perceived lightness of the colors is enhanced, leading to a more visually appealing image.

##### Surface Reflectance

The CIECAM02 model also has applications in the study of surface reflectance. The model is used to predict the perceived lightness of a surface, which is crucial in the study of how surfaces reflect light. By accurately predicting the perceived lightness of a surface, the CIECAM02 model can help in the design of surface reflectance models that can accurately predict the reflectance of a surface.

For instance, the CIECAM02 model can be used to design a surface reflectance model that can accurately predict the reflectance of a surface based on its perceived lightness. This would result in a surface reflectance model where the perceived lightness of a surface is directly proportional to its reflectance, leading to a more accurate prediction of surface reflectance.

In conclusion, the CIECAM02 model, with its improved understanding of lightness perception, has found numerous applications in the field of vision science. Its applications in color reproduction, imaging, and surface reflectance make it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in these fields.

### Subsection: 12.2 Advanced Lightness Illusions

#### 12.2a Advanced Simultaneous Contrast

Simultaneous contrast is a phenomenon in vision science where the perceived lightness of a color is influenced by the lightness of its surround. This effect was first described by Ewald Hering in the 19th century, and it is a fundamental aspect of our perception of color.

The simultaneous contrast effect can be explained in terms of the CIECAM97s color appearance model. According to this model, the perceived lightness of a color is determined by the ratio of the cone responses to the maximum cone response. The surround of a color can influence this ratio, thereby affecting the perceived lightness of the color.

For instance, consider a white patch surrounded by a black patch. The black patch reduces the maximum cone response, thereby increasing the ratio of the cone responses to the maximum cone response. This results in the white patch appearing lighter than it would in the absence of the black surround.

Conversely, if the white patch is surrounded by a white patch, the maximum cone response is not reduced, and the ratio of the cone responses to the maximum cone response is lower. This results in the white patch appearing darker than it would in the absence of the white surround.

The simultaneous contrast effect can be quantified using the CIECAM97s color appearance model. The perceived lightness of a color, $L^*$, can be calculated using the formula:

$$
L^* = \frac{R^* + G^* + B^*}{3}
$$

where $R^*$, $G^*$, and $B^*$ are the cone responses for red, green, and blue, respectively. The surround of a color can influence the cone responses, and hence the perceived lightness, of the color.

In the next section, we will explore another advanced topic in lightness perception: the role of the shape of the cone response S-curve in lightness perception.

#### 12.2b Advanced Lightness Contrast

Lightness contrast is another important aspect of lightness perception in vision science. It refers to the difference in perceived lightness between two colors. This concept is closely related to the simultaneous contrast effect, but it also takes into account the lightness of the surround.

The lightness contrast of a color can be quantified using the CIECAM97s color appearance model. The lightness contrast, $L_{contrast}$, can be calculated using the formula:

$$
L_{contrast} = \frac{L^*_{color} - L^*_{surround}}{L^*_{max} - L^*_{min}}
$$

where $L^*_{color}$ and $L^*_{surround}$ are the perceived lightness of the color and its surround, respectively, and $L^*_{max}$ and $L^*_{min}$ are the maximum and minimum perceived lightness, respectively.

The lightness contrast can range from 0 (no contrast) to 1 (maximum contrast). A lightness contrast of 0 indicates that the color and its surround have the same perceived lightness, while a lightness contrast of 1 indicates that the color and its surround have maximum perceived lightness difference.

The lightness contrast can be influenced by several factors, including the color of the color and its surround, the surround of the color, and the surround of the surround of the color. For instance, a color surrounded by a color of the same lightness will have a lower lightness contrast than a color surrounded by a color of a different lightness. Similarly, a color surrounded by a surround of the same lightness will have a lower lightness contrast than a color surrounded by a surround of a different lightness.

The lightness contrast can also be influenced by the shape of the cone response S-curve. As mentioned in the previous section, the shape of the cone response S-curve can affect the perceived hue and saturation of a color at low luminance levels. Similarly, the shape of the cone response S-curve can affect the perceived lightness of a color. A steeper S-curve can result in a higher lightness contrast, while a flatter S-curve can result in a lower lightness contrast.

In the next section, we will explore another advanced topic in lightness perception: the role of the shape of the cone response S-curve in lightness perception.

#### 12.2c Advanced Lightness Illusion

The advanced lightness illusion is a phenomenon in vision science where the perceived lightness of a color can be influenced by the lightness of its surround, as well as the lightness of the surround of the surround. This illusion is a further extension of the simultaneous contrast and lightness contrast effects, and it can be quantified using the CIECAM97s color appearance model.

The advanced lightness illusion can be quantified using the formula for lightness contrast, as discussed in the previous section. However, in this case, the lightness contrast is calculated not only for the color and its surround, but also for the surround of the color and its surround. This results in a more complex calculation of the lightness contrast, which can range from 0 (no illusion) to 1 (maximum illusion).

The advanced lightness illusion can be influenced by several factors, including the color of the color and its surround, the surround of the color, and the surround of the surround of the color. For instance, a color surrounded by a color of the same lightness will have a lower lightness contrast than a color surrounded by a color of a different lightness. Similarly, a color surrounded by a surround of the same lightness will have a lower lightness contrast than a color surrounded by a surround of a different lightness.

The advanced lightness illusion can also be influenced by the shape of the cone response S-curve. As mentioned in the previous sections, the shape of the cone response S-curve can affect the perceived hue, saturation, and lightness of a color. In the case of the advanced lightness illusion, the shape of the cone response S-curve can result in a higher or lower lightness contrast, depending on the specific characteristics of the color and its surround.

In the next section, we will explore another advanced topic in lightness perception: the role of the shape of the cone response S-curve in lightness perception.

#### 12.3a Advanced Color Constancy

Color constancy is a fundamental aspect of color perception in vision science. It refers to the ability of the visual system to maintain the perceived color of an object despite changes in the illumination. This is crucial for our perception of the world, as it allows us to recognize objects and their colors even when they are viewed under different lighting conditions.

The advanced color constancy is an extension of the basic color constancy, and it takes into account the color of the surround of the color. This is because the color of the surround can influence the perceived color of the color, and hence the color constancy.

The advanced color constancy can be quantified using the CIECAM97s color appearance model. The color constancy, $C_{constancy}$, can be calculated using the formula:

$$
C_{constancy} = \frac{C_{color} - C_{surround}}{C_{max} - C_{min}}
$$

where $C_{color}$ and $C_{surround}$ are the color constancy of the color and its surround, respectively, and $C_{max}$ and $C_{min}$ are the maximum and minimum color constancy, respectively.

The color constancy can range from 0 (no constancy) to 1 (maximum constancy). A color constancy of 0 indicates that the color and its surround have the same color constancy, while a color constancy of 1 indicates that the color and its surround have maximum color constancy difference.

The color constancy can be influenced by several factors, including the color of the color and its surround, the surround of the color, and the surround of the surround of the color. For instance, a color surrounded by a color of the same color constancy will have a lower color constancy than a color surrounded by a color of a different color constancy. Similarly, a color surrounded by a surround of the same color constancy will have a lower color constancy than a color surrounded by a surround of a different color constancy.

The color constancy can also be influenced by the shape of the cone response S-curve. As mentioned in the previous sections, the shape of the cone response S-curve can affect the perceived hue, saturation, and lightness of a color. In the case of the advanced color constancy, the shape of the cone response S-curve can result in a higher or lower color constancy, depending on the specific characteristics of the color and its surround.

#### 12.3b Advanced Color Shift

Color shift is another important aspect of color perception in vision science. It refers to the change in the perceived color of an object when viewed under different lighting conditions. This is a common phenomenon that we encounter in our daily lives, for instance, when we see a colored object under different types of light.

The advanced color shift is an extension of the basic color shift, and it takes into account the color of the surround of the color. This is because the color of the surround can influence the perceived color of the color, and hence the color shift.

The advanced color shift can be quantified using the CIECAM97s color appearance model. The color shift, $S_{shift}$, can be calculated using the formula:

$$
S_{shift} = \frac{S_{color} - S_{surround}}{S_{max} - S_{min}}
$$

where $S_{color}$ and $S_{surround}$ are the color shift of the color and its surround, respectively, and $S_{max}$ and $S_{min}$ are the maximum and minimum color shift, respectively.

The color shift can range from 0 (no shift) to 1 (maximum shift). A color shift of 0 indicates that the color and its surround have the same color shift, while a color shift of 1 indicates that the color and its surround have maximum color shift difference.

The color shift can be influenced by several factors, including the color of the color and its surround, the surround of the color, and the surround of the surround of the color. For instance, a color surrounded by a color of the same color shift will have a lower color shift than a color surrounded by a color of a different color shift. Similarly, a color surrounded by a surround of the same color shift will have a lower color shift than a color surrounded by a surround of a different color shift.

The color shift can also be influenced by the shape of the cone response S-curve. As mentioned in the previous sections, the shape of the cone response S-curve can affect the perceived hue, saturation, and lightness of a color. In the case of the advanced color shift, the shape of the cone response S-curve can result in a higher or lower color shift, depending on the specific characteristics of the color and its surround.

#### 12.3c Advanced Color Appearance

Color appearance is a crucial aspect of color perception in vision science. It refers to the overall perception of a color, taking into account its lightness, colorfulness, and hue. The advanced color appearance is an extension of the basic color appearance, and it takes into account the color of the surround of the color. This is because the color of the surround can influence the perceived color of the color, and hence the color appearance.

The advanced color appearance can be quantified using the CIECAM97s color appearance model. The color appearance, $A_{appearance}$, can be calculated using the formula:

$$
A_{appearance} = \frac{A_{color} - A_{surround}}{A_{max} - A_{min}}
$$

where $A_{color}$ and $A_{surround}$ are the color appearance of the color and its surround, respectively, and $A_{max}$ and $A_{min}$ are the maximum and minimum color appearance, respectively.

The color appearance can range from 0 (no appearance) to 1 (maximum appearance). A color appearance of 0 indicates that the color and its surround have the same color appearance, while a color appearance of 1 indicates that the color and its surround have maximum color appearance difference.

The color appearance can be influenced by several factors, including the color of the color and its surround, the surround of the color, and the surround of the surround of the color. For instance, a color surrounded by a color of the same color appearance will have a lower color appearance than a color surrounded by a color of a different color appearance. Similarly, a color surrounded by a surround of the same color appearance will have a lower color appearance than a color surrounded by a surround of a different color appearance.

The color appearance can also be influenced by the shape of the cone response S-curve. As mentioned in the previous sections, the shape of the cone response S-curve can affect the perceived hue, saturation, and lightness of a color. In the case of the advanced color appearance, the shape of the cone response S-curve can result in a higher or lower color appearance, depending on the specific characteristics of the color and its surround.

So, let's embark on this journey into the advanced topics in imaging, exploring the intricate details of how we perceive and interpret visual information.




#### 12.2b Advanced Luminance Constancy

Luminance constancy is a fundamental aspect of our perception of lightness. It refers to the ability of the visual system to maintain the perceived lightness of a color despite changes in the luminance of the surrounding environment. This phenomenon is crucial for our perception of color in different lighting conditions.

The concept of luminance constancy can be understood in terms of the CIECAM97s color appearance model. According to this model, the perceived lightness of a color is determined by the ratio of the cone responses to the maximum cone response. Changes in the luminance of the surrounding environment can affect the maximum cone response, thereby influencing the perceived lightness of a color.

For instance, consider a white patch in a dark room. The dark room reduces the maximum cone response, thereby increasing the ratio of the cone responses to the maximum cone response. This results in the white patch appearing lighter than it would in a bright room.

Conversely, if the white patch is in a bright room, the maximum cone response is not reduced, and the ratio of the cone responses to the maximum cone response is lower. This results in the white patch appearing darker than it would in a dark room.

The luminance constancy effect can be quantified using the CIECAM97s color appearance model. The perceived lightness of a color, $L^*$, can be calculated using the formula:

$$
L^* = \frac{R^* + G^* + B^*}{3}
$$

where $R^*$, $G^*$, and $B^*$ are the cone responses for red, green, and blue, respectively. Changes in the luminance of the surrounding environment can affect the cone responses, and hence the perceived lightness, of a color.

In the next section, we will explore another advanced topic in lightness perception: the role of the shape of the cone response S-curve in lightness perception.

#### 12.2c Advanced Lightness Illusions

Lightness illusions are a fascinating aspect of lightness perception. They occur when our perception of the lightness of a color is influenced by the context in which it is presented. This can lead to apparent changes in the lightness of a color that are not actually present in the stimulus.

One of the most well-known lightness illusions is the Ponzo illusion. In this illusion, two lines of the same length appear to be different lengths due to the context in which they are presented. The line that is presented against a background of shorter lines appears longer, and the line that is presented against a background of longer lines appears shorter. This illusion can be explained in terms of the CIECAM97s color appearance model.

According to the CIECAM97s model, the perceived lightness of a color is determined by the ratio of the cone responses to the maximum cone response. In the Ponzo illusion, the context of the shorter or longer lines can affect the maximum cone response, thereby influencing the perceived lightness of the lines.

For instance, consider a line presented against a background of shorter lines. The shorter lines reduce the maximum cone response, thereby increasing the ratio of the cone responses to the maximum cone response. This results in the line appearing lighter than it would in a context of longer lines.

Conversely, if the line is presented against a background of longer lines, the maximum cone response is not reduced, and the ratio of the cone responses to the maximum cone response is lower. This results in the line appearing darker than it would in a context of shorter lines.

The Ponzo illusion can be quantified using the CIECAM97s color appearance model. The perceived lightness of a color, $L^*$, can be calculated using the formula:

$$
L^* = \frac{R^* + G^* + B^*}{3}
$$

where $R^*$, $G^*$, and $B^*$ are the cone responses for red, green, and blue, respectively. The context of the lines can affect the cone responses, and hence the perceived lightness, of the lines.

In the next section, we will explore another advanced topic in lightness perception: the role of the shape of the cone response S-curve in lightness perception.

#### 12.3a Advanced Color Constancy

Color constancy is a fundamental aspect of our perception of color. It refers to the ability of the visual system to maintain the perceived color of a surface despite changes in the illumination of the surrounding environment. This phenomenon is crucial for our perception of color in different lighting conditions.

The concept of color constancy can be understood in terms of the CIECAM97s color appearance model. According to this model, the perceived color of a surface is determined by the ratio of the cone responses to the maximum cone response. Changes in the illumination of the surrounding environment can affect the maximum cone response, thereby influencing the perceived color of a surface.

For instance, consider a red surface in a dark room. The dark room reduces the maximum cone response, thereby increasing the ratio of the cone responses to the maximum cone response. This results in the red surface appearing brighter than it would in a bright room.

Conversely, if the red surface is in a bright room, the maximum cone response is not reduced, and the ratio of the cone responses to the maximum cone response is lower. This results in the red surface appearing darker than it would in a dark room.

The color constancy effect can be quantified using the CIECAM97s color appearance model. The perceived color of a surface, $L^*$, can be calculated using the formula:

$$
L^* = \frac{R^* + G^* + B^*}{3}
$$

where $R^*$, $G^*$, and $B^*$ are the cone responses for red, green, and blue, respectively. Changes in the illumination of the surrounding environment can affect the cone responses, and hence the perceived color, of a surface.

In the next section, we will explore another advanced topic in color perception: the role of the shape of the cone response S-curve in color perception.

#### 12.3b Advanced Color Contrast

Color contrast is a crucial aspect of our perception of color. It refers to the ability of the visual system to distinguish between different colors. This phenomenon is crucial for our perception of color in different lighting conditions.

The concept of color contrast can be understood in terms of the CIECAM97s color appearance model. According to this model, the perceived color contrast between two surfaces is determined by the ratio of the cone responses of the two surfaces to the maximum cone response. Changes in the illumination of the surrounding environment can affect the maximum cone response, thereby influencing the perceived color contrast between two surfaces.

For instance, consider two surfaces, one red and one green, in a dark room. The dark room reduces the maximum cone response, thereby increasing the ratio of the cone responses to the maximum cone response. This results in the red surface appearing brighter than the green surface, and hence the color contrast between the two surfaces appears higher than it would in a bright room.

Conversely, if the red and green surfaces are in a bright room, the maximum cone response is not reduced, and the ratio of the cone responses to the maximum cone response is lower. This results in the red surface appearing darker than the green surface, and hence the color contrast between the two surfaces appears lower than it would in a dark room.

The color contrast effect can be quantified using the CIECAM97s color appearance model. The perceived color contrast between two surfaces, $L^*$, can be calculated using the formula:

$$
L^* = \frac{R^* + G^* + B^*}{3}
$$

where $R^*$, $G^*$, and $B^*$ are the cone responses for red, green, and blue, respectively. Changes in the illumination of the surrounding environment can affect the cone responses, and hence the perceived color contrast, between two surfaces.

In the next section, we will explore another advanced topic in color perception: the role of the shape of the cone response S-curve in color perception.

#### 12.3c Advanced Color Illusions

Color illusions are a fascinating aspect of color perception. They occur when our perception of color is influenced by the context in which it is presented. This can lead to apparent changes in the color of a surface that are not actually present in the stimulus.

One of the most well-known color illusions is the Munker illusion. In this illusion, a central patch of color appears to change color depending on the context in which it is presented. This illusion can be explained in terms of the CIECAM97s color appearance model.

According to the CIECAM97s model, the perceived color of a surface is determined by the ratio of the cone responses to the maximum cone response. Changes in the context of the central patch can affect the maximum cone response, thereby influencing the perceived color of the central patch.

For instance, consider a central patch of red presented against a background of green. The green background reduces the maximum cone response, thereby increasing the ratio of the cone responses to the maximum cone response. This results in the red patch appearing brighter than it would against a background of red, and hence the color of the red patch appears to shift towards yellow.

Conversely, if the red patch is presented against a background of red, the maximum cone response is not reduced, and the ratio of the cone responses to the maximum cone response is lower. This results in the red patch appearing darker than it would against a background of green, and hence the color of the red patch appears to shift towards blue.

The Munker illusion can be quantified using the CIECAM97s color appearance model. The perceived color of the central patch, $L^*$, can be calculated using the formula:

$$
L^* = \frac{R^* + G^* + B^*}{3}
$$

where $R^*$, $G^*$, and $B^*$ are the cone responses for red, green, and blue, respectively. Changes in the context of the central patch can affect the cone responses, and hence the perceived color, of the central patch.

In the next section, we will explore another advanced topic in color perception: the role of the shape of the cone response S-curve in color perception.

By inducing strabismus, researchers can study how the visual system adapts to this condition and how it affects the perception of depth.

##### Inter-Pupillary Distance (IPD)

Inter-pupillary distance (IPD) is the distance between the centers of the pupils of the eyes. This measurement is crucial in binocular vision as it determines the separation of the two images that are received by the retinas. Variations in IPD can lead to binocular vision disorders, such as strabismus and amblyopia.

##### Stereopsis Recovery

Stereopsis recovery is a technique used to study the mechanisms of stereopsis, the perception of depth based on the difference in the images received by the two eyes. This technique involves training individuals with binocular vision disorders, such as convergence insufficiency and decompensating exophoria, to improve their near-point convergence. This training can lead to improvements in stereoacuity, the ability to perceive depth.

Experiments on monkeys have shown that extensive psychophysical training can improve stereoacuity in monkeys who have been raised with binocular deprivation. However, these improvements remain limited compared to those of normally raised monkeys.

Human studies have also shown promising results. A study published in 2011 reported on a study on human stereopsis recovery using perceptual learning which was inspired by Barry's work. In this study, a small number of stereoblind subjects who had initially been stereoblind or stereoanomalous recovered stereopsis using perceptual learning exercises. The authors of this study pointed out that the stereopsis that was recovered following perceptual learning was more limited in resolution and depth range compared to that of normally sighted individuals.

For example, a single point that appears at the "x" coordinate "t" (measured in pixels) in the left image may be present at the "x" coordinate "t" − 3 in the right image. In this case, the disparity at that location in the right image would be 3 pixels.

Stereo images may not always be correctly aligned to allow for quick disparity calculation. For example, the set of cameras may be slightly rotated off level. Through a process known as image rectification, both images are rotated to allow for disparities in only the horizontal direction (i.e., there is no disparity in the "y" image coordinates). This is a property that can also be achieved by precise alignment of the stereo cameras before image capture.

##### Advanced Techniques for Utilizing Binocular Disparity

Once the binocular disparity is computed, it can be used in various advanced techniques for depth perception. One such technique is the use of a computer algorithm to solve the correspondence problem. This problem involves scanning both the left and right images for matching image features. A common approach to this problem is to form a smaller image patch around every pixel in the left image. These image patches are compared to all possible disparities in the right image by comparing their corresponding image patches.

For example, for a disparity of 1, the patch in the left image would be compared to a similar-sized patch in the right, shifted to the left by one pixel. The comparison between these two patches can be made by attaining a computational measure from one of the following equations that compares each of the pixels in the patches. For all of the following equations, "L" and "R" refer to the left and right columns while "r" and "c" refer to the current row and column:

$$
D = \sum_{r,c} |L_{r,c} - R_{r,c}|
$$

$$
D = \sum_{r,c} |L_{r,c} - R_{r,c}|^2
$$

$$
D = \sum_{r,c} |L_{r,c} - R_{r,c}|^3
$$

where "D" is the disparity measure, and "L" and "R" are the left and right image patches, respectively.

In conclusion, advanced techniques for computing and utilizing binocular disparity are crucial for understanding and improving depth perception. These techniques have numerous applications in various fields, including computer vision, robotics, and human-computer interaction.




### Subsection: 13.3b Advanced Stereopsis and Vergence

Stereopsis and vergence are two fundamental concepts in stereo vision. Stereopsis refers to the perception of depth from the disparity between the two eyes' views of a scene, while vergence refers to the convergence of the two eyes' gaze towards a point in space. In this section, we will explore advanced techniques for enhancing stereopsis and vergence.

#### 13.3b Advanced Stereopsis and Vergence

##### Enhancing Stereopsis

Stereopsis can be enhanced through various techniques, including the use of advanced stereoscopic displays and training procedures. Advanced stereoscopic displays, such as autostereoscopic displays, can present stereoscopic content without matching focal depth, thereby exhibiting vergence-accommodation conflict. This conflict can enhance stereopsis by forcing the viewer to actively adjust their vergence and accommodation, thereby improving their depth perception.

Training procedures, such as orthoptic exercises, can also enhance stereopsis. These exercises have been proven to be effective for reducing symptoms in patients with convergence insufficiency and decompensating exophoria by improving the near-point convergence of the eyes that is necessary for binocular fusion. Experiments on monkeys have revealed improvements in stereoacuity in monkeys who, after having been raised with binocular deprivation through prisms for the first two years, were exposed to extensive psychophysical training. Their stereo vision recovered in part, but remained far more limited than that of normally raised monkeys.

##### Enhancing Vergence

Vergence can be enhanced through the use of advanced stereoscopic displays and training procedures. Advanced stereoscopic displays, such as autostereoscopic displays, can present stereoscopic content without matching focal depth, thereby exhibiting vergence-accommodation conflict. This conflict can enhance vergence by forcing the viewer to actively adjust their vergence and accommodation, thereby improving their depth perception.

Training procedures, such as orthoptic exercises, can also enhance vergence. These exercises have been proven to be effective for reducing symptoms in patients with convergence insufficiency and decompensating exophoria by improving the near-point convergence of the eyes that is necessary for binocular fusion. Experiments on monkeys have revealed improvements in stereoacuity in monkeys who, after having been raised with binocular deprivation through prisms for the first two years, were exposed to extensive psychophysical training. Their stereo vision recovered in part, but remained far more limited than that of normally raised monkeys.

##### Perceptual Learning and Stereopsis Recovery

Perceptual learning plays an important role in stereopsis recovery. One investigation, published 2011, reported on a study on human stereopsis recovery using perceptual learning which was inspired by Barry's work. In this study, a small number of stereoblind subjects who had initially been stereoblind or stereoanomalous recovered stereopsis using perceptual learning exercises. Alongside the scientific assessment of the extent of recovery, also the subjective outcomes are described:

After achieving stereopsis, our observers reported that the depth "popped out," which they found very helpful and joyful in their everyday life. The anisometropic observer GD noticed "a surge in depth" one day when shopping in a supermarket. While playing table tennis, she feels that she is able to track a ping-pong ball more accurately and therefore can play better. Strabismic observer AB is more confident now when walking down stairs because she can judge the depth of the steps better. Strabismics AB, DP, and LR, are able to enjoy 3D movies for the first time, and strabismic GJ finds it easier to catch a fly.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, advanced stereopsis and vergence techniques can significantly enhance depth perception and improve the quality of stereoscopic displays. These techniques, including advanced stereoscopic displays and training procedures, can be used to overcome the limitations of traditional stereoscopic systems and provide a more immersive and realistic visual experience.

In the previous chapters, we have explored the basics of specularity and its role in perception and imaging. In this section, we will delve deeper into the topic of specular reflections, focusing on advanced concepts such as multiple distributions and the use of different distribution functions.

#### 15.1a Advanced Concepts in Specular Reflections

The Cook–Torrance model, as mentioned in the previous context, uses a specular term of the form:

$$
D \cdot F
$$

where $D$ is the Beckmann distribution factor and $F$ is the Fresnel term. The Fresnel term is often approximated using Schlick's approximation in real-time 3D graphics.

The geometric attenuation term $G$ describes self-shadowing due to the microfacets and is of the form:

$$
G = \frac{1}{\alpha^m}
$$

where $V$ is the vector to the camera or eye, $H$ is the half-angle vector, $L$ is the vector to the light source, and $N$ is the normal vector. The angle between $H$ and $N$ is denoted by $\alpha$.

In the Cook–Torrance model, different distributions can be combined using a weighted average. This is useful for modeling surfaces that have small smooth and rough patches rather than uniform roughness.

#### 15.1b Multiple Distributions

The use of multiple distributions in the Cook–Torrance model allows for a more accurate representation of real-world surfaces. By combining different distributions, we can model surfaces that have both smooth and rough patches. This is particularly useful in computer graphics, where surfaces often have a mix of smooth and rough areas.

The distributions are usually combined using a weighted average, with each distribution having a different weight. The weights can be adjusted to control the overall appearance of the surface.

#### 15.1c Using Different Distribution Functions

In addition to combining different distributions, we can also use different distribution functions in the Cook–Torrance model. The most common distribution functions used are the Beckmann distribution and the GGX distribution.

The Beckmann distribution is defined as:

$$
D = \frac{1}{\pi} \frac{m^m}{\left(m^2 + \left(\frac{\alpha}{\alpha_0}\right)^2\right)^m}
$$

where $m$ is the roughness parameter and $\alpha_0$ is the cutoff angle.

The GGX distribution is defined as:

$$
D = \frac{1}{\pi} \frac{m^m}{\left(m^2 + \left(\frac{\alpha}{\alpha_0}\right)^2\right)^m}
$$

where $m$ is the roughness parameter and $\alpha_0$ is the cutoff angle.

By using different distribution functions, we can model surfaces with different levels of roughness. The choice of distribution function depends on the specific surface being modeled.

#### 15.3a Advanced BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function)

The Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) is a fundamental concept in computer graphics and vision science. It describes the relationship between the incoming and outgoing light at a point on a surface. The BRDF is a function of the incoming and outgoing light directions, as well as the surface normal.

The BRDF is a crucial component in the rendering of realistic images. It is used to calculate the amount of light that is reflected from a surface in a particular direction. This is essential for creating realistic images, as it allows for the accurate representation of light reflection on surfaces.

#### 15.3b Advanced Concepts in BRDF

The BRDF is a complex function that describes the interaction of light with a surface. It is often represented as a function of the incoming and outgoing light directions, as well as the surface normal. However, there are several advanced concepts that are important to understand when working with the BRDF.

##### 15.3b.1 Bidirectional Texture Function (BTF)

The Bidirectional Texture Function (BTF) is a generalization of the BRDF that is appropriate for modeling non-flat surfaces. It includes non-local scattering effects like shadowing, masking, interreflections, and subsurface scattering. The functions defined by the BTF at each point on the surface are thus called Apparent BRDFs.

The BTF is particularly useful for modeling surfaces that are not perfectly smooth or flat. It allows for a more accurate representation of the light reflection on these surfaces.

##### 15.3b.2 Bidirectional Surface Scattering Reflectance Distribution Function (BSSRDF)

The Bidirectional Surface Scattering Reflectance Distribution Function (BSSRDF) is a further generalization of the BRDF. It takes into account the fact that light entering the surface may scatter internally and exit at another location. This is particularly important for surfaces that are not perfectly transparent.

The BSSRDF is a 8-dimensional function, defined as $S(\mathbf{x}_{\text{i}},\,\omega_{\text{i}},\,\mathbf{x}_{\text{r}},\,\omega_{\text{r}})$. It is a crucial component in the accurate representation of light reflection on surfaces.

##### 15.3b.3 Wavelength Dependence of the BRDF

In reality, the BRDF is wavelength dependent. This means that the amount of light that is reflected from a surface depends on the wavelength of the incoming light. This is particularly important for surfaces that exhibit phenomena such as iridescence or luminescence.

To account for the wavelength dependence of the BRDF, the function can be parameterized as $f_{\text{r}}(\lambda_{\text{i}},\,\omega_{\text{i}},\,\lambda_{\text{r}},\,\omega_{\text{r}})$. This allows for a more accurate representation of the light reflection on surfaces.

##### 15.3b.4 Physically Based BRDFs

Physically realistic BRDFs have additional properties, including energy conservation and non-negativity. These properties are important for ensuring that the rendered images are physically plausible.

The energy conservation property states that the total amount of light that is reflected from a surface is equal to the total amount of light that is incident on the surface. This is crucial for ensuring that the rendered images are not overly bright or dark.

The non-negativity property states that the BRDF cannot take on negative values. This is important for ensuring that the rendered images are not unrealistically dark.

##### 15.3b.5 Applications of the BRDF

The BRDF is a crucial component in the rendering of realistic images. It is used in a wide range of applications, including computer graphics, image processing, and vision science.

In computer graphics, the BRDF is used to calculate the amount of light that is reflected from a surface in a particular direction. This is essential for creating realistic images, as it allows for the accurate representation of light reflection on surfaces.

These highlights can provide valuable information about the surface properties and the lighting conditions. In this section, we will explore advanced techniques for detecting and analyzing specular highlights.

##### 15.3b.3 Specular Highlight Detection using Deep Learning

Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of sophisticated algorithms for specular highlight detection. These algorithms use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn the patterns of specular highlights from large datasets. The CNNs are trained to identify the boundaries of specular highlights and to classify pixels as either specular or non-specular.

One of the key advantages of using deep learning for specular highlight detection is its ability to handle complex and varied lighting conditions. The CNNs can learn to detect specular highlights even when the lighting conditions change, making them robust to variations in illumination.

##### 15.3b.4 Specular Highlight Analysis using BRDF

The BRDF can also be used for specular highlight analysis. By convolving the BRDF with the incoming light, we can predict the intensity of the specular highlight at a given point on the surface. This can be useful for tasks such as surface reconstruction and material identification.

##### 15.3b.5 Specular Highlight Detection in Real-Time Applications

Specular highlight detection is a critical component of many real-time applications, such as augmented reality and virtual reality. These applications often require the detection of specular highlights in real-time, which poses a significant challenge due to the computational complexity of deep learning algorithms.

To address this challenge, researchers have proposed various techniques for accelerating specular highlight detection. These include using light-weight CNNs, exploiting the spatial and temporal coherence of the input images, and leveraging the parallel computing capabilities of modern GPUs.

#### 17.1c Applications of Advanced Contour Perception

In this section, we will explore some of the practical applications of advanced contour perception, particularly in the field of imaging. The principles of contour closure and rapid discrimination of shapes have been applied in various imaging techniques, including computer vision and image processing.

One of the key applications of advanced contour perception is in the field of object detection and recognition. Computer vision algorithms often rely on the principles of contour closure and rapid discrimination of shapes to identify and classify objects in images. For example, the Principal Curvature-based Region Detector (PCBR) uses these principles to detect curvilinear structures in images, which can be used to identify objects such as lines and edges.

The PCBR algorithm begins by calculating the principal curvature of an image. This is done by calculating the Hessian matrix, which is a matrix of second partial derivatives of the image. The maximum and minimum eigenvalues of this matrix are then used to create two images, one with white lines on a black background and one with black lines on a white background. These images are then used to detect curvilinear structures in the image.

The next step in the PCBR algorithm is to seek characteristics and robustness in scale space. This is done by simulating the process of David Lowe's SIFT detector, which is used to detect principal curvilinear structure in scale space. Local maximum images of principal curvature values are used to define regions, which are then cleaned by a morphological closing and eigenvector-flow guided hysteresis thresholding.

Finally, the traditional watershed algorithm is applied to the images to acquire regions. This process is repeated for each scale, and the final result is a set of regions that correspond to the principal curvilinear structures in the image.

The PCBR algorithm is just one example of how advanced contour perception can be applied in imaging. Other techniques, such as the Principal Curvature-based Region Detector, also rely on these principles to detect and classify objects in images. These techniques have been used in a wide range of applications, from medical imaging to robotics.

#### 18.1b Techniques for Advanced Shape from Contours

In this subsection, we will explore some of the advanced techniques used for shape from contours. These techniques are based on the principles of shape from contours, which is a method of inferring the shape of an object from its boundary. This method is particularly useful when dealing with occluding contours, as it allows us to infer the shape of an object even when it is partially occluded by another object.

One of the key techniques used in shape from contours is the use of principal curvature-based region detectors (PCBR). These detectors are structure-based detectors that use curvilinear structures, also known as ridges, to detect edges in an image. This is in contrast to traditional edge detectors, which use the gradient magnitude image.

The PCBR algorithm begins by detecting curvilinear structures in an image. This is done by calculating the principal curvature, which is the maximum or minimum curvature of a curve at a given point. The principal curvature is calculated using the Hessian matrix, which is a matrix of second partial derivatives of the image. The maximum and minimum eigenvalues of this matrix form two images that correspond to white lines on a black background and black lines on a white background, respectively.

Next, the PCBR algorithm seeks characteristics and robustness in scale space. This is done by simulating the process of David Lowe's SIFT detector, which is used to detect local maximum images of principal curvature values. This step helps to make the detector scale invariant and improves its robustness.

The final step in the PCBR algorithm is to define regions by enhanced watershed algorithms. This is done by cleaning the principal curvature images using morphological closing and eigenvector-flow guided hysteresis thresholding. The traditional watershed algorithm is then applied to these images to acquire regions.

The PCBR algorithm is just one example of an advanced technique used for shape from contours. Other techniques include the use of line integral convolution, which is used to enhance the visualization of vector fields, and the use of the Hough transform, which is used to detect lines and curves in an image.

In the next subsection, we will explore the role of these advanced techniques in depth perception and imaging. We will also discuss the potential for further advancements in these techniques and their applications in the field of vision science.

For instance, the PCBR algorithm has been used to detect the boundaries of objects in a robot's environment, which can then be used to create a map of the environment. This map can then be used for navigation and obstacle avoidance.

In the field of medical imaging, advanced shape from contours techniques have been used to improve the visualization of medical images.

##### Curvilinear Structure Detection

Curvilinear structure detection is a technique used to detect the boundaries of objects in a visual scene. Unlike traditional edge detectors, which use edges to define the boundaries of objects, curvilinear structure detectors use curvilinear structures, also known as ridges.

The process of curvilinear structure detection begins with the calculation of the principal curvature image. This image is calculated by finding the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. The maximum and minimum eigenvalues are then used to create two images, one with white lines on a black background and one with black lines on a white background.

##### Region Definition

Once the principal curvature image has been calculated, the next step is to define regions. This is done by seeking the local maximum images of the principal curvature values. These local maximum images are then used to define regions in the image.

##### Enhanced Watershed Algorithm

To improve the robustness of the region definition process, an enhanced watershed algorithm is used. This algorithm is similar to the watershed algorithm used in image processing, but it is modified to account for the scale space in which the principal curvature images are defined.

The enhanced watershed algorithm begins by finding the local maximum images of the principal curvature values. These local maximum images are then used to define regions in the image. The regions are then merged based on their proximity, creating a single region for each object in the image.

##### Applications of Advanced Occlusion Boundary Detection

Advanced occlusion boundary detection has many applications in vision science. It can be used to improve the accuracy of depth ordering techniques, such as depth filtering. It can also be used in imaging techniques, such as multi-focus image fusion, to enhance the quality of images.

In addition, advanced occlusion boundary detection has potential applications in other fields, such as robotics and computer vision.

## Chapter 1:9: Advanced Topics in Visual Perception and Imaging




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into advanced topics in constructing visual perception. As we have explored in previous chapters, perception is a complex process that involves the transformation of sensory information into meaningful representations of the environment. In this chapter, we will focus on the advanced techniques and theories that have been developed to understand and explain this process.

We will begin by discussing the role of attention in perception. Attention is a cognitive process that allows us to selectively focus on certain aspects of the environment while ignoring others. We will explore how attention influences perception and how it can be studied using various methods.

Next, we will delve into the topic of visual illusions. Illusions are perceptual phenomena that are not consistent with our expectations based on our knowledge of the physical world. We will discuss the different types of visual illusions and the theories that explain how they occur.

We will then move on to the topic of visual imagery. Visual imagery is the mental representation of visual information. We will explore the different types of visual imagery and how they are related to perception.

Finally, we will discuss the role of imaging techniques in studying perception. Imaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), allow us to study the neural processes underlying perception. We will discuss how these techniques have contributed to our understanding of perception.

Throughout this chapter, we will use mathematical equations to describe and explain the concepts discussed. For example, we might use the equation `$y_j(n)$` to represent the output of a neural network at time `n` for input `j`. We will also use equations to represent mathematical models of perception, such as the equation `$$\Delta w = ...$$` to represent the change in synaptic weights in a neural network.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a deeper understanding of the advanced topics in constructing visual perception and how they contribute to our understanding of perception. You will also have a solid foundation in the mathematical techniques used to describe and explain these concepts.




### Subsection: 19.1 Advanced Visual Illusions

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamental concepts of visual perception and imaging. We have learned about the role of the visual system in processing information from the environment and how this information is used to construct our perception of the world. However, there are many advanced topics in visual perception that require a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms and processes. In this section, we will delve into one of these topics: advanced visual illusions.

Visual illusions are perceptual phenomena that are not consistent with our expectations based on our knowledge of the physical world. They are often the result of complex interactions between different aspects of the visual system, and they can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of perception.

One of the most well-known visual illusions is the Ponzo illusion, which was first described by Italian psychologist Mario Ponzo in 1913. In this illusion, two lines of the same length appear to be different in length when viewed against a background of converging lines. This illusion is thought to be caused by the visual system's sensitivity to the orientation of lines and the perceived distance between them.

Another classic visual illusion is the Müller-Lyer illusion, which was first described by German psychologist Franz Müller-Lyer in 1889. In this illusion, two lines of the same length appear to be different in length when viewed against a background of arrows pointing in opposite directions. This illusion is thought to be caused by the visual system's sensitivity to the orientation of lines and the perceived distance between them.

These illusions, and many others like them, have been extensively studied by vision researchers. They have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms of perception and have led to the development of theories and models that explain how we perceive the world around us.

In the following sections, we will explore some of these advanced visual illusions in more detail. We will discuss their history, the theories and models that explain them, and the latest research in this exciting field. We will also discuss how these illusions can be used to study the visual system and to understand the mechanisms of perception.
