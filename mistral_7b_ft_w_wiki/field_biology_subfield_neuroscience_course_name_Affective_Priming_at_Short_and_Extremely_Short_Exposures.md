## Foreward

Welcome to "A Comprehensive Guide to Affective Priming at Short and Extremely Short Exposures". This book aims to provide a thorough understanding of affective priming, a phenomenon that has been extensively studied in the field of psychology. Affective priming refers to the influence of affect or emotion on our perception and decision-making processes. It is a complex and fascinating area of study that has significant implications for our understanding of human cognition and behavior.

The book begins by exploring the concept of affect heuristic, a decision-making process that is heavily influenced by affect. This concept has been extensively studied and has been found to play a crucial role in our attitudes and opinions, particularly in the realm of risk perception. The book delves into the experimental findings that have further elucidated the role of affect in decision-making, demonstrating its importance in various domains and aspects of human life.

One of the most intriguing aspects of affective priming is its ability to influence our judgments and decisions without our conscious awareness. This is demonstrated in the book through a detailed exploration of subliminal affective response. The book discusses a study conducted by Winkielman, Zajonc, and Schwarz (1997) that used a subliminal priming paradigm to show how affect can influence our judgments in a matter of milliseconds. This study, among others, provides compelling evidence of the power and speed of affective priming.

The book also delves into the persistence of initial affect, a phenomenon where our initial affective response to a stimulus can influence our subsequent responses, even when the stimulus is presented subliminally. This concept is further explored in a second experiment conducted by Winkielman, Zajonc, and Schwarz (1997), which demonstrates the enduring nature of affective priming.

Throughout the book, we will explore these concepts in depth, providing a comprehensive understanding of affective priming at short and extremely short exposures. We will also discuss the implications of these findings for various fields, including marketing, politics, and health psychology.

This book is intended for advanced undergraduate students at MIT, but it is also a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding the complex interplay between affect and cognition. We hope that this book will serve as a useful guide to understanding the fascinating world of affective priming.

Thank you for joining us on this journey.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

### Subsection 1.2a Understanding abstracts

In the field of psychology, abstracts play a crucial role in summarizing research studies and providing a concise overview of the key findings. They are often the first thing that researchers, students, and practitioners read when looking for information on a particular topic. Therefore, understanding how to write and interpret abstracts is an essential skill for anyone working in the field.

#### What is an Abstract?

An abstract is a brief summary of a research study that provides a concise overview of the key findings. It is typically written in a structured format, with specific sections for the purpose of the study, methods, results, and conclusions. Abstracts are often used in academic journals, conference proceedings, and other publications to provide a quick and easy way for readers to understand the main points of a study.

#### Writing an Abstract

Writing an abstract requires a careful and systematic approach. The first step is to clearly define the purpose of the study. This should include a brief description of the research question or hypothesis, as well as the main objectives of the study. Next, the methods used in the study should be outlined, including the participants, materials, and procedures. This section should be detailed enough to provide a clear understanding of how the study was conducted.

The results section should summarize the key findings of the study. This can be done by highlighting the most important results and providing a brief explanation of how they relate to the research question or hypothesis. Finally, the conclusions section should summarize the main points of the study and provide a brief discussion of their implications.

#### Interpreting an Abstract

When reading an abstract, it is important to keep in mind the purpose of the study and the key findings. The abstract should provide a clear and concise summary of the research, without any unnecessary details. If there are any uncertainties or questions, it is always possible to refer back to the full text of the study for more information.

In conclusion, abstracts are an essential part of academic writing and play a crucial role in summarizing research studies. By understanding how to write and interpret abstracts, researchers, students, and practitioners can effectively communicate their findings and contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field of psychology.
