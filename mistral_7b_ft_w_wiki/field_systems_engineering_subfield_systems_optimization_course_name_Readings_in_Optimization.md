## Chapter 1: Optimization in Machine Learning:




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of MAXCUT, Semidefinite Programming, and the Goemans-Williamson Paper. These topics are fundamental to the field of optimization and have wide-ranging applications in various fields such as computer science, engineering, and economics.

MAXCUT is a combinatorial optimization problem that involves partitioning a graph into two subsets such that the number of edges between the two subsets is maximized. This problem has been extensively studied due to its applications in network design, clustering, and image segmentation.

Semidefinite Programming (SDP) is a powerful optimization technique that extends the concept of linear programming. It allows for the optimization of linear functions subject to linear matrix inequalities. SDP has found applications in various fields such as control theory, combinatorial optimization, and machine learning.

The Goemans-Williamson Paper is a seminal work in the field of approximation algorithms. It presents a randomized algorithm for MAXCUT with an approximation ratio of 0.878, which was a significant improvement over the previously known ratio of 0.5. This paper has been cited over 1000 times and has sparked further research in the area of MAXCUT.

Throughout this chapter, we will explore these topics in detail, starting with an introduction to MAXCUT and its applications. We will then move on to Semidefinite Programming, discussing its formulation and applications. Finally, we will delve into the Goemans-Williamson Paper, discussing its key ideas and implications.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive guide to these topics, suitable for both beginners and advanced readers. We will start with a brief overview of the necessary background and gradually build up to more complex concepts. We will also provide numerous examples and exercises to help you understand the concepts better.

So, let's embark on this exciting journey into the world of MAXCUT, Semidefinite Programming, and the Goemans-Williamson Paper.




### Subsection: 1.1a Introduction to Semidefinite Programming

Semidefinite Programming (SDP) is a powerful optimization technique that extends the concept of linear programming. It allows for the optimization of linear functions subject to linear matrix inequalities. SDP has found applications in various fields such as control theory, combinatorial optimization, and machine learning.

#### 1.1a.1 Formulation of Semidefinite Programming

A semidefinite program can be formulated as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{minimize} \quad & c^Tx \\
\text{subject to} \quad & A_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n x_iA_i \succeq 0, \\
& x \in \mathbb{R}^n,
\end{align*}
$$

where $c \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $A_0, A_1, \ldots, A_n$ are symmetric matrices of size $d \times d$, and $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the vector of decision variables. The notation $\succeq 0$ means that the matrix is positive semidefinite.

The objective function is linear, and the constraints are linear matrix inequalities. The decision variables are real-valued, and the goal is to minimize the objective function subject to the constraints.

#### 1.1a.2 Duality in Semidefinite Programming

The dual of a semidefinite program is given by:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{maximize} \quad & c^Tz \\
\text{subject to} \quad & \langle A_0, z \rangle + \sum_{i=1}^n z_i \langle A_i, z \rangle = 0, \\
& z \in \mathbb{R}^n.
\end{align*}
$$

The dual variables $z$ correspond to the constraints $A_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n x_iA_i \succeq 0$ in the primal program. The dual program provides a way to solve the primal program by finding the optimal solution to the dual program.

#### 1.1a.3 Applications of Semidefinite Programming

Semidefinite Programming has found applications in various fields. In control theory, it is used to design robust controllers. In combinatorial optimization, it is used to solve problems such as graph coloring and maximum cut. In machine learning, it is used to solve problems such as clustering and dimensionality reduction.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the applications of Semidefinite Programming in the context of MAXCUT and the Goemans-Williamson Paper.




### Subsection: 1.1b Application in MAXCUT

The MAXCUT problem is a fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization that involves partitioning a graph into two subsets such that the number of edges between the two subsets is maximized. This problem has been extensively studied and has found applications in various fields such as network design, clustering, and image segmentation.

#### 1.1b.1 MAXCUT as a Semidefinite Program

The MAXCUT problem can be formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP) as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{maximize} \quad & \sum_{i,j \in V} w_{ij}x_ix_j \\
\text{subject to} \quad & x_i^2 = 1, \quad \forall i \in V, \\
& x_i \in \mathbb{R}, \quad \forall i \in V, \\
& x_i \in [0, 1], \quad \forall i \in V.
\end{align*}
$$

In this formulation, the decision variables $x_i$ represent the membership of vertex $i$ to the two subsets, and the constraints ensure that each vertex is assigned to exactly one subset. The objective function maximizes the sum of weights of the edges between the two subsets.

#### 1.1b.2 Solving MAXCUT using SDP

The SDP formulation of MAXCUT can be solved using various techniques such as interior-point methods, cutting plane methods, and semidefinite relaxations. These methods provide upper and lower bounds on the optimal solution, and can be used to find the optimal solution within a given tolerance.

#### 1.1b.3 Applications of MAXCUT in Semidefinite Programming

MAXCUT has found applications in various fields such as network design, clustering, and image segmentation. In network design, MAXCUT is used to partition a network into two subsets such that the number of edges between the two subsets is maximized. This can be useful for designing efficient routing schemes, load balancing, and network security.

In clustering, MAXCUT is used to partition a set of data points into two subsets such that the number of edges between the two subsets is maximized. This can be useful for clustering data into two groups, such as in bipartite matching problems.

In image segmentation, MAXCUT is used to partition an image into two subsets such that the number of edges between the two subsets is maximized. This can be useful for segmenting an image into two regions, such as in object detection and recognition.

### Conclusion

In this section, we have seen how the MAXCUT problem can be formulated as a semidefinite program and solved using various techniques. We have also discussed some applications of MAXCUT in network design, clustering, and image segmentation. In the next section, we will explore the Goemans-Williamson paper, which provides an improved approximation algorithm for MAXCUT.

It presents a novel approach to solving MAXCUT using semidefinite programming (SDP), and provides a theoretical analysis of the algorithm.

#### 1.1c.1 The Goemans-Williamson Algorithm

The Goemans-Williamson algorithm is an SDP-based algorithm for solving MAXCUT. It formulates the MAXCUT problem as a semidefinite program, and then solves this program using techniques from SDP. The algorithm provides a theoretical guarantee of a solution within a certain factor of the optimal solution.

The algorithm begins by constructing a semidefinite program (SDP) that represents the MAXCUT problem. This SDP is then solved using techniques from SDP, such as interior-point methods or cutting plane methods. The solution to the SDP provides a lower bound on the optimal solution to the MAXCUT problem.

#### 1.1c.2 Theoretical Analysis of the Goemans-Williamson Algorithm

The Goemans-Williamson paper provides a theoretical analysis of the algorithm. It proves that the algorithm provides a solution within a certain factor of the optimal solution. This factor is dependent on the properties of the SDP formulation of the MAXCUT problem, and can be improved by refining the SDP formulation.

The paper also discusses the implications of the algorithm for other optimization problems, such as the satisfiability problem. It shows that the algorithm can be used to provide improved approximation algorithms for these problems as well.

#### 1.1c.3 Applications of the Goemans-Williamson Algorithm

The Goemans-Williamson algorithm has found applications in various fields, including network design, clustering, and image segmentation. In network design, the algorithm can be used to partition a network into two subsets such that the number of edges between the two subsets is maximized. This can be useful for designing efficient routing schemes, load balancing, and network security.

In clustering, the algorithm can be used to partition a set of data points into two subsets such that the number of edges between the two subsets is maximized. This can be useful for clustering data into two groups, such as in image segmentation.
