It is divided into ten books, each covering a different aspect of architecture, from the principles of design to the practical aspects of construction. The work is written in the Latin language, and it is believed to have been written in the first century BC.

The first book of "De Architectura" introduces the reader to the principles of architecture, including the three orders of architecture: the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. These orders are defined by their proportions and the details of their design, and they serve as the foundation for all architectural design.

The second book delves into the principles of design, including the concept of symmetry and proportion, which Vitruvius believed were essential for creating a harmonious and pleasing design. He also discusses the importance of the human body as a model for architectural proportion, a concept that he expands upon in the third book.

The third book, titled "The Human Body as a Model for Architectural Proportion," is one of the most intriguing parts of Vitruvius' work. In this book, Vitruvius explores the relationship between the human body and architectural design. He argues that the human body is the perfect model for architectural proportion, and he uses this model to explain the principles of symmetry and proportion in architecture.

The fourth book covers the practical aspects of construction, including the selection of materials and the construction of foundations. The fifth book discusses the construction of walls, while the sixth book covers the construction of roofs. The seventh book delves into the construction of windows and doors, while the eighth book covers the construction of floors and pavements.

The ninth book is dedicated to the construction of aqueducts, a topic that Vitruvius discusses in great detail. He describes the different types of aqueducts, their construction methods, and the materials needed for their construction. The tenth book covers the construction of bridges, another important aspect of Roman architecture.

Vitruvius' work is a testament to the sophistication and complexity of Roman architecture. It provides a detailed and comprehensive guide to architectural design and construction, and it is a valuable resource for anyone interested in the history of architecture. However, despite its importance, Vitruvius' work is also a source of mystery, particularly because of the absence of images in his treatise. This absence of images, known as the mystery of Vitruvius' missing images, is a topic that will be explored in more detail in the following sections.

#### 2.1b Vitruvius' Influence on Architecture

Vitruvius' work, "De Architectura," has had a profound influence on the field of architecture. His principles and theories have been studied, debated, and applied by architects for centuries, and his work continues to be relevant in the modern era.

One of the most significant ways in which Vitruvius' work has influenced architecture is through his emphasis on the human body as a model for architectural proportion. This concept, known as the "Vitruvian Man," has been used by architects to create harmonious and pleasing designs. The Vitruvian Man is a symbol of balance, proportion, and harmony, and it serves as a guide for architects in creating spaces that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

Vitruvius' work has also had a profound impact on the principles of design. His emphasis on symmetry and proportion has been incorporated into the principles of modern architecture, and his theories continue to be studied and applied in design schools around the world.

Moreover, Vitruvius' work has also influenced the practical aspects of construction. His detailed descriptions of construction methods and materials have been used by architects and engineers to understand and replicate the architectural feats of the ancient Romans. His descriptions of aqueducts and bridges, for example, have been used to inform modern construction techniques.

However, despite his influence, Vitruvius' work is not without its criticisms. Some scholars argue that his emphasis on the human body as a model for architectural proportion can lead to a lack of creativity and originality in design. Others argue that his theories are too focused on the classical orders of architecture and do not adequately address the needs and desires of modern society.

Despite these criticisms, Vitruvius' work remains a cornerstone of architectural theory and practice. His influence can be seen in the work of architects around the world, and his principles continue to be studied and applied in architectural education. His work serves as a reminder of the enduring nature of architectural principles and the importance of understanding the past in order to create a better future.

#### 2.1c The Mystery of Vitruvius' Missing Images

The mystery of Vitruvius' missing images is a topic that has intrigued scholars for centuries. Despite the fact that Vitruvius' work, "De Architectura," is a comprehensive guide to architecture, it is devoid of any images or diagrams. This absence of visual aids is particularly striking given the detailed and precise nature of Vitruvius' descriptions.

The absence of images in Vitruvius' work has led to a variety of interpretations and theories. Some scholars argue that the lack of images is a reflection of the limitations of ancient Roman technology. They suggest that the Romans did not have the tools or techniques to create detailed and accurate drawings, and therefore relied solely on written descriptions.

Others argue that the absence of images is a deliberate choice on the part of Vitruvius. They suggest that Vitruvius' emphasis on the human body as a model for architectural proportion led him to reject the use of images. They argue that Vitruvius believed that images could distract from the underlying principles and theories, and therefore chose to present his ideas solely through words.

However, despite these theories, the mystery of Vitruvius' missing images remains unsolved. The absence of images in Vitruvius' work continues to be a source of speculation and debate among scholars.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of the "Vitruvian Man," a symbol that has been used by architects for centuries to represent the principles of balance, proportion, and harmony in architecture.




#### 2.1b His influence on architectural design

Vitruvius' work, "De Architectura," has had a profound influence on architectural design, particularly in the Renaissance period. His principles of design, particularly the concept of the three orders of architecture, were revived and expanded upon by Renaissance architects, leading to the development of new architectural styles.

The Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio, for example, was heavily influenced by Vitruvius' work. Palladio's "Four Books of Architecture," published in 1570, is a direct response to Vitruvius' "De Architectura." Palladio's work expands upon Vitruvius' principles, particularly the concept of the three orders of architecture, and introduces new elements such as the Palladian window.

Palladio's work, in turn, influenced the development of the Neoclassical style in the 18th and 19th centuries. Neoclassical architects, such as Sir John Soane and Robert Adam, were heavily influenced by Palladio's work and incorporated elements of the Palladian style into their designs.

Vitruvius' work also had a significant impact on the development of modern architecture. The principles of symmetry and proportion that Vitruvius espoused are still fundamental to modern architectural design. The concept of the human body as a model for architectural proportion, introduced in the third book of "De Architectura," has been particularly influential. This concept has been used by modern architects, such as Le Corbusier, to develop new principles of design.

In conclusion, Vitruvius' work, "De Architectura," has had a profound influence on architectural design, from the Renaissance period to the present day. His principles of design, particularly the concept of the three orders of architecture and the human body as a model for architectural proportion, have been used by architects to develop new architectural styles and principles of design.

#### 2.1c His influence on urban planning

Vitruvius' influence extends beyond architectural design to urban planning as well. His principles of design and proportion are not only applicable to individual buildings but also to the layout of entire cities. This is particularly evident in the work of the British industrial architect Ernest Bates, who was commissioned by the cotton magnate Eccles Shorrock to design the India Mill at Darwen, Lancashire.

Bates' design for the India Mill is a prime example of the influence of Vitruvius on urban planning. The mill is designed to impress, with a tall Italianate campanile-style chimney, ornamental urns at each corner, and an ornate cresting consisting of over 300 pieces of cast iron. This extravagant design is a direct reflection of the wealth generated by the new industries of the time, and it showcases the importance of design and proportion in urban planning.

The India Mill is also a testament to the concept of the "cathedrals of progress," as described by the French poet Théophile Gautier. Just as the new railway stations of the time were seen as cathedrals to the new humanity, the India Mill can be seen as a cathedral to the new industry. This concept of architecture as a celebration of progress and innovation is a direct reflection of Vitruvius' principles of design.

Vitruvius' influence on urban planning can also be seen in the design of railway stations. The Great Western Railway's engineer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, described London Paddington station as "a cathedral to the iron horse." This description reflects the importance of design and proportion in the layout of railway stations, which were seen as symbols of progress and innovation.

In conclusion, Vitruvius' work, "De Architectura," has had a profound influence on urban planning, particularly in the 19th century. His principles of design and proportion are not only applicable to individual buildings but also to the layout of entire cities, as seen in the design of the India Mill and railway stations of the time.




#### 2.2a Exploring the missing images in Vitruvius' work

The mystery of the missing images in Vitruvius' work is a topic of ongoing research and debate among scholars. The images in question are the architectural drawings that Vitruvius refers to in his book "De Architectura." These drawings, which are mentioned numerous times throughout the book, are described in detail but are not included in the text. This has led to speculation about their existence and whereabouts.

The first mention of these missing images is in the preface to the book, where Vitruvius states that he will be using "figures" to illustrate his points. These figures, he says, will be "drawn to scale" and will provide a visual aid to help the reader understand the concepts being discussed. However, these figures are not included in the text.

Throughout the book, Vitruvius refers to these figures repeatedly, often using phrases such as "as shown in Figure 1" or "as illustrated in Figure 2." These references are made in the context of explaining architectural principles and techniques, and the absence of these figures makes it difficult for modern readers to fully understand these explanations.

The mystery of these missing images is compounded by the fact that Vitruvius' book was written during a time when architectural drawings were commonplace. The Roman architect and engineer Frontinus, for example, included detailed architectural drawings in his book "De aquaeductu urbis Romae." This leads to the question: why did Vitruvius choose not to include these drawings in his book?

Scholars have proposed various theories to explain the absence of these images. Some suggest that the drawings may have been lost or destroyed over time. Others argue that Vitruvius may have intended for the reader to create these drawings themselves, as a form of exercise. However, these theories are largely speculative and have not been definitively proven.

The mystery of the missing images in Vitruvius' work is a fascinating and complex topic that continues to intrigue scholars and students alike. It is a testament to the enduring relevance and importance of Vitruvius' work in the field of architecture.

#### 2.2b Theories on the missing images

The mystery of the missing images in Vitruvius' work has sparked a number of theories among scholars. These theories aim to explain why Vitruvius chose not to include the architectural drawings that he refers to throughout his book.

One theory suggests that the drawings may have been lost or destroyed over time. This theory is supported by the fact that Vitruvius' book was written during a time of political instability and upheaval. The Roman Empire was in decline, and many of the architectural works that Vitruvius describes in his book had been abandoned or destroyed. It is possible that the drawings were lost in the chaos of this period.

Another theory proposes that Vitruvius may have intended for the reader to create these drawings themselves. This theory is based on the idea that Vitruvius' book was intended as a guide for architects, and that the drawings were meant to be used as a form of exercise or practice. This theory is supported by the fact that Vitruvius often refers to the drawings as "figures," which could be interpreted as a form of shorthand for "drawings."

However, there are also theories that suggest a more complex and nuanced explanation for the absence of the drawings. For example, some scholars argue that the drawings may have been intentionally omitted by Vitruvius as a way of emphasizing the importance of the written word. This theory is supported by the fact that Vitruvius' book is primarily a textual work, with only occasional references to the drawings. It is possible that Vitruvius was making a statement about the primacy of the word in architectural design.

Another theory proposes that the drawings may have been included in a separate volume that has since been lost. This theory is supported by the fact that Vitruvius' book was originally written in ten books, but only eight of these books have survived. It is possible that the drawings were included in one of the two lost books.

In conclusion, the mystery of the missing images in Vitruvius' work is a complex and ongoing topic of research. While there is no definitive answer, these theories provide valuable insights into the possible reasons for the absence of the drawings. Further research and analysis of Vitruvius' work will continue to shed light on this intriguing mystery.

### Section: 3.2 The Untrustworthy Nature of Man-made Images:

#### 3.2a Discussion on the limitations and biases of man-made images

The advent of digital design has brought about a new era in the creation and manipulation of images. With the use of software and algorithms, images can be created, modified, and manipulated in ways that were previously unimaginable. However, this power also comes with its own set of limitations and biases.

One of the most significant limitations of man-made images is their reliance on data. As seen in the case of Stable Diffusion, a popular image generation model, the quality of generated images is heavily dependent on the quality and quantity of data used to train the model. This data, often collected from the internet, can be biased and reflect the prejudices and biases of the society from which it originates. For instance, the LAION database, used to train Stable Diffusion, has been criticized for its lack of diversity and representation, particularly in terms of race and gender. This bias can be seen in the generated images, which often reflect the same prejudices and stereotypes present in the data.

Moreover, the use of machine learning models in image generation can also lead to the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes. For example, the use of text-to-image models can result in the generation of images that align with the text input, even if the text is discriminatory or offensive. This can lead to the creation of images that reinforce harmful stereotypes and perpetuate discrimination.

Another limitation of man-made images is their potential for degradation and inaccuracies. As seen in the case of Stable Diffusion, the quality of generated images can noticeably degrade when the user specifications deviate from the expected resolution of the model. This can be particularly problematic in scenarios where high-resolution images are required, such as in medical imaging or other professional applications.

Finally, the use of man-made images can also raise concerns about accessibility. The fine-tuning process required to adapt these models for new use cases can be a barrier for individual developers, particularly those without access to high-end computing resources. This can limit the ability of certain groups to fully participate in the creation and manipulation of images.

In conclusion, while digital design has opened up new possibilities for the creation and manipulation of images, it is important to acknowledge and address the limitations and biases inherent in these processes. As we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with digital design, it is crucial that we do so in a way that is inclusive, ethical, and responsible.

#### 3.2b The Role of Man-made Images in Digital Design

Man-made images play a pivotal role in the field of digital design. They are the visual representations of our ideas, concepts, and designs, and they serve as a powerful tool for communication and expression. However, as we have seen in the previous section, these images are not without their limitations and biases.

One of the key roles of man-made images in digital design is their ability to convey complex ideas and concepts in a simple and intuitive manner. This is particularly important in the context of design, where the goal is to create products that are not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing. Man-made images, whether they are sketches, diagrams, or computer-generated renderings, allow designers to communicate their ideas and designs in a way that is accessible and understandable to a wide audience.

Moreover, man-made images also play a crucial role in the design process itself. They serve as a means of exploration and experimentation, allowing designers to test and refine their ideas before they are physically realized. This can save time and resources, and it can also lead to more innovative and creative solutions.

However, the use of man-made images in digital design also raises important ethical and social issues. As we have seen, these images can be biased and discriminatory, and they can perpetuate harmful stereotypes. This raises questions about the responsibility of designers and the ethical implications of their work.

In conclusion, man-made images are a powerful tool in the field of digital design. They allow us to communicate our ideas, explore and refine our designs, and create products that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. However, we must also be aware of their limitations and biases, and we must strive to use them in a responsible and ethical manner.

#### 3.2c Case Studies of Man-made Images in Digital Design

In this section, we will delve into specific case studies that highlight the role of man-made images in digital design. These case studies will provide a more concrete understanding of the concepts discussed in the previous sections.

##### Case Study 1: Stable Diffusion

Stable Diffusion is a popular image generation model that has been used in a variety of digital design applications. It is a prime example of the power and potential of man-made images in digital design. However, it also illustrates the limitations and biases that can arise from the use of these images.

As we have seen, Stable Diffusion has issues with degradation and inaccuracies in certain scenarios. This is due to the model's reliance on a dataset that consists of 512×512 resolution images. When user specifications deviate from this resolution, the quality of generated images noticeably degrades. This can be a significant limitation in scenarios where high-resolution images are required, such as in medical imaging or other professional applications.

Moreover, Stable Diffusion has also been criticized for its lack of diversity and representation in the generated images. This is due to the poor data quality of limbs and faces in the LAION database, which the model is insufficiently trained to understand. This lack of representation can lead to biased and discriminatory images, perpetuating harmful stereotypes.

##### Case Study 2: ECNN

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is another example of a man-made image used in digital design. The EKF is a mathematical model used in control systems to estimate the state of a system based on noisy measurements. In the context of digital design, the EKF can be used to estimate the state of a design based on noisy data.

However, the EKF also has its limitations. It assumes that the system is linear and that the noise is Gaussian. If these assumptions are not met, the performance of the EKF can degrade significantly. This can be a limitation in scenarios where the design is complex and non-linear, or where the data is non-Gaussian.

In conclusion, these case studies highlight the power and potential of man-made images in digital design, as well as the limitations and biases that can arise from their use. As we continue to push the boundaries of digital design, it is crucial that we are aware of these issues and strive to address them in a responsible and ethical manner.

### Section: 3.2 The Untrustworthy Nature of Man-made Images:

#### 3.2b Critical analysis of Alberti's ideas

Leon Battista Alberti, a Renaissance humanist and architect, was a pioneer in the use of perspective in art. His treatise "De Pictura" (On Painting) and "De Re Aedificatoria" (On Architecture) laid the foundation for the modern understanding of perspective and its role in art and architecture. However, his ideas on perspective and its relationship with truth and reality have been subject to critical analysis.

Alberti's theory of perspective was based on the concept of a single vanishing point, a point at which all lines in a scene appear to converge. This concept, while revolutionary at the time, has been criticized for its limitations. The use of a single vanishing point can lead to a flattening of the scene, reducing the depth and dimensionality of the image. This can be particularly problematic in architectural drawings, where the accurate representation of depth and space is crucial.

Moreover, Alberti's theory of perspective was heavily influenced by the principles of linear perspective, which assumes that all lines in a scene are parallel to the picture plane. This assumption is not always valid in real-world scenes, leading to discrepancies between the drawn image and the actual scene. This can be particularly problematic in architectural drawings, where the accurate representation of depth and space is crucial.

Furthermore, Alberti's theory of perspective was based on the assumption that the viewer's eye is located at the vanishing point. This assumption, while useful for simplifying the mathematical calculations involved in perspective drawing, can lead to a disconnect between the drawn image and the actual scene. This is because the viewer's eye is not always located at the vanishing point, leading to a mismatch between the drawn image and the actual scene.

In conclusion, while Alberti's ideas on perspective have been instrumental in the development of modern art and architecture, they have also been subject to critical analysis due to their limitations and assumptions. The advent of digital design has further complicated the relationship between drawings and numbers, highlighting the need for a critical analysis of the assumptions and limitations inherent in these systems.

The advent of digital design and image-making technologies has not only revolutionized the way architects create and communicate their designs but has also opened up new possibilities for architectural replication. This section will explore some of the notable examples of architectural replication through technology.

#### Digital Twins in Architecture

Digital twins, a concept borrowed from the manufacturing industry, have been increasingly adopted in architecture. A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical asset, continuously updated with real-time data from sensors and other devices. In the context of architecture, digital twins can be used to create a virtual replica of a building, allowing architects to monitor and analyze its performance in real-time.

For instance, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, has implemented a digital twin to monitor its energy consumption and optimize its operations. The digital twin provides real-time data on the building's energy usage, allowing the museum to identify areas of energy waste and make necessary adjustments. This not only helps in reducing energy costs but also contributes to the museum's sustainability efforts.

#### Parametric Design and Fabrication

Parametric design and fabrication, enabled by computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) technologies, have also led to architectural replication. Parametric design allows architects to create complex and intricate designs by defining a set of parameters and rules. These parameters can then be adjusted to generate multiple design options, each with its own unique characteristics.

For example, the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, Spain, is a prime example of parametric design and fabrication. The cathedral's intricate facades are the result of a parametric design system that defines the shape and placement of each brick based on a set of rules. This allows for the creation of a near-infinite number of unique facades, each with its own distinct pattern.

#### 3D Printing in Architecture

3D printing, a technology that allows for the creation of complex and intricate objects from digital models, has also been used in architectural replication. 3D printing can be used to create physical replicas of architectural designs, allowing architects to test and evaluate their designs in a real-world setting.

For instance, the National Museum of Qatar, designed by Jean Nouvel, was built using 3D printed concrete. The museum's complex and intricate geometric forms were created using a combination of 3D printing and traditional construction techniques. This not only allowed for the creation of a visually stunning building but also contributed to the museum's sustainability efforts by reducing waste and energy consumption.

In conclusion, the relationship between image-making technologies and architecture is not only about how these technologies are used to create and communicate architectural designs but also about how they enable architectural replication. From digital twins to parametric design and fabrication, and 3D printing, these technologies are transforming the way architects approach design and construction, opening up new possibilities for architectural replication.




### Subsection: 6.2a The concept of identical replication in design

Identical replication in design refers to the process of creating multiple instances of a design that are identical in all aspects. This concept is deeply rooted in the principles of parametric design and digital fabrication, where a set of parameters and rules are defined to generate multiple instances of a design.

In the context of architectural design, identical replication can be seen in the construction of identical units in a housing complex, or in the creation of multiple instances of a building facade. The concept of identical replication is also prevalent in the design of digital systems, where a single design can be replicated to create multiple instances of a system.

The concept of identical replication is closely tied to the principles of modularity and standardization. Modularity refers to the ability of a system to be broken down into smaller, interchangeable components. Standardization, on the other hand, refers to the use of common design standards and protocols across different systems.

In the context of digital design, modularity and standardization allow for the creation of complex systems from a set of standard components. This not only simplifies the design process but also allows for the easy replication of designs.

For instance, the design of a digital system can be broken down into a set of standard components, each with its own set of parameters and rules. By adjusting these parameters, multiple instances of the system can be created, each with its own unique characteristics.

In the context of architecture, identical replication can be seen in the design of a housing complex, where a single design is replicated to create multiple instances of a housing unit. This not only simplifies the design process but also allows for the efficient use of resources.

In conclusion, identical replication in design is a powerful concept that allows for the creation of multiple instances of a design from a single set of parameters and rules. This concept is deeply rooted in the principles of parametric design and digital fabrication, and is prevalent in both digital systems and architectural design.




### Subsection: 6.2b Advantages and disadvantages

Identical replication in design has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. In this section, we will explore these advantages and disadvantages in detail.

#### Advantages of Identical Replication in Design

1. **Efficiency**: Identical replication allows for the creation of multiple instances of a design with minimal effort. This is particularly useful in architectural design, where a single design can be replicated to create multiple instances of a housing unit or a building facade. This not only saves time but also reduces the complexity of the design process.

2. **Standardization**: Identical replication promotes standardization in design. By using a set of standard components and parameters, designers can create complex systems with ease. This not only simplifies the design process but also allows for the easy replication of designs.

3. **Resource Utilization**: Identical replication allows for the efficient use of resources. By replicating a design, designers can make the most out of their resources, whether it be time, effort, or materials. This is particularly important in industries where resources are limited.

#### Disadvantages of Identical Replication in Design

1. **Lack of Creativity**: Identical replication can lead to a lack of creativity in design. By replicating a design, designers may be limited in their ability to create unique and innovative designs. This can be particularly problematic in industries where creativity is highly valued.

2. **Complexity**: While identical replication can simplify the design process, it can also lead to complexity in the final design. By replicating a design, designers may have to deal with a large number of parameters and components, which can make the design more complex and difficult to manage.

3. **Limited Customization**: Identical replication may limit the ability to customize a design. By replicating a design, designers may be limited in their ability to make changes or modifications to the design. This can be problematic in industries where customization is highly valued.

In conclusion, identical replication in design has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. While it can offer efficiency and standardization, it may also limit creativity and customization. As with any design approach, it is important for designers to carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages before deciding whether to use identical replication in their designs.

### Section: 7.1 Overview of Semi-automatic Machines

#### 7.1a Introduction to semi-automatic machines

Semi-automatic machines have been a significant part of the architectural design process since the seventeenth century. These machines, as the name suggests, are a blend of manual and automated operations. They are designed to assist architects and designers in creating precise and complex drawings, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the design process.

The concept of semi-automatic machines can be traced back to the early modern period, when architects and engineers began to explore the potential of mechanical devices in the design and construction process. These machines were designed to perform specific tasks, such as drawing straight lines, circles, or complex geometric shapes, with a high degree of precision. They were also equipped with numerical controls, allowing for the automation of certain operations.

One of the earliest examples of a semi-automatic machine is the Jacquard loom, invented in the early nineteenth century. This machine used a series of punched cards to control the weaving process, thereby automating a task that was previously done manually. This principle of using numerical controls to automate specific tasks was later applied to architectural design, leading to the development of semi-automatic machines for drawing.

The operation of these machines is based on the principles of kinematic chains, as described by Mario H. Gottfried Gutiérrez. A kinematic chain is a series of mechanical components connected in such a way that the motion of one component affects the motion of the others. In the context of semi-automatic machines, this principle is used to control the movement of the machine's drawing arm, allowing it to create precise and complex drawings.

The development of semi-automatic machines has been closely tied to advancements in technology. For instance, the introduction of polyphase electric motors in the early twentieth century led to the development of more advanced and efficient semi-automatic machines. Similarly, the advent of computer-aided design (CAD) systems has further enhanced the capabilities of these machines, allowing for the creation of complex and detailed drawings.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the history, principles, and impact of semi-automatic machines for architectural design. We will also explore the role of these machines in the evolution of digital design, and their potential for future advancements.

#### 7.1b Operation of semi-automatic machines

The operation of semi-automatic machines is a complex process that involves a combination of manual and automated operations. The machine is controlled by an operator, who inputs the design parameters and controls the machine's movements. The machine then performs the drawing operations based on these parameters, with a high degree of precision and efficiency.

The operation of these machines can be understood in terms of the concept of a kinematic chain, as described by Mario H. Gottfried Gutiérrez. The machine's drawing arm is a series of mechanical components connected in such a way that the motion of one component affects the motion of the others. This allows the machine to perform complex drawing operations with a high degree of precision.

The operation of these machines is also influenced by the principles of factory automation infrastructure. This includes the use of numerical controls, which allow for the automation of specific tasks, and the use of automation masters, which control the operation of the machine.

The operation of semi-automatic machines is also closely tied to the concept of the ABC of theory and application of polyphase electric motors in industry, as described by Gutiérrez. This includes the use of polyphase electric motors to control the machine's movements, and the use of automation masters to control the operation of the machine.

#### 7.2a Exploration of architectural styles and orders during the seventeenth century

The seventeenth century was a period of significant change and development in the field of architecture. The Baroque style, which had been gaining popularity in Europe, began to make its way to the Americas, where it was adapted and blended with local influences to create unique architectural styles.

In Spain, the Baroque style was heavily influenced by the Jesuits, who promoted it as a means of expressing grandeur and opulence. The early characteristics of Spanish Baroque included a lavish exterior contrasting with a relatively simple interior, and multiple spaces carefully planned for lighting and atmosphere. This can be seen in the new west facade of Santiago de Compostela Cathedral, built in the late 1730s, which features spectacular towers designed by Fernando de Casas Novoa.

In Seville, the College of San Telmo, built in the early 18th century, showcases the influence of Italian Baroque on Spanish architecture. The College's facade, designed by Leonardo de Figueroa, is a prime example of the ornate and intricate details that became synonymous with the Spanish Baroque.

The most ornate works of the Spanish Baroque, however, were made by Jose Benito de Churriguera in Madrid and Salamanca. His buildings, such as the College of San Telmo and the Church of San Lorenzo, are nearly overwhelmed by the ornament of gilded wood, gigantic twisting columns, and sculpted vegetation. This ornate style, known as Churrigueresque, was adopted in many parts of Latin America, particularly in Mexico and Brazil.

In Mexico, the Baroque style was heavily influenced by the Churrigueresque style, with notable examples such as the Zacatecas Cathedral and the Metropolitan Tabernacle of the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral. These buildings showcase the intricate and ornate details that became synonymous with the Mexican Baroque.

In Brazil, the Baroque style was also heavily influenced by the Churrigueresque style, with notable examples such as the Monastery of Sao Bento in Rio de Janeiro. The Monastery, built in the late 17th century, features intricate carvings and ornate details that are characteristic of the Brazilian Baroque.

The Baroque style also made its way to the Caribbean, where it was adapted and blended with local influences to create unique architectural styles. The Dominican Republic, for example, saw the development of the Indigenous Baroque style, which incorporated elements of indigenous architecture and design. This can be seen in the Church of Santo Domingo, built in the late 17th century, which features a blend of Baroque and indigenous influences.

In conclusion, the seventeenth century was a period of significant change and development in the field of architecture. The Baroque style, heavily influenced by the Jesuits, gained popularity in Europe and made its way to the Americas, where it was adapted and blended with local influences to create unique architectural styles. The Churrigueresque style, in particular, had a significant impact on the development of Baroque architecture in Latin America. 





### Subsection: 7.2b Analysis of the unique inventions during this period

The seventeenth century was a period of significant innovation in the field of architecture, particularly in the development of semi-automatic machines for the drawing of architectural orders. These machines, often referred to as "machines for the drawing of the architectural orders oddly invented in the seventeenth century," were designed to streamline the process of creating architectural drawings and plans.

One of the most notable inventions of this period was the use of digital design in architecture. This innovation, while not entirely new, saw a significant advancement during the seventeenth century. The use of digital design allowed architects to create complex and intricate designs with a level of precision and efficiency that was previously unattainable. This was made possible by the development of new mathematical and computational techniques, such as the use of polynomials and matrices, as well as the application of these techniques to the construction of calendars and the calculation of astronomical phenomena.

The invention of the Chronomètre of Loulié, for example, was a significant advancement in the field of digital design. This device, described by its inventor as "a machine for the drawing of the architectural orders," was designed to automate the process of creating architectural drawings. The Chronomètre of Loulié used a series of gears and levers to generate a set of coordinates, which could then be used to create a precise architectural drawing. This invention marked a significant shift in the way architectural drawings were created, moving from a largely manual process to a more automated one.

Another notable invention of this period was the Enaton, a machine designed for the drawing of architectural orders. The Enaton, developed by Abraham ben Mazhir, was a complex machine that used a series of pulleys and levers to generate a set of coordinates. These coordinates were then used to create a precise architectural drawing. The Enaton was particularly notable for its use of a novel mathematical technique known as the "method of elimination," which allowed for the reduction of a set of equations to a single equation with a single unknown. This technique, while not entirely new, was applied in a novel way to the field of architectural design, allowing for a level of precision and efficiency that was previously unattainable.

In conclusion, the seventeenth century was a period of significant innovation in the field of architecture, particularly in the development of semi-automatic machines for the drawing of architectural orders. These machines, while not entirely new, saw significant advancements during this period, particularly in the use of digital design and novel mathematical techniques. The inventions of the Chronomètre of Loulié and the Enaton, among others, marked a significant shift in the way architectural drawings were created, moving from a largely manual process to a more automated one.

The stereographic projection, a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional object, has been a fundamental tool in the field of architecture since ancient times. It has been used to simplify complex architectural designs, making them easier to understand and replicate.

The use of stereographic projection in architectural drawing is not a new concept. It has been used extensively in the past, particularly in the classical orders of ancient Greece and Rome. The Greeks, for instance, used the stereographic projection to represent the five regular polyhedra, which were considered the ideal forms for architectural design. The Romans, on the other hand, used it to simplify the complex geometric forms found in their architecture.

In this chapter, we will explore the principles behind stereographic projection and its applications in architectural drawing. We will also discuss the evolution of this technique over time, from its early use in ancient civilizations to its modern applications in digital design.

## Chapter 9: The Intersection of Drawings and Numbers:




### Introduction

In the realm of design, numbers play a crucial role in shaping the final outcome. They are the building blocks that guide the creative process, providing a framework for designers to work within and offering a means of quantifying and evaluating their ideas. This chapter, "The Role of Numbers in Design," delves into the intricate relationship between numbers and design, exploring how they are used, why they are important, and the impact they have on the design process.

The use of numbers in design is not a recent development. Throughout history, designers have used numerical systems to create order and structure in their work. From the ancient Greeks who used mathematical ratios to create harmonious compositions, to the modern designers who use algorithms to generate complex designs, numbers have been a fundamental tool in the design process.

However, with the advent of digital design, the role of numbers has become even more pronounced. Digital design tools, such as computer-aided design (CAD) programs, allow designers to manipulate numbers and mathematical equations directly, providing a level of precision and control that was previously unattainable. This has opened up new possibilities for designers, enabling them to create complex and intricate designs that were previously impossible to achieve.

In this chapter, we will explore these topics in more detail, examining the historical context of number use in design, the role of numbers in digital design, and the impact of numbers on the design process. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities that arise from the use of numbers in design, providing a comprehensive understanding of the role of numbers in design.




### Section: 9.1a Introduction to the role of numbers in design

Numbers play a pivotal role in the design process, serving as a language that allows designers to communicate their ideas and concepts. They provide a framework for understanding and evaluating design decisions, offering a means of quantifying and qualifying the design process. In this section, we will explore the importance of numbers in design, delving into their historical context, their role in digital design, and their impact on the design process.

#### The Historical Context of Number Use in Design

The use of numbers in design is not a recent development. Throughout history, designers have used numerical systems to create order and structure in their work. The ancient Greeks, for instance, used mathematical ratios to create harmonious compositions. The Renaissance saw a revival of interest in the mathematical principles of the ancients, with artists and architects like Leonardo da Vinci and Andrea Palladio incorporating mathematical proportions into their designs.

In the modern era, the advent of digital design tools has further emphasized the importance of numbers in design. These tools allow designers to manipulate numbers and mathematical equations directly, providing a level of precision and control that was previously unattainable. This has opened up new possibilities for designers, enabling them to create complex and intricate designs that were previously impossible to achieve.

#### The Role of Numbers in Digital Design

In the realm of digital design, numbers are used in a variety of ways. They are used to define the parameters of a design, to calculate the dimensions of a design, and to simulate the behavior of a design. For instance, in the design of a building, numbers might be used to define the dimensions of the building, to calculate the amount of material needed, and to simulate the structural integrity of the building.

Numbers are also used in digital design to create patterns and textures. For instance, the use of fractal geometry in digital design allows designers to create complex and intricate patterns by defining a set of simple rules and a set of initial conditions. This approach, known as generative design, allows designers to explore a vast design space, generating a large number of design options that can then be evaluated and refined.

#### The Impact of Numbers on the Design Process

The use of numbers in design has a profound impact on the design process. It allows designers to quantify and qualify their design decisions, providing a means of evaluating the effectiveness of their designs. This can lead to more informed design decisions, as designers can test their ideas against a set of numerical criteria.

Moreover, the use of numbers in design can lead to more efficient and effective design processes. By defining the parameters of a design in numerical terms, designers can automate certain aspects of the design process, reducing the time and effort required to create a design. This can be particularly beneficial in complex design problems, where the design space is vast and the design process is iterative.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these topics, exploring the historical context of number use in design, the role of numbers in digital design, and the impact of numbers on the design process. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities that arise from the use of numbers in design, providing a comprehensive understanding of the role of numbers in design.




### Subsection: 9.1b The impact of numbers on design decisions

The impact of numbers on design decisions is profound. Numbers not only provide a means of quantifying and qualifying design decisions, but they also influence the way designers think about and approach these decisions. 

#### The Influence of Numbers on Design Thinking

Numbers can influence design thinking in several ways. For instance, the use of numerical data can provide designers with valuable insights into the behavior of their designs. This can help them identify areas of improvement, guide their design decisions, and evaluate the effectiveness of their designs.

Moreover, the use of numbers can also influence the way designers perceive and interpret their designs. As the empirical research cited in the previous section suggests, the inclusion of numerical data can produce significant fixation effects, leading designers to focus on certain aspects of their designs while neglecting others. This can limit their creativity and innovation, and can lead to suboptimal design decisions.

#### The Impact of Numbers on Design Outcomes

The impact of numbers on design outcomes is equally significant. Numbers can influence the quality, functionality, and usability of a design. For instance, in the design of a building, the use of numerical data can help designers optimize the building's structural integrity, energy efficiency, and user experience.

However, the use of numbers can also lead to over-optimization, where designers focus on optimizing one aspect of their design at the expense of others. This can result in a design that is overly complex, difficult to use, or inefficient. Therefore, it is important for designers to strike a balance between optimization and simplicity, and to consider the broader implications of their design decisions.

In conclusion, numbers play a crucial role in design, influencing not only the way designers think and work, but also the outcomes of their designs. As such, a deep understanding of numbers and their implications is essential for any designer.




### Subsection: 9.1c Case studies of numerical design

In this section, we will explore some case studies that highlight the role of numbers in design. These case studies will provide practical examples of how numbers are used in design, and how they can influence design decisions and outcomes.

#### Case Study 1: The Role of Numbers in the Design of a Smart Home

In the design of a smart home, numbers play a crucial role in optimizing the home's functionality and efficiency. For instance, the designer might use numerical data to determine the optimal placement of sensors and actuators, to optimize the home's energy usage, or to optimize the home's security system.

For example, the designer might use numerical data to determine the optimal placement of sensors. This could involve using statistical analysis to determine the likelihood of certain events occurring in different parts of the home, and then placing sensors accordingly. For instance, if the data shows that burglaries are more likely to occur in the living room than in the bedroom, the designer might place more sensors in the living room.

Similarly, the designer might use numerical data to optimize the home's energy usage. This could involve using data on the home's energy consumption to determine the most efficient way to use energy, or to identify areas where energy usage can be reduced. For instance, if the data shows that the home's energy usage is highest in the morning, the designer might design the home's energy system to use energy more efficiently during this period.

Finally, the designer might use numerical data to optimize the home's security system. This could involve using data on past burglaries to identify the most common points of entry, and then designing the security system to protect these points of entry.

#### Case Study 2: The Role of Numbers in the Design of a Mobile App

In the design of a mobile app, numbers play a crucial role in optimizing the app's functionality and usability. For instance, the designer might use numerical data to determine the optimal layout of the app's interface, to optimize the app's performance, or to optimize the app's user experience.

For example, the designer might use numerical data to determine the optimal layout of the app's interface. This could involve using statistical analysis to determine the most common user actions, and then designing the interface to facilitate these actions. For instance, if the data shows that users often tap on a certain button, the designer might place this button in a more prominent position.

Similarly, the designer might use numerical data to optimize the app's performance. This could involve using data on the app's usage patterns to determine the most efficient way to use resources, or to identify areas where performance can be improved. For instance, if the data shows that the app's performance is lowest when there are many users online, the designer might design the app to use resources more efficiently during this period.

Finally, the designer might use numerical data to optimize the app's user experience. This could involve using data on user behavior to identify areas where the user experience can be improved, or to identify features that are not being used and can therefore be removed. For instance, if the data shows that users rarely use a certain feature, the designer might remove this feature to simplify the app's interface.




### Subsection: 9.2a Early forms of numerical design

The history of numerical design is deeply intertwined with the development of mathematical concepts and computational tools. In this section, we will explore some of the early forms of numerical design, focusing on the role of numbers in these early designs.

For instance, the design of Gothic cathedrals was based on a system of proportions that was based on the number 3. This system was used to design the height, width, and length of the cathedrals.

Similarly, the design of Islamic architecture was based on a system of proportions that was based on the number 8. This system was used to design the domes, arches, and other elements of Islamic architecture.

#### The Role of Numbers in Renaissance Design

In the Renaissance, numbers played an even more important role in design. The Renaissance saw the development of perspective drawing, which was based on mathematical principles and ratios. These principles and ratios were represented using numbers, and the design was based on these numbers.

For instance, the design of the Sistine Chapel was based on a system of proportions that was based on the number 5. This system was used to design the height, width, and length of the chapel.

Similarly, the design of the Villa d'Este was based on a system of proportions that was based on the number 7. This system was used to design the gardens, fountains, and other elements of the villa.

In conclusion, the history of numerical design is deeply intertwined with the development of mathematical concepts and computational tools. From the ancient civilizations to the Renaissance, numbers have played a crucial role in design, shaping the way we design and construct buildings, monuments, and artifacts.




### Subsection: 9.2b Evolution of numerical design techniques

These software tools use mathematical equations and algorithms to create and manipulate designs. The numbers in these equations and algorithms determine the shape, size, and behavior of the design.

Similarly, the use of computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software has also become commonplace. These software tools use numbers to control the movement of machines and tools, allowing for precise and repeatable manufacturing processes.

#### The Role of Numbers in Digital Design

The advent of digital design has further expanded the role of numbers in design. Digital design involves the use of digital tools and software to create, manipulate, and analyze designs. This process involves the use of a wide range of numbers, from the basic dimensions and coordinates of a design to the complex mathematical equations and algorithms used in computer simulations.

For instance, the use of finite element method (FEM) in structural analysis is a common practice in digital design. FEM uses a system of equations to model the behavior of a structure under various loads. The accuracy of these models depends on the precision of the numbers used in the equations.

Similarly, the use of lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) in fluid dynamics is another example of the role of numbers in digital design. LBM uses a lattice-based approach to simulate fluid flow. The accuracy of these simulations depends on the precision of the numbers used in the lattice.

In conclusion, the role of numbers in design has evolved significantly over the centuries.

## Example of a toolkit to support DIY design by users

To illustrate the basic concepts of a toolkit for product innovation and product customization by users, consider a house owner who wants to self-design a custom deck that is “just right” for his or her specific backyard physical setting and planned deck usages. The house owner will know the functions they want their custom deck to serve – outdoor barbecues for up to 10 people, play space for their kids, etc. But suppose that these users – like the vast majority of deck users – do not actually have the architectural and engineering skills required to create a complete, buildable design for the deck they want. A “deck design” toolkit solves this problem by inviting the DIY user to design "only the top surface" of deck they want by simply sketching the deck size and shape they have in mind onto a computer screen. Note that this top surface is the only portion of the deck that will "directly interact with planned user activities" on the deck – and so accordingly is the only aspect of deck design for which specialized user knowledge of intended deck uses is relevant.

The toolkit then further helps the user to check deck surface functionality via a simulation of just that part of the deck design. For example, users might be asked to select and place images of items like chairs and tables on the deck surface they have sketched out. This will assist them to determine whether the size and shape of the deck surface they have designed will actually be adequate for their intended uses. If not, they can easily make adjustments directly on the computer screen to solve the usage problems they see, and then assess again to see if they are now satisfied. Again, this toolkit is just one example of how innovation can be used to support user innovation and customization in design.

#### Case Study 1: The Ethics of User-Centered Design in Smart Homes

Smart homes, which use digital technology to automate and control various aspects of a home, present a unique set of ethical considerations. For instance, consider the design of a smart home system that controls the lighting and temperature in a home. The system is designed to learn the user's preferences and adjust the lighting and temperature accordingly. However, what happens if the user's preferences are not aligned with the system's understanding of energy efficiency? Should the system prioritize the user's preferences or its own understanding of energy efficiency?

This case study highlights the importance of user-centered design in digital design. By understanding the user's needs and preferences, designers can create systems that respect the user's autonomy and privacy. However, it also raises questions about the role of designers in making decisions that can impact the user's behavior.

#### Case Study 2: The Ethics of Design for Social Impact in Online Learning Platforms

Online learning platforms, such as Coursera and edX, have become increasingly popular in recent years. These platforms offer a wide range of courses, from introductory level to advanced, and cater to a diverse group of learners. However, the design of these platforms can have a significant impact on the learning experience of the users.

For example, consider the design of a quiz feature on an online learning platform. The quiz is designed to test the user's understanding of the course material. However, the design of the quiz can significantly impact the user's performance. If the quiz is designed to be too difficult, it can discourage users from continuing with the course. On the other hand, if the quiz is designed to be too easy, it can lead to a false sense of understanding and hinder the user's learning.

This case study illustrates the importance of design for social impact in digital design. By considering the potential impact of the design on the users, designers can create products that promote positive social outcomes.

#### Case Study 3: The Ethics of Design for the Environment in Digital Interfaces

Digital interfaces, such as websites and mobile apps, are often designed with the goal of engaging users and encouraging them to spend more time on the interface. However, this can lead to the overuse of resources, such as data and energy, which can have a negative impact on the environment.

Consider the design of a mobile app that allows users to stream music. The app is designed to be visually appealing and easy to use, but it also consumes a significant amount of data and energy. This raises questions about the ethical responsibility of designers in considering the environmental impact of their designs.

This case study highlights the importance of design for the environment in digital design. By considering the environmental impact of their designs, designers can create products that are not only aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly but also environmentally sustainable.

In conclusion, these case studies illustrate the importance of ethics in digital design. By considering the ethical implications of their designs, designers can create products that not only meet the needs and preferences of the users but also promote positive social and environmental outcomes.




### Subsection: 20.2a The difficulties of ethical design

The role of ethics in design is a complex and multifaceted one. As we have seen in the previous section, ethical considerations can significantly impact the design process and the resulting product. However, the application of ethics in design is not without its challenges.

#### The Difficulty of Defining Ethics

One of the primary challenges in ethical design is defining what constitutes an ethical design. As mentioned in the previous section, the concept of values is central to value-based engineering (VBE) and value sensitive design (VSD). However, the definition of values is not without its criticisms.

Le Dantec et al. argue that formulating a pre-determined list of implicated values runs the risk of ignoring important values that can be elicited from any given empirical case by mapping those values a priori. This critique highlights the difficulty of defining values in a way that is both comprehensive and flexible.

Manders-Huits instead takes on the concept of ‘values’ itself with VSD as the central issue. She argues that the traditional VSD definition of values as “what a person or group of people consider important in life” is nebulous and runs the risk of conflating stakeholders preferences with moral values. This critique underscores the need for a more nuanced understanding of values in ethical design.

#### The Difficulty of Making Moral Commitments

Another challenge in ethical design is making moral commitments. As argued by Wessel Reijers and Bert Gordijn, the value heuristics of VSD are insufficient given their lack of moral commitment. They propose that a heuristic of virtues stemming from a virtue ethics approach to technology design, mostly influenced by the works of Shannon Vallor, provides a more holistic approach to technology design.

However, Steven Umbrello has criticized this approach arguing that not only can the heuristic of values be reinforced but that VSD does make moral commitments to at least three universal values: human well-being, justice, and dignity. This critique underscores the difficulty of making moral commitments in a way that is both comprehensive and nuanced.

#### The Difficulty of Implementing Ethics in Design

Finally, the implementation of ethics in design presents its own set of challenges. As argued by Batya Friedman and David Hendry, the earlier iterations of the VSD approach did not make explicit moral commitments. However, it has since evolved over the past two decades to commit to a set of values. This evolution highlights the difficulty of implementing ethics in design in a way that is both consistent and adaptable.

In conclusion, the role of ethics in design is a complex and multifaceted one. The challenges of defining ethics, making moral commitments, and implementing ethics in design underscore the need for a nuanced and comprehensive approach to ethical design.




### Subsection: 20.2b Overcoming the challenges of ethics in design

Despite the challenges of ethical design, there are ways to navigate these complexities and ensure that ethical considerations are adequately addressed in the design process. This section will explore some strategies for overcoming the challenges of ethics in design.

#### Embracing a Value-Based Approach

One way to navigate the difficulty of defining ethics is to embrace a value-based approach. This approach recognizes that values are not static or universal, but rather context-specific and subject to change. As such, it advocates for a more flexible and context-sensitive approach to defining values. This can be achieved through the use of value-based engineering (VBE) and value sensitive design (VSD), which emphasize the importance of considering values in the design process.

#### Making Moral Commitments

Another strategy for overcoming the difficulty of making moral commitments is to incorporate a virtue ethics approach to technology design. This approach, influenced by the works of Shannon Vallor, emphasizes the importance of virtues such as honesty, fairness, and respect in the design process. By incorporating these virtues into the design process, designers can make more informed and ethical decisions.

#### Engaging in Ethical Analysis

Engaging in ethical analysis can also help designers navigate the challenges of ethics in design. This involves systematically examining the ethical implications of a design, considering the potential impacts on various stakeholders, and evaluating these impacts against ethical principles. This process can help designers identify potential ethical issues and develop strategies to address them.

#### Collaborating with Ethics Experts

Collaborating with ethics experts can also be a valuable strategy for overcoming the challenges of ethics in design. These experts can provide valuable insights into ethical considerations and help designers navigate complex ethical issues. They can also assist in developing ethical guidelines and principles that can guide the design process.

In conclusion, while the role of ethics in design presents significant challenges, there are ways to navigate these complexities and ensure that ethical considerations are adequately addressed in the design process. By embracing a value-based approach, making moral commitments, engaging in ethical analysis, and collaborating with ethics experts, designers can navigate the challenges of ethics in design and create more ethical and responsible designs.




### Subsection: 20.2c Case studies of overcoming ethical challenges

In this section, we will explore some case studies that demonstrate how designers have successfully navigated the challenges of ethics in design. These case studies will provide practical examples of how the strategies discussed in the previous section can be applied in real-world scenarios.

The team faced several ethical challenges, including the potential for privacy invasion, the potential for exploitation of the elderly, and the potential for the system to be used for malicious purposes.

To address these challenges, the team adopted a value-based approach, considering the values of privacy, respect, and security. They also made moral commitments to ensure that the system would not invade privacy, exploit the elderly, or be used for malicious purposes. They engaged in ethical analysis, considering the potential impacts of the system on various stakeholders and evaluating these impacts against ethical principles. Finally, they collaborated with ethics experts to ensure that their design decisions were ethical.

#### Case Study 2: The Ethical Design of a Social Media Platform

In this case study, a team of designers was tasked with creating a social media platform that would promote positive social interactions. The team faced several ethical challenges, including the potential for cyberbullying, the potential for the platform to be used for propaganda, and the potential for the platform to exacerbate social inequalities.

To address these challenges, the team adopted a value-based approach, considering the values of inclusivity, transparency, and diversity. They also made moral commitments to ensure that the platform would not promote cyberbullying, be used for propaganda, or exacerbate social inequalities. They engaged in ethical analysis, considering the potential impacts of the platform on various stakeholders and evaluating these impacts against ethical principles. Finally, they collaborated with ethics experts to ensure that their design decisions were ethical.

These case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the strategies discussed in the previous section for overcoming the challenges of ethics in design.
