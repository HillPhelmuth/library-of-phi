### Section 1.1 Cartesian Coordinate System:

The Cartesian coordinate system is a fundamental concept in mathematics and is widely used in various fields, including electromagnetics. It is a three-dimensional coordinate system that uses three perpendicular axes to define the location of a point in space. The axes are usually labeled as x, y, and z, and the point is represented by the coordinates (x, y, z).

#### 1.1a Introduction to Cartesian Coordinate System

The Cartesian coordinate system was developed by the French mathematician René Descartes in the 17th century. It is based on the concept of a coordinate plane, which is a two-dimensional plane defined by two perpendicular axes. The Cartesian coordinate system extends this concept to three dimensions by adding a third axis.

The Cartesian coordinate system is a right-handed system, meaning that the x-axis is positive to the right, the y-axis is positive upwards, and the z-axis is positive towards the viewer. This convention is important in electromagnetics, as it allows us to easily visualize and manipulate electromagnetic fields in space.

One of the key advantages of the Cartesian coordinate system is its ability to represent any point in space with a unique set of coordinates. This allows us to easily describe the location of a point in space and perform calculations involving that point.

In electromagnetics, the Cartesian coordinate system is used to describe the behavior of electromagnetic fields. The electric and magnetic fields are represented by vector quantities, and their behavior is described by Maxwell's equations. These equations are written in terms of the electric and magnetic fields, which are represented by the vectors E and B, respectively.

The Cartesian coordinate system is also used in the study of electromagnetic radiation. The direction of propagation of an electromagnetic wave is represented by the unit vector k, which is perpendicular to the plane of the wave. The wavelength and frequency of the wave are represented by the symbols λ and ν, respectively.

In addition to its applications in electromagnetics, the Cartesian coordinate system is also used in other fields, such as physics, engineering, and computer science. It is a versatile and powerful tool that allows us to describe and analyze complex systems in a systematic and mathematical manner.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of vector calculus, which is used to describe and analyze vector quantities, such as electric and magnetic fields. We will also discuss the applications of vector calculus in electromagnetics, including the calculation of electromagnetic fields and the analysis of electromagnetic systems.

### Conversion between barycentric and Cartesian coordinates

#### Edge approach

Given a point $\mathbf{r}$ in a triangle's plane one can obtain the barycentric coordinates $\lambda_{1}$, $\lambda_{2}$ and $\lambda_{3}$ from the Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ or vice versa.

We can write the Cartesian coordinates of the point $\mathbf{r}$ in terms of the Cartesian components of the triangle vertices $\mathbf{r}_1$, $\mathbf{r}_2$, $\mathbf{r}_3$ where $\mathbf{r}_i = (x_i, y_i)$ and in terms of the barycentric coordinates of $\mathbf{r}$ as

$$
x = \lambda_{1} x_{1} + \lambda_{2} x_{2} + \lambda_{3} x_{3} \\
y = \lambda_{1} y_{1} + \lambda_{2} y_{2} + \lambda_{3} y_{3} \\
$$

That is, the Cartesian coordinates of any point are a weighted average of the Cartesian coordinates of the triangle's vertices, with the weights being the point's barycentric coordinates summing to unity.

To find the reverse transformation, from Cartesian coordinates to barycentric coordinates, we first substitute $\lambda_{3} = 1 - \lambda_{1} - \lambda_{2}$ into the above to obtain

$$
x = \lambda_{1} x_{1} + \lambda_{2} x_{2} + (1 - \lambda_{1} - \lambda_{2}) x_{3} \\
y = \lambda_{1} y_{1} + \lambda_{2} y_{2} + (1 - \lambda_{1} - \lambda_{2}) y_{3} \\
$$

Rearranging, this is

$$
\mathbf{T} \cdot \lambda = \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_3
$$

where $\lambda$ is the vector of the first two barycentric coordinates, $\mathbf{r}$ is the vector of Cartesian coordinates, and $\mathbf{T}$ is a matrix given by

$$
\mathbf{T} = \begin{bmatrix}
x_1-x_3 & x_2-x_3 \\
y_1-y_3 & y_2-y_3 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Section 1.1c Limitations of Cartesian Coordinate System

While the Cartesian coordinate system is a powerful tool for representing points in three-dimensional space, it does have some limitations. One of the main limitations is that it is not well-suited for representing points that are not on the coordinate axes. This can be problematic in certain applications, such as in the study of electromagnetics where points in space are often not aligned with the coordinate axes.

Another limitation of the Cartesian coordinate system is that it can be difficult to visualize and manipulate points in higher dimensions. While it is relatively easy to visualize points in three-dimensional space, it becomes increasingly difficult to visualize points in four or more dimensions. This can make it challenging to understand and analyze complex systems in electromagnetics, where there may be multiple dimensions of varying importance.

Furthermore, the Cartesian coordinate system is not well-suited for representing and manipulating curved surfaces or volumes. This can be a limitation in the study of electromagnetics, where many phenomena are inherently curved or three-dimensional. For example, the electric and magnetic fields around a charged particle are not easily represented using Cartesian coordinates, as they are curved and three-dimensional.

Despite these limitations, the Cartesian coordinate system remains a fundamental tool in mathematics and is widely used in electromagnetics. It is particularly useful for linear transformations, as seen in the previous section, and for representing points in two-dimensional space. However, for more complex and non-linear systems, other coordinate systems, such as the barycentric coordinate system, may be more appropriate.

### Conclusion

In this section, we have explored the limitations of the Cartesian coordinate system. While it is a powerful tool for representing points in three-dimensional space, it does have some limitations that can make it difficult to represent and manipulate certain phenomena in electromagnetics. However, by understanding these limitations, we can better appreciate the strengths of the Cartesian coordinate system and use it effectively in our studies of electromagnetics.

### Subsection 1.2a Introduction to Cylindrical Coordinate System

The cylindrical coordinate system is a three-dimensional coordinate system that is particularly useful for representing points in space that are not on the coordinate axes. It is defined by three coordinates: `ρ` (rho), `φ` (phi), and `z`. The first two coordinates, `ρ` and `φ`, are used to represent points on a cylindrical surface, while the third coordinate, `z`, represents the height of the point above or below the cylindrical surface.

The cylindrical coordinate system is often used in electromagnetics due to its ability to easily represent and manipulate curved surfaces and volumes. For example, the electric and magnetic fields around a charged particle can be easily represented using cylindrical coordinates, as these fields are curved and three-dimensional.

The cylindrical coordinate system is also useful for representing points in higher dimensions. While it can be difficult to visualize and manipulate points in four or more dimensions using Cartesian coordinates, it becomes much easier using cylindrical coordinates. This can be particularly useful in the study of electromagnetics, where there may be multiple dimensions of varying importance.

In the next section, we will explore the mathematical properties of the cylindrical coordinate system and how it can be used to solve problems in electromagnetics.

### Subsection 1.2b Conversion between Cartesian and Cylindrical Coordinates

Converting between Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates is a fundamental skill in electromagnetics. This conversion is necessary when dealing with problems that involve both linear and curved components, as is often the case in electromagnetic fields.

The conversion between Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates is governed by the following equations:

$$
x = \rho \cos \phi
$$

$$
y = \rho \sin \phi
$$

$$
z = z
$$

where `ρ` is the radial distance from the origin, `φ` is the azimuthal angle, and `z` is the height above or below the cylindrical surface.

Conversely, the conversion from cylindrical to Cartesian coordinates is given by:

$$
\rho = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

$$
\phi = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
$$

$$
z = z
$$

These equations allow us to convert between the two coordinate systems, and they are essential tools in solving problems in electromagnetics.

In the next section, we will explore how these coordinate systems can be used to solve problems in electromagnetics, particularly in the context of Maxwell's equations.

### Subsection 1.2c Applications of Cylindrical Coordinate System

The cylindrical coordinate system is a powerful tool in the study of electromagnetics. It is particularly useful in the analysis of electromagnetic fields, as it allows us to easily represent and manipulate curved surfaces and volumes. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of the cylindrical coordinate system in electromagnetics.

#### Electromagnetic Fields

One of the primary applications of the cylindrical coordinate system in electromagnetics is in the analysis of electromagnetic fields. The cylindrical coordinate system is particularly useful for representing the electric and magnetic fields around a charged particle. The fields are curved and three-dimensional, making them difficult to represent using Cartesian coordinates. However, with the cylindrical coordinate system, we can easily represent these fields and perform calculations on them.

The electric field around a charged particle is given by:

$$
\vec{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{r}
$$

where `q` is the charge of the particle, `r` is the radial distance from the particle, and `\hat{r}` is the unit vector in the radial direction.

The magnetic field around a moving charged particle is given by:

$$
\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q v r}{c^2} \left(\hat{\phi} - \frac{v r}{c^2} \hat{z}\right)
$$

where `v` is the velocity of the particle, `c` is the speed of light, `\hat{\phi}` is the unit vector in the azimuthal direction, and `\hat{z}` is the unit vector in the height direction.

#### Maxwell's Equations

Maxwell's equations, which describe the behavior of electromagnetic fields, can also be expressed in cylindrical coordinates. These equations are particularly useful in the study of electromagnetics, as they provide a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of electromagnetic fields.

The cylindrical form of Maxwell's equations is given by:

$$
\frac{1}{\mu_0 \epsilon_0} \frac{\partial E_z}{\partial \phi} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0 r}
$$

$$
\frac{1}{\mu_0} \frac{\partial B_z}{\partial \phi} = \mu_0 \rho v_z
$$

$$
\frac{1}{\mu_0 \epsilon_0} \frac{\partial E_\phi}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial B_z}{\partial \phi}
$$

$$
\frac{1}{\mu_0 \epsilon_0} \frac{\partial E_z}{\partial \phi} = \frac{\partial B_\phi}{\partial z}
$$

where `E_z` and `B_z` are the z-components of the electric and magnetic fields, respectively, `E_\phi` and `B_\phi` are the azimuthal components, `ρ` is the charge density, and `v_z` is the z-component of the velocity of the charged particles.

In the next section, we will explore how these equations can be used to solve problems in electromagnetics.




### Subsection 1.2b Applications of Cylindrical Coordinate System

The cylindrical coordinate system is a powerful tool in electromagnetics, with a wide range of applications. In this section, we will explore some of these applications, focusing on how the cylindrical coordinate system can be used to simplify complex problems and provide insights into the behavior of electromagnetic fields.

#### 1.2b.1 Visualizing Rotation in Spacecraft Orbit

One of the most intriguing applications of the cylindrical coordinate system is in visualizing the rotation of a spacecraft in orbit. This is achieved through Poinsot's construction, a geometric representation of the rotation of a spacecraft. The cylindrical coordinate system is particularly useful in this context because it allows us to easily visualize the rotation of the spacecraft in three dimensions.

#### 1.2b.2 Line Integral Convolution

The cylindrical coordinate system also finds application in the technique of line integral convolution. This technique, first published in 1993, has been applied to a wide range of problems since then. The cylindrical coordinate system is particularly useful in this context because it allows us to easily represent and manipulate the lines along which the convolution is performed.

#### 1.2b.3 Solving Arbitrary Non-linear Systems

The cylindrical coordinate system is also used in the Gauss–Seidel method, a numerical method for solving arbitrary non-linear systems. The cylindrical coordinate system is particularly useful in this context because it allows us to easily represent and manipulate the non-linear equations that need to be solved.

#### 1.2b.4 Elliptic Cylindrical Coordinates

The cylindrical coordinate system is also used in the study of elliptic cylindrical coordinates. These coordinates are a three-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system that results from projecting the two-dimensional elliptic coordinate system in the perpendicular `z`-direction. The cylindrical coordinate system is particularly useful in this context because it allows us to easily represent and manipulate the elliptic cylindrical coordinates.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical properties of the cylindrical coordinate system and how it can be used to solve problems in electromagnetics.

## Chapter: Maxwell's Equations

### Introduction

Welcome to Chapter 2 of "Electromagnetics: Theory and Applications". In this chapter, we will delve into the heart of electromagnetics - Maxwell's equations. These equations, named after the physicist James Clerk Maxwell, are a set of four differential equations that describe how electric and magnetic fields interact. They are considered the foundation of classical electrodynamics, optics, and electric circuits, and have been unchallenged in these domains for over a century.

Maxwell's equations are a set of four equations, each of which relates the electric and magnetic fields. They are given by:

1. Gauss's law for electricity: $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}$$
2. Gauss's law for magnetism: $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$$
3. Faraday's law: $$\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$$
4. Ampere's law with Maxwell's addition: $$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$$

These equations are not only fundamental to the study of electromagnetics, but they also have wide-ranging applications in various fields such as telecommunications, electronics, and medical imaging. Understanding these equations is crucial for anyone studying or working in these fields.

In this chapter, we will explore each of these equations in detail, discussing their physical interpretations, mathematical derivations, and practical applications. We will also discuss the concept of electromagnetic waves, which are a direct consequence of Maxwell's equations, and their role in various phenomena such as light and radio waves.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of Maxwell's equations and their importance in the study of electromagnetics. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the rest of the book, as we delve deeper into the fascinating world of electromagnetics.
