## Foreward

Welcome to "How to Develop 'Breakthrough' Products and Services: A Comprehensive Guide". This book is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the process of developing breakthrough products and services, with a focus on the Systematic Inventive Thinking (SIT) approach.

The SIT approach, as outlined by the author, is a methodology that encourages the generation of large numbers of ideas. This approach is rooted in the belief that the rewards of generating a large number of ideas outweigh the costs. This notion can be traced back to early studies in the field, and it is a fundamental principle that underpins the entire process of product development.

However, the SIT approach also recognizes that the process of generating ideas can be complex and un-formalized. To address this, the approach encourages individuals to identify patterns of invention that are common to different contexts and apply them within a certain product category. This cognitive strategy is expected to provide an advantage over those who treat every task as new and unrelated to past ideation.

The SIT approach is also built on the thesis that certain patterns, termed templates, are identifiable, objectively verifiable, widely applied, and learnable. These templates serve as a facilitative tool that channels the ideation process, enabling the individual to be more productive and focused.

This book will delve into the details of the SIT approach, providing a comprehensive guide to understanding and applying this methodology. It will also explore the various aspects of product development, from defining market needs to the final product launch.

Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field of product development, this book will serve as a valuable resource.

### Subsection: 1.2a The Concept of User Innovation

User innovation is a concept that has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in the field of product and service development. It refers to the process of innovation by intermediate users (e.g., user firms) or consumer users (individual end-users or user communities), rather than by suppliers (producers or manufacturers). This concept is closely aligned to co-design and co-creation, and has been proven to result in more innovative solutions than traditional consultation methodologies.

Eric von Hippel and others have observed that many products and services are actually developed or at least refined, by users, at the site of implementation and use. These ideas are then moved back into the supply network. This is because products are developed to meet the widest possible need; when individual users face problems that the majority of consumers do not, they have no choice but to develop their own modifications to existing products, or entirely new products, to solve their issues. Often, user innovators will share their ideas with manufacturers in hopes of having them produce the product, a process called free revealing. However, user innovators also generate their own firms to commercialize their innovations and generate new markets, a process called "consumer-led market emergence." For example, research on how users innovated in multiple boardsports shows that some users capitalized on their innovations, founding firms in sports that became global markets.

Based on research on the evolution of Internet technologies and open source software Ilkka Tuomi further highlighted the point that users are fundamentally social. User innovation, therefore, is also socially and socio-technically distributed innovation. According to Tuomi, key uses are often unintended uses invented by user communities that reinterpret and reinvent the meaning of emerging technological opportunities.

The existence of user innovation, for example, by users of industrial robots, rather than the manufacturers of robots, is a core part of the argument against the Linear Innovation Diffusion Model. This model suggests that innovation is a linear process, starting with the development of a new product or service by a manufacturer, and then diffusing through the market. However, the reality is often more complex, with users playing a significant role in the development and diffusion of new products and services.

In the next section, we will explore the role of users in the development of breakthrough products and services, and how they can be effectively engaged in the innovation process.

### Subsection: 1.2b Role of Users in Innovation

The role of users in innovation is a critical aspect of product and service development. As we have seen in the previous section, users are often the driving force behind innovation, developing and refining products and services to meet their specific needs and problems. This section will delve deeper into the role of users in innovation, exploring their contributions and the benefits they bring to the innovation process.

#### 1.2b.1 User Innovation as a Source of New Ideas

Users are often the first to encounter problems or challenges with existing products and services. These problems can range from minor inconveniences to major barriers that prevent users from achieving their goals. In response to these problems, users may develop their own solutions, modifications, or even entirely new products or services. These user innovations can then be shared with other users or even with manufacturers, leading to the development of new, improved products and services.

For example, consider the case of the iPhone. The iPhone was not the first smartphone on the market, but it was the first to integrate a touch screen and a variety of other features that users had been requesting for years. These user-driven innovations were crucial to the success of the iPhone and have since become standard features in many other smartphones.

#### 1.2b.2 User Innovation as a Driver of Market Emergence

User innovation can also lead to the emergence of new markets. When users develop their own solutions to problems, they often create new demand for these solutions. This can lead to the formation of new markets, which can then be exploited by manufacturers.

For instance, consider the case of the skateboard. Skateboarding was originally a hobby or pastime, with users modifying existing products to suit their needs. However, as the sport gained popularity, users began to develop their own skateboards, leading to the emergence of a new market for skateboarding equipment. This market was then exploited by manufacturers, leading to the development of specialized skateboarding equipment and the growth of the skateboarding industry.

#### 1.2b.3 User Innovation as a Source of Knowledge and Insight

Finally, user innovation can provide valuable knowledge and insights to manufacturers. By observing how users interact with their products and services, manufacturers can gain a deeper understanding of user needs, preferences, and behaviors. This can lead to the development of more effective and user-friendly products and services.

For example, consider the case of the LEGO Mindstorm robot. The LEGO Mindstorm was developed in response to user requests for a programmable robot that could be built and customized by users. By observing how users interacted with the LEGO Mindstorm, LEGO gained valuable insights into user needs and preferences, leading to the development of new, improved products.

In conclusion, users play a crucial role in innovation, driving the development of new products and services, creating new markets, and providing valuable knowledge and insights to manufacturers. Understanding and leveraging the role of users in innovation is therefore essential for any organization seeking to develop breakthrough products and services.

### Subsection: 1.2c Case Studies of User Innovation

The iPhone was not the first smartphone on the market, but it was the first to integrate a touch screen and a variety of other features that users had been requesting for years. These user-driven innovations were crucial to the success of the iPhone and have since become standard features in many other smartphones.

The iPhone's success can be attributed to the active role that users played in its development. Users were not just passive consumers of the iPhone; they were actively involved in shaping the product. They provided feedback, suggestions, and even solutions to problems, which were then incorporated into the iPhone's design. This collaborative approach to product development not only resulted in a more user-friendly product but also fostered a sense of ownership and loyalty among users.

#### 1.2c.2 The Emergence of the Skateboarding Industry

The skateboarding industry is another example of a market that emerged as a result of user innovation. Skateboarding was originally a hobby or pastime, with users modifying existing products to suit their needs. However, as the sport gained popularity, users began to develop their own skateboards, leading to the emergence of a new market for skateboarding equipment.

The skateboarding industry is a testament to the power of user innovation. Users not only created a new market but also drove the development of specialized equipment and techniques. This user-driven innovation has been instrumental in the growth and evolution of the skateboarding industry.

#### 1.2c.3 The Role of Users in the Development of the LEGO Mindstorm

The LEGO Mindstorm is a robotics kit that was developed in response to user requests for a programmable robot that could be built and customized by users. The LEGO Mindstorm was a significant departure from traditional LEGO sets, which were primarily construction toys. However, the success of the LEGO Mindstorm can be attributed to the active involvement of users in its development.
