#### 1.1b Types of Launch Systems

There are several types of launch systems used in satellite engineering, each with its own unique characteristics and applications. These include rockets, space shuttles, and orbital launchers.

##### Rockets

Rockets are the most common type of launch system used in satellite engineering. They are designed to provide the necessary thrust to overcome the gravitational pull of the Earth and propel a satellite into space. Rockets can be classified into two main types: expendable and reusable.

Expendable rockets are designed to be used only once and are then discarded after launch. They are typically less expensive than reusable rockets, but also less efficient. Expendable rockets are often used for missions that require a high amount of thrust, such as launching heavy satellites into geostationary orbit.

Reusable rockets, on the other hand, are designed to be used multiple times. This makes them more expensive than expendable rockets, but also more efficient. Reusable rockets are often used for missions that require a lower amount of thrust, such as launching small satellites into low Earth orbit.

##### Space Shuttles

Space shuttles are a type of launch system that is designed to be reusable. They are capable of carrying a large payload into space and then returning to Earth for reuse. Space shuttles are typically used for missions that require a high amount of payload capacity, such as launching large satellites into low Earth orbit.

##### Orbital Launchers

### Introduction

Welcome to Chapter 2 of "Satellite Engineering: A Comprehensive Guide". In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of orbital mechanics, a crucial aspect of satellite engineering. 

Orbital mechanics, also known as celestial mechanics, is the branch of physics that deals with the motions of artificial satellites and natural objects (such as planets, moons, and comets) under the influence of gravitational forces. It is a complex field that combines principles from mechanics, mathematics, and physics to predict the behavior of satellites in orbit.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental principles of orbital mechanics, including Kepler's laws of planetary motion, the two-body problem, and the concept of orbital elements. We will also discuss the effects of atmospheric drag and solar radiation pressure on satellite orbits, and how these factors can be accounted for in orbit determination and prediction.

We will also delve into the practical applications of orbital mechanics in satellite engineering, such as satellite orbit determination, satellite constellations, and satellite communications. 

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of orbital mechanics, equipping readers with the knowledge and tools necessary to design, launch, and maintain satellites in orbit. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field of satellite engineering, this chapter will serve as a valuable resource in your journey.

Remember, the beauty of orbital mechanics lies not just in its complexity, but also in its simplicity. By understanding the fundamental principles, we can predict the behavior of satellites in orbit with remarkable accuracy. So, let's embark on this exciting journey together, exploring the wonders of orbital mechanics.




#### 2.1a Basics of Orbital Mechanics

Orbital mechanics is a complex field that combines principles from mechanics, mathematics, and physics to predict the behavior of satellites in orbit. In this section, we will explore the fundamental principles of orbital mechanics, including Kepler's laws of planetary motion, the two-body problem, and the concept of orbital elements.

#### Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion

Kepler's laws of planetary motion are three scientific laws describing the motion of planets around the Sun. These laws were formulated by Johannes Kepler in the 17th century based on his analysis of the observations of the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe.

1. The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.
2. A line segment joining a planet and a point on its elliptical orbit traces out a sector of an angle that is equal to twice the angle between the radius vector and the tangent at the point.
3. The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.

These laws apply to satellites in orbit around the Earth as well, with the Earth replacing the Sun.

#### The Two-Body Problem

The two-body problem is a problem in celestial mechanics that deals with the motion of two massive bodies that are abstractly constrained to move only under the influence of their mutual gravitational attraction. The problem was first formulated by Sir Isaac Newton in the 18th century.

The solution to the two-body problem led to the development of the concept of orbital elements, which are a set of six parameters that define the shape, size, and orientation of an orbit. These elements are used to describe the orbit of a satellite in space.

#### Orbital Elements

Orbital elements are a set of six parameters that define the shape, size, and orientation of an orbit. These elements are used to describe the orbit of a satellite in space. The six orbital elements are:

1. Semi-major axis ($a$) - This is the longest diameter of the ellipse and is half of the longest distance between the satellite and the Earth.
2. Eccentricity ($e$) - This is a measure of how much the orbit deviates from a perfect circle. An eccentricity of 0 represents a perfect circle, while an eccentricity greater than 0 represents an elliptical orbit.
3. Inclination ($i$) - This is the angle between the orbital plane and the Earth's equatorial plane.
4. Longitude of the ascending node ($\Omega$) - This is the angle between the vernal equinox and the ascending node.
5. Argument of periapsis ($\omega$) - This is the angle between the ascending node and the periapsis.
6. True anomaly ($\nu$) - This is the angle between the periapsis and the satellite's current position.

These elements are used to calculate the position and velocity of a satellite at any given time.

#### Atmospheric Drag and Solar Radiation Pressure

Atmospheric drag and solar radiation pressure are two factors that can affect the orbit of a satellite. Atmospheric drag is the force exerted by the Earth's atmosphere on a satellite as it moves through it. This force is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the satellite and the density of the atmosphere.

Solar radiation pressure is the force exerted by the Sun on a satellite due to the Sun's radiation. This force is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the satellite and the intensity of the Sun's radiation.

Both of these factors can cause a satellite's orbit to decay over time, eventually causing the satellite to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the practical applications of orbital mechanics in satellite engineering, including satellite orbit determination, satellite constellations, and satellite communications.

#### 2.1b Orbital Mechanics Calculations

In this section, we will delve into the calculations involved in orbital mechanics. These calculations are essential for predicting the behavior of satellites in orbit and for designing satellite systems.

##### Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion

Kepler's laws of planetary motion can be used to calculate the orbit of a satellite. The first law states that the orbit of a satellite is an ellipse with the Earth at one of the two foci. This can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
$$

where $x$ and $y$ are the coordinates of the satellite, $a$ is the semi-major axis of the orbit, and $b$ is the semi-minor axis.

The second law states that a line segment joining a satellite and a point on its elliptical orbit traces out a sector of an angle that is equal to twice the angle between the radius vector and the tangent at the point. This can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\frac{d\theta}{ds} = \frac{2}{na}
$$

where $d\theta$ is the change in the true anomaly, $ds$ is the change in the distance from the Earth, $n$ is the mean motion of the satellite, and $a$ is the semi-major axis of the orbit.

The third law states that the square of the orbital period of a satellite is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This can be represented mathematically as:

$$
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2a^3}{GM}
$$

where $T$ is the orbital period, $a$ is the semi-major axis of the orbit, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $M$ is the mass of the Earth.

##### The Two-Body Problem

The two-body problem can be solved using the equations of motion derived from Newton's second law of motion. These equations can be used to calculate the position and velocity of a satellite at any given time. The equations of motion are:

$$
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\frac{GMx}{r^3}
$$

$$
\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = -\frac{GMy}{r^3}
$$

where $x$ and $y$ are the coordinates of the satellite, $t$ is time, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the Earth, and $r$ is the distance from the Earth.

##### Orbital Elements

The six orbital elements can be used to calculate the position and velocity of a satellite at any given time. The semi-major axis $a$ and eccentricity $e$ can be used to calculate the orbit's shape and size. The inclination $i$ can be used to calculate the orbit's tilt relative to the Earth's equatorial plane. The longitude of the ascending node $\Omega$ can be used to calculate the orbit's orientation in space. The argument of periapsis $\omega$ can be used to calculate the orientation of the orbit relative to the ascending node. The true anomaly $\nu$ can be used to calculate the satellite's position on the orbit.

These calculations are essential for predicting the behavior of satellites in orbit and for designing satellite systems. In the next section, we will explore the practical applications of these calculations in satellite engineering.

#### 2.1c Orbital Mechanics Applications

In this section, we will explore some of the practical applications of orbital mechanics in satellite engineering. These applications include satellite orbit determination, satellite constellations, and satellite communications.

##### Satellite Orbit Determination

Satellite orbit determination is a critical aspect of satellite engineering. It involves the use of ground-based tracking stations to measure the satellite's position and velocity. These measurements are then used to calculate the satellite's orbit using the equations of motion derived from Newton's second law of motion.

The two-body problem, as described by the equations of motion, is used to calculate the position and velocity of the satellite at any given time. This is done by integrating the equations of motion over time, taking into account the gravitational attraction of the Earth.

The equations of motion are:

$$
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\frac{GMx}{r^3}
$$

$$
\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = -\frac{GMy}{r^3}
$$

where $x$ and $y$ are the coordinates of the satellite, $t$ is time, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the Earth, and $r$ is the distance from the Earth.

##### Satellite Constellations

Satellite constellations are a set of satellites that work together to provide a specific service, such as global positioning or communication. The design of these constellations involves the use of orbital mechanics to ensure that the satellites are in the correct orbits and at the correct times to provide the desired service.

The design of a satellite constellation involves the use of the Kepler's laws of planetary motion. These laws are used to calculate the orbit of each satellite in the constellation. The first law states that the orbit of a satellite is an ellipse with the Earth at one of the two foci. This is used to ensure that the satellites are in the correct orbit.

The second law states that a line segment joining a satellite and a point on its elliptical orbit traces out a sector of an angle that is equal to twice the angle between the radius vector and the tangent at the point. This is used to calculate the time at which the satellite will be at a specific point in its orbit.

The third law states that the square of the orbital period of a satellite is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This is used to calculate the orbital period of each satellite in the constellation.

##### Satellite Communications

Satellite communications involve the use of satellites to transmit and receive signals. The design of these systems involves the use of orbital mechanics to ensure that the satellites are in the correct orbits and at the correct times to provide the desired service.

The design of a satellite communications system involves the use of the Kepler's laws of planetary motion. These laws are used to calculate the orbit of each satellite in the system. The first law states that the orbit of a satellite is an ellipse with the Earth at one of the two foci. This is used to ensure that the satellites are in the correct orbit.

The second law states that a line segment joining a satellite and a point on its elliptical orbit traces out a sector of an angle that is equal to twice the angle between the radius vector and the tangent at the point. This is used to calculate the time at which the satellite will be at a specific point in its orbit.

The third law states that the square of the orbital period of a satellite is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This is used to calculate the orbital period of each satellite in the system.




#### 2.1b Orbital Elements

Orbital elements are a set of six parameters that define the shape, size, and orientation of an orbit. These elements are used to describe the orbit of a satellite in space. The six orbital elements are:

1. Semi-major axis ($a$) - This is the longest diameter of the ellipse and is a measure of the size of the orbit.
2. Eccentricity ($e$) - This is a measure of how elliptical the orbit is. An eccentricity of 0 indicates a perfect circle, while an eccentricity greater than 0 indicates an elliptical orbit.
3. Inclination ($i$) - This is the angle between the orbital plane and the equatorial plane of the Earth.
4. Longitude of the ascending node ($\Omega$) - This is the angle between the vernal equinox and the ascending node.
5. Argument of periapsis ($\omega$) - This is the angle between the ascending node and the periapsis.
6. True anomaly ($f$) - This is the angle between the periapsis and the current position of the satellite.

These elements are used to calculate the position and velocity of a satellite at any given time. The equations used to calculate these values are known as the orbital elements equations.

The orbital elements equations are derived from the two-body problem and are based on the conservation of angular momentum and energy. These equations are used to predict the motion of satellites in orbit and are essential for the design and operation of satellite systems.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of orbital maneuvers and how they are used to change the orbit of a satellite.

#### 2.1c Orbital Maneuvers

Orbital maneuvers are essential for satellite engineering as they allow for the adjustment of a satellite's orbit. These maneuvers are typically performed using rocket engines and are designed to change one or more of the orbital elements.

There are several types of orbital maneuvers, including:

1. Hohmann transfer orbit - This maneuver is used to transfer a satellite from one circular orbit to another. It involves two engine burns, one to raise the satellite's orbit and another to lower it into the desired orbit.
2. Bi-elliptic transfer - This maneuver is used to transfer a satellite from one elliptical orbit to another. It involves four engine burns, two to raise the satellite's orbit and two to lower it into the desired orbit.
3. Raising the orbit - This maneuver is used to increase the semi-major axis of a satellite's orbit. It involves an engine burn in the direction of the satellite's motion.
4. Lowering the orbit - This maneuver is used to decrease the semi-major axis of a satellite's orbit. It involves an engine burn in the opposite direction of the satellite's motion.
5. Changing the inclination - This maneuver is used to change the inclination of a satellite's orbit. It involves an engine burn in the direction perpendicular to the satellite's orbit.
6. Changing the longitude of the ascending node - This maneuver is used to change the longitude of the ascending node of a satellite's orbit. It involves an engine burn in the direction of the satellite's motion.
7. Changing the argument of periapsis - This maneuver is used to change the argument of periapsis of a satellite's orbit. It involves an engine burn in the direction perpendicular to the satellite's orbit.
8. Changing the true anomaly - This maneuver is used to change the true anomaly of a satellite's orbit. It involves an engine burn in the direction of the satellite's motion.

These maneuvers are used to adjust the orbit of a satellite to meet specific requirements, such as changing the satellite's altitude, inclination, or longitude. They are also used to perform orbital inclination changes, which are essential for satellite constellations.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of orbital inclination changes and how they are used in satellite engineering.

#### 2.1d Orbital Resonances

Orbital resonances are a phenomenon that occurs when the orbits of two or more satellites are synchronized in such a way that they pass each other at regular intervals. This can have significant implications for satellite engineering, particularly in the design of satellite constellations.

The concept of orbital resonances is closely related to the concept of orbital inclination changes. As mentioned in the previous section, orbital inclination changes are essential for satellite constellations, as they allow for the efficient use of satellite resources. Orbital resonances can further enhance this efficiency by ensuring that satellites pass each other at regular intervals, allowing for the transfer of data and resources.

There are several types of orbital resonances, including:

1. 1:1 resonance - This resonance occurs when two satellites have the same orbital period. In this case, the satellites will pass each other every orbit.
2. 2:1 resonance - This resonance occurs when two satellites have twice the orbital period of another satellite. In this case, the satellites will pass each other every other orbit.
3. 3:1 resonance - This resonance occurs when two satellites have three times the orbital period of another satellite. In this case, the satellites will pass each other every third orbit.
4. Higher order resonances - These resonances occur when the orbital periods of the satellites are related in a ratio of 4:1, 5:1, and so on.

Orbital resonances can be achieved through careful design of the satellite orbits. This can involve the use of orbital maneuvers, such as those discussed in the previous section, to adjust the orbits of the satellites.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of orbital inclination changes in more detail, focusing on the methods used to achieve these changes and their implications for satellite engineering.

#### 2.1e Orbital Debris

Orbital debris, also known as space junk, is a significant concern in satellite engineering. These are objects in space that are no longer functional and are not expected to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. They can pose a threat to operational satellites and the International Space Station (ISS).

The issue of orbital debris has become increasingly important as the number of satellites in orbit has increased. According to the European Space Agency, there are currently over 1,000 active satellites in orbit, and over 3,000 defunct satellites and rocket stages. The United States Strategic Command's Joint Task Force for Space Defense tracks over 23,000 pieces of debris larger than 10 cm.

The risk posed by orbital debris is not just limited to collisions. Even small fragments of debris can cause significant damage to operational satellites. For example, a 1 cm fragment traveling at 17,500 mph can impart the same amount of energy as a .22 caliber bullet.

The problem of orbital debris is further complicated by the fact that satellites in orbit can have a lifespan of several decades. This means that even if a satellite is no longer operational, it can remain in orbit for a long time, increasing the risk of collisions with other satellites.

There are several methods for dealing with orbital debris. These include:

1. Active debris removal - This involves using robotic spacecraft to capture and remove debris from orbit.
2. Passive debris removal - This involves designing satellites to deorbit themselves at the end of their operational life.
3. Collision avoidance - This involves using onboard sensors and algorithms to detect and avoid collisions with other satellites.
4. Space traffic management - This involves coordinating the orbits of satellites to minimize the risk of collisions.

In the next section, we will explore these methods in more detail, focusing on the challenges and opportunities they present for satellite engineering.

#### 2.1f Orbital Perturbations

Orbital perturbations are small changes in the orbit of a satellite due to various factors such as atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure, and gravitational effects. These perturbations can accumulate over time and can significantly affect the orbit of a satellite.

Atmospheric drag is a major source of orbital perturbations. Satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) experience significant atmospheric drag due to the dense atmosphere at these altitudes. This drag force is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the satellite and the square of the relative velocity between the satellite and the atmosphere. The drag force can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
F_d = \frac{1}{2} C_d \rho v^2 A
$$

where $F_d$ is the drag force, $C_d$ is the drag coefficient, $\rho$ is the air density, $v$ is the relative velocity, and $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the satellite.

Solar radiation pressure is another significant source of orbital perturbations. The Sun exerts a small force on a satellite due to the pressure of the solar radiation. This force can cause the satellite to accelerate in the direction of the Sun. The solar radiation pressure force can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
F_s = \frac{L}{c} \frac{A}{m}
$$

where $F_s$ is the solar radiation pressure force, $L$ is the luminosity of the Sun, $c$ is the speed of light, $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the satellite, and $m$ is the mass of the satellite.

Gravitational effects, such as the gravitational pull of the Earth and other celestial bodies, can also cause orbital perturbations. These effects can be modeled using the equations of motion, which describe the motion of a satellite in orbit.

Orbital perturbations can be mitigated through various methods. These include:

1. Drag compensation - This involves using onboard propulsion systems to counteract the effects of atmospheric drag.
2. Solar radiation pressure control - This involves using reflective surfaces or solar panels to control the effects of solar radiation pressure.
3. Gravity gradient boost - This involves using the gravitational pull of the Earth to raise the orbit of a satellite.
4. Orbital maneuvers - This involves using onboard propulsion systems to perform orbital maneuvers to correct for orbital perturbations.

In the next section, we will explore these methods in more detail, focusing on the challenges and opportunities they present for satellite engineering.

$$

where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the Earth, $r$ is the distance from the Earth, and $\mathbf{a_p}$ is the perturbation acceleration.

The perturbation acceleration $\mathbf{a_p}$ is due to various factors such as atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure, and gravitational effects.

### Section: 3.1 SMAD, sec. 11.4: Power Generation in Spacecraft

#### 3.1a Power Generation in Spacecraft

The generation of power in spacecraft is a critical aspect of spacecraft power systems. It involves the conversion of various forms of energy into electrical power that can be used to operate the spacecraft's subsystems. The primary sources of power generation in spacecraft are solar panels and batteries.

Solar panels, also known as solar arrays, are the most common source of power generation in spacecraft. They are designed to collect direct sunlight and light reflected off from the Earth, and are more efficient and operate at a lower temperature than single-sided cells commonly used on Earth. The International Space Station (ISS), for instance, uses double-sided solar arrays to generate electrical power.

The Russian segment of the ISS uses 28 V low voltage DC from two rotating solar arrays mounted on "Zvezda". The USOS, on the other hand, uses 130–180 V DC from the USOS PV array. The higher distribution voltage allows smaller, lighter conductors, at the expense of crew safety. The two station segments share power with converters.

The USOS solar arrays are arranged as four wing pairs, for a total production of 75 to 90 kilowatts. These arrays normally track the Sun to maximize power generation. Each array is about 10 meters long and 4 meters wide. In the complete configuration, the solar arrays track the Sun by rotating the "alpha gimbal" once per orbit; the "beta gimbal" follows slower changes in the angle of the Sun to the orbital plane. The Night Glider mode aligns the solar arrays parallel to the ground at night to reduce the significant aerodynamic drag at the station's relatively low orbital altitude.

The ISS originally used rechargeable nickel–hydrogen batteries for continuous power during the 45 minutes of every 90-minute orbit that it is eclipsed by the Earth. The batteries are recharged on the day side of the orbit. They had a 6.5-year lifetime (over 37,000 charge/discharge cycles) and were regularly replaced over the anticipated 20-year life of the station. Starting in 2016, the nickel–hydrogen batteries were replaced by lithium-ion batteries, which are expected to last until the end of the ISS program.

The station's large solar panels generate a high potential voltage difference between the station and the ionosphere, which can cause significant power loss if not properly managed. This is one of the challenges faced in operating spacecraft power systems.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the conversion and distribution of power in spacecraft.

#### 3.1b Power Storage in Spacecraft

Power storage in spacecraft is a critical aspect of spacecraft power systems. It involves the storage of electrical power generated by solar panels or other power sources for use when the spacecraft is in the shadow of the Earth or other celestial body. The primary means of power storage in spacecraft is through the use of batteries.

The International Space Station (ISS), for instance, uses rechargeable nickel–hydrogen batteries (NiH2) for continuous power during the 45 minutes of every 90-minute orbit that it is eclipsed by the Earth. The batteries are recharged on the day side of the orbit. They had a 6.5-year lifetime (over 37,000 charge/discharge cycles) and were regularly replaced over the anticipated 20-year life of the station. Starting in 2016, the nickel–hydrogen batteries were replaced by lithium-ion batteries, which are expected to last until the end of the ISS program.

The use of lithium-ion batteries in spacecraft is a significant advancement in power storage technology. These batteries have a higher energy density than nickel–hydrogen batteries, allowing for more power to be stored in a given volume. They also have a longer lifespan, reducing the need for frequent replacements.

However, the use of lithium-ion batteries in spacecraft also presents some challenges. They are more sensitive to temperature changes and can degrade over time if exposed to extreme temperatures. They also require more complex charging and management systems to ensure their safety and longevity.

In addition to batteries, some spacecraft also use supercapacitors for power storage. Supercapacitors have the advantage of being able to charge and discharge very quickly, making them ideal for short-term power storage needs. However, they have a lower energy density than batteries, limiting their use in spacecraft.

The power storage system in a spacecraft is a critical component of the overall power system. It ensures that the spacecraft has a continuous supply of electrical power, even when it is in the shadow of the Earth or other celestial body. As spacecraft technology continues to advance, it is likely that new and improved power storage technologies will be developed to meet the growing power needs of these complex systems.

It involves the management and distribution of electrical power generated by solar panels or other power sources to the various subsystems of the spacecraft. The primary means of power distribution in spacecraft is through the use of power distribution units (PDUs).

The International Space Station (ISS), for instance, uses PDUs to distribute power to the various subsystems of the station. These PDUs are responsible for converting the high voltage power from the solar arrays to a usable voltage for the various subsystems. They also include voltage regulators to ensure that the power delivered to each subsystem is within the acceptable range.

The PDUs on the ISS are designed to handle a wide range of power levels, from the low voltage power used by the Russian segment of the station to the higher voltage power used by the USOS. This allows for efficient power distribution and management throughout the entire station.

However, the use of PDUs in spacecraft also presents some challenges. They are complex systems that require careful design and testing to ensure their reliability and safety. They also require regular maintenance and monitoring to ensure their continued operation.

In addition to PDUs, some spacecraft also use power buses for power distribution. Power buses are a simpler and more direct means of power distribution, but they are less flexible and can be more prone to power surges and other issues.

The power distribution system in a spacecraft is a critical component of the overall power system. It ensures that the spacecraft has a reliable and efficient means of distributing power to its various subsystems. As spacecraft technology continues to advance, it is likely that new and improved power distribution technologies will be developed to meet the growing power needs of these complex systems.

#### 3.1d Power Management in Spacecraft

Power management in spacecraft is a critical aspect of spacecraft power systems. It involves the control and optimization of power usage throughout the spacecraft. The primary means of power management in spacecraft is through the use of power management units (PMUs).

The International Space Station (ISS), for instance, uses PMUs to manage power usage throughout the station. These PMUs are responsible for monitoring and controlling the power usage of each subsystem, ensuring that the power usage is within the acceptable limits. They also include power management algorithms to optimize power usage and ensure that the power is distributed efficiently throughout the station.

The PMUs on the ISS are designed to handle a wide range of power usage levels, from the low power usage of the Russian segment of the station to the higher power usage of the USOS. This allows for efficient power management and optimization throughout the entire station.

However, the use of PMUs in spacecraft also presents some challenges. They are complex systems that require careful design and testing to ensure their reliability and safety. They also require regular maintenance and monitoring to ensure their continued operation.

In addition to PMUs, some spacecraft also use power management software for power management. Power management software can provide more detailed and flexible power management capabilities, but it also requires more complex hardware and software infrastructure.

The power management system in a spacecraft is a critical component of the overall power system. It ensures that the spacecraft has a reliable and efficient means of managing power usage throughout the spacecraft.

## Chapter 4: Propulsion:




### Section: 4.1 SMAD, ch. 17:

#### 4.1a Basics of Propulsion

Propulsion is a crucial aspect of satellite engineering, as it enables the movement and maintenance of satellites in their desired orbits. In this section, we will explore the basics of propulsion, including the different types of propulsion systems used in satellites and the principles behind them.

There are three main types of propulsion systems used in satellites: chemical rockets, electric propulsion, and ion propulsion. Chemical rockets use a chemical reaction to generate thrust, while electric propulsion and ion propulsion use electric fields to accelerate ions or plasma. Each of these systems has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of propulsion system depends on the specific needs and requirements of the satellite.

The principles behind these propulsion systems are based on Newton's third law of motion, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In the case of propulsion, the action is the expulsion of a fluid or gas, and the reaction is the resulting thrust that propels the satellite.

The thrust generated by a propulsion system is given by Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object times its acceleration. In the case of propulsion, the mass of the fluid or gas being expelled is equal to the mass flow rate, and the acceleration is equal to the change in velocity of the exhaust. This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
F = \dot{m}V_e
$$

where $F$ is the thrust, $\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate, and $V_e$ is the velocity of the exhaust.

The specific impulse (I<sub>sp</sub>) of a propulsion system is another important metric of efficiency. It is defined as the change in velocity of the satellite per unit of mass of propellant expelled. A higher specific impulse indicates a more efficient propulsion system. The theoretical specific impulse for cold gases is given by:

$$
I_{sp} = \frac{C^*}{g_0} \gamma \sqrt{\left ( \frac{2}{\gamma - 1} \right )^2 - 1}
$$

where $C^*$ is the specific heat at constant entropy, $g_0$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $\gamma$ is the specific heat ratio.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the design considerations for propulsion systems in satellites, including factors such as thrust, specific impulse, and fuel efficiency. We will also discuss the trade-offs and challenges involved in choosing the right propulsion system for a particular satellite.

As mentioned earlier, there are three main types: chemical rockets, electric propulsion, and ion propulsion. Each of these systems has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of propulsion system depends on the specific needs and requirements of the satellite.

##### Chemical Rockets

Chemical rockets are the most commonly used type of propulsion system in satellites. They use a chemical reaction to generate thrust, typically by burning a fuel and an oxidizer. The resulting high-temperature and high-pressure gases are expelled through a nozzle at the back of the rocket, generating thrust.

The efficiency of a chemical rocket is determined by its specific impulse (I<sub>sp</sub>), which is the change in velocity of the satellite per unit of mass of propellant expelled. The specific impulse is affected by the type of fuel and oxidizer used, as well as the design of the rocket.

##### Electric Propulsion

Electric propulsion systems use electric fields to accelerate ions or plasma. These systems are typically more efficient than chemical rockets, but they also require more power. Electric propulsion systems are often used for satellite orbit raising and station keeping.

One type of electric propulsion system is the Hall effect thruster, which uses a high voltage electric field to accelerate ions. Another type is the plasma thruster, which uses a plasma discharge to generate thrust.

##### Ion Propulsion

Ion propulsion systems use electric fields to accelerate ions. These systems are even more efficient than electric propulsion systems, but they also require even more power. Ion propulsion systems are often used for satellite orbit raising and station keeping, as well as for deep space missions.

One type of ion propulsion system is the ion engine, which uses a series of electric grids to accelerate ions. Another type is the ion thruster, which uses a single electric grid to accelerate ions.

In the next section, we will explore the specifics of each of these propulsion systems, including their design, operation, and applications.

The space environment is a unique and complex realm that presents a multitude of challenges and opportunities for satellite engineering. In this section, we will explore the various aspects of the space environment, including the vacuum of space, the effects of solar radiation, and the role of the Earth's magnetic field.

#### 5.1a.1 The Vacuum of Space

The vacuum of space is one of the most fundamental aspects of the space environment. It is a state of matter in which there is no significant concentration of matter. In other words, space is empty. This emptiness is not due to a lack of physical space, but rather a lack of physical matter. The vacuum of space is not a "nothingness", but rather a "no-thingness". 

The vacuum of space is a result of the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of an isolated system always increases over time. In the context of space, this means that any matter or energy in space will eventually disperse and become evenly distributed throughout space. This is why the vacuum of space is not truly empty, but rather filled with a very low density of particles and radiation.

The vacuum of space has a profound impact on satellite design and operation. The lack of air and other gases in space means that satellites do not experience air resistance, which can significantly reduce the amount of fuel needed for satellite propulsion. However, the vacuum of space also means that satellites are not protected from the harsh conditions of extreme temperatures and radiation.

#### 5.1a.2 Solar Radiation

Solar radiation is another important aspect of the space environment. The Sun is the primary source of energy in the solar system, and its radiation has a profound impact on the behavior of satellites. Solar radiation is responsible for the day/night cycle on Earth, and it also affects the Earth's magnetic field.

Solar radiation is also a major source of power for satellites. Many satellites use solar panels to convert sunlight into electricity, which is then used to power various systems on the satellite. However, solar radiation can also be a source of interference for satellite communications, as it can cause electromagnetic interference.

#### 5.1a.3 The Earth's Magnetic Field

The Earth's magnetic field is a crucial aspect of the space environment. It is generated by the motion of liquid iron in the outer core of the Earth, and it protects the Earth from harmful solar radiation. The Earth's magnetic field is not uniform, and it varies in strength and direction over time.

The Earth's magnetic field has a significant impact on satellite design and operation. Satellites that operate in low Earth orbit (LEO) are particularly affected by the Earth's magnetic field. The Earth's magnetic field can cause satellites to experience magnetic storms, which can disrupt satellite communications and navigation systems.

In conclusion, the space environment is a complex and dynamic realm that presents a multitude of challenges and opportunities for satellite engineering. The vacuum of space, solar radiation, and the Earth's magnetic field are just some of the aspects of the space environment that engineers must consider when designing and operating satellites. In the next section, we will delve deeper into the effects of the space environment on satellite systems.

#### 5.1b.1 Radiation

As mentioned in the previous section, satellites are exposed to high levels of radiation in space. This radiation can have a detrimental effect on the health of astronauts and the functioning of satellites. 

Radiation can damage the cells in the human body, particularly those involved in maintaining the immune system. This can lead to lowered immunity and increased susceptibility to illness. Radiation can also cause other health issues, such as cataracts and an increased risk of cancer.

For satellites, radiation can cause damage to electronic components, leading to malfunctions and potential system failures. This is a significant concern for long-term missions, where the effects of radiation can accumulate over time.

#### 5.1b.2 Vacuum

The vacuum of space can also have a profound impact on satellites. The lack of air and other gases in space means that satellites are not protected from the harsh conditions of extreme temperatures and radiation. 

Temperatures in space can range from -270°C to +120°C, and satellites must be designed to withstand these extreme temperatures. Additionally, satellites are not protected from solar radiation, which can cause overheating and damage to electronic components.

#### 5.1b.3 Microgravity

Another effect of the space environment is microgravity. In microgravity, objects do not experience the force of gravity, which can have a significant impact on the functioning of satellites. 

In microgravity, objects can float away, making it challenging to maintain the orientation of the satellite. This can lead to difficulties in communication and navigation. Additionally, microgravity can cause fluid shifts in the human body, which can have health implications for astronauts.

#### 5.1b.4 Isolation

Finally, the space environment can be isolating for both astronauts and satellites. Astronauts are often separated from their support team for extended periods, which can lead to feelings of isolation and confinement. For satellites, being in space can mean being isolated from ground control for long periods, making it challenging to make adjustments or respond to unexpected issues.

In conclusion, the space environment presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities for satellite engineering. Understanding these effects is crucial for designing and operating successful satellites.




### Section: 5.1c Protection from Space Environment

The harsh conditions of the space environment necessitate the implementation of various protection measures to ensure the successful operation of satellites. These measures are designed to mitigate the effects of radiation, vacuum, and microgravity on satellites and their occupants.

#### 5.1c.1 Radiation Protection

To protect satellites from the harmful effects of radiation, various shielding materials are used. These materials, such as aluminum and titanium, are dense and can absorb a significant portion of the incoming radiation. Additionally, satellite designers also employ error-correcting codes to detect and correct errors caused by radiation.

The International Space Station (ISS), for instance, is equipped with a radiation monitoring system that continuously tracks the amount of radiation in the station's environment. Astronauts are also provided with personal dosimeters to monitor their individual exposure to radiation.

#### 5.1c.2 Vacuum Protection

To protect satellites from the harsh conditions of the vacuum of space, they are designed to withstand extreme temperatures. This includes the use of thermal control systems to regulate the temperature of the satellite and its components. Additionally, satellites are designed to withstand solar radiation, which can cause overheating and damage to electronic components.

#### 5.1c.3 Microgravity Protection

To mitigate the effects of microgravity, satellites are equipped with various systems to maintain their orientation. These include reaction wheels and thrusters. Reaction wheels are rotating devices that use the conservation of angular momentum to control the orientation of the satellite. Thrusters, on the other hand, use the principle of action and reaction to change the orientation of the satellite.

For astronauts, microgravity can lead to various health issues, including bone loss and muscle atrophy. To mitigate these effects, astronauts are provided with exercise equipment and are encouraged to perform regular exercises. Additionally, researchers are exploring the use of artificial gravity to counteract the effects of microgravity.

In conclusion, the space environment poses significant challenges to satellites and their occupants. However, through the implementation of various protection measures, these challenges can be mitigated, enabling the successful operation of satellites and the exploration of space.

The ADCS system is responsible for determining the satellite's attitude and controlling its orientation in space. This is achieved through a combination of sensors, actuators, and control algorithms. The ADCS system is essential for maintaining the satellite's stability and ensuring that it can perform its intended functions.

The ADCS system is composed of three main components: the attitude determination subsystem, the attitude control subsystem, and the communication subsystem. The attitude determination subsystem is responsible for measuring the satellite's attitude and orientation in space. This is achieved through the use of sensors such as star trackers, sun sensors, and gyroscopes.

The attitude control subsystem is responsible for controlling the satellite's orientation and attitude in space. This is achieved through the use of actuators such as thrusters and reaction wheels. The control algorithms used in this subsystem are complex and require precise calculations to ensure the satellite's stability.

The communication subsystem is responsible for transmitting and receiving data between the satellite and the ground station. This is crucial for maintaining communication and control of the satellite. The communication subsystem also plays a role in the attitude determination process, as it can receive data from the satellite's sensors and transmit it to the ground station for processing.

The ADCS system is a critical component of any satellite, as it is responsible for maintaining the satellite's stability and ensuring that it can perform its intended functions. Without a functioning ADCS system, a satellite would be unable to maintain its orientation and would eventually drift off course.

In addition to maintaining stability, the ADCS system also plays a crucial role in the satellite's overall performance. By accurately determining the satellite's attitude and controlling its orientation, the ADCS system allows for precise pointing and tracking of targets, which is essential for many satellite missions.

Furthermore, the ADCS system is responsible for managing the satellite's power and resources. By controlling the satellite's orientation, the ADCS system can optimize the use of solar panels and other power sources, ensuring that the satellite has enough energy to perform its functions.

In conclusion, the ADCS system is a vital component of any satellite, responsible for maintaining stability, optimizing performance, and managing resources. In the next section, we will discuss the different types of ADCS systems and their applications in satellite engineering.

#### 11.1b Optimization Techniques

In the previous section, we discussed the Gauss-Seidel method, a popular technique for optimizing separated spacecraft interferometer trajectories. In this section, we will explore other optimization techniques that can be used in this context.

One such technique is the Remez algorithm, a numerical algorithm used for finding the best approximation of a function. The Remez algorithm is particularly useful in the context of formation flight, as it can be used to optimize the trajectories of spacecraft in an interferometer.

The Remez algorithm is based on the concept of a Chebyshev polynomial, which is a polynomial of degree $n$ that satisfies the condition $|p_n(x)| \leq 1$ for all $x \in [-1, 1]$. The Remez algorithm uses this polynomial to find the best approximation of a function $f(x)$ in the interval $[a, b]$.

The algorithm starts by defining an initial polynomial $p_0(x) = 0$ and then iteratively updates it until the approximation error is minimized. The update rule for the polynomial is given by:

$$
p_{n+1}(x) = p_n(x) - \frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}p_n(x)

The Remez algorithm is particularly useful in the context of formation flight, as it can be used to optimize the trajectories of spacecraft in an interferometer. By finding the best approximation of the trajectory, the algorithm can minimize the error between the desired and actual trajectory, leading to more efficient and effective formation flight.

Another optimization technique that can be used in the context of formation flight is the Lifelong Planning A* (LPA*) algorithm. This algorithm is algorithmically similar to the A* algorithm and shares many of its properties. LPA* is particularly useful in the context of formation flight, as it can handle complex and dynamic environments.

The LPA* algorithm uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost of a path and then uses this information to guide the search for the optimal path. The algorithm also uses a priority queue to store the nodes that need to be explored, ensuring that the most promising paths are explored first.

In conclusion, the optimization of separated spacecraft interferometer trajectories is a complex task that requires the use of advanced mathematical techniques.

#### 11.1c Case Studies

In this section, we will explore some case studies that demonstrate the application of optimization techniques in formation flight. These case studies will provide a practical understanding of how these techniques can be used to optimize the trajectories of spacecraft in an interferometer.

#### 11.1c.1 Optimization of a Spacecraft Interferometer Trajectory using the Gauss-Seidel Method

The Gauss-Seidel method is a popular technique for optimizing separated spacecraft interferometer trajectories. In this case study, we will use this method to optimize the trajectory of a spacecraft interferometer in the absence of a gravity-well.

The initial conditions for the spacecraft are given by:

$$
\mathbf{r}_1(0) = (0, 0, 0)^T, \quad \mathbf{v}_1(0) = (1, 0, 0)^T, \quad \mathbf{r}_2(0) = (0, 1, 0)^T, \quad \mathbf{v}_2(0) = (0, 1, 0)^T
$$

The trajectories of the spacecraft are given by the equations:

$$
\mathbf{r}_1(t) = \mathbf{v}_1(0)t + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{a}_1(0)t^2, \quad \mathbf{r}_2(t) = \mathbf{v}_2(0)t + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{a}_2(0)t^2
$$

where $\mathbf{a}_1(0) = \mathbf{a}_2(0) = \mathbf{0}$.

The objective is to minimize the error between the desired and actual trajectory. The Gauss-Seidel method is used to update the initial conditions until the error is minimized.

#### 11.1c.2 Optimization of a Spacecraft Interferometer Trajectory using the Remez Algorithm

The Remez algorithm is another technique that can be used to optimize the trajectories of spacecraft in an interferometer. In this case study, we will use this method to optimize the trajectory of a spacecraft interferometer in the absence of a gravity-well.

The initial conditions for the spacecraft are given by:

$$
\mathbf{r}_1(0) = (0, 0, 0)^T, \quad \mathbf{v}_1(0) = (1, 0, 0)^T, \quad \mathbf{r}_2(0) = (0, 1, 0)^T, \quad \mathbf{v}_2(0) = (0, 1, 0)^T
$$

The trajectories of the spacecraft are given by the equations:

$$
\mathbf{r}_1(t) = \mathbf{v}_1(0)t + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{a}_1(0)t^2, \quad \mathbf{r}_2(t) = \mathbf{v}_2(0)t + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{a}_2(0)t^2
$$

where $\mathbf{a}_1(0) = \mathbf{a}_2(0) = \mathbf{0}$.

The objective is to minimize the error between the desired and actual trajectory. The Remez algorithm is used to find the best approximation of the trajectory, which is then used to update the initial conditions until the error is minimized.

#### 11.1c.3 Optimization of a Spacecraft Interferometer Trajectory using the Lifelong Planning A* (LPA*) Algorithm

The LPA* algorithm is a variant of the A* algorithm that can be used to optimize the trajectories of spacecraft in an interferometer. In this case study, we will use this method to optimize the trajectory of a spacecraft interferometer in the absence of a gravity-well.

The initial conditions for the spacecraft are given by:

$$
\mathbf{r}_1(0) = (0, 0, 0)^T, \quad \mathbf{v}_1(0) = (1, 0, 0)^T, \quad \mathbf{r}_2(0) = (0, 1, 0)^T, \quad \mathbf{v}_2(0) = (0, 1, 0)^T
$$

The trajectories of the spacecraft are given by the equations:

$$
\mathbf{r}_1(t) = \mathbf{v}_1(0)t + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{a}_1(0)t^2, \quad \mathbf{r}_2(t) = \mathbf{v}_2(0)t + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{a}_2(0)t^2
$$

where $\mathbf{a}_1(0) = \mathbf{a}_2(0) = \mathbf{0}$.

The objective is to minimize the error between the desired and actual trajectory. The LPA* algorithm is used to find the optimal path for the spacecraft, which is then used to update the initial conditions until the error is minimized.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of minimum energy trajectories and their role in satellite engineering.




### Section: 12.1 (PDF):

#### 12.1a Techsat 21 Overview

Techsat 21 is a satellite system that consists of multiple satellites orbiting the Earth. These satellites are designed to perform various tasks, such as remote sensing, communication, and navigation. The satellites in this system are often required to work together in a coordinated manner, and formation flight plays a crucial role in achieving this.

The satellites in Techsat 21 are designed to operate in a specific orbit, known as the Techsat 21 orbit. This orbit is carefully chosen to provide the optimal conditions for the satellites to perform their tasks. The orbit is also designed to minimize the effects of solar radiation and other external factors that could affect the satellites' performance.

The satellites in Techsat 21 are also designed to operate in a specific formation. This formation is determined by the minimum energy trajectories that the satellites are required to follow. These trajectories are carefully calculated to ensure that the satellites move along the path that requires the least amount of energy. This is particularly important for satellite systems that need to conserve energy, such as Techsat 21.

#### 12.1b Minimum Energy Trajectories

In the previous section, we discussed the basics of Techsat 21 and its importance in satellite engineering. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of minimum energy trajectories and how they are used in Techsat 21.

Minimum energy trajectories are a crucial aspect of satellite engineering, as they allow for the efficient movement of satellites in orbit. These trajectories are calculated using the principles of orbital mechanics, specifically the conservation of energy. The goal is to find the path that requires the least amount of energy for the satellites to travel along.

The concept of minimum energy trajectories is closely related to the concept of formation flight. In formation flight, multiple satellites work together to achieve a common goal, such as remote sensing or communication. These satellites must move along a specific path, and the minimum energy trajectories play a crucial role in determining this path.

To understand the importance of minimum energy trajectories, we must first understand the concept of potential energy. In orbital mechanics, potential energy is defined as the energy an object possesses due to its position in a gravitational field. In the case of satellites, this potential energy is provided by the Earth's gravitational field.

The potential energy of a satellite in orbit can be calculated using the equation:

$$
U = -\frac{GMm}{2a}
$$

where $U$ is the potential energy, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the Earth, $m$ is the mass of the satellite, and $a$ is the semi-major axis of the satellite's orbit.

The minimum energy trajectory is the path that minimizes the change in potential energy over time. This means that the satellites must move along a path that requires the least amount of energy to maintain their orbit. This is crucial for satellite systems like Techsat 21, where energy conservation is essential.

However, finding the minimum energy trajectory is not always straightforward. There are various factors that must be considered, such as the initial conditions of the satellites, the gravitational pull of the Earth, and any external forces acting on the satellites. These factors can make the equations involved in calculating the minimum energy trajectory complex and difficult to solve.

To overcome these challenges, engineers use numerical methods and computer simulations to calculate the minimum energy trajectories. These methods allow for more accurate and efficient calculations, taking into account all the necessary factors.

In conclusion, minimum energy trajectories play a crucial role in satellite engineering, particularly in systems like Techsat 21. They allow for the efficient movement of satellites in orbit, conserving energy and enabling the successful completion of various tasks. However, finding these trajectories can be complex and requires the use of advanced mathematical techniques and computer simulations. 





#### 12.1c Techsat 21 Operations

Techsat 21 is a complex satellite system that requires careful planning and execution for its operations. In this section, we will discuss the various aspects of Techsat 21 operations, including the role of minimum energy trajectories and the use of the Gauss-Seidel method.

The operations of Techsat 21 are crucial for its success and the achievement of its objectives. These operations involve the launch of the satellites, their placement in orbit, and their subsequent movement along minimum energy trajectories. The operations also include the communication and coordination between the satellites, as well as the collection and transmission of data.

One of the key aspects of Techsat 21 operations is the use of minimum energy trajectories. As mentioned in the previous section, these trajectories are calculated using the principles of orbital mechanics and are essential for the efficient movement of satellites in orbit. The use of minimum energy trajectories allows for the conservation of energy, which is crucial for the long-term sustainability of the satellite system.

Another important aspect of Techsat 21 operations is the use of the Gauss-Seidel method. This method is used to solve a system of linear equations, which is necessary for the calculation of minimum energy trajectories. The Gauss-Seidel method is an iterative technique that allows for the efficient computation of solutions to these equations.

The operations of Techsat 21 also involve the use of various software tools and techniques. These include the use of the MOOSE (Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment) software, which is used for the development of finite element codes. MOOSE is a powerful tool that allows for the decomposition of weak form residual equations into separate terms, making it easier to implement and modify new physics.

In addition to MOOSE, the operations of Techsat 21 also involve the use of the SUNDIALS (SUN Differential/Algebraic Equation Library) software. SUNDIALS is a collection of codes for the numerical solution of differential and algebraic equations, which is necessary for the simulation and analysis of Techsat 21 operations.

Overall, the operations of Techsat 21 are complex and involve a combination of theoretical concepts, numerical techniques, and software tools. The use of minimum energy trajectories and the Gauss-Seidel method are crucial for the efficient and sustainable operation of the satellite system.

## Chapter 1:3: Satellite Orbit Determination:




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the complex and fascinating world of satellite engineering, specifically focusing on the design and implementation of a Visible Geosynchronous Earth Imager (VGEI). This satellite, designed to capture high-resolution images of the Earth's surface, presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities for engineers.

The VGEI is designed to operate in a geosynchronous orbit, a highly elliptical orbit that allows the satellite to remain over the same point on the Earth's surface at all times. This presents a unique set of challenges for trajectory design, as we will explore in this chapter.

We will begin by discussing the basic principles of satellite trajectory design, including the use of orbital elements and the two-body problem. We will then move on to discuss the specific challenges and considerations for designing a trajectory for a VGEI. This will include a discussion of the trade-offs between orbit altitude, inclination, and other parameters, as well as the impact of these decisions on the satellite's imaging capabilities.

Throughout this chapter, we will use mathematical expressions and equations to describe the principles and calculations involved in trajectory design. These will be formatted using the popular Markdown format and the MathJax library, as shown in the example below:

$$
\Delta v = \sqrt{\frac{G(M+m)}{a}}
$$

Where $\Delta v$ is the change in velocity, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the Earth, $m$ is the mass of the satellite, and $a$ is the semi-major axis of the satellite's orbit.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a comprehensive understanding of the principles and considerations involved in designing a trajectory for a VGEI, as well as the mathematical tools and techniques used in this process.




#### 13.1a Geosynchronous Earth Imager

The Geosynchronous Earth Imager (GEI) is a satellite designed to capture high-resolution images of the Earth's surface from a geosynchronous orbit. This orbit, which is highly elliptical, allows the satellite to remain over the same point on the Earth's surface at all times. This is a crucial feature for the GEI, as it allows for continuous imaging of the Earth's surface.

The GEI is a complex satellite system that requires careful design and implementation. In this section, we will delve into the specifics of the GEI, including its design considerations, trajectory design, and imaging capabilities.

#### 13.1a.1 Design Considerations

The design of the GEI presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities. One of the primary considerations is the trade-off between orbit altitude and inclination. A higher orbit altitude allows for a larger coverage area, but it also requires a higher launch velocity and more fuel. On the other hand, a lower orbit altitude reduces the launch velocity and fuel requirements, but it also reduces the coverage area.

Another important consideration is the satellite's imaging capabilities. The GEI is equipped with a Visible Geosynchronous Earth Imager (VGEI), which uses 128 spectral bands from approximately 353 nm to 1080 nm wavelengths at 5.7 nm spectral resolution. This allows for high-resolution imaging of the Earth's surface, but it also requires careful design of the satellite's optical system.

#### 13.1a.2 Trajectory Design

The trajectory design for the GEI is a complex task that requires careful consideration of the satellite's design parameters and imaging capabilities. The GEI operates in a highly elliptical orbit, which presents unique challenges for trajectory design. The satellite must maintain a specific altitude and inclination to remain over the same point on the Earth's surface at all times.

The trajectory design for the GEI involves the use of orbital elements, which are parameters that define the shape and orientation of the satellite's orbit. These elements include the semi-major axis, eccentricity, and inclination. The trajectory design process involves adjusting these elements to achieve the desired orbit.

#### 13.1a.3 Imaging Capabilities

The GEI's imaging capabilities are a crucial aspect of its design. The VGEI uses 128 spectral bands from approximately 353 nm to 1080 nm wavelengths at 5.7 nm spectral resolution. This allows for high-resolution imaging of the Earth's surface, but it also presents challenges for data storage and processing.

The GEI collects satellite imagery from September 25, 2009, to September 13, 2014. A maximum of eight daylight scenes were collected per day, resulting in a patchy temporal resolution. However, the GEI's imaging capabilities allow for high-resolution imaging of the Earth's surface, making it a valuable tool for studying the Earth's surface.

#### 13.1a.4 Data Products

The GEI's data products are large in size and require careful processing and storage. The satellite collects data from September 25, 2009, to September 13, 2014, resulting in a large dataset. The data products are available in various formats, including HDF4 and HDF5, and they can be accessed through the GEI's data archive.

In conclusion, the GEI is a complex satellite system that requires careful design and implementation. Its design considerations, trajectory design, and imaging capabilities make it a valuable tool for studying the Earth's surface. The GEI's data products are large and require careful processing and storage, but they provide valuable insights into the Earth's surface. 





#### 13.1b Trajectory Design

The trajectory design for the GEI is a crucial aspect of its overall design and operation. It involves the use of orbital elements, which are parameters that define the shape and orientation of the satellite's orbit. These elements are used to calculate the satellite's position and velocity at any given time, and to determine its trajectory.

The trajectory design for the GEI is a complex task due to the satellite's highly elliptical orbit. The satellite must maintain a specific altitude and inclination to remain over the same point on the Earth's surface at all times. This requires careful consideration of the satellite's design parameters and imaging capabilities.

One approach to trajectory design for the GEI is through the use of Multiple Coordinate Ascent Evolutionary Algorithm (MCACEA). This approach involves dividing the problem of trajectory design into smaller subproblems, which are solved simultaneously by different Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). The solutions of these subproblems are then shared and combined to find the optimal trajectory for the GEI.

MCACEA has been successfully applied to the problem of trajectory design for multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) flying simultaneously in the same scenario. This approach can be extended to the problem of trajectory design for the GEI, where the satellite's trajectory is optimized while considering the trajectories of other satellites in the same orbit.

Another approach to trajectory design for the GEI is through the use of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). This approach involves using a mathematical model of the satellite's dynamics and measurements to estimate its position and velocity. The EKF then uses this information to calculate the satellite's trajectory and make adjustments to maintain its desired orbit.

The EKF has been successfully applied to the problem of trajectory design for satellites in low Earth orbit. However, its application to the GEI's highly elliptical orbit presents unique challenges. The EKF must be able to accurately estimate the satellite's position and velocity in the presence of noise and disturbances, and it must be able to handle the large changes in the satellite's velocity and acceleration as it moves from perigee to apogee.

In conclusion, the trajectory design for the GEI is a complex task that requires careful consideration of the satellite's design parameters and imaging capabilities. The use of advanced techniques such as MCACEA and the Extended Kalman Filter can help to optimize the satellite's trajectory and ensure its successful operation in a highly elliptical orbit.





#### 13.1c Imager Operations

The operation of the visible geosynchronous Earth imager (VGEI) is a critical aspect of the satellite's overall design and operation. It involves the use of various imaging techniques and algorithms to capture and process images of the Earth's surface.

The VGEI is equipped with a high-resolution camera that captures images of the Earth's surface in visible light. These images are then processed using advanced image processing techniques to extract useful information about the Earth's surface.

One of the key challenges in operating the VGEI is dealing with the satellite's highly elliptical orbit. The satellite must maintain a specific altitude and inclination to remain over the same point on the Earth's surface at all times. This requires careful consideration of the satellite's design parameters and imaging capabilities.

To address this challenge, the VGEI uses a combination of orbit determination and control techniques. These techniques involve using ground-based tracking stations to determine the satellite's orbit and making small adjustments to its trajectory to maintain its desired orbit.

Another important aspect of VGEI operations is the management of the satellite's onboard resources. The VGEI has limited onboard resources, including power, storage, and processing capabilities. Therefore, it is crucial to manage these resources efficiently to ensure the satellite's long-term operation.

The VGEI also uses a variety of imaging techniques and algorithms to capture and process images of the Earth's surface. These include multispectral imaging, which captures images in multiple spectral bands, and image fusion, which combines images from different sources to create a more complete image.

The VGEI also uses advanced image processing techniques to extract useful information from the captured images. These techniques include object detection and recognition, which identify and classify objects in the images, and change detection, which detects changes in the Earth's surface over time.

In conclusion, the operation of the VGEI is a complex task that requires careful consideration of the satellite's design parameters, onboard resources, and imaging capabilities. It also involves the use of advanced imaging techniques and algorithms to capture and process images of the Earth's surface.

### Section: 14.1 Introduction to Structures:

Satellites and other spacecraft are complex systems that require a variety of structures to function effectively. These structures are designed to withstand the harsh conditions of space, including extreme temperatures, radiation, and vacuum. In this section, we will provide an overview of the different types of structures used in space systems.

#### 14.1a Basics of Space Structures

Space structures can be broadly classified into two categories: primary structures and secondary structures. Primary structures are those that are essential for the functioning of the satellite, such as the main body, solar panels, and antennas. Secondary structures, on the other hand, are non-essential but provide additional functionality or support to the primary structures.

The main body of a satellite is the central structure that houses all the necessary components, such as the power system, communication system, and payload. It is typically made of lightweight materials, such as aluminum alloys or carbon fiber composites, to reduce weight and increase fuel efficiency. The main body also needs to be strong enough to withstand the forces exerted on it during launch and in orbit.

Solar panels are another crucial component of space structures. They are responsible for generating electricity to power the satellite's systems. The design of solar panels is complex, as they need to be lightweight, efficient, and able to withstand the extreme conditions of space. The materials used for solar panels can vary, but they are typically made of silicon wafers or gallium arsenide.

Antennas are also essential for communication in space systems. They are used to transmit and receive signals, allowing for communication between satellites and ground stations.

### P1, S1 trusses

The P1 and S1 trusses (also called the "Port and Starboard Side Thermal Radiator Trusses") are attached to the S0 truss and contain carts to transport the Canadarm2 and astronauts to worksites along with the space station. They each flow 290 kg (637 lb) of anhydrous ammonia through three heat rejection radiators. The S1 truss was launched on STS-112 in October 2002 and the P1 truss was launched on STS-113 in November 2002. Detailed design, test, and construction of the S1 and P1 structures were conducted by McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) in Huntington Beach, CA. First parts were cut for the structure in 1996, and delivery of the first truss occurred in 1999.

### P2, S2 trusses

The P2 and S2 trusses were planned as locations for rocket thrusters in the original design for Space Station Freedom. Since the Russian parts of the ISS also provided that capability, the reboost capability of the Space Station Freedom design was no longer needed at that location. So P2 and S2 were canceled.

### P3/P4, S3/S4 truss assemblies

The P3/P4 truss assembly was installed by the Space Shuttle " Atlantis" STS-115 mission, launched September 9, 2006, and attached to the P1 segment. The P3 and P4 segments together contain a pair of solar arrays, a radiator, and a rotary joint that will aim the solar arrays, and connects P3 to P4. Upon its installation, no power was flowing across the rotary joint, so the electricity generated by the P4 solar array wings was only being used on the P4 segment and not the rest of the station. Then in December 2006, a major electrical rewiring of the station by STS-116 routed this power to the entire grid. The S3/S4 truss assembly—a mirror-image of P3/P4—was installed on June 11, 2007 also by Space Shuttle "Atlantis" during flight STS-117, mission 13A and mounted to the S1 truss segment. It is the heaviest station-bound module at 14,000 kg (30,865 lb).

### Section: 14.1 Introduction to Structures:

Satellites and other spacecraft are complex systems that require a variety of structures to function effectively. These structures are designed to withstand the harsh conditions of space, including extreme temperatures, radiation, and vacuum. In this section, we will provide an overview of the different types of structures used in space systems.

#### 14.1a Basics of Space Structures

Space structures can be broadly classified into two categories: primary structures and secondary structures. Primary structures are those that are essential for the functioning of the satellite, such as the main body, solar panels, and antennas. Secondary structures, on the other hand, are non-essential but provide additional functionality or support to the primary structures.

The main body of a satellite is the central structure that houses all the necessary components, such as the power system, communication system, and payload. It is typically made of lightweight materials, such as aluminum alloys or carbon fiber composites, to reduce weight and increase fuel efficiency. The main body also needs to be strong enough to withstand the forces exerted on it during launch and in orbit.

Solar panels are another crucial component of space structures. They are responsible for generating electricity to power the satellite's systems. The design of solar panels is complex, as they need to be lightweight, efficient, and able to withstand the extreme conditions of space. The materials used for solar panels can vary, but they are typically made of silicon wafers or gallium arsenide.

Antennas are also essential for communication in space systems. They are used to transmit and receive signals, allowing for communication between satellites and ground stations. The design of antennas is critical, as they need to be efficient, lightweight, and able to withstand the harsh conditions of space. The materials used for antennas can vary, but they are typically made of aluminum or titanium alloys.

### Subsection: 14.1b Design of Space Structures

The design of space structures is a complex and multidisciplinary process. It involves considering various factors such as weight, strength, and thermal management. The design process also takes into account the specific requirements of the satellite, such as its intended mission and operating environment.

One of the key considerations in the design of space structures is weight. Satellites need to be as lightweight as possible to reduce fuel consumption and increase fuel efficiency. This is especially important for communication satellites, which need to remain in orbit for extended periods of time. The weight of a satellite is also directly related to its cost, as launching a heavier satellite requires more fuel and therefore is more expensive.

Strength is another crucial factor in the design of space structures. Satellites need to be able to withstand the forces exerted on them during launch and in orbit. This includes forces from acceleration, gravity, and atmospheric drag. The strength of a satellite is determined by its structural integrity, which is the ability of the structure to withstand these forces without failing.

Thermal management is also a critical aspect of space structure design. Satellites are exposed to extreme temperatures in space, ranging from -150°C to +150°C. This requires careful consideration of the materials used in the structure, as well as the design of thermal management systems. These systems are used to regulate the temperature of the satellite and protect its components from damage.

In addition to these factors, the design of space structures also takes into account the specific requirements of the satellite's intended mission. For example, communication satellites may require additional components for signal transmission and reception, while scientific satellites may require specialized equipment for data collection.

Overall, the design of space structures is a complex and collaborative process that involves engineers from various disciplines. It requires careful consideration of weight, strength, and thermal management, as well as the specific requirements of the satellite's intended mission. With the continued advancements in technology and materials, the design of space structures will continue to evolve and improve, allowing for more efficient and effective satellite systems.

The basic profit model used in cost modeling is sales minus costs. Sales are made up of quantity sold multiplied by their price, while costs are usually divided between fixed costs and variable costs. The profit can then be calculated from this equation:

$$
\pi = \text{sales} - \text{costs}
$$

However, in the case of satellite engineering, there are additional factors that need to be considered when estimating costs. These include the cost of goods sold, which is the cost of the satellite and its components, and the cost of goods made, which is the cost of designing and manufacturing the satellite.

To accurately estimate costs, it is important to consider all aspects of the project, including the cost of goods sold and made. This can be achieved by including the opening and closing finished goods stocks in the cost of goods sold equation. The cost of goods made can then be calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold from the total cost of goods.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the different types of costs associated with space systems and the factors that influence these costs. We will also discuss the methods and tools used for cost estimation in satellite engineering.

So, let us embark on this exciting journey to understand the concept of spacecraft autonomy and its significance in the field of satellite engineering. 





#### 18.1a Basics of Spacecraft Autonomy

Spacecraft autonomy is a crucial aspect of satellite engineering, allowing for the efficient and effective functioning of satellites in space. In this section, we will explore the basics of spacecraft autonomy, including the different levels of autonomy, the challenges faced in implementing autonomy, and the technologies and techniques used to achieve it.

#### Levels of Autonomy

There are three main levels of autonomy that a satellite can achieve: teleoperation, supervisory control, and full autonomy. Teleoperation is the lowest level, where the satellite is controlled by a human operator on the ground. Supervisory control is the next level, where the satellite has some level of decision-making capabilities, but still requires human oversight. Full autonomy is the highest level, where the satellite is completely independent and can make decisions and carry out tasks without human intervention.

#### Challenges in Implementing Autonomy

Implementing autonomy in spacecraft is a complex and challenging task. One of the main challenges is the vast distances and limited communication capabilities in space. This makes it difficult for satellites to receive instructions and feedback from human operators on the ground. Additionally, the harsh environment of space, with extreme temperatures and radiation, poses a challenge for the functioning of autonomous systems.

#### Technologies and Techniques for Achieving Autonomy

To overcome the challenges in implementing autonomy, various technologies and techniques have been developed. These include artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and robotics. AI and ML algorithms are used to enable satellites to make decisions and carry out tasks without human intervention. Robotics is also used to develop autonomous systems that can perform complex tasks in space.

#### Ethical Considerations and Future Prospects

As with any technology, there are ethical considerations surrounding the use of autonomy in spacecraft. One of the main concerns is the potential for accidents or malfunctions in autonomous systems, which could have serious consequences in space. However, with proper testing and regulations, these risks can be mitigated. The future prospects for spacecraft autonomy are promising, with advancements in AI and robotics paving the way for more complex and capable autonomous systems.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the role of artificial intelligence and machine learning in spacecraft autonomy, and how these fields are revolutionizing the way satellites operate.





#### 18.1b Autonomy Systems for Spacecraft

Autonomy systems for spacecraft are crucial for the efficient and effective functioning of satellites in space. These systems allow satellites to make decisions and carry out tasks without human intervention, making them essential for long-term space missions. In this section, we will explore the different types of autonomy systems used in spacecraft, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics.

#### Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that deals with creating systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. In the context of spacecraft autonomy, AI is used to develop systems that can make decisions and carry out tasks without human intervention. This is achieved through the use of algorithms that can analyze data and make decisions based on that data.

One example of AI being used in spacecraft autonomy is NASA's autonomous science experiment (ASE) on Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) satellite. The ASE software is capable of on-board science analysis, re-planning, robust execution, and model-based diagnostic. This allows the satellite to analyze images and data on-board and only downlink them when a change or interesting event occurs, reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted.

#### Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI that deals with developing systems that can learn from data and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. In the context of spacecraft autonomy, ML is used to develop systems that can learn from data and make decisions based on that data. This is achieved through the use of algorithms that can analyze data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

One example of ML being used in spacecraft autonomy is NASA's Artificial Intelligence Flight Adviser. This project aims to develop a system that can aid pilots by giving them real-time expert advice in situations that pilot training does not cover or just aid with a pilot's train of thought during flight. This is achieved through the use of IBM Watson cognitive computing system, which pulls data from a large database of relevant information to give advice to pilots.

#### Robotics

Robotics is another important aspect of spacecraft autonomy. It involves the development of systems that can perform physical tasks without human intervention. In the context of spacecraft autonomy, robotics is used to develop systems that can perform complex tasks such as docking with other spacecraft or performing repairs.

One example of robotics being used in spacecraft autonomy is NASA's Robonaut 2 (R2). R2 is a humanoid robot that is capable of performing a variety of tasks, including manipulating tools and objects, moving around a spacecraft, and even assisting astronauts. R2 is currently being used on the International Space Station (ISS) to perform tasks that are too dangerous or difficult for astronauts to carry out.

#### Conclusion

Autonomy systems for spacecraft are crucial for the efficient and effective functioning of satellites in space. These systems, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics, allow satellites to make decisions and carry out tasks without human intervention. As space exploration continues to advance, the development and implementation of these systems will become increasingly important for the success of future missions.





#### 18.1c Case Studies in Spacecraft Autonomy

In this section, we will explore some real-world case studies that demonstrate the use of autonomy systems in spacecraft. These case studies will provide a deeper understanding of the challenges and benefits of implementing autonomy in spacecraft.

#### Case Study 1: NASA's Autonomous Science Experiment (ASE)

As mentioned in the previous section, NASA's ASE on the Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) satellite is a prime example of the use of autonomy in spacecraft. The ASE software is capable of on-board science analysis, re-planning, robust execution, and model-based diagnostic. This allows the satellite to analyze images and data on-board and only downlink them when a change or interesting event occurs, reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted. This not only saves bandwidth but also allows for more efficient use of the satellite's resources.

#### Case Study 2: NASA's Artificial Intelligence Flight Adviser

NASA's Artificial Intelligence Flight Adviser is another example of the use of autonomy in spacecraft. This project aims to develop a system that can aid pilots by giving them real-time expert advice in situations that pilot training does not cover or just aid with a pilot's train of thought during flight. This is achieved through the use of IBM Watson cognitive computing system, which pulls data from a large database of relevant information like aircraft manuals, accident reports, and close-call reports to give advice to pilots. This project highlights the potential of autonomy in improving safety and efficiency in spacecraft operations.

#### Case Study 3: European Space Agency's (ESA) Autonomous Navigation System

The European Space Agency (ESA) has also been actively working on developing autonomy systems for spacecraft. Their autonomous navigation system is designed to allow spacecraft to navigate and make decisions without human intervention. This system is particularly useful for long-term space missions where human intervention may not be feasible. The ESA's autonomous navigation system is currently being tested on the Mars Express mission and has shown promising results.

#### Conclusion

These case studies demonstrate the diverse applications of autonomy in spacecraft. From on-board science analysis to aiding pilots, autonomy has proven to be a valuable tool in space exploration. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more innovative uses of autonomy in spacecraft, paving the way for future space missions.
