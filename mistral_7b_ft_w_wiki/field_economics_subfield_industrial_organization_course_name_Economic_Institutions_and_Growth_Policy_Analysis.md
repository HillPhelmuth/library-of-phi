# Title: Economic Institutions and Growth Policy Analysis:

## Foreward

Welcome to "Economic Institutions and Growth Policy Analysis", a comprehensive guide to understanding the complex relationship between economic institutions and growth. As the title suggests, this book aims to delve into the intricacies of economic institutions and their role in shaping a country's economic growth.

The book is structured around the concept of institutional sclerosis, a term coined by American economist and social scientist Mancur Olson. Olson's theory posits that as a society ages, its institutions become increasingly resistant to change, leading to a decline in economic growth. This theory serves as the foundation for our exploration of economic institutions and growth policy analysis.

We will delve into the various factors that contribute to institutional sclerosis, including the role of interest groups, the bureaucracy, and the political system. We will also examine how these factors can hinder economic growth and what can be done to mitigate their effects.

The book will also explore the concept of entrepreneurship and its role in economic growth. As policymakers and scholars often emphasize, entrepreneurship is a key driver of economic growth. However, empirically examining and quantifying its impact is challenging due to endogeneity. We will discuss various methods and approaches to address this challenge and gain a deeper understanding of entrepreneurship's impact on growth.

Finally, we will explore the introduction of new products and services and their role in economic growth. New products create demand, which is necessary to offset the decline in employment that occurs through labor-saving technology. We will examine how the U.S. has seen a significant shift in consumer spending towards new products and services, and the implications of this shift for economic growth.

This book is intended for advanced undergraduate students at MIT, but it is also a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding the complex relationship between economic institutions and growth. I hope this book will serve as a useful guide for your exploration of this fascinating topic.

Thank you for joining me on this journey into the world of economic institutions and growth policy analysis. Let's dive in.

### Subsection 1.1a Definition of Economic Institutions

Economic institutions are the rules, norms, and organizations that govern economic activity within a society. They provide the framework for economic activity and determine how resources are allocated, prices are set, and transactions are conducted. These institutions can range from formal laws and regulations to informal norms and customs. They can also include organizations such as banks, corporations, and labor unions.

Economic institutions play a crucial role in creating a stable and predictable environment for economic activity. They help to ensure fair and efficient allocation of resources, which is essential for long-term economic growth. In this book, we will delve into the various types of economic institutions and their impact on economic development.

### Subsection 1.1b Types of Economic Institutions

There are various types of economic institutions that exist within a society. These include formal institutions, such as laws and regulations, and informal institutions, such as customs and norms. Formal institutions are created and enforced by the government, while informal institutions are often passed down through generations and are not legally binding.

Formal institutions include laws and regulations that govern economic activity, such as antitrust laws, labor laws, and environmental regulations. These institutions are created and enforced by the government to ensure fair and efficient allocation of resources. They also help to create a level playing field for all economic actors.

Informal institutions, on the other hand, are often passed down through generations and are not legally binding. These include customs, norms, and social expectations that govern economic behavior. For example, the concept of "face" in Chinese culture, where saving face is highly valued, can impact economic decision-making.

### Subsection 1.1c Role of Economic Institutions in Economic Development

Economic institutions play a crucial role in economic development. They provide the framework for economic activity and determine how resources are allocated, prices are set, and transactions are conducted. By creating a stable and predictable environment, economic institutions help to attract investment and promote economic growth.

Moreover, economic institutions also play a crucial role in promoting fair and efficient allocation of resources. By enforcing laws and regulations, they ensure that economic actors are held accountable and that resources are allocated in a fair manner. This is essential for long-term economic growth and development.

In this book, we will explore the various types of economic institutions and their impact on economic development. We will also discuss the role of growth policies in shaping economic institutions. By understanding the complex relationship between economic institutions and growth policies, we can gain valuable insights into the economic landscape of a country and its potential for future development.





### Subsection 1.1b Importance of Growth Policy Analysis

Growth policy analysis is a crucial aspect of economic analysis. It involves the study of policies and institutions that can promote economic growth. This analysis is essential for understanding the factors that contribute to economic growth and for designing policies that can enhance it.

One of the key reasons why growth policy analysis is important is that it helps us understand the role of economic institutions in promoting economic growth. As discussed in the previous section, economic institutions play a crucial role in creating a stable and predictable environment for economic activity. They help to ensure fair and efficient allocation of resources, which is essential for long-term economic growth.

Growth policy analysis also helps us understand the impact of different policies on economic growth. For example, policies related to trade, investment, and innovation can have a significant impact on economic growth. By analyzing these policies, we can gain insights into how they can be designed and implemented to promote economic growth.

Moreover, growth policy analysis can also help us identify potential barriers to economic growth. These can include institutional barriers, such as corruption or lack of property rights, as well as policy barriers, such as trade restrictions or inefficient regulations. By identifying these barriers, we can develop strategies to address them and promote economic growth.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the various aspects of growth policy analysis, including the role of economic institutions, the impact of different policies, and the identification of potential barriers to economic growth. We will also explore the concept of endogenous growth theory, which provides a framework for understanding the long-term drivers of economic growth.

### Related Context

# New institutionalism

### Definition of institution

There is no agreed upon definition of institution in new institutionalist scholarship. Mats Alvesson and Andre Spicer wrote in 2018 that it had become "difficult to agree what an institution is not – because institutions have become everything... When the term institution is defined, it is done so in broad and vague ways."
 # New institutionalism

New institutionalism (also referred to as neo-institutionalist theory or institutionalism) is an approach to the study of institutions that focuses on the constraining and enabling effects of formal and informal rules on the behavior of individuals and groups. New institutionalism traditionally encompasses three major strands: sociological institutionalism, rational choice institutionalism, and historical institutionalism. New institutionalism originated in work by sociologist John Meyer published in 1977.

## History

The study of institutions and their interactions has been a focus of academic research for many years. In the late 19th and early 20th century, social theorists began to systematize this body of literature. One of the most prominent examples of this was the work of German economist and social theorist Max Weber; Weber focused on the organizational structure (i.e. bureaucracy) within society, and the institutionalization created by means of the iron cage which organizational bureaucracies create. In Britain and the United States, the study of political institutions dominated political science until the 1950s. This approach, sometimes called 'old' institutionalism, focused on analyzing the formal institutions of government and the state in comparative perspective. It was followed by a behavioral revolution which brought new perspectives to analyzing politics, such as positivism, rational choice theory, and behavioralism, and the narrow focus on institutions was discarded as the focus moved to analyzing individuals rather than the institutions which surround them.

## Chapter 1: Introduction:




### Subsection: 1.2b Key Concepts in New Institutionalism

The new institutionalism in organizational analysis has introduced several key concepts that have greatly contributed to our understanding of institutions and their role in shaping economic growth. These concepts include institutional logics, dominant logics, and logic shifts.

#### Institutional Logics

Institutional logics, as defined by Ocasio (1997), are the underlying assumptions, beliefs, and practices that guide the behavior of individuals and organizations within a particular institution. These logics can be thought of as the "rules of the game" that govern how things are done within an institution. They can be explicit or implicit, and they can be shared or contested.

#### Dominant Logics

Dominant logics are the institutional logics that hold the most influence within an institution. They are often the logics that are most widely accepted and followed, and they can shape the behavior of individuals and organizations within the institution. For example, in a corporation, the dominant logic might be profit maximization, which would guide the behavior of employees and decision-makers within the corporation.

#### Logic Shifts

Logic shifts occur when an institution transitions from one dominant logic to another. These shifts can be driven by a variety of factors, including changes in the environment, changes in leadership, or changes in the values and beliefs of the institution. For example, in the healthcare industry, the shift from a logic of cost containment to a logic of patient-centered care has led to changes in the behavior of healthcare providers and the structure of healthcare organizations.

These key concepts have been empirically tested and have been shown to have important implications for organizational behavior and economic growth. For example, Haveman and Rao (1997) showed how the rise of Progressive thought enabled a shift in savings and loan organizational forms in the U.S. in the early 20th century. Similarly, Thornton and Ocasio (1999) analyzed how a change from professional to market logics in U.S. higher education publishing led to corollary changes in how executive succession was carried out.

In recent years, there has been a growing focus on multiple and competing logics within institutions, and the contestation of meaning. This approach, inspired by the work of Bourdieu, provides a more pluralistic perspective on institutions and their role in economic growth. By focusing on how some fields are composed of multiple logics, and thus, multiple forms of institutionally-based rationality, institutional analysts can provide new insights into the complex dynamics of economic institutions and growth.




### Subsection: 1.2c Application of New Institutionalism in Organizational Analysis

The new institutionalism has been widely applied in organizational analysis, particularly in the study of economic institutions and growth policy analysis. This approach has been used to understand the behavior of individuals and organizations within institutions, and how these behaviors contribute to economic growth.

#### Institutional Logics and Economic Institutions

Institutional logics have been applied to the study of economic institutions, such as corporations, markets, and governments. For example, in the study of corporations, institutional logics have been used to understand the behavior of employees and decision-makers within the corporation. By examining the dominant logics within the corporation, researchers can gain insights into the behavior of employees and decision-makers, and how these behaviors contribute to the overall performance of the corporation.

Similarly, in the study of markets, institutional logics have been used to understand the behavior of buyers and sellers within the market. By examining the dominant logics within the market, researchers can gain insights into the behavior of buyers and sellers, and how these behaviors contribute to the overall functioning of the market.

#### Dominant Logics and Economic Institutions

Dominant logics have been applied to the study of economic institutions, such as corporations, markets, and governments. For example, in the study of corporations, dominant logics have been used to understand the behavior of employees and decision-makers within the corporation. By examining the dominant logics within the corporation, researchers can gain insights into the behavior of employees and decision-makers, and how these behaviors contribute to the overall performance of the corporation.

Similarly, in the study of markets, dominant logics have been used to understand the behavior of buyers and sellers within the market. By examining the dominant logics within the market, researchers can gain insights into the behavior of buyers and sellers, and how these behaviors contribute to the overall functioning of the market.

#### Logic Shifts and Economic Institutions

Logic shifts have been applied to the study of economic institutions, such as corporations, markets, and governments. For example, in the study of corporations, logic shifts have been used to understand how corporations transition from one dominant logic to another. By examining the logic shifts within the corporation, researchers can gain insights into the factors that drive these shifts, and how these shifts contribute to the overall performance of the corporation.

Similarly, in the study of markets, logic shifts have been used to understand how markets transition from one dominant logic to another. By examining the logic shifts within the market, researchers can gain insights into the factors that drive these shifts, and how these shifts contribute to the overall functioning of the market.

In conclusion, the new institutionalism has been widely applied in organizational analysis, particularly in the study of economic institutions and growth policy analysis. By examining the institutional logics, dominant logics, and logic shifts within economic institutions, researchers can gain insights into the behavior of individuals and organizations within these institutions, and how these behaviors contribute to economic growth.
