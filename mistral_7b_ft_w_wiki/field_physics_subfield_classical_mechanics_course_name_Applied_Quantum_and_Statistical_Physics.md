### Subsection 1.1a: Introduction to Probability Amplitudes

In classical mechanics, the behavior of a system can be predicted with certainty. However, in quantum mechanics, the behavior of a system is described by a wave function, which contains all the information about the system. The wave function is a complex-valued function, and its absolute square gives the probability density of finding the system in a particular state.

The concept of probability amplitudes is central to quantum mechanics. These are complex numbers that represent the probability of a system being in a particular state. The probability amplitude is denoted by the symbol $\psi$, and it is a solution to the Schrödinger equation.

The probability amplitude is a complex number, and its absolute square gives the probability density of finding the system in a particular state. This is given by the equation:

$$
|\psi|^2 = \psi^*\psi
$$

where $\psi^*$ is the complex conjugate of the probability amplitude.

The probability amplitude is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, and it is used to calculate the probability of a system being in a particular state. This is done by taking the absolute square of the probability amplitude, as shown in the equation above.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of probability amplitudes in more detail and discuss how they are used in quantum mechanics. We will also discuss the concept of wave-particle duality and how it relates to probability amplitudes.

### Section: 1.2 Fourier Transforms / MATLAB®

In this section, we will explore the concept of Fourier transforms and their applications in quantum and statistical physics. Fourier transforms are mathematical operations that decompose a function into its constituent frequencies. They are widely used in signal processing, image processing, and quantum mechanics.

#### 1.2a Introduction to Fourier Transforms

The Fourier transform is a mathematical operation that transforms a function of time into a function of frequency. It is defined as:

$$
F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)e^{-i\omega t} dt
$$

where $f(t)$ is the function of time, $F(\omega)$ is the Fourier transform of $f(t)$, and $\omega$ is the frequency. The inverse Fourier transform is given by:

$$
f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(\omega)e^{i\omega t} d\omega
$$

The Fourier transform has many important properties that make it a powerful tool in quantum and statistical physics. Some of these properties include linearity, additivity, and unitarity. These properties allow us to manipulate functions in the frequency domain, which can be useful in solving certain problems in quantum mechanics.

In addition to its mathematical properties, the Fourier transform also has physical interpretations. In quantum mechanics, the Fourier transform is used to represent the wave function of a particle in terms of its momentum. This is known as the momentum space representation. The Fourier transform also plays a crucial role in the study of quantum systems with periodic boundary conditions, such as the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom.

#### 1.2b Fourier Transforms in Quantum Mechanics

In quantum mechanics, the Fourier transform is used to represent the wave function of a particle in terms of its momentum. This is known as the momentum space representation. The wave function in momentum space is given by:

$$
\psi(p) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\hbar}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\psi(x)e^{-ipx/\hbar} dx
$$

where $\psi(p)$ is the wave function in momentum space, $\psi(x)$ is the wave function in position space, and $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant. The Fourier transform allows us to easily switch between the position and momentum representations of a wave function.

#### 1.2c Fourier Transforms in Quantum Systems with Periodic Boundary Conditions

In quantum systems with periodic boundary conditions, such as the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom, the Fourier transform plays a crucial role. These systems have a finite number of energy levels, and the Fourier transform allows us to express the wave function in terms of these energy levels. This simplifies the calculations and allows us to solve these systems analytically.

#### 1.2d MATLAB® Implementation of Fourier Transforms

MATLAB® is a popular software tool for numerical computation and data analysis. It has built-in functions for performing Fourier transforms, making it a useful tool for studying quantum and statistical systems. The MATLAB® function `fft` performs a discrete Fourier transform, while the function `fftshift` shifts the frequencies to the range [-π, π]. These functions are particularly useful for analyzing discrete signals, such as those found in quantum systems.

In conclusion, Fourier transforms are a powerful tool in quantum and statistical physics. They allow us to manipulate functions in the frequency domain, represent wave functions in terms of momentum, and solve quantum systems with periodic boundary conditions. MATLAB® provides convenient functions for performing Fourier transforms, making it a valuable tool for studying quantum and statistical systems. 





#### 1.2b Application of Fourier Transforms in MATLAB®

In this subsection, we will explore the application of Fourier transforms in MATLAB®, a popular software tool for numerical computation and data analysis. MATLAB® provides built-in functions for performing Fourier transforms, making it a powerful tool for analyzing signals and systems in quantum and statistical physics.

##### Fourier Transforms in MATLAB®

The Fourier transform in MATLAB® is implemented using the function `fft`. This function computes the discrete Fourier transform of a vector or matrix. The inverse Fourier transform is computed using the function `ifft`. These functions are based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, which allows for efficient computation of Fourier transforms for large signals.

##### Least-Squares Spectral Analysis (LSSA) in MATLAB®

The LSSA method can be implemented in MATLAB® using a few lines of code. The following is a simplified implementation of the LSSA method:

```
% Define the data vector x
x = [x1, x2, ..., xn];

% Define the frequencies at which we want to compute the spectrum
frequencies = [f1, f2, ..., fn];

% Compute the least-squares spectrum
spectrum = zeros(1, length(frequencies));
for i = 1:length(frequencies)
    % Compute the sine and cosine functions at the data times
    sin_function = sin(2*pi*frequencies(i)*(0:length(x)-1));
    cos_function = cos(2*pi*frequencies(i)*(0:length(x)-1));

    % Take the dot product of the data vector with the sinusoid vectors
    dot_product_sin = sum(x.*sin_function);
    dot_product_cos = sum(x.*cos_function);

    % Normalize the dot products
    norm_sin = sqrt(dot_product_sin^2 + dot_product_cos^2);
    norm_cos = sqrt(dot_product_cos^2 + dot_product_sin^2);

    % Compute the power at each frequency
    power = (norm_sin^2 + norm_cos^2)/(2*length(x));

    % Store the power at each frequency
    spectrum(i) = power;
end
```

This implementation treats each sinusoidal component independently, even though they may not be orthogonal to data points. Alternatively, a full simultaneous or in-context least-squares fit can be performed by solving a matrix equation and partitioning the total data variance between the specified sinusoid frequencies. This method, however, cannot fit more components (sines and cosines) than there are data samples.

##### Lomb's Periodogram Method in MATLAB®

Lomb's periodogram method can also be implemented in MATLAB®. This method allows for an arbitrarily high number of frequency components, as in a standard periodogram. The following is a simplified implementation of Lomb's periodogram method:

```
% Define the data vector x
x = [x1, x2, ..., xn];

% Define the frequencies at which we want to compute the spectrum
frequencies = [f1, f2, ..., fn];

% Compute the periodogram spectrum
spectrum = zeros(1, length(frequencies));
for i = 1:length(frequencies)
    % Compute the sine and cosine functions at the data times
    sin_function = sin(2*pi*frequencies(i)*(0:length(x)-1));
    cos_function = cos(2*pi*frequencies(i)*(0:length(x)-1));

    % Take the dot product of the data vector with the sinusoid vectors
    dot_product_sin = sum(x.*sin_function);
    dot_product_cos = sum(x.*cos_function);

    % Normalize the dot products
    norm_sin = sqrt(dot_product_sin^2 + dot_product_cos^2);
    norm_cos = sqrt(dot_product_cos^2 + dot_product_sin^2);

    % Compute the power at each frequency
    power = (norm_sin^2 + norm_cos^2)/(2*length(x));

    % Store the power at each frequency
    spectrum(i) = power;
end
```

This implementation treats each sinusoidal component independently, even though they may not be orthogonal to data points. The frequency domain can be over-sampled by an arbitrary factor, allowing for a higher density of frequency components.

In conclusion, MATLAB® provides powerful tools for implementing various Fourier transform methods, making it a valuable tool for analyzing signals and systems in quantum and statistical physics.




#### 1.2c Fourier Transforms in Quantum Mechanics

In quantum mechanics, the Fourier transform plays a crucial role in the analysis of quantum states and operators. The Fourier transform in quantum mechanics is defined as:

$$
\hat{F} = \int dx \hat{F}(x)e^{-i2\pi\xi x}
$$

where $\hat{F}$ is a quantum operator, $\hat{F}(x)$ is the position space representation of the operator, and $\xi$ is the Fourier transform variable.

The Fourier transform in quantum mechanics has several important properties that make it a powerful tool in quantum analysis. These properties include linearity, additivity, and the ability to transform operators.

##### Linearity

The Fourier transform is a linear operator, meaning that it satisfies the following properties:

1. Linearity in the transform variable: If $\hat{F}_1$ and $\hat{F}_2$ are Fourier transforms of operators $\hat{F}_1(x)$ and $\hat{F}_2(x)$, then the Fourier transform of the sum of these operators is given by:

$$
\hat{F}_1 + \hat{F}_2 = \int dx (\hat{F}_1(x) + \hat{F}_2(x))e^{-i2\pi\xi x}
$$

2. Linearity in the operator variable: If $\hat{F}_1$ and $\hat{F}_2$ are Fourier transforms of operators $\hat{F}_1(x)$ and $\hat{F}_2(x)$, then the Fourier transform of the product of these operators is given by:

$$
\hat{F}_1\hat{F}_2 = \int dx \hat{F}_1(x)\hat{F}_2(x)e^{-i2\pi\xi x}
$$

##### Additivity

The Fourier transform is an additive operator, meaning that the Fourier transform of a sum of operators is equal to the sum of the Fourier transforms of the individual operators:

$$
\hat{F}_1 + \hat{F}_2 = \hat{F}_1 + \hat{F}_2
$$

##### Transformation of Operators

The Fourier transform can transform operators from the position space to the momentum space and vice versa. This property is particularly useful in quantum mechanics, where operators often need to be transformed between these two spaces.

In the next section, we will explore the application of Fourier transforms in quantum mechanics, focusing on the Wigner D-matrix and its properties.
