I hope this book will serve as a valuable resource for you as you explore the exciting world of personal narrative in visual arts. Let's embark on this journey together.




### Introduction

In the realm of visual arts, the concept of narrative has been a fundamental aspect since its inception. The ability to tell a story through images has been a powerful tool for artists, allowing them to convey complex ideas and emotions in a visually compelling way. However, the roots of narrative in visual arts can be traced back to two distinct approaches: the Lumiere brothers' realistic and naturalistic style, and Georges Melies' fantastical and imaginative approach.

The Lumiere brothers, Auguste and Louis, were pioneers in the field of cinema. Their early films, such as "Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat" and "Workers Leaving the Lumiere Factory", were characterized by their realistic and naturalistic style. They sought to capture everyday life in a way that was authentic and unstaged, often using long takes and minimal camera movement. This approach to narrative was grounded in the belief that the power of cinema lay in its ability to document and represent reality.

On the other hand, Georges Melies, a contemporary of the Lumiere brothers, took a more fantastical and imaginative approach to narrative. His films, such as "A Trip to the Moon" and "The Impossible Voyage", were characterized by their use of special effects and elaborate sets. Melies' work was heavily influenced by his background in theater and magic, and his films often featured elaborate and fantastical narratives that were far removed from reality.

These two approaches to narrative, the realistic and naturalistic style of the Lumiere brothers and the fantastical and imaginative approach of Georges Melies, have had a profound impact on the development of visual arts. They have set the stage for the diverse and complex narratives that are explored in the visual arts today.

In this chapter, we will delve deeper into these two approaches, exploring their origins, their impact, and their legacy in the visual arts. We will also examine how these two approaches have influenced and shaped the development of narrative in visual arts, and how they continue to inform contemporary practices.




#### 1.1a Introduction to Lumiere Films

The Lumiere brothers, Auguste and Louis, were pioneers in the field of cinema. Their early films, such as "Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat" and "Workers Leaving the Lumiere Factory", were characterized by their realistic and naturalistic style. This approach to narrative was grounded in the belief that the power of cinema lay in its ability to document and represent reality.

The Lumiere brothers endeavored to correct the flaws they perceived in the kinetograph and the kinetoscope, to develop a machine with both sharper images and better illumination. The weighed only 10 pounds, which allowed for ease of transportation and placement. As well, the was manually operated by a hand-crank, as opposed to Edison's electrically powered camera, which was not readily portable. Furthermore, while only one person at a time could use Edison's kinetoscope for viewing through an eyepiece-- an early model of a viewfinder. The could project an image onto a screen so a large audience of people could view images simultaneously.

The produced a sharper projected image than had been seen before due to its design, in which a kind of fork held frames behind the lens in place using the perforations in the sides of the film strip.

In 1897, the Lumières further added to their invention by using a glass flask of water as the condenser to concentrate the light onto the film frame and to absorb heat. The flask also acted as a safety feature, as the light would no longer focus on the flammable film if the glass were to break due to overheating or accident.

The Lumiere brothers' approach to narrative was grounded in the belief that the power of cinema lay in its ability to document and represent reality. This approach was a stark contrast to the fantastical and imaginative approach of Georges Melies, who sought to use cinema as a medium for expressing his own personal narrative. This contrast between the two approaches will be explored in more detail in the following sections.

#### 1.1b Techniques Used in Lumiere Films

The Lumiere brothers' approach to filmmaking was characterized by a commitment to realism and a focus on capturing everyday life. This was achieved through a combination of technical innovations and a careful selection of subjects.

One of the key techniques used in Lumiere films was the use of a hand-cranked camera. This allowed for a more natural and fluid movement of the camera, as opposed to the electrically powered camera used by Thomas Edison. This technique was particularly effective in capturing the movement and rhythm of everyday life, as seen in the film "Workers Leaving the Lumiere Factory".

Another important technique was the use of a projector. This allowed for a larger audience to view the films simultaneously, as opposed to the kinetoscope which could only be used by one person at a time. This technique was crucial in the popularization of cinema, as it allowed for a more communal and immersive experience.

The Lumiere brothers also pioneered the use of a glass flask of water as a condenser. This helped to concentrate the light onto the film frame and absorb heat, preventing the film from overheating and potentially catching fire. This was a significant safety feature, particularly in the early days of cinema when fire hazards were a major concern.

In terms of subject matter, the Lumiere brothers were known for their focus on everyday life. This included scenes of workers leaving a factory, a train arriving at a station, and a baby's first steps. These scenes were chosen for their simplicity and everyday nature, reflecting the Lumiere brothers' commitment to capturing reality.

In conclusion, the Lumiere brothers' approach to filmmaking was characterized by a combination of technical innovations and a focus on everyday life. These techniques and subject matter helped to establish the Lumiere brothers as pioneers in the field of cinema, paving the way for future filmmakers to explore and experiment with narrative in visual arts.

#### 1.1c Impact of Lumiere Films

The Lumiere brothers' contributions to the world of cinema have been profound and long-lasting. Their innovative techniques and focus on everyday life have had a significant impact on the development of visual arts, particularly in the realm of narrative.

The Lumiere brothers' use of a hand-cranked camera allowed for a more natural and fluid movement of the camera, which has been emulated by many filmmakers since. This technique has been particularly influential in the development of the "cinéma vérité" or "direct cinema" movement, which seeks to capture reality in a direct and unmediated way.

The Lumiere brothers' use of a projector also had a significant impact on the popularization of cinema. By allowing for a larger audience to view the films simultaneously, they created a more communal and immersive experience. This has been a key factor in the widespread appeal and popularity of cinema.

The Lumiere brothers' focus on everyday life has also been influential in the development of narrative in visual arts. By choosing simple and everyday subjects for their films, they established a precedent for other filmmakers to explore and capture the mundane aspects of life. This has led to the development of a wide range of narrative styles and approaches, from the minimalist and observational to the more fantastical and imaginative.

Finally, the Lumiere brothers' use of a glass flask of water as a condenser has had a lasting impact on the safety standards in the film industry. This simple but effective safety feature has been adopted by many filmmakers and has helped to prevent numerous fires and accidents.

In conclusion, the Lumiere brothers' contributions to the world of cinema have been profound and long-lasting. Their innovative techniques and focus on everyday life have had a significant impact on the development of visual arts, particularly in the realm of narrative. Their legacy continues to inspire and influence filmmakers to this day.




#### 1.1b Lumiere Films Analysis

The Lumiere brothers' films, while groundbreaking in their realistic and naturalistic style, were not without their flaws. One of the main criticisms of their early films was the lack of a clear narrative structure. This was a direct result of their belief that the power of cinema lay in its ability to document and represent reality, rather than in the creation of a narrative.

In "Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat", for example, the film's narrative is essentially a series of events that occur in real-time. The film begins with a long shot of a train approaching a station, and ends with the train pulling into the station. There is no clear protagonist or antagonist, and the film's conflict (if one can even call it that) is merely the train's journey from one location to another.

This lack of narrative structure was a significant departure from the traditional forms of storytelling that were prevalent at the time. In literature and theater, for instance, a clear narrative structure was essential for engaging the audience and creating a sense of drama. The Lumiere brothers' approach, however, was to simply capture reality on film, without any attempt to shape it into a narrative.

Despite this criticism, the Lumiere brothers' films were groundbreaking in their use of the moving image. Their films were the first to be projected onto a screen, allowing for a large audience to view the images simultaneously. This innovation, along with their use of a sharper projected image and their portable camera, laid the foundation for the development of modern cinema.

In the next section, we will explore the contrasting approach to narrative in the films of Georges Melies, who sought to use cinema as a medium for expressing his own personal narrative.

This innovation not only made cinema a more accessible form of entertainment but also paved the way for the development of the movie theater as a communal space for storytelling.

In terms of narrative structure, the Lumiere brothers' films were groundbreaking in their lack of a clear narrative. This approach, while criticized at the time, laid the groundwork for the development of abstract and experimental cinema. It also allowed for the exploration of the power of cinema as a medium for documenting and representing reality, rather than as a tool for creating a narrative.

The impact of the Lumiere brothers' films can also be seen in their influence on other filmmakers. For example, the American filmmaker Edwin S. Porter, who is often credited with creating the first narrative film, "The Great Train Robbery", was heavily influenced by the Lumiere brothers' work. Porter's film, like "Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat", features a train as its central element and uses a series of edited shots to tell a story.

In conclusion, the Lumiere brothers' films had a profound impact on the development of cinema. Their pioneering work not only revolutionized the technical aspects of filmmaking but also laid the foundation for the narrative structure and storytelling techniques that are still used in cinema today.




#### 1.2a Introduction to Melies Films

Georges Melies, a French filmmaker, is often referred to as the father of cinema. His innovative and imaginative films, particularly his early works, have had a profound impact on the development of cinema as an art form. In this section, we will explore the life and work of Melies, focusing on his early films and their significance in the history of cinema.

Melies was born in 1861 in Paris, France. He began his career as a scene painter for the Paris Opera and later became a magician and stage director. His interest in magic and illusion led him to experiment with the newly invented motion picture camera, which he used to create a series of short films that blurred the lines between reality and illusion.

One of Melies's earliest films, "The House of the Devil" (1896), is a prime example of his use of trick photography and special effects. The film tells the story of a man who enters a haunted house and encounters a series of supernatural events. The film's use of stop-motion animation and other visual tricks was groundbreaking and set the stage for his later, more elaborate films.

Melies's most famous film, "A Trip to the Moon" (1902), is a silent, black-and-white, 14-minute-long film that tells the story of a group of astronomers who travel to the moon and encounter a series of fantastic creatures and events. The film is notable for its use of elaborate sets, costumes, and special effects, which were created using a combination of trick photography and hand-painted frames.

Melies's films were not only visually stunning but also had a strong narrative structure. Unlike the Lumiere brothers' films, which were largely devoid of a clear narrative, Melies's films told a story and often had a moral or message. This approach to filmmaking was groundbreaking and paved the way for the development of narrative cinema.

In addition to his innovative filmmaking techniques, Melies also played a significant role in the development of the film industry. He opened his own film studio, Star Film Company, in 1899 and produced and distributed his own films. He also invented several filmmaking technologies, including the "Melies camera" and the "Melies projector".

In conclusion, Melies's early films, particularly "The House of the Devil" and "A Trip to the Moon", were instrumental in the development of cinema as an art form. His innovative use of trick photography, special effects, and narrative structure set the stage for the development of narrative cinema and paved the way for the work of later filmmakers. 

In the next section, we will delve deeper into Melies's later films and explore their significance in the history of cinema.

#### 1.2b Techniques in Melies Films

Georges Melies's films are characterized by their innovative use of techniques that blurred the lines between reality and illusion. These techniques were often achieved through the use of trick photography, stop-motion animation, and hand-painted frames. In this section, we will explore some of these techniques in more detail.

##### Trick Photography

Trick photography, a technique used in many of Melies's films, involves manipulating the camera or the subject to create an illusion. In "The House of the Devil", for example, Melies used trick photography to create the illusion of a man being attacked by a werewolf. The werewolf was actually played by Melies himself, and the attack was achieved by using a series of still photographs that were then projected in rapid succession, giving the impression of movement.

##### Stop-Motion Animation

Stop-motion animation is another technique used in Melies's films. It involves taking a series of still photographs of an object or a scene, moving it slightly between each shot, and then projecting the images in rapid succession to create the illusion of movement. In "A Trip to the Moon", Melies used stop-motion animation to create the scene of the astronomers landing on the moon. The moon was actually a miniature model, and the landing was achieved by moving the model slightly between each shot.

##### Hand-Painted Frames

Hand-painted frames, a technique used in many of Melies's early films, involved painting each frame of the film by hand. This allowed Melies to create detailed and colorful scenes that would have been difficult or impossible to achieve with traditional animation techniques. In "A Trip to the Moon", for example, Melies used hand-painted frames to create the scenes of the astronomers traveling through space and encountering various creatures on the moon.

##### Narrative Structure

Unlike the Lumiere brothers' films, which were largely devoid of a clear narrative, Melies's films told a story and often had a moral or message. This approach to filmmaking was groundbreaking and paved the way for the development of narrative cinema. In "A Trip to the Moon", for example, the story of the astronomers' journey to the moon and their encounter with various creatures can be interpreted as a commentary on the human desire for exploration and discovery.

In conclusion, Melies's films were characterized by their innovative use of techniques and their strong narrative structure. These elements set the stage for the development of cinema as an art form and continue to influence filmmakers to this day.
