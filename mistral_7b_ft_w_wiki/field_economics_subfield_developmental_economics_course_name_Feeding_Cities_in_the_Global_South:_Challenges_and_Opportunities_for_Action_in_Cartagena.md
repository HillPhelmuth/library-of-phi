# Title: Feeding Cities in the Global South: Challenges and Opportunities for Action in Cartagena":

## Foreward

As we delve into the complex and multifaceted issue of feeding cities in the Global South, it is crucial to acknowledge the role of urban agriculture in addressing food security. The concept of food security, as defined by the Community Food Security Coalition, is a fundamental aspect of this discussion. It encompasses the idea that all individuals within a community have access to culturally acceptable, nutritionally adequate food through local, non-emergency sources at all times.

However, the reality is often starkly different, particularly in urban areas where the influx of population has increased the demand for fresh and safe food. This has led to a reliance on highly processed fast food or convenience store foods, which are often high in calories and low in nutrients, leading to diet-related illnesses such as diabetes. This has brought about the concept of food justice, which serves as a bridge between scholarship and activism on sustainable agriculture, food insecurity, and environmental justice.

Urban agriculture, as part of the larger discussion of alternative agricultural paradigms, plays a crucial role in addressing food insecurity, inaccessibility of fresh foods, and unjust practices on multiple levels of the food system. It is a concept that has been led by different actors, including food-insecure individuals, farm workers, educators and academics, policymakers, social movements, organizations, and marginalized people globally.

In the context of Cartagena, a city in the Global South, the challenges and opportunities for action in urban agriculture are numerous. The city faces a unique set of challenges, including limited land availability, high population density, and a complex web of social, economic, and political factors that influence food production and distribution. However, these challenges also present opportunities for innovative and sustainable solutions.

As we explore these challenges and opportunities in this book, it is our hope that we can contribute to the ongoing discussions and actions surrounding urban agriculture and food security in the Global South. We invite you to join us on this journey, to learn, to reflect, and to take action.




### Section 1.1:  Introduction:

Welcome to the first chapter of "Feeding Cities in the Global South: Challenges and Opportunities for Action in Cartagena". This book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities faced in the provision of food in cities of the Global South, with a specific focus on Cartagena.

The Global South, also known as the developing world, is home to a significant portion of the world's population. As urbanization continues to rise in these regions, the challenge of feeding the growing urban populations becomes increasingly complex. This is further exacerbated by the unique socio-economic, political, and environmental contexts of these cities.

In this chapter, we will introduce the seminar and the broader context of food provisioning in Global South cities. We will explore the challenges faced in these cities, including issues of food security, access to food, and the impact of urbanization on food systems. We will also discuss the opportunities for action that exist, such as the potential for urban agriculture and the role of technology in improving food provisioning.

This chapter will serve as a foundation for the rest of the book, which will delve deeper into these topics and provide practical solutions for addressing the challenges and harnessing the opportunities in feeding cities of the Global South. We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for policymakers, researchers, and anyone interested in understanding and addressing the complex issues surrounding food provisioning in these cities.




### Section 1.1:  Food Markets and Development Policy:

#### 1.1a Introduction to Food Markets

Food markets play a crucial role in the provision of food in cities, particularly in the Global South. They are the primary means by which food is distributed and consumed, and their functioning is closely tied to the overall health and well-being of urban populations. In this section, we will explore the role of food markets in the context of development policy, focusing on the challenges and opportunities they present for feeding cities in the Global South.

Food markets in the Global South are characterized by a complex interplay of social, economic, and political factors. These markets are often the primary source of food for urban populations, particularly for the poor and marginalized. However, they also face significant challenges, including issues of food safety, quality, and access. These challenges are often exacerbated by the lack of effective development policies and regulations.

One of the key challenges faced by food markets in the Global South is the issue of food safety. As urban populations continue to grow, the demand for food increases, leading to increased pressure on food markets. This pressure can result in the sale of substandard or unsafe food, particularly in informal markets. This not only poses a direct threat to the health of urban populations, but also undermines confidence in the market system.

Another challenge faced by food markets is the issue of food quality. In many cities of the Global South, the quality of food available in markets is often poor, with a high proportion of processed and ultra-processed foods. This is due to a variety of factors, including the influence of global food corporations, the lack of local food production, and the high cost of fresh, nutritious food. As a result, many urban populations are forced to rely on cheap, unhealthy foods, leading to issues of malnutrition and diet-related diseases.

Despite these challenges, food markets in the Global South also present significant opportunities for action. One of the key opportunities is the potential for urban agriculture. By promoting the production and sale of fresh, nutritious food in urban areas, urban agriculture can help to improve food quality and access. This can be particularly beneficial for marginalized populations, who often face the greatest barriers to accessing healthy food.

In addition, the use of technology and innovation can also play a crucial role in improving food markets in the Global South. For example, mobile phone-based platforms can be used to improve food supply chains, reducing waste and increasing efficiency. Similarly, the use of blockchain technology can help to ensure food safety and transparency in food markets.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these challenges and opportunities, exploring the role of development policy in addressing them. We will also examine the role of various stakeholders, including governments, NGOs, and the private sector, in shaping food markets in the Global South. By understanding these complex issues, we can work towards creating more resilient and sustainable food systems in cities of the Global South.

#### 1.1b The Role of Food Markets in Development

Food markets play a pivotal role in the development of cities in the Global South. They are not only a source of food for urban populations, but also a driver of economic growth and a platform for social interaction. In this subsection, we will explore the role of food markets in development, focusing on their impact on urban economies and social dynamics.

Food markets in the Global South are often the primary source of employment for urban populations. They provide employment opportunities at all levels of the food supply chain, from farmers and producers to vendors and retailers. This not only contributes to the local economy, but also helps to alleviate poverty and improve the livelihoods of urban populations.

Moreover, food markets are a key driver of economic growth in cities. They stimulate local economies by creating a demand for goods and services, such as transportation, packaging, and storage. This not only leads to job creation, but also contributes to the overall economic development of the city.

In addition to their economic role, food markets also play a crucial role in social dynamics. They are a platform for social interaction, where people from different backgrounds and socio-economic statuses come together to buy and sell food. This not only promotes social cohesion, but also provides a space for the exchange of knowledge and ideas.

However, the role of food markets in development is not without challenges. As mentioned in the previous section, food markets in the Global South face significant challenges, including issues of food safety and quality. These challenges can hinder the potential of food markets to drive economic growth and improve social dynamics.

To address these challenges, effective development policies and regulations are crucial. These policies should aim to improve food safety and quality, while also promoting the growth and development of food markets. This can be achieved through a combination of measures, including the implementation of food safety standards, the promotion of local food production, and the provision of training and support for food market vendors.

In conclusion, food markets play a crucial role in the development of cities in the Global South. They are not only a source of food and employment, but also a driver of economic growth and a platform for social interaction. However, to fully realize their potential, effective development policies and regulations are needed to address the challenges they face.

#### 1.1c Strategies for Improving Food Markets

Improving food markets in the Global South requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the various challenges they face. This section will outline several strategies that can be employed to improve food markets, with a focus on their potential impact on urban economies and social dynamics.

##### 1.1c.1 Strengthening Food Safety and Quality

One of the most pressing challenges faced by food markets in the Global South is the issue of food safety and quality. This is not only a health concern, but also a barrier to economic growth. To address this challenge, it is crucial to strengthen food safety and quality standards. This can be achieved through a combination of measures, including the implementation of food safety regulations, the provision of training and support for food market vendors, and the promotion of local food production.

##### 1.1c.2 Promoting Local Food Production

Promoting local food production can have a significant impact on food markets in the Global South. By encouraging urban populations to consume locally produced food, the demand for food in local markets can be increased. This not only stimulates economic growth, but also creates job opportunities and contributes to food security. Moreover, promoting local food production can also help to improve food safety and quality, as locally produced food is often fresher and less likely to have traveled long distances.

##### 1.1c.3 Enhancing Social Dynamics

Food markets are not just a source of food and employment, but also a platform for social interaction. Enhancing social dynamics in food markets can contribute to social cohesion and the exchange of knowledge and ideas. This can be achieved through initiatives that promote social interaction, such as community-based food markets and food festivals.

##### 1.1c.4 Utilizing Technology

The use of technology can also play a crucial role in improving food markets in the Global South. For instance, mobile phone-based platforms can be used to improve food supply chains, reduce waste, and increase efficiency. Similarly, the use of technology can help to improve food safety and quality, by enabling the traceability of food products.

In conclusion, improving food markets in the Global South requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges they face. By strengthening food safety and quality, promoting local food production, enhancing social dynamics, and utilizing technology, food markets can be transformed into platforms for economic growth and social interaction.




### Section 1.1b Role of Development Policy in Food Markets

Development policy plays a crucial role in shaping the functioning of food markets in the Global South. It sets the framework for how food is produced, distributed, and consumed, and can have a significant impact on the health and well-being of urban populations. In this section, we will explore the role of development policy in food markets, focusing on the challenges and opportunities it presents for feeding cities in the Global South.

One of the key roles of development policy in food markets is to ensure food safety. This can be achieved through the implementation of regulations and standards that govern the production, processing, and sale of food. For example, the Codex Alimentarius, a set of international food standards developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO), provides a framework for ensuring food safety and quality. By adopting and enforcing these standards, governments can help to improve the safety and quality of food available in markets.

Development policy also plays a crucial role in promoting food security. This involves ensuring that all members of the population, particularly the poor and marginalized, have access to safe and nutritious food. This can be achieved through policies that promote local food production, reduce food prices, and improve the functioning of food markets. For example, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is a tool used by the FAO to assess food insecurity at the national and sub-national level. By using this tool, governments can identify areas of high food insecurity and implement targeted interventions to improve food security.

In addition to these roles, development policy also plays a crucial role in promoting sustainable food systems. This involves addressing the environmental, social, and economic dimensions of food production and consumption. For example, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include a specific goal (Goal 2) to end hunger, achieve food security, and promote sustainable agriculture. By aligning development policy with this goal, governments can help to create more sustainable and resilient food systems.

However, despite these efforts, there are still significant challenges in the implementation of development policy in food markets. These include issues of capacity, corruption, and the influence of global food corporations. These challenges can undermine the effectiveness of development policy and hinder efforts to improve food markets in the Global South.

In conclusion, development policy plays a crucial role in shaping the functioning of food markets in the Global South. By promoting food safety, food security, and sustainable food systems, it can help to improve the health and well-being of urban populations. However, there are still significant challenges that need to be addressed in order to fully realize these opportunities. 





### Subsection 1.1c Case Studies of Development Policies

In this subsection, we will explore some case studies of development policies in the Global South, focusing on their impact on food markets and food security. These case studies will provide real-world examples of the challenges and opportunities that arise in implementing development policies, and how they can be addressed.

#### Case Study 1: The Impact of Trade Policies on Food Markets in Sub-Saharan Africa

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to some of the world's poorest and most food-insecure populations. The region has been heavily reliant on food imports, with a large portion of these imports coming from the European Union (EU). However, the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has been criticized for its negative impact on food security in Sub-Saharan Africa.

The CAP has been accused of creating a surplus of agricultural products, leading to low prices and reduced incentives for farmers to produce. This has resulted in a decline in domestic food production in Sub-Saharan Africa, making the region more dependent on food imports. This dependence has been further exacerbated by the EU's policy of providing subsidies to its own farmers, making it difficult for African farmers to compete.

In response to these concerns, the EU has implemented a policy of "everything but arms" (EBA), which grants duty-free and quota-free access to the EU market for all products from least-developed countries (LDCs). This policy has been welcomed by many African countries, as it provides an opportunity to increase their exports and reduce their dependence on food imports. However, there are concerns that this policy may not be enough to address the structural issues that have led to the region's food insecurity.

#### Case Study 2: The Role of Domestic Resource Mobilization in Financing the MDGs in Ghana

Ghana has been a leader in implementing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), with a focus on domestic resource mobilization (DRM) to finance its efforts. DRM involves mobilizing domestic resources, such as taxes and domestic borrowing, to finance development initiatives. This approach has been praised for its sustainability and potential to reduce aid dependence.

However, there have been concerns about the impact of DRM on food security in Ghana. The government's focus on mobilizing domestic resources has led to a decrease in aid funding for the agriculture sector, which is crucial for food production. This has resulted in a decline in agricultural investment and productivity, contributing to food insecurity in the country.

In response to these concerns, the government has implemented policies to promote domestic food production, such as the Planting for Food and Jobs program. This program provides farmers with inputs and training to increase their productivity and reduce their dependence on food imports. However, there are concerns about the effectiveness of this program, as it has been criticized for its lack of coordination and limited impact on food security.

#### Conclusion

These case studies highlight the complex and often conflicting nature of development policies in the Global South. While policies such as the EBA and DRM have been praised for their potential to address food insecurity, there are concerns about their effectiveness and potential negative impacts on food markets. It is crucial for policymakers to carefully consider the potential consequences of their policies and work towards finding a balance that promotes both food security and sustainable development.





### Subsection 1.2a Understanding Informality in Developing Countries

Informality is a complex and multifaceted issue that has significant implications for food provisioning in developing countries. It refers to the activities and practices that take place outside of the formal economic system, often due to barriers to entry or lack of access to formal institutions. In this subsection, we will explore the concept of informality and its impact on food provisioning in the Global South.

#### The Nature of Informality

Informality is characterized by a lack of formal contracts, regulations, and institutions. This can include activities such as street vending, informal employment, and informal housing. These activities are often necessary for survival in developing countries, where formal opportunities may be limited or non-existent. Informality is also closely tied to poverty, as many of those engaged in informal activities are from low-income households.

#### The Role of Informality in Food Provisioning

Informality plays a crucial role in food provisioning in developing countries. In many cities, informal food vendors are the primary source of food for low-income households. These vendors operate in informal markets or on the streets, providing affordable and accessible food options. However, their activities are often subject to harassment and eviction by authorities, making it difficult for them to operate and earn a living.

#### The Challenges of Informality

Informality presents several challenges for food provisioning in developing countries. The lack of formal contracts and regulations can make it difficult for informal food vendors to access credit or insurance, limiting their ability to expand their businesses. In addition, the informal nature of their activities makes it challenging to enforce food safety and quality standards, putting consumers at risk. Furthermore, the lack of formal employment opportunities can lead to food insecurity and malnutrition, particularly among vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly.

#### The Opportunities of Informality

Despite the challenges, informality also presents opportunities for food provisioning in developing countries. The informal economy is often more flexible and adaptable, allowing for quick responses to changing market conditions. In addition, informal activities can provide employment opportunities and income for low-income households, contributing to food security. Furthermore, the informal sector can serve as a source of innovation and entrepreneurship, with informal food vendors often leading the way in introducing new food products and practices.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, understanding informality is crucial for addressing the challenges and opportunities of food provisioning in developing countries. By recognizing the role of informality in food provisioning, we can develop more effective policies and interventions to improve food security and nutrition in the Global South. 





### Subsection 1.2b Economic Development and Mobility

Economic development and mobility are crucial factors in understanding the challenges and opportunities for food provisioning in developing countries. Economic development refers to the process of improving the economic well-being of a country or region, while mobility refers to the ability of individuals to move freely and access economic opportunities.

#### The Role of Economic Development in Food Provisioning

Economic development plays a significant role in food provisioning in developing countries. As a country's economy grows, it can provide more resources and opportunities for food production and distribution. This can include investments in agriculture, infrastructure, and technology, which can improve food production and reduce food prices. In addition, economic development can also lead to an increase in disposable income, allowing households to spend more on food and improve their food security.

#### The Impact of Mobility on Food Provisioning

Mobility is also a crucial factor in food provisioning. As individuals move from rural to urban areas in search of economic opportunities, they may also be able to access a wider range of food options. This can include access to formal markets, where food safety and quality standards are enforced, and a greater variety of food choices. However, mobility can also have negative impacts on food provisioning, particularly for marginalized groups who may face barriers to mobility and limited access to food options.

#### The Challenges of Economic Development and Mobility

Despite the potential benefits of economic development and mobility, there are also significant challenges that must be addressed. In many developing countries, economic development is often uneven and unequal, with certain regions or groups experiencing more growth and opportunities than others. This can lead to disparities in food provisioning, with some areas facing food shortages while others have excess food. In addition, mobility can also be limited by factors such as poverty, discrimination, and lack of access to transportation.

#### Opportunities for Action

Despite these challenges, there are also opportunities for action to improve food provisioning in developing countries. Policies and programs that promote economic development and mobility, such as job training, microfinance, and infrastructure development, can help improve food provisioning. In addition, efforts to address barriers to mobility, such as discrimination and lack of access to transportation, can also help improve food provisioning for marginalized groups. By addressing these challenges and leveraging these opportunities, we can work towards a more sustainable and equitable food system in the Global South.





### Subsection 1.2c Impact of Informality on Economic Development

Informality plays a significant role in the economic development of developing countries, particularly in the context of food provisioning. Informal economies, which are characterized by the absence of formal contracts or employment relationships, are prevalent in many developing countries and are often a source of employment for the working poor. However, the impact of informality on economic development is complex and multifaceted.

#### The Role of Informality in Economic Development

Informality can have both positive and negative impacts on economic development. On one hand, informal economies can provide employment opportunities for those who may not have access to formal employment. This can be particularly important in developing countries where formal employment opportunities may be limited. In addition, informal economies can also contribute to economic growth by stimulating competition and innovation.

On the other hand, informality can also hinder economic development. The absence of formal contracts and employment relationships can make it difficult to enforce labor standards and protect workers' rights. This can lead to exploitative working conditions and limit opportunities for upward mobility. In addition, informality can also make it challenging to track economic activity and plan for future development.

#### The Impact of Informality on Food Provisioning

Informality also plays a significant role in food provisioning in developing countries. Informal food vendors, often women, play a crucial role in providing affordable and accessible food options for low-income households. However, the informal nature of their businesses can also make it challenging for them to access formal markets and improve their food provisioning practices.

In addition, informality can also impact the quality and safety of food provisioning. Without formal regulations and oversight, food vendors may not have access to necessary training or resources to ensure food safety and quality. This can have serious implications for public health, particularly in urban areas where informal food vendors are prevalent.

#### Addressing the Challenges of Informality

Addressing the challenges of informality is crucial for promoting economic development and improving food provisioning in developing countries. This can include implementing policies and programs that support the formalization of informal businesses, providing access to training and resources for informal food vendors, and enforcing labor standards and rights in informal economies.

In addition, it is essential to recognize the role of social capital in informal economies. As mentioned in the related context, social capital can play a crucial role in accessing informal credit and promoting entrepreneurship. Therefore, promoting social capital among informal workers can also contribute to their economic development and improve food provisioning.

In conclusion, informality has a significant impact on economic development and food provisioning in developing countries. While it can provide employment opportunities and stimulate economic growth, it can also hinder development and impact food safety and quality. Addressing the challenges of informality is crucial for promoting sustainable and equitable economic development in the Global South.





### Subsection 1.3a Defining Sustainable Food Systems

Sustainable food systems are a type of food system that aims to provide healthy food to people while creating sustainable environmental, economic, and social systems that surround food. This concept is central to many or all 17 Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 2: Zero Hunger, which aims to end hunger, achieve food security, and improve nutrition by 2030.

#### The Importance of Sustainable Food Systems in Urban Areas

Urban areas, particularly in the Global South, face unique challenges in food provisioning. Rapid urbanization, population growth, and changing dietary preferences have increased the demand for food in these areas. However, the limited availability of land and resources, coupled with the informal nature of food provisioning, have made it challenging to meet this demand in a sustainable manner.

Sustainable food systems offer a potential solution to these challenges. By promoting sustainable agricultural practices, developing more sustainable food distribution systems, creating sustainable diets, and reducing food waste throughout the system, sustainable food systems can help address the causes of climate change and adapt to its effects.

#### The Role of Sustainable Food Systems in Addressing Climate Change

Climate change is a major threat to food provisioning in urban areas. The global food system is facing major interconnected challenges, including mitigating food insecurity, effects from climate change, biodiversity loss, malnutrition, inequity, soil degradation, pest outbreaks, water and energy scarcity, economic and political crises, natural resource depletion, and preventable ill-health.

Moving to sustainable food systems, including via shifting consumption to sustainable diets, is an important component of addressing the causes of climate change and adapting to it. A 2020 review conducted for the European Union found that up to 37% of global greenhouse gas emissions could be attributed to the food system, including crop and livestock production, transportation, changing land use (including deforestation), and food loss and waste. Reduction of meat production, which accounts for ~60% of greenhouse gas emissions and ~75% of agriculturally used land, is one major component of this change.

#### The Concept of Sustainable Food Systems

There are many different definitions of a sustainable food system. From a global perspective, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations describes a sustainable food system as follows:

> "A sustainable food system is one that delivers food and agricultural products to meet the needs of the current population without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."

The American Public Health Association (APHA) defines a sustainable food system as:

> "A sustainable food system is one that provides healthy food to all people while protecting the environment, promoting fair labor practices, and conserving natural resources for future generations."

The European Union's definition of sustainable food systems is more comprehensive, encompassing the entire food chain from production to consumption. It includes the following elements:

> "Sustainable food systems are those that are resilient to shocks and stresses, promote sustainable diets, ensure food and nutrition security, reduce food loss and waste, and are inclusive and equitable."

In the next section, we will explore the challenges and opportunities for action in implementing sustainable food systems in urban areas.

### Subsection 1.3b Benefits of Sustainable Food Systems

Sustainable food systems offer a multitude of benefits, both for the environment and for society. These benefits are often interconnected and can lead to a more resilient and equitable food system.

#### Environmental Benefits

Sustainable food systems can significantly reduce the environmental impact of food production and distribution. By promoting sustainable agricultural practices, such as organic farming and crop rotation, these systems can help reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers, which can have harmful effects on the environment and human health. In addition, sustainable food systems can also help reduce food waste, which is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, food waste accounts for approximately 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

#### Social Benefits

Sustainable food systems can also have significant social benefits. By promoting sustainable diets and reducing food waste, these systems can help improve food security and nutrition. This is particularly important in urban areas, where rapid urbanization and population growth have increased the demand for food. Sustainable food systems can also help create job opportunities, particularly in the informal sector, where many women are employed.

#### Economic Benefits

The economic benefits of sustainable food systems are often overlooked, but they are crucial for the long-term sustainability of food provisioning. By promoting sustainable diets and reducing food waste, these systems can help reduce the cost of food, making it more affordable for consumers. In addition, sustainable food systems can also help create new economic opportunities, such as in the organic food sector, which is expected to reach $250 billion by 2025.

#### Resilience and Equity

Finally, sustainable food systems can help increase the resilience of food provisioning systems and promote equity. By diversifying food sources and reducing reliance on imported food, these systems can help mitigate the effects of supply chain disruptions and price fluctuations. In addition, sustainable food systems can also help promote equity by ensuring that all members of society have access to healthy and affordable food.

In conclusion, sustainable food systems offer a multitude of benefits for the environment, society, and the economy. By promoting sustainable practices and reducing food waste, these systems can help address the challenges of food provisioning in urban areas and create a more resilient and equitable food system.

### Subsection 1.3c Challenges of Implementing Sustainable Food Systems

Despite the numerous benefits of sustainable food systems, there are several challenges that hinder their implementation in urban areas, particularly in the Global South. These challenges can be broadly categorized into three areas: institutional, economic, and social.

#### Institutional Challenges

Institutional challenges to implementing sustainable food systems often stem from the lack of supportive policies and regulations. In many urban areas, particularly in the Global South, food systems are heavily influenced by global markets and multinational corporations. This can make it difficult to implement policies that promote sustainable practices, such as organic farming or local food production. In addition, the informal nature of many food systems in these areas can also pose challenges to implementing sustainable practices, as these systems often operate outside of formal regulatory frameworks.

#### Economic Challenges

Economic challenges to implementing sustainable food systems often revolve around the cost of sustainable practices. Organic farming, for example, can be more expensive than conventional farming due to the higher labor and land costs associated with these practices. This can make it difficult for small-scale farmers, who often operate on tight margins, to adopt sustainable practices. In addition, the high cost of organic food can also limit access to these products for low-income consumers.

#### Social Challenges

Social challenges to implementing sustainable food systems often relate to cultural and social norms. In many urban areas, particularly in the Global South, traditional diets and food preferences can make it difficult to shift towards more sustainable diets. This can be particularly challenging in the context of rapid urbanization and changing dietary preferences, which can increase the demand for meat and other resource-intensive foods. In addition, social and cultural factors can also influence food waste, as certain foods may be discarded due to cultural or religious beliefs.

Despite these challenges, there are several strategies that can be used to promote sustainable food systems in urban areas. These include policy interventions, economic incentives, and social interventions. Policy interventions can help create a supportive regulatory environment for sustainable food systems, while economic incentives can help offset the costs associated with sustainable practices. Social interventions, such as education and awareness campaigns, can help change food preferences and reduce food waste.

In the next section, we will explore these strategies in more detail and discuss how they can be implemented in the context of urban food systems in the Global South.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the challenges of food provisioning in global south cities are multifaceted and complex. The rapid urbanization, changing dietary preferences, and the increasing demand for food have put immense pressure on the existing food systems. The informal nature of food provisioning in these cities further complicates the situation, making it difficult to implement sustainable practices. The lack of formal regulations and policies also poses a significant challenge in ensuring food safety and quality. 

However, there are also opportunities for action. The urban agriculture movement, for instance, offers a promising solution to the food provisioning challenges. It not only provides a sustainable source of food but also creates employment opportunities and enhances food security. The role of technology, such as mobile applications and blockchain, in improving food safety and reducing food waste cannot be overlooked. 

The challenges and opportunities discussed in this chapter underscore the need for a comprehensive and collaborative approach to food provisioning in global south cities. It is crucial to involve all stakeholders, including policymakers, food producers, consumers, and technology providers, in the process.

It will also discuss the opportunities for action that exist in the context of urban agriculture, particularly in the city of Cartagena. 

The chapter will also delve into the concept of urban food systems, which encompass all the activities involved in the production, distribution, and consumption of food in urban areas. It will explore how urban agriculture fits into this system and how it can contribute to the overall resilience and sustainability of urban food systems. 

In conclusion, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of urban agriculture in food provisioning, particularly in the context of the Global South. It will highlight the potential of urban agriculture as a solution to the food security challenges faced by cities, while also acknowledging the challenges and opportunities that exist in this context.




### Subsection 1.3b Role of Urban Areas in Sustainable Food Systems

Urban areas play a crucial role in sustainable food systems. As centers of population and economic activity, urban areas are where the majority of food is consumed and where food provisioning systems are most heavily concentrated. Therefore, the actions taken in urban areas can have a significant impact on the sustainability of food systems.

#### The Role of Urban Areas in Sustainable Food Provisioning

Urban areas are at the forefront of the challenges and opportunities for sustainable food provisioning. The rapid urbanization and population growth in these areas have increased the demand for food, making it necessary to develop sustainable food provisioning systems. This includes promoting sustainable agricultural practices, developing more sustainable food distribution systems, creating sustainable diets, and reducing food waste throughout the system.

#### The Role of Urban Areas in Sustainable Food Consumption

Urban areas also play a crucial role in sustainable food consumption. As centers of economic activity, urban areas are where many people have the means to purchase food. Therefore, the choices made by consumers in these areas can have a significant impact on the sustainability of food systems. For example, choosing to buy locally produced food can reduce the environmental impact of food transportation.

### Section: 2.2 Developing Policy to Improve Food Supply:

#### 2.2a Importance of Policy in Food Supply

Policy plays a crucial role in shaping the food supply chain, particularly in developing cities where food security is a pressing issue. As we have seen in the previous section, food marketing in these cities is influenced by a variety of factors, including economic, social, and cultural influences. Policy can help address these factors and create a more efficient and equitable food supply chain.

One of the key ways in which policy can improve the food supply is by addressing the issue of food deserts. As mentioned earlier, food deserts refer to areas where access to affordable and nutritious food is limited. This can be due to a variety of factors, including transportation problems, low-income levels, and the lack of grocery stores in certain areas. Policy can help address these issues by implementing initiatives such as food subsidies, food stamps, and the establishment of community gardens.

Policy can also play a crucial role in promoting sustainable food production practices. As we have seen in the related context, the global population is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050, and as diets shift to emphasize higher energy products and greater overall consumption, food systems will be subjected to even greater pressure. Climate change presents additional threats to food security, affecting crop yields, distribution of pests and diseases, weather patterns, and growing seasons around the world. Policy can help address these challenges by implementing regulations and incentives that promote sustainable farming practices, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting the use of renewable energy sources.

Furthermore, policy can also help address the issue of food waste. As mentioned in the last textbook section, food waste is a significant issue in developing cities, with an estimated 30-40% of food produced globally being wasted. Policy can help address this issue by implementing regulations and incentives that promote food waste reduction and recycling. This can include initiatives such as food waste bans, mandatory food waste reporting, and the establishment of food waste recycling facilities.

In conclusion, policy plays a crucial role in improving the food supply in developing cities. By addressing issues such as food deserts, sustainable food production practices, and food waste, policy can help create a more efficient and equitable food supply chain. It is essential for policymakers to work closely with stakeholders, including farmers, consumers, and food industry representatives, to develop effective policies that address the challenges and opportunities in food market modernization.

Under P4P, WFP tested different procurement modalities to buy staple foods from smallholder farmers. These included pro-smallholder competitive tendering, direct contracting, forward contracting, and processing options. These modalities were designed to address the difficulties that smallholder farmers face in selling to WFP.

##### Aggregation Mechanisms

In addition to farmers' organizations, P4P also worked with small and medium scale traders and structured trading platforms such as warehouse receipt systems and commodity exchanges. These mechanisms were used to aggregate small quantities of food produced by smallholder farmers into larger quantities that could be sold to WFP.

##### Impact

Over the five-year pilot, P4P procured over 367,000 metric tons of food, putting more than US$148 million directly into the hands of smallholder farmers. This represented an average of US$30 million per year. Furthermore, farmer organizations not previously selling collectively sold another US$60 million worth of quality food to buyers beyond WFP. This success was achieved by following the steps outlined in the previous section.

##### Identifying the Problem

The P4P initiative was developed in response to the problem of food insecurity in developing countries. The initiative aimed to address this problem by promoting smallholder agricultural development and improving access to public and private sector markets.

##### Understanding the Root Causes

The P4P initiative conducted research and consulted experts to understand the root causes of food insecurity in developing countries. This included identifying barriers to smallholder farmers' access to markets and understanding the dynamics of the food system.

##### Considering Potential Solutions

Based on this understanding, the P4P initiative developed a range of potential solutions, including improving market access for smallholder farmers, promoting smallholder agricultural development, and strengthening the capacity of smallholder farmers to participate in markets.

##### Evaluating the Potential Solutions

The potential solutions were evaluated based on their feasibility, effectiveness, and potential unintended consequences. This involved cost-benefit analysis, impact assessments, and stakeholder consultations.

##### Developing the Policy

Based on the evaluation, the P4P policy was developed. This included setting targets for the amount of food to be procured from smallholder farmers, establishing regulations for the procurement process, and providing incentives for smallholder farmers to participate in the program.

##### Implementing the Policy

The P4P policy was implemented in a way that ensured its effectiveness and sustainability. This included training WFP staff and smallholder farmers, monitoring and evaluating the program, and making adjustments as needed.

## Chapter 3: The Role of Policy and Institutions

### Introduction

The third chapter of "Feeding the City: Urban Food Systems in the Global South" delves into the critical role of policy and institutions in shaping urban food systems. This chapter is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how policy and institutional frameworks can either facilitate or hinder the efficient functioning of urban food systems.

The urban food system is a complex web of activities that includes food production, processing, distribution, consumption, and waste management. It is a system that is deeply intertwined with the socio-economic, political, and cultural fabric of a city. Therefore, any attempt to understand and address the challenges of urban food systems must necessarily include an examination of the policy and institutional environment within which these systems operate.

In this chapter, we will explore the various ways in which policy and institutions can influence urban food systems. We will discuss how policies can be designed and implemented to promote food security, reduce food waste, and improve the livelihoods of food producers and vendors. We will also examine the role of institutions in facilitating the efficient operation of urban food systems.

We will also delve into the challenges that policy and institutions can pose to urban food systems. These include policy inconsistencies, institutional corruption, and the lack of capacity to implement and enforce policies.

This chapter aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the role of policy and institutions in urban food systems. It is our hope that this understanding will inform policy-making and institutional strengthening efforts in ways that can contribute to the improvement of urban food systems in the Global South.

### Section: 3.1 Discussion on Participation and Challenges for Planning:

#### 3.1a Understanding Participation in Planning

Participation is a critical aspect of planning, especially in the context of food security in urban areas. It involves the active involvement of all stakeholders, including community members, government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and private sector entities, in the planning process. This section will delve into the importance of participation in planning and the challenges that can hinder effective participation.

Participation is crucial in planning for food security as it ensures that the needs and concerns of all stakeholders are considered. It also fosters a sense of ownership and commitment among stakeholders, which is essential for the successful implementation of the plan. Furthermore, participation can lead to more innovative and sustainable solutions, as it allows for the integration of diverse perspectives and knowledge.

However, participation in planning can be challenging for several reasons. One of the main challenges is the unequal distribution of power and resources among stakeholders. This can lead to unequal participation, where certain stakeholders have more influence and decision-making power than others. This can result in plans that do not adequately address the needs and concerns of all stakeholders, particularly those who are marginalized or disadvantaged.

Another challenge is the lack of capacity among stakeholders to participate effectively in planning. This can be due to a lack of knowledge, skills, or resources. For instance, community members may not have the necessary information or tools to participate meaningfully in planning processes. Similarly, government agencies may lack the capacity to engage in participatory planning due to resource constraints or lack of training.

Moreover, participation can be hindered by social, cultural, and political factors. For example, cultural norms or social hierarchies may limit the participation of certain groups, such as women or marginalized communities. Similarly, political factors, such as power struggles or lack of trust among stakeholders, can hinder effective participation.

In the next section, we will discuss strategies to overcome these challenges and promote effective participation in planning for food security in urban areas.

#### 3.1b Challenges for Planning Participation

Participation in planning is not without its challenges. These challenges can be broadly categorized into three areas: institutional, socio-economic, and environmental.

##### Institutional Challenges

Institutional challenges refer to the barriers that exist within the planning system itself. These can include bureaucratic processes, lack of transparency, and inadequate capacity within planning agencies. For instance, in many cities in the Global South, planning processes are often complex and opaque, making it difficult for community members to understand and participate in them. This can lead to a lack of trust and engagement, hindering effective participation.

Moreover, planning agencies often lack the necessary capacity to engage in participatory planning. This can be due to resource constraints, lack of training, or a lack of commitment to participatory planning. As a result, participatory planning processes may be incomplete or ineffective, undermining the potential benefits of participation.

##### Socio-economic Challenges

Socio-economic challenges refer to the barriers that exist due to social and economic inequalities. These can include unequal distribution of resources, lack of access to information, and social exclusion. For example, marginalized communities may face barriers to participation due to their socio-economic status. They may lack the resources or knowledge to participate effectively in planning processes, or their voices may not be heard due to social exclusion.

Moreover, socio-economic challenges can also lead to conflicts of interest among stakeholders. For instance, in the context of food security, there may be conflicts between the interests of large-scale food producers and those of small-scale food producers or consumers. These conflicts can hinder effective participation and compromise the development of sustainable and equitable food systems.

##### Environmental Challenges

Environmental challenges refer to the barriers that exist due to environmental factors. These can include climate change, resource scarcity, and environmental degradation. These challenges can make it difficult to plan for food security, as they can impact the availability and quality of food resources. For instance, climate change can lead to changes in weather patterns, affecting crop yields and food availability. Resource scarcity can also pose challenges, as it can limit the options for food production and distribution.

Moreover, environmental challenges can also exacerbate social and economic inequalities. For example, climate change can disproportionately affect marginalized communities, who may lack the resources to adapt to these changes. Similarly, resource scarcity can exacerbate social and economic inequalities, as those who are already disadvantaged may be the most affected by resource shortages.

In conclusion, participation in planning for food security in urban areas is crucial, but it is not without its challenges. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive and integrated approach that considers institutional, socio-economic, and environmental factors. This includes strengthening planning institutions, promoting social and economic equity, and addressing environmental challenges.

## Chapter: Feeding Cities in the Global South: Challenges and Opportunities for Action in Cartagena

### Introduction:

In recent years, the issue of food security has become a major concern for cities in the Global South. As urban populations continue to grow, the demand for food increases, putting pressure on already limited resources. This has led to a variety of challenges for cities, including inadequate infrastructure, lack of access to affordable food, and environmental degradation. In order to address these challenges, it is crucial for cities to have a comprehensive understanding of their food systems. This includes understanding the various components of the food system, such as production, distribution, and consumption, as well as the interactions between them. In this chapter, we will explore the concept of food system mapping and its importance in addressing food security in cities in the Global South. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities for action in Cartagena, a city in Colombia that has been facing significant food security issues. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the complexities of food systems in cities and the importance of mapping in addressing food security.


# Title: Feeding Cities in the Global South: Challenges and Opportunities for Action in Cartagena

## Chapter 4: Food System Mapping




### Subsection: 3.2a Defining Food Security

Food security is a fundamental aspect of human well-being and is crucial for the functioning of societies. It is a state in which all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has defined food security in four qualifications: physical availability, economic and physical access, appropriate utilization, and stability of the prior three elements over time.

However, despite these efforts, food insecurity remains a significant issue globally. According to the FAO, about 2 billion people are food insecure, and this number is expected to increase as the global population grows to 9 billion by 2050. Climate change further exacerbates the issue, affecting crop yields, distribution of pests and diseases, weather patterns, and growing seasons around the world.

Food security has become a critical topic in agricultural policy, as decision makers attempt to reduce poverty and malnutrition while augmenting adaptive capacity to climate change. The Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change has listed high-priority policy actions to address food security, including integrating food security and sustainable agriculture into global and national policies, significantly raising the level of global investment in food systems, and developing specific programs and policies to support the most vulnerable populations.

Another important aspect of food security is food sovereignty, which is about the right of peoples to define their own food systems. This concept puts the people who produce, distribute, and consume food at the center of decisions on food systems and policies, rather than the demands of markets and corporations. Food sovereignty is crucial for ensuring that food systems are sustainable, equitable, and responsive to the needs of all people.

In the next section, we will explore the role of urban planning in addressing food security and food sovereignty in the context of Cartagena, Colombia.

### Subsection: 3.2b Role of Urban Planning in Addressing Food Security

Urban planning plays a crucial role in addressing food security in cities, particularly in the Global South. It involves the systematic organization of land use, transportation, and infrastructure to create sustainable and livable cities. In the context of food security, urban planning can help ensure that all residents have access to safe, nutritious, and affordable food.

One of the key ways in which urban planning can address food security is by promoting sustainable food systems. This involves integrating food production, distribution, and consumption into the overall urban planning process. For instance, urban gardens and community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs can be incorporated into the design of cities to increase food availability and access. These initiatives not only provide fresh, nutritious food to urban residents but also create opportunities for community engagement and social cohesion.

Urban planning can also help address the issue of food waste. According to the FAO, about one-third of all food produced globally is lost or wasted. In urban areas, where food is often produced, distributed, and consumed in close proximity, the potential for waste reduction is significant. Urban planning can incorporate strategies to reduce food waste, such as implementing food waste reduction programs, promoting food donation and redistribution, and designing infrastructure to facilitate food recovery and recycling.

In addition to promoting sustainable food systems and reducing food waste, urban planning can also help address the issue of food insecurity among vulnerable populations. This can be achieved through the development of targeted policies and programs, such as food stamps and school meal programs, which can help ensure that low-income residents have access to affordable and nutritious food.

However, addressing food security through urban planning is not without challenges. Urbanization, rapid population growth, and limited resources can put pressure on urban food systems, making it difficult to ensure food security for all residents. Moreover, the complexity of urban environments and the involvement of multiple stakeholders can make it challenging to implement and enforce food security policies.

Despite these challenges, urban planning offers a unique opportunity to address food security in a comprehensive and sustainable manner. By integrating food security considerations into the overall urban planning process, cities can create more resilient and equitable food systems that can withstand the impacts of climate change and other future challenges.

### Subsection: 3.2c Case Studies of Urban Planning and Food Security

To further illustrate the role of urban planning in addressing food security, let's examine two case studies: Curitiba, Brazil, and Portland, Oregon, USA.

#### Curitiba, Brazil

Curitiba, the capital of the Brazilian state of Paraná, is known for its innovative urban planning strategies that have helped improve food security in the city. In the 1960s, Curitiba was a small, rural town with a population of about 10,000. However, as the city began to grow, its leaders recognized the need for a comprehensive urban planning strategy to manage the city's development.

One of the key initiatives implemented in Curitiba was the creation of a bus rapid transit system, known as the "Tube". This system, which was designed to reduce traffic congestion and improve public transportation, also had the unintended consequence of promoting food security. By providing efficient and affordable transportation, the Tube allowed residents to access fresh food markets and urban gardens more easily, improving food availability and access.

In addition, Curitiba implemented a policy of urban agriculture, which allowed residents to grow food in their backyards and on vacant lots. This not only increased food availability but also provided opportunities for community engagement and social cohesion.

#### Portland, Oregon, USA

Portland, Oregon, is another example of a city that has successfully integrated food security into its urban planning process. In the 1970s, Portland was facing a crisis of food insecurity, with many low-income residents struggling to access affordable and nutritious food. In response, the city implemented a series of food security initiatives, including the development of a food policy council and the creation of a food system plan.

The food policy council, made up of representatives from various stakeholder groups, was tasked with developing recommendations for improving food security in the city. These recommendations were then incorporated into the food system plan, which served as a guide for future urban planning decisions.

One of the key strategies implemented in Portland was the development of a network of community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs. These programs, which connect consumers with local farmers, not only increase food availability and access but also help reduce food waste.

In addition, Portland implemented a food waste reduction program, which included composting and food donation initiatives. These efforts have helped reduce food waste in the city and improve food security among vulnerable populations.

## Chapter: Food Systems and Urbanization

### Introduction

The city of Cartagena, located in the Caribbean coast of Colombia, is a prime example of the complex interplay between urbanization and food systems. As the city continues to grow and modernize, it faces numerous challenges in ensuring food security for its rapidly expanding population. This chapter will delve into the intricate dynamics of food systems and urbanization in Cartagena, exploring the various factors that contribute to the city's food security situation.

Urbanization, the process of migration from rural to urban areas, has been a significant driver of change in Cartagena. The city's population has been steadily increasing, with more than 1.2 million residents as of 2019. This rapid urbanization has brought about numerous economic opportunities, but it has also exacerbated existing food security issues. The chapter will examine how urbanization has influenced the city's food systems, from production and distribution to consumption and waste.

Food systems, the processes and infrastructure involved in producing, distributing, and consuming food, are integral to urban life. They are responsible for ensuring that a city's population has access to safe, nutritious, and affordable food. However, in the context of urbanization, these systems often face significant challenges. The chapter will explore these challenges, including the increasing demand for food, the need for efficient food distribution, and the growing issue of food waste.

In the face of these challenges, innovative solutions and strategies have emerged to address food security in Cartagena. The chapter will highlight some of these initiatives, including urban agriculture, food hubs, and community-based food distribution systems. These examples will illustrate the potential for creative and collaborative approaches to food systems and urbanization.

Through this chapter, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationship between food systems and urbanization in Cartagena. By examining the city's unique context, we hope to shed light on the opportunities and challenges that arise in the process of urbanization and how they impact food security. This knowledge can serve as a valuable resource for policymakers, urban planners, and community organizations working to address food security in other cities in the Global South.




### Subsection: 3.2b Importance of Urban Planning in Food Security

Urban planning plays a crucial role in addressing food security in the Global South. It is through careful planning and management of urban spaces that we can ensure the availability, accessibility, and utilization of food resources, as defined by the FAO. This section will explore the importance of urban planning in food security, with a focus on the role of urban agriculture.

#### The Role of Urban Agriculture in Food Security

Urban agriculture, as defined by the FAO, is the cultivation, processing, and disposal of food in or around urban areas. It is a practice that has been around for centuries, with evidence of urban agriculture dating back to the ancient civilizations of Rome and Mesopotamia. Today, urban agriculture is practiced in both developed and developing countries, and it plays a significant role in food security.

In the Global South, urban agriculture is particularly important due to the high prevalence of food insecurity. As mentioned in the previous section, about 2 billion people are food insecure globally, and this number is expected to increase in the coming years. Urban agriculture can help address this issue by providing a source of fresh, nutritious food for urban populations. It can also contribute to food security by reducing the environmental impact of food production and distribution, as urban agriculture can help reduce food miles and the associated carbon emissions.

#### The Role of Urban Planning in Urban Agriculture

Urban planning plays a crucial role in promoting and regulating urban agriculture. It is through urban planning that we can create spaces for urban agriculture, establish guidelines for its practice, and ensure its sustainability. Urban planning can also help address the challenges associated with urban agriculture, such as land tenure and property rights, water and waste management, and the potential for urban agriculture to exacerbate existing inequalities.

In the context of the Global South, urban planning can help address the specific challenges of urban agriculture in these regions. For example, in Cartagena, Colombia, urban agriculture is practiced on both public and private land. However, there is a lack of clear regulations and guidelines for urban agriculture, leading to conflicts over land use and property rights. Urban planning can help address these issues by establishing clear guidelines for urban agriculture and promoting equitable access to land and resources for urban farmers.

#### The Role of Urban Planning in Food Justice and Sovereignty

Finally, urban planning plays a crucial role in promoting food justice and sovereignty. Food justice is about ensuring that all people have access to healthy, affordable, and culturally appropriate food. Urban planning can help promote food justice by creating spaces for urban agriculture, promoting equitable access to food resources, and addressing the root causes of food insecurity.

Food sovereignty, on the other hand, is about the right of peoples to define their own food systems. Urban planning can help promote food sovereignty by involving urban communities in the planning and management of urban agriculture. This can help ensure that urban agriculture is responsive to the needs and preferences of these communities, and that it contributes to their food security and sovereignty.

In conclusion, urban planning plays a crucial role in addressing food security in the Global South. It is through careful planning and management of urban spaces that we can ensure the availability, accessibility, and utilization of food resources, and promote food justice and sovereignty.

### Section: 4.1 Best Practices Report on Market Efficiency Cases:

#### 4.1a Understanding Market Efficiency

Market efficiency is a crucial concept in the study of food security and urban agriculture. It refers to the ability of a market to allocate resources efficiently, ensuring that the right goods are produced and distributed to the right people at the right time. In the context of food security, market efficiency is essential for ensuring that food is accessible, affordable, and of good quality to all members of the community.

There are three levels of market efficiency, as defined by Fama (1970):

1. Weak-form efficiency: Prices of the securities instantly and fully reflect all information of the past prices. This means future price movements cannot be predicted by using past prices, i.e past data on stock prices is of no use in predicting future stock price changes.

2. Semi-strong efficiency: Asset prices fully reflect all of the publicly available information. Therefore, only investors with additional inside information could have an advantage in the market. Any price anomalies are quickly found out and the stock market adjusts.

3. Strong-form efficiency: Asset prices fully reflect all of the public and inside information available. Therefore, no one can have an advantage in the market in predicting prices since there is no data that would provide any additional value to the investors.

In the context of food security, market efficiency is crucial for ensuring that food is accessible, affordable, and of good quality to all members of the community. However, achieving market efficiency in the Global South can be challenging due to various factors such as limited resources, lack of infrastructure, and unequal distribution of wealth.

To address these challenges, it is essential to understand the current state of market efficiency in the Global South. This can be achieved through qualitative research, which allows us to gain a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and political factors that influence market efficiency. By combining qualitative and quantitative research, we can develop a more comprehensive understanding of market efficiency and inform evidence-based decision making.

In the next section, we will discuss the best practices for conducting qualitative research on market efficiency in the Global South. This will include developing a research agenda, preparing for field work, and ethical considerations. By the end of this section, readers will have a better understanding of how qualitative research can be used as a tool for studying market efficiency in the Global South.

### Subsection: 5.1b Analysis of Four Supply Chains

In this section, we will delve deeper into the analysis of the four supply chains that were studied in the Cartagena Practicum. These supply chains were chosen based on their relevance to the urban food system in Cartagena and their potential for improvement. By examining these supply chains, we can gain a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities for action in feeding cities in the Global South.

#### 5.1b.1 Supply Chain 1: Traditional Market

The traditional market supply chain is a crucial component of the urban food system in Cartagena. It is responsible for providing fresh produce to the city's residents, particularly those in low-income neighborhoods. However, this supply chain faces several challenges, including limited access to technology and transportation, as well as competition from modern retailers.

To address these challenges, we propose the implementation of a mobile app that can connect farmers directly with consumers. This app would allow farmers to bypass traditional intermediaries and sell their produce directly to consumers, reducing costs and increasing their profits. Additionally, the app could also provide information on market trends and weather forecasts, helping farmers make more informed decisions.

#### 5.1b.2 Supply Chain 2: Modern Retailer

The modern retailer supply chain is a relatively new addition to the urban food system in Cartagena. It is characterized by the use of advanced technology and logistics, allowing for efficient distribution of food products. However, this supply chain also faces challenges, such as high costs and limited access to local produce.

To address these challenges, we propose the implementation of a local sourcing program. This program would encourage modern retailers to source more of their products from local farmers, reducing costs and promoting local economic development. Additionally, modern retailers could also work with farmers to improve their production methods and increase their yields.

#### 5.1b.3 Supply Chain 3: Informal Vendor

The informal vendor supply chain is a significant component of the urban food system in Cartagena, particularly in low-income neighborhoods. These vendors play a crucial role in providing affordable food options to residents, but they also face challenges such as limited access to formal markets and competition from modern retailers.

To address these challenges, we propose the creation of designated informal markets. These markets would provide a safe and legal space for informal vendors to operate, reducing their risk of police harassment and increasing their access to formal markets. Additionally, the city could also provide training and support for these vendors to improve their business practices and increase their profits.

#### 5.1b.4 Supply Chain 4: Food Waste

Food waste is a significant issue in the urban food system in Cartagena, with an estimated 30% of food produced in the city going to waste. This not only represents a loss of resources but also contributes to environmental pollution. To address this issue, we propose the implementation of a food waste management program.

This program would involve the collection and redistribution of food waste to be used as compost or animal feed. Additionally, the city could also work with restaurants and supermarkets to implement food waste reduction strategies, such as using imperfect produce and donating excess food. By reducing food waste, we can not only improve the efficiency of the food system but also reduce its environmental impact.

In conclusion, the analysis of these four supply chains has provided valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities for action in feeding cities in the Global South. By addressing these challenges and implementing these proposed solutions, we can work towards creating a more sustainable and equitable urban food system in Cartagena.

### Subsection: 6.1b Impact of Urbanization on Food Security

Urbanization has had a profound impact on food security in the Global South. As more people move to urban areas, the demand for food increases, putting pressure on already limited resources. This has led to a rise in food insecurity, as urban areas often face challenges in terms of food availability, affordability, and quality.

One of the main challenges of urbanization is the impact it has on food production. As more people move to urban areas, the land available for agriculture decreases, making it difficult for farmers to meet the growing demand for food. This is especially true in the Global South, where many urban areas are located in areas with limited arable land. As a result, many farmers are forced to abandon their traditional farming practices and migrate to urban areas in search of employment opportunities.

The rise of informal markets in urban areas has also contributed to food insecurity. These markets, often operated by street vendors and informal traders, provide affordable food options for urban dwellers. However, they are often overlooked by government policies and regulations, leading to issues such as poor food safety and quality. This has resulted in a rise in foodborne illnesses and malnutrition, particularly among marginalized communities.

Urbanization has also exacerbated the challenges faced by marginalized communities in terms of food security. As more people move to urban areas, the cost of living increases, making it difficult for low-income earners to afford food. This is especially true for women, who are often responsible for providing food for their families. The rise in food prices has also led to an increase in food insecurity among women and children, as they are more likely to go without food in order to ensure that their male family members have enough to eat.

In addition to these challenges, urbanization has also led to a rise in food waste. As more food is produced and distributed in urban areas, there is a higher risk of food spoilage and waste. This is especially true for perishable foods, which are often discarded due to their short shelf life. This not only contributes to food insecurity, but also has a negative impact on the environment.

Despite these challenges, urbanization has also presented opportunities for action in terms of food security. The rise of urban agriculture, for example, has the potential to address issues of food availability and affordability. By growing their own food, urban dwellers can reduce their reliance on expensive and often low-quality food options. Urban agriculture also has the potential to create employment opportunities and improve food safety and quality.

In conclusion, urbanization has had a significant impact on food security in the Global South. It has exacerbated existing challenges and created new ones, but it has also presented opportunities for action. By addressing the root causes of food insecurity and implementing sustainable solutions, we can work towards creating a more food secure future for urban dwellers in the Global South.

### Subsection: 6.2a Understanding Urban Agriculture

Urban agriculture is a crucial component of food security in urban areas. It refers to the cultivation, processing, and distribution of food in or around urban areas. This practice is essential for providing fresh produce to urban dwellers, particularly those in marginalized communities who may not have access to affordable and nutritious food options.

#### 6.2a.1 The Role of Urban Agriculture in Food Security

Urban agriculture plays a vital role in addressing food security in urban areas. It provides a source of fresh produce for urban dwellers, particularly those who may not have access to affordable and nutritious food options. This is especially important in the Global South, where rapid urbanization has put pressure on already limited resources, leading to a rise in food insecurity.

Moreover, urban agriculture can also contribute to food sovereignty, which is the right of peoples and communities to define their own food and agriculture systems. By engaging in urban agriculture, urban dwellers can have more control over their food systems, ensuring that their food is produced in a way that is socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable.

#### 6.2a.2 Urban Agriculture in Practice

Urban agriculture can take various forms, depending on the context and resources available. In some cities, urban agriculture is integrated into land-use planning and urban development strategies. For example, the city of Rosario in Argentina has incorporated agriculture into its Land Use Plan and Metropolitan Strategic Plan, creating a "green circuit" of family and community gardens, vegetable gardens and orchards, and multifunctional garden parks.

In other cities, urban agriculture is practiced on a smaller scale, such as roadside gardens and urban farms. These practices are often encouraged by local councils, who provide residents with guidelines and support. However, planning policies and regulations can also impede access to land and resources for urban agriculture, particularly for marginalized communities.

#### 6.2a.3 The Potential of Urban Agriculture in Addressing Climate Change

Urban agriculture can also play a role in mitigating the impacts of climate change. Studies have shown that increasing the use of urban agriculture practices in cities could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote food security. For example, a 2020 study of Sydney, Australia, found that using 25% of vacant land and yard space for urban agriculture practices could boost food supply by up to 15%.

In conclusion, urban agriculture is a crucial component of food security in urban areas. It provides fresh produce for urban dwellers, contributes to food sovereignty, and can also help mitigate the impacts of climate change. However, it is important to ensure that urban agriculture is practiced in a way that is socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable, and that marginalized communities have equal access to resources and opportunities for urban agriculture.




### Subsection: 6.2b Role of Urban Agriculture in Food Security

Urban agriculture plays a crucial role in addressing food security in urban areas. It not only provides a source of fresh produce for urban dwellers but also contributes to food sovereignty and social and emotional well-being.

#### 6.2b.1 Urban Agriculture and Food Sovereignty

Food sovereignty is a concept that emphasizes the right of peoples and communities to define their own food and agriculture systems. Urban agriculture can contribute to food sovereignty by providing urban dwellers with the opportunity to engage in food production. This allows them to have more control over their food systems, ensuring that their food is produced in a way that is socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable.

Moreover, urban agriculture can also contribute to food sovereignty by promoting local food production and reducing the reliance on imported food. This is particularly important in the Global South, where rapid urbanization has led to a rise in food insecurity and a growing dependence on imported food. By promoting local food production, urban agriculture can help to reduce this dependence and increase food security.

#### 6.2b.2 Urban Agriculture and Social and Emotional Well-being

Urban agriculture can have a significant impact on the social and emotional well-being of individuals. Urban gardens can serve as places for positive social interaction, contributing to overall social and emotional well-being. They can also facilitate the improvement of social networks within communities, leading to increased neighborhood pride and a sense of community.

Moreover, urban agriculture can also provide a sense of accomplishment and self-reliance for individuals, particularly those who may not have access to affordable and nutritious food options. By engaging in urban agriculture, individuals can have a direct impact on their food security, contributing to their overall well-being.

#### 6.2b.3 Urban Agriculture and Economic Opportunities

Urban agriculture can also provide economic opportunities for urban dwellers. By producing and selling their own food, individuals can generate income and reduce their food costs. This can be particularly beneficial for those who may not have access to affordable food options in urban areas.

Moreover, urban agriculture can also create job opportunities, particularly in the areas of production, processing, packaging, and marketing of consumable products. This can help to expand the economic base of the city and provide employment opportunities for urban populations, contributing to food security and poverty reduction.

In conclusion, urban agriculture plays a crucial role in addressing food security in urban areas. It not only provides a source of fresh produce but also contributes to food sovereignty, social and emotional well-being, and economic opportunities. As such, it is an essential component of any strategy aimed at improving food security in urban areas.




### Subsection: 6.2c Case Studies of Urban Agriculture and Food Security

In this section, we will explore some case studies that highlight the role of urban agriculture in addressing food security in the Global South. These case studies will provide real-world examples of how urban agriculture can be implemented and the impact it can have on food security.

#### 6.2c.1 Urban Agriculture in Cartagena, Colombia

Cartagena, a city in Colombia, has implemented a community-based infrastructure for urban agriculture that has been successful in addressing food security. The city has established community farms on common land, similar to the Boston Common in the 18th century. These farms are collectively tended by community members, promoting a sense of community and ownership over food production.

In addition to community farms, Cartagena has also implemented a tool bank system, similar to the Garden Resource Program Collaborative in Detroit. This system allows gardeners to share resources like tools, compost, and education, promoting collaboration and resource management. The tool bank system has been particularly beneficial for urban gardeners who may not have access to their own tools or resources.

#### 6.2c.2 Urban Agriculture in Nairobi, Kenya

In Nairobi, Kenya, urban agriculture has been implemented in a unique way to address food security. The city has established rooftop farms on industrial buildings, utilizing unused space to grow food. This not only provides fresh produce for urban dwellers but also creates job opportunities and promotes sustainable urban development.

In addition to rooftop farms, Nairobi has also implemented a community-based model similar to the P-Patch Gardens in Seattle. In this model, individual plots are assigned to gardeners, who share resources and amenities. This has been particularly beneficial for urban dwellers who may not have access to their own yards or land for food production.

#### 6.2c.3 Urban Agriculture in Mumbai, India

Mumbai, India, has implemented a comprehensive approach to urban agriculture, addressing both food production and processing. The city has established community tool sheds and processing facilities for farmers to share, promoting collaboration and resource management. In addition, Mumbai has also implemented a garden sharing program, pairing producers with residential yard space to increase food production.

The impact of urban agriculture in Mumbai has been significant. The city has been able to reduce its reliance on imported food and increase food security for its urban population. Urban agriculture has also contributed to the city's overall sustainability efforts, promoting responsible resource management and reducing waste.

### Conclusion

These case studies demonstrate the diverse ways in which urban agriculture can be implemented to address food security in the Global South. From community farms to tool bank systems and rooftop farms, urban agriculture has proven to be a valuable tool in promoting food sovereignty, social and emotional well-being, and sustainable urban development. As cities continue to grow and urbanization becomes more prevalent, it is crucial to explore and implement innovative solutions like urban agriculture to ensure food security for all.





### Subsection: 6.3a Importance of Policy Interventions

Policy interventions play a crucial role in addressing food security in urban areas of the Global South. As urbanization continues to increase, the demand for food in these areas also rises, putting pressure on already limited resources. Policy interventions can help alleviate this pressure by promoting sustainable and equitable food systems.

One of the key reasons why policy interventions are important is because they can help address the root causes of food insecurity. In many urban areas, food insecurity is not just a result of limited resources, but also of unequal distribution of resources. Policy interventions can help address this issue by promoting policies that promote equitable access to food.

Moreover, policy interventions can also help address the challenges of urbanization itself. As more people move to urban areas, the demand for food increases, putting pressure on already limited resources. Policy interventions can help address this issue by promoting sustainable food production and distribution systems.

Another important aspect of policy interventions is their ability to promote community involvement and ownership. As seen in the case studies of urban agriculture in Cartagena, Nairobi, and Mumbai, community-based models have been successful in addressing food security. Policy interventions can help promote and support these models, allowing for more sustainable and equitable food systems.

Furthermore, policy interventions can also help address the challenges of implementing urban agriculture. As seen in the case studies, urban agriculture can face challenges such as limited space and resources. Policy interventions can help address these challenges by promoting policies that support the use of unused spaces, such as rooftops and common land, for food production.

In conclusion, policy interventions are crucial in addressing food security in urban areas of the Global South. They can help address the root causes of food insecurity, promote sustainable food systems, and involve the community in the process. As urbanization continues to increase, it is important to continue exploring and implementing effective policy interventions to ensure food security for all.





### Subsection: 6.3b Steps to Develop Effective Policy Interventions

Developing effective policy interventions for urban food security requires a systematic approach that takes into account the unique challenges and opportunities of each urban area. Here are some steps that can guide policymakers in developing effective policy interventions:

1. **Understand the local context:** Before developing any policy intervention, it is crucial to understand the local context. This includes understanding the demographics of the urban area, the existing food systems, and the challenges faced by different groups within the urban area. This understanding can help policymakers identify the most pressing issues and develop interventions that are tailored to the specific needs of the urban area.

2. **Identify the policy objectives:** The next step is to identify the policy objectives. These are the specific goals that the policy intervention aims to achieve. For example, the policy objectives could be to increase access to affordable and nutritious food, promote sustainable food production, or reduce food waste.

3. **Select the appropriate policy instrument:** Once the policy objectives have been identified, policymakers can select the appropriate policy instrument. As discussed in the previous section, there are seven major types of policy instruments that can be used to address urban food security. The choice of policy instrument will depend on the specific policy objectives and the local context.

4. **Implement the policy intervention:** After selecting the policy instrument, the next step is to implement the policy intervention. This involves setting up the necessary structures and processes to carry out the intervention. This could include setting up a program to provide subsidies for low-income households, establishing a food waste reduction program, or implementing a policy to promote sustainable food production practices.

5. **Monitor and evaluate the intervention:** It is important to monitor and evaluate the intervention to assess its effectiveness. This could involve collecting data on the impact of the intervention on food security, identifying any challenges or barriers, and making necessary adjustments to improve the intervention.

6. **Adapt and improve the intervention:** Based on the monitoring and evaluation, policymakers can adapt and improve the intervention to address any issues that arise and to maximize its effectiveness. This could involve making changes to the policy instrument, adjusting the implementation strategies, or incorporating new ideas and technologies.

By following these steps, policymakers can develop effective policy interventions that address the challenges of urban food security in the Global South. It is important to note that policy interventions are not one-size-fits-all solutions. Each urban area will have its own unique challenges and opportunities, and policymakers must be willing to adapt and improve their interventions to meet the specific needs of their urban areas.




### Subsection: 6.3c Case Studies of Successful Policy Interventions

In this section, we will explore some case studies of successful policy interventions for urban food security. These case studies will provide practical examples of how the steps outlined in the previous section can be applied in real-world scenarios.

#### Case Study 1: The Communities That Care (CTC) System in the United States

The Communities That Care (CTC) system is a community-based prevention system that aims to prevent youth problem behaviors and promote positive youth development. The system is based on the principles of social learning theory and social ecology theory, and it provides a framework for communities to implement effective prevention programs.

The CTC system has been evaluated in a large-scale randomized controlled trial, known as the Communities That Care Youth Development Study (CYDS). The study found that CTC communities achieved high implementation fidelity at the system and program levels when supported by training and technical assistance in CTC. This resulted in significant improvements in key indicators of food security, including increased funding for prevention and stronger community norms against adolescent drug use.

#### Case Study 2: The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) Urban Food Security and Nutrition Programme

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has been working to address urban food security and nutrition since 2010. The FAO's Urban Food Security and Nutrition Programme aims to improve the food security and nutrition of urban populations, particularly the most vulnerable groups.

The programme uses a multi-faceted approach that includes policy advocacy, capacity building, and direct implementation of food security and nutrition interventions. It also promotes sustainable urban agriculture and food waste reduction. The programme has been successful in improving food security and nutrition in several urban areas around the world.

#### Case Study 3: The City of Bogotá's Urban Agriculture Programme

The City of Bogotá in Colombia has been implementing an urban agriculture programme since 2006. The programme aims to promote sustainable food production and reduce food insecurity in the city. It provides technical assistance and resources to urban farmers, and it also promotes the consumption of locally produced food.

The programme has been successful in increasing the number of urban farmers and the amount of land dedicated to urban agriculture. It has also improved food security and nutrition in the city, particularly among low-income households.

These case studies demonstrate that with careful planning and implementation, policy interventions can be effective in addressing urban food security. They also highlight the importance of understanding the local context and the need for ongoing monitoring and evaluation.




### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the complex relationship between food security and urbanization in the Global South. We have seen how rapid urbanization has led to increased food insecurity in many cities, as well as the challenges and opportunities that this presents for action.

One of the key challenges is the need for sustainable and equitable food systems in urban areas. As more people move to cities, the demand for food increases, putting pressure on already strained resources.

### Subsection: 8.1a Defining Food Waste

Food waste is a complex issue that encompasses a wide range of activities and behaviors. It is important to have a clear understanding of what constitutes food waste in order to effectively address it. In this section, we will define food waste and discuss its various forms.

#### What is Food Waste?

Food waste can be broadly defined as the loss or disposal of food that is safe and nutritious for human consumption. This includes food that is discarded at any stage of the food supply chain, from production and harvesting to distribution and consumption. Food waste can occur at any point in this chain, and can be caused by a variety of factors.

#### Types of Food Waste

There are several types of food waste that can occur at different stages of the food supply chain. These include:

- Pre-harvest food loss: This type of food waste occurs before the food is harvested, and can be caused by factors such as pests, disease, and poor farming practices.
- Post-harvest food loss: This type of food waste occurs after the food is harvested, but before it reaches the consumer. It can be caused by factors such as poor storage and transportation practices, as well as market inefficiencies.
- Consumer food waste: This type of food waste occurs at the consumer level, and can be caused by factors such as overproduction, overconsumption, and improper storage and handling.

#### Amount of Food Waste

The amount of food waste generated is a significant concern, both globally and in Cartagena. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), an estimated one-third of all food produced globally is wasted. In Cartagena, this amounts to a significant loss of resources and has severe implications for the environment, economy, and society.

#### Environmental Impacts of Food Waste

Food waste has a significant impact on the environment. The disposal of food waste in landfills contributes to the generation of greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. In addition, food waste can also lead to pollution of water and soil, as well as the depletion of natural resources.

#### Economic Implications of Food Waste

Food waste also has significant economic implications. The cost of food waste to the city of Cartagena is estimated to be millions of dollars each year. This includes the cost of producing, distributing, and disposing of food that is ultimately wasted. In addition, food waste can also have a negative impact on the economy by reducing the availability of food for consumption and increasing food prices.

#### Social and Cultural Factors Contributing to Food Waste

Food waste is also influenced by social and cultural factors. In many cultures, certain foods are associated with status and wealth, leading to overproduction and waste. In addition, cultural norms surrounding food storage and handling can also contribute to food waste.

#### Solutions and Actions for Addressing Food Waste

Addressing food waste requires a multi-faceted approach that includes policy changes, technological advancements, and community-based initiatives. This can include implementing food waste reduction strategies, improving food storage and handling practices, and promoting sustainable food consumption behaviors.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of food sustainability and its role in addressing food waste.





### Subsection: 8.1b Impact of Food Waste on Sustainability

Food waste has a significant impact on sustainability, both in terms of environmental and economic sustainability. The environmental impact of food waste is particularly concerning, as it contributes to the depletion of natural resources and the generation of greenhouse gases.

#### Environmental Impact of Food Waste

The environmental impact of food waste is multifaceted. The production of food involves the use of various resources, including land, water, and energy. When food is wasted, these resources are also wasted, leading to inefficiencies in resource use. For example, the production of food in Australia alone results in the use of 1.5 million hectares of land and 12 billion liters of water each year. This is a significant amount of resources that are wasted when food is not consumed.

In addition to resource waste, food waste also contributes to the generation of greenhouse gases. As food waste decomposes in landfills, it produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. In Australia, it is estimated that food waste in landfills generates 7.6 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> each year. This contributes to the overall carbon footprint of the country and exacerbates the effects of climate change.

#### Economic Impact of Food Waste

The economic impact of food waste is also significant. The cost of producing food is substantial, and when food is wasted, this cost is also wasted. In Australia, the Australian economy loses $20 billion each year due to food waste. This is a significant amount of money that could be used for other purposes.

Moreover, food waste also has a ripple effect on the economy. For example, the loss of food can lead to shortages in the market, driving up prices for consumers. This can have a cascading effect on the economy, particularly in developing countries where food security is a major concern.

#### Sustainability and Food Waste

The issue of food waste is a critical one for sustainability. As the world's population continues to grow, the need for food will only increase. However, if food is wasted at the current rate, it will become increasingly difficult to meet this growing demand. This is why it is crucial to address food waste and find ways to reduce it.

In the next section, we will explore some of the strategies and initiatives that can be used to reduce food waste and promote sustainability.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, food waste is a significant challenge that cities in the Global South face. It not only contributes to environmental degradation but also poses a threat to food security and economic stability. The issue of food waste is complex and multifaceted, requiring a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes and provides sustainable solutions.

## Chapter: Chapter 9: Urban Agriculture and Food Security

### Introduction

The city of Cartagena, like many other urban centers in the Global South, faces a unique set of challenges when it comes to feeding its growing population. The rapid urbanization and increasing population density have put immense pressure on the city's food supply system, leading to issues of food security and sustainability. This chapter, "Urban Agriculture and Food Security," delves into these challenges and explores potential solutions through the lens of urban agriculture.

Urban agriculture, the practice of cultivating crops and raising animals within the city limits, has gained significant attention in recent years as a potential solution to the food security issues faced by urban centers. It not only provides a source of fresh produce for urban dwellers but also creates employment opportunities and helps to reduce food costs. Furthermore, urban agriculture can contribute to the sustainability of food systems by reducing the environmental impact of food production and distribution.

However, the implementation of urban agriculture in Cartagena, like many other cities, is not without its challenges. Limited land availability, regulatory barriers, and the need for technical knowledge and resources are some of the obstacles that need to be addressed. This chapter will explore these challenges and propose strategies to overcome them.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the concept of urban agriculture, its potential benefits and challenges, and the role it can play in addressing food security in Cartagena. We will also examine case studies and best practices from other cities in the Global South to provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic. By the end of this chapter, readers should have a better understanding of the role of urban agriculture in feeding cities in the Global South and the opportunities it presents for action.




### Subsection: 8.2a Importance of Reducing Food Waste

Food waste is a pressing issue that affects not only the environment but also the economy and society as a whole. In this section, we will explore the importance of reducing food waste and how it can contribute to a more sustainable future.

#### Environmental Impact

Food waste has a significant environmental impact, particularly in terms of resource utilization and waste generation. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), food waste accounts for approximately one-third of all food produced globally. This not only results in the loss of valuable resources such as land, water, and energy, but also contributes to the generation of greenhouse gases. In fact, it is estimated that food waste is responsible for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, making it a major contributor to climate change.

Moreover, food waste that ends up in landfills can also have detrimental effects on the environment. As food decomposes, it produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. In addition, the disposal of food waste in landfills can also lead to pollution of soil and water, as well as the loss of valuable nutrients that could have been used for fertilizer.

#### Economic Impact

Food waste also has a significant economic impact. In Australia, for example, it is estimated that the country loses $20 billion each year due to food waste. This not only represents a loss of resources, but also a loss of potential economic opportunities. By reducing food waste, we can not only save resources, but also create new economic opportunities, such as in the development of new technologies and industries.

#### Social Impact

Food waste also has a social impact, particularly in developing countries where food insecurity is a major issue. In these countries, food waste can exacerbate food insecurity by taking away resources that could be used to feed those in need. In addition, food waste can also contribute to social inequalities, as those who are already struggling to access food are disproportionately affected by food waste.

#### Sustainability

Reducing food waste is crucial for achieving sustainability goals. By reducing food waste, we can not only reduce our environmental impact, but also create a more resilient and equitable food system. This is especially important in the context of the Global South, where the challenges of feeding a growing population are compounded by issues such as climate change and social inequalities.

In conclusion, reducing food waste is not only important for the environment, but also for the economy and society. By implementing strategies to reduce food waste, we can create a more sustainable future for all. In the next section, we will explore some of these strategies and how they can be applied in the context of Cartagena, Colombia.





### Subsection: 8.2b Techniques for Reducing Food Waste

In the previous section, we discussed the importance of reducing food waste and its impact on the environment, economy, and society. In this section, we will explore some techniques that can be used to reduce food waste.

#### Source Reduction

One of the most effective ways to reduce food waste is through source reduction. This involves reducing the amount of food that is generated and potentially wasted. At an individual level, food waste results from choices made during the planning, shopping, storing, preparing, cooking, eating, and discarding of food. By making small changes, such as creating shopping lists, buying smaller amounts of produce more frequently, and learning about food labels, individuals can significantly reduce food waste at the household level.

Source reduction is also advocated at all stages of the food supply chain. This can be achieved through prevention and valorisation pathways for human consumption, such as food donations, or upcycling and re-processing into new food products. By recovering food resources for human consumption or preventing waste generation, the food potential can be increased. This can support sustainable food systems and contribute to food security.

#### Food Rescue

Food rescue is another important technique for reducing food waste. This involves rescuing food that would otherwise go to a landfill and redirecting it to those in need. The United States Environmental Protection Agency recommends actions such as feeding hungry people, feeding animals, industrial use, and composting, all of which are preferred to the least desirable options, incineration and landfill.

#### Food Waste Tracking and Monitoring

Tracking and monitoring food waste can also be an effective technique for reducing food waste. By tracking where and how food is wasted, organizations and individuals can identify areas for improvement and implement targeted strategies to reduce food waste. This can include implementing food waste tracking systems, conducting food waste audits, and using food waste tracking software.

#### Education and Awareness

Education and awareness are also crucial for reducing food waste. By raising awareness about the impact of food waste and educating individuals and organizations about food waste reduction techniques, we can create a culture of food waste reduction. This can include educating individuals about food labels and expiration dates, as well as promoting food waste reduction initiatives in schools and workplaces.

In conclusion, reducing food waste is crucial for creating sustainable food systems and addressing food insecurity. By implementing techniques such as source reduction, food rescue, food waste tracking and monitoring, and education and awareness, we can significantly reduce food waste and create a more sustainable future.





### Subsection: 8.2c Case Studies of Successful Food Waste Reduction

In this section, we will explore some case studies of successful food waste reduction initiatives. These examples will provide real-world insights into how organizations and individuals have successfully implemented strategies to reduce food waste.

#### Case Study 1: Food Waste Reduction at MIT

At MIT, the Department of Food Services has implemented a comprehensive food waste reduction program. This program includes source reduction strategies, such as creating shopping lists and buying smaller amounts of produce more frequently. They have also implemented a food rescue program, where excess food is donated to local food banks. Additionally, MIT has implemented a food waste tracking and monitoring system, which allows them to identify areas for improvement and track their progress in reducing food waste.

#### Case Study 2: Food Waste Reduction at Whole Foods

Whole Foods, a popular grocery store chain, has implemented a food waste reduction program that focuses on source reduction and food rescue. They have implemented a "zero waste" policy, where all food waste is composted or donated to local food banks. They have also implemented a food waste tracking and monitoring system, which allows them to identify areas for improvement and track their progress in reducing food waste.

#### Case Study 3: Food Waste Reduction at the City of San Francisco

The City of San Francisco has implemented a comprehensive food waste reduction program, which includes source reduction strategies, food rescue, and food waste tracking and monitoring. They have also implemented a mandatory food waste recycling program, where all food waste is composted or donated to local food banks. This program has resulted in a significant reduction in food waste and has also helped to improve food security in the city.

These case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of implementing a combination of strategies to reduce food waste. By focusing on source reduction, food rescue, and tracking and monitoring food waste, organizations and individuals can significantly reduce their food waste and contribute to a more sustainable future. 





### Subsection: 8.3a Understanding the Link Between Food Waste and Food Security

Food waste and food security are closely intertwined, with food waste having a significant impact on food security. Food waste refers to the loss or disposal of food that is safe and nutritious for consumption. This can occur at any stage of the food supply chain, from production to consumption. Food security, on the other hand, refers to the availability, access, and utilization of food. It is a complex issue that is influenced by various factors, including food waste.

The link between food waste and food security is complex and multifaceted. On one hand, food waste can contribute to food insecurity by reducing the availability of food. When food is wasted, it is not available for consumption, which can lead to food shortages and increased food prices. This can have a significant impact on food security, especially for vulnerable populations who may already struggle to access affordable and nutritious food.

On the other hand, food waste can also have a positive impact on food security. By reducing food waste, we can increase the availability of food for consumption. This can help to alleviate food shortages and reduce food prices, making food more accessible to vulnerable populations. Additionally, by reducing food waste, we can also improve the nutritional value of the food that is available for consumption. This is because food waste often includes highly perishable and nutrient-rich foods, which are discarded before they can be consumed. By reducing food waste, we can ensure that these nutrients are not wasted and are instead consumed by individuals.

The relationship between food waste and food security is further complicated by the fact that food waste can have both positive and negative impacts on the different dimensions of food security. For example, reducing food waste can improve food availability, which is a key dimension of food security. However, it can also have negative impacts on food access and utilization. For instance, implementing food waste reduction strategies may require additional resources, such as labor or machinery, which can increase costs and make food less accessible to vulnerable populations. Additionally, by reducing food waste, we may also be reducing the amount of food that is available for consumption, which can have negative impacts on food utilization.

In conclusion, understanding the link between food waste and food security is crucial for addressing food insecurity in the Global South. By reducing food waste, we can improve food security, but it is important to consider the potential trade-offs and impacts on different dimensions of food security. This highlights the need for a comprehensive and holistic approach to addressing food waste and food security in the Global South.





### Subsection: 8.3b Role of Food Waste Reduction in Enhancing Food Security

Food waste reduction plays a crucial role in enhancing food security in the Global South. As mentioned in the previous section, food waste can have both positive and negative impacts on the different dimensions of food security. By reducing food waste, we can address the negative impacts and enhance the positive impacts, leading to improved food security.

One of the key ways in which food waste reduction enhances food security is by increasing the availability of food. By reducing food waste, we can ensure that more food is available for consumption. This can help to alleviate food shortages and reduce food prices, making food more accessible to vulnerable populations. Additionally, by reducing food waste, we can also improve the nutritional value of the food that is available for consumption. This is because food waste often includes highly perishable and nutrient-rich foods, which are discarded before they can be consumed. By reducing food waste, we can ensure that these nutrients are not wasted and are instead consumed by individuals.

Food waste reduction also plays a crucial role in enhancing the sustainability of food systems. As mentioned in the previous section, sustainable food systems are essential for addressing the challenges of food security in the Global South. By reducing food waste, we can help to ensure that food systems are sustainable in the long term. This is because food waste contributes to environmental degradation and resource depletion, which can have long-term impacts on food security. By reducing food waste, we can help to mitigate these impacts and ensure that food systems are sustainable in the long term.

In addition to its role in enhancing food security and sustainability, food waste reduction also has economic benefits. By reducing food waste, we can help to reduce food prices, making food more affordable for vulnerable populations. This can have a significant impact on food security, especially for those who are already struggling to access affordable and nutritious food. Additionally, by reducing food waste, we can also help to reduce the economic costs associated with food waste. This includes the costs of production, transportation, and disposal of food waste. By reducing food waste, we can help to reduce these costs and improve the overall economic efficiency of food systems.

In conclusion, food waste reduction plays a crucial role in enhancing food security in the Global South. By reducing food waste, we can address the negative impacts of food waste on food security and enhance the positive impacts. This can help to create more sustainable and resilient food systems that are better equipped to address the challenges of food security in the Global South.

We have also discussed the challenges faced by the city in terms of food security and nutrition. In this chapter, we will delve into the realm of food policy and governance, which plays a crucial role in addressing these challenges.

Food policy and governance refer to the systems and processes by which decisions are made and implemented regarding food production, distribution, and consumption. These systems are influenced by a variety of factors, including government policies, market forces, social norms, and cultural values. The goal of food policy and governance is to ensure that everyone has access to safe, nutritious, and affordable food.

In the context of Cartagena, food policy and governance are particularly important due to the city's unique characteristics. As a rapidly growing urban center in the Global South, Cartagena faces a complex set of challenges related to food systems. These include issues of food availability, access, and quality, as well as the need to balance economic development with environmental sustainability.

In this chapter, we will explore the current state of food policy and governance in Cartagena, including the key actors and institutions involved. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities that exist in this area, and how they can be addressed through action. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the role of food policy and governance in feeding cities in the Global South, and how it can be leveraged to create more sustainable and equitable food systems.




### Section: 9.1 Understanding Food Policy:

Food policy and governance are crucial components of any functioning society. They determine the availability, accessibility, and quality of food for all members of the community. In this section, we will explore the basics of food policy, including its definition, key principles, and the role of stakeholders in shaping it.

#### 9.1a Basics of Food Policy

Food policy refers to the set of decisions, plans, and actions that are implemented to ensure the availability, accessibility, and quality of food for all members of the community. It encompasses a wide range of issues, including food production, distribution, consumption, and waste. The goal of food policy is to create a food system that is sustainable, equitable, and resilient to shocks and stresses.

The principles that guide food policy are rooted in the concept of food sovereignty, which emphasizes the right of peoples to define their own food systems. This principle recognizes the importance of local knowledge, traditions, and cultures in shaping food policies. It also emphasizes the need for food systems to be based on principles of social justice, equity, and sustainability.

Stakeholders play a crucial role in shaping food policy. These include government agencies, non-governmental organizations, food producers, consumers, and other actors who have a stake in the food system. The involvement of these stakeholders is essential for ensuring that food policies are inclusive, equitable, and effective.

In the context of Cartagena, food policy and governance are particularly important due to the city's unique characteristics. As a rapidly growing urban center in the Global South, Cartagena faces a complex set of challenges related to food systems. These include issues of food availability, access, and quality, as well as the need to balance economic development with environmental sustainability.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the specific aspects of food policy and governance, including food security, food safety, and the role of markets and trade. We will also explore the challenges and opportunities that exist in these areas, and how they can be addressed through action. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the role of food policy and governance in feeding cities in the Global South, and how it can be leveraged to create more sustainable and equitable food systems.

#### 9.1b Key Principles of Food Policy

The principles that guide food policy are rooted in the concept of food sovereignty, which emphasizes the right of peoples to define their own food systems. This principle recognizes the importance of local knowledge, traditions, and cultures in shaping food policies. It also emphasizes the need for food systems to be based on principles of social justice, equity, and sustainability.

One of the key principles of food policy is the right to food. This principle recognizes that everyone has the right to access safe, nutritious, and culturally appropriate food. It also acknowledges the importance of food security, which refers to the availability, accessibility, and quality of food for all members of the community.

Another important principle is the right to food sovereignty. This principle recognizes the right of peoples to define their own food systems, and to have a say in the decisions that affect their food and agriculture. It also emphasizes the importance of local knowledge, traditions, and cultures in shaping food policies.

The principle of food sovereignty is closely linked to the concept of agroecology. Agroecology is a form of agriculture that is based on principles of ecology, sustainability, and social justice. It aims to create food systems that are resilient to shocks and stresses, and that promote the well-being of all members of the community.

In addition to these principles, food policy also needs to be guided by the principles of social justice, equity, and sustainability. This means that food policies should aim to address issues of inequality and discrimination in the food system, and to promote sustainable practices that protect the environment and public health.

Overall, the principles of food policy are rooted in the concept of food sovereignty, which recognizes the importance of local knowledge, traditions, and cultures in shaping food systems. By upholding these principles, we can create food policies that are inclusive, equitable, and effective in addressing the challenges and opportunities of feeding cities in the Global South.

#### 9.1c Challenges in Food Policy

Despite the principles and goals of food policy, there are several challenges that hinder the effective implementation of food policies. These challenges can be broadly categorized into three areas: institutional, socio-economic, and environmental.

Institutionally, there are often gaps between policy and practice. This can be due to a lack of capacity, resources, or political will. For example, in many developing countries, there may be a lack of effective policies or regulations to ensure food safety and quality. This can be due to weak institutional structures, corruption, or a lack of technical expertise.

Socio-economically, there are often barriers to accessing food. This can be due to poverty, unemployment, or social exclusion. For example, in urban areas, marginalized communities may face difficulties in accessing affordable and nutritious food. This can be due to factors such as high food prices, lack of transportation, or discrimination.

Environmentally, there are challenges related to climate change, natural disasters, and resource depletion. These can have a significant impact on food production and availability. For example, climate change can lead to changes in weather patterns, affecting crop yields and food security. Natural disasters, such as floods or droughts, can also disrupt food systems and exacerbate food insecurity. Resource depletion, such as water scarcity or soil degradation, can also impact food production and availability.

In addition to these challenges, there are also ongoing debates about the role of markets and trade in food policy. Some argue that markets and trade can help to increase food availability and reduce prices, while others argue that they can exacerbate inequalities and contribute to food insecurity.

Overall, addressing these challenges requires a holistic and integrated approach that takes into account the complex interactions between different aspects of food policy. This includes not only policies and regulations, but also capacity building, community engagement, and sustainable practices. By addressing these challenges, we can work towards creating more resilient and equitable food systems in the Global South.

#### 9.2c Case Studies of Food Governance

In this section, we will delve into specific case studies that highlight the role of governance in food security. These case studies will provide a more concrete understanding of the concepts discussed in the previous sections.

##### Case Study 1: The United States' Food Desert Initiative

The United States has been at the forefront of addressing food deserts, areas where residents have limited access to affordable and nutritious food options. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has been instrumental in this effort, releasing a comprehensive report to Congress in 2009 that proposed solutions to address access issues in food deserts.

One of the proposed solutions was the use of transportation initiatives. The USDA suggested that where growing vehicle availability is insufficient, better public transportation in rural food deserts or promoting safe walking and biking environments in urban areas may help. This proposal highlights the role of governance in ensuring food access by addressing transportation barriers.

Another proposed solution was incentivizing supermarket and grocery store numbers. State and local governments have implemented public-private partnerships that use a combination of financing initiatives and community-level interventions to target areas with lower healthy food access. This case study underscores the importance of governance in creating an enabling environment for food retailers to operate in food-insecure areas.

##### Case Study 2: University-Led Initiatives in Philadelphia

In Philadelphia, universities have coordinated with local business and community leaders to solve food scarcity issues. In 2008, La Salle University and The Fresh Grocer teamed up to open a grocery store in Germantown, a neighborhood that had been plagued with a decades-long food desert. This collaboration not only provided healthy food options to the community but also created job opportunities.

This case study illustrates the role of governance in food security by highlighting the importance of collaboration between different stakeholders. It also underscores the potential of universities as drivers of food security initiatives.

##### Case Study 3: The Healthy Food Financing Initiative

In early 2010, the Obama administration unveiled the Healthy Food Financing Initiative, a federal program that aims to increase access to healthy food in underserved communities. The initiative provides funding for supermarkets and grocery stores in food deserts, demonstrating the role of governance in addressing food insecurity.

These case studies provide valuable insights into the role of governance in food security. They highlight the importance of policy and collaboration in ensuring food availability, access, and utilization. They also underscore the potential of different stakeholders, including universities and the federal government, in addressing food insecurity.

2. **Reducing Malnutrition**: Policy interventions can also be used to reduce malnutrition. This could involve implementing policies that provide nutritional support to vulnerable groups, or promoting educational campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of a balanced diet.

3. **Improving Food Safety**: Policy interventions can also be used to improve food safety. This could involve implementing policies that ensure the safety and quality of food products, or promoting educational campaigns to raise awareness about food safety practices.

In conclusion, policy interventions play a crucial role in addressing food security challenges in the Global South. By implementing a combination of supply-side and demand-side interventions, cities like Cartagena can work towards improving food security for all residents.

#### 9.3c Case Studies of Policy Interventions

In this section, we will explore some case studies of policy interventions for food security in the Global South. These case studies will provide practical examples of how different types of policy interventions can be implemented and their impact on food security.

##### Case Study 1: Supply-Side Intervention in India

In India, the government has implemented a supply-side intervention known as the Public Distribution System (PDS). The PDS is a system of food subsidies that aims to ensure affordable food for all residents. The system operates through a network of fair price shops, where residents can purchase subsidized food items at a discounted price. The PDS has been successful in increasing food availability and reducing food insecurity in India. However, it has also faced criticism for its inefficiencies and corruption.

##### Case Study 2: Demand-Side Intervention in Brazil

In Brazil, the government has implemented a demand-side intervention known as the Bolsa Familia program. The program provides cash transfers to poor families, conditional on their children attending school and receiving regular health check-ups. The program has been successful in improving food access and utilization among poor households in Brazil. It has also been associated with improvements in health and education outcomes.

##### Case Study 3: Mixed Intervention in South Africa

In South Africa, the government has implemented a mixed intervention known as the Comprehensive Agricultural Support Programme (CASP). The program aims to increase food production and reduce food insecurity through a combination of supply-side and demand-side interventions. It provides support to small-scale farmers, promotes sustainable farming practices, and also provides food vouchers to poor households. The program has been successful in improving food security in South Africa, but it has also faced challenges in terms of implementation and sustainability.

These case studies highlight the potential of policy interventions to address food security challenges in the Global South. However, they also underscore the importance of careful planning and implementation, as well as the need for ongoing monitoring and evaluation.

Developing effective policy interventions for food security in Cartagena requires a systematic approach that takes into account the local context, evidence-based decision-making, and stakeholder involvement. Here are some steps that can guide the process:

##### Step 1: Identify the Problem

The first step in developing any policy intervention is to clearly identify the problem. In the context of food security, this could involve conducting a thorough analysis of the food system, including production, distribution, and consumption. It is important to understand the root causes of food insecurity and the factors that contribute to it. This could involve conducting research, consulting experts, and engaging with local communities.

##### Step 2: Set Objectives and Strategies

Once the problem has been identified, the next step is to set clear objectives and strategies for the policy intervention. Objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). Strategies should be aligned with the objectives and should outline the steps that will be taken to achieve them. This could involve setting targets for food production, improving food distribution systems, or promoting healthy eating habits.

##### Step 3: Implement the Intervention

The next step is to implement the policy intervention. This involves putting the strategies into action and monitoring their progress. It is important to have a clear implementation plan, including timelines, resources, and responsibilities. Regular monitoring and evaluation are crucial to ensure that the intervention is on track and to make necessary adjustments.

##### Step 4: Evaluate the Intervention

After the intervention has been implemented, it is important to evaluate its effectiveness. This involves assessing whether the objectives have been met and whether the intervention has had the desired impact. It is also important to consider any unintended consequences or challenges that have arisen during the implementation process.

##### Step 5: Adapt and Improve the Intervention

Based on the evaluation, the policy intervention should be adapted and improved. This could involve making adjustments to the strategies, adding new ones, or implementing additional interventions. It is important to continue monitoring and evaluating the intervention to ensure that it remains effective and relevant.

By following these steps, policymakers can develop effective policy interventions for food security in Cartagena. It is important to involve all relevant stakeholders, including local communities, in the process to ensure that the interventions are context-specific and sustainable.

### Subsection: 10.1c Case Studies of Climate Change and Food Systems

Climate change is a global phenomenon that has far-reaching implications for food systems, particularly in the Global South. In this section, we will explore some case studies that highlight the impact of climate change on food systems in different regions of the Global South.

#### 10.1c.1 Climate Change and Food Systems in Sub-Saharan Africa

Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the regions most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The region is already experiencing changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and frequency of extreme weather events, which are affecting food production and security.

In Kenya, for example, climate change has led to changes in rainfall patterns, resulting in more frequent and severe droughts. This has had a significant impact on food production, particularly for small-scale farmers who rely on rain-fed agriculture. The increased frequency of droughts has also led to food insecurity, with many households experiencing periods of food shortage.

#### 10.1c.2 Climate Change and Food Systems in South Asia

South Asia is another region that is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The region is experiencing changes in temperature, with warmer temperatures leading to more frequent and severe heatwaves. This has had a significant impact on food production, particularly for crops that are sensitive to high temperatures.

In India, for example, climate change has led to a decrease in rice yields, which is a staple crop for many households. This has resulted in food insecurity, with many households experiencing periods of food shortage. Climate change has also led to changes in precipitation patterns, resulting in more frequent and severe floods, which have also affected food production and security.

#### 10.1c.3 Climate Change and Food Systems in Latin America

Latin America is also experiencing the impacts of climate change on food systems. The region is experiencing changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and frequency of extreme weather events, which are affecting food production and security.

In Mexico, for example, climate change has led to changes in precipitation patterns, resulting in more frequent and severe droughts. This has had a significant impact on food production, particularly for small-scale farmers who rely on rain-fed agriculture. The increased frequency of droughts has also led to food insecurity, with many households experiencing periods of food shortage.

These case studies highlight the diverse and complex ways in which climate change is impacting food systems in different regions of the Global South. They also underscore the need for action to address the challenges posed by climate change and to build more resilient food systems. In the following sections, we will explore the opportunities for action that exist to address these challenges.




### Subsection: 10.2a Understanding Climate Change Adaptation

Climate change adaptation is a crucial aspect of addressing the impacts of climate change on food systems. It involves adjusting to current or expected changes in climate and its effects, in order to minimize harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. Adaptation can occur in anticipation of change or be a response to those changes. For example, artificial snow-making in the European Alps responds to current climate trends, while the construction of the Confederation Bridge in Canada at a higher elevation takes into account the effect of future sea-level rise on ship clearance under the bridge.

Effective adaptive policy can be difficult to implement because policymakers are rewarded more for enacting short-term change, rather than long-term planning. Since the impacts of climate change are generally not seen in the short term, policymakers have less incentive to act. Furthermore, climate change is occurring on a global scale. This requires a global framework for adapting to and combating climate change. The vast majority of climate change adaptation and mitigation policies are being implemented on a more local scale. This is because different regions must adapt differently. National and global policies are often more challenging to enact.

#### 10.2a.1 Maladaptation

Much adaptation takes place in relation to short-term climate variability. But this may cause maladaptation to longer-term climate trends. The expansion of irrigation in Egypt into the Western Sinai desert after a period of higher river flows is maladaptation given the longer-term projections of drying in the region. Adaptations at one scale can have impacts at another by reducing the adaptive capacity of other people or organizations. This is often the case when broad assessments of the costs and benefits of adaptation are examined at smaller scales. An adaptation may benefit some people, but have a negative effect on others. Development interventions to increase adaptive capacity have tended not to result in increased power or agency for local people. Agency is a central factor in allowing people to adapt to climate change.

#### 10.2a.2 Climate Change Adaptation in Food Systems

Climate change adaptation in food systems is a complex and multifaceted issue. It involves adjusting to changes in temperature, precipitation, and other climate factors that affect food production, distribution, and consumption. Adaptation strategies can include changes in agricultural practices, food storage and distribution systems, and consumer behavior.

For example, in response to increased temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns, farmers may need to switch to more drought-resistant crop varieties or implement irrigation systems. Food storage and distribution systems may need to be adapted to handle increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts. Consumer behavior can also play a role in adaptation, as individuals may need to adjust their food preferences and consumption patterns in response to changes in food availability and prices.

#### 10.2a.3 Challenges and Opportunities for Climate Change Adaptation in Food Systems

Despite the challenges, there are also opportunities for climate change adaptation in food systems. For instance, the development and adoption of climate-resilient agricultural practices can help to reduce the impacts of climate change on food production. Similarly, the implementation of climate-smart food storage and distribution systems can help to ensure food security in the face of climate change.

Furthermore, the transition to more sustainable and equitable food systems can also contribute to climate change adaptation. This includes reducing food waste, promoting sustainable diets, and supporting small-scale farmers and food producers. These actions can not only help to mitigate the impacts of climate change on food systems, but also contribute to broader goals of food security, nutrition, and social equity.

In conclusion, climate change adaptation is a crucial aspect of addressing the impacts of climate change on food systems. It involves adjusting to current or expected changes in climate and its effects, in order to minimize harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. While there are challenges, there are also opportunities for adaptation, particularly in the context of sustainable and equitable food systems.




### Subsection: 10.2b Role of Adaptation in Food Systems

Climate change adaptation plays a crucial role in food systems, particularly in the Global South where the impacts of climate change are often felt more severely. The role of adaptation in food systems is multifaceted and involves a range of strategies and approaches.

#### 10.2b.1 Adaptation Strategies

Adaptation strategies in food systems can be broadly categorized into two types: proactive and reactive. Proactive adaptation involves anticipating and preparing for future changes in climate, while reactive adaptation responds to current or recent changes. Both types of adaptation are necessary and can be used in conjunction to effectively manage food systems in the face of climate change.

Proactive adaptation strategies include:

- Diversification of crop varieties: As seen in the case of the Great Famine of Ireland, relying on a narrow portfolio of crops or crop varieties can be detrimental to food production systems. Diversifying crop varieties can help to mitigate the impacts of climate change by reducing the risk of crop failure due to pests, diseases, or extreme weather events.

- Integrated pest management: Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of pests and diseases, which can have a significant impact on food production. Integrated pest management (IPM) is a proactive approach that combines various pest control methods to minimize the use of pesticides and reduce the risk of pest resistance.

- Climate-resilient agriculture: Climate-resilient agriculture involves the use of climate-smart practices that can help to reduce the vulnerability of food systems to climate change. This can include the use of drought-resistant crop varieties, improved irrigation practices, and the implementation of agroforestry systems.

Reactive adaptation strategies include:

- Post-disaster recovery: In the event of a climate-related disaster, such as a flood or drought, reactive adaptation involves the efforts to recover and rebuild the food system. This can include emergency food aid, crop replanting, and infrastructure repair.

- Climate risk management: Climate risk management involves the use of various tools and strategies to assess and manage the risks posed by climate change to food systems. This can include climate risk assessments, early warning systems, and disaster risk reduction strategies.

#### 10.2b.2 Role of Adaptation in Food Systems

The role of adaptation in food systems is to ensure the sustainability and resilience of food production systems in the face of climate change. By implementing adaptation strategies, we can help to reduce the impacts of climate change on food systems and ensure food security for communities in the Global South.

However, it is important to note that adaptation is not a panacea. It is just one part of the broader climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. Other strategies, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable food consumption and production practices, are also crucial for addressing the impacts of climate change on food systems.

In conclusion, adaptation plays a vital role in food systems, particularly in the Global South. By implementing a range of adaptation strategies, we can help to ensure the sustainability and resilience of food systems in the face of climate change.

### Subsection: 12.1a Basics of Poverty

Poverty is a complex issue that affects millions of people around the world, particularly in the Global South. It is a state of being without sufficient access to the goods, services, and opportunities necessary for a decent standard of living. In this section, we will explore the basics of poverty, including its definition, causes, and impacts.

#### 12.1a.1 Definition of Poverty

Poverty is a multidimensional concept that encompasses more than just income levels. It is a complex social, economic, and political condition characterized by a lack of basic human needs, opportunities, and choices. The United Nations defines poverty as "a state of extreme social, economic and political exclusion of individuals, groups and communities, as well as a violation of their human rights." This definition highlights the multifaceted nature of poverty and emphasizes the importance of addressing not just material deprivation, but also social and political exclusion.

#### 12.1a.2 Causes of Poverty

Poverty is caused by a variety of factors, both structural and individual. Structural causes of poverty include unequal power dynamics, discrimination, and systemic barriers to opportunity. For example, in the United States, Rank, Yoon, and Hirschl (2003) argue that poverty is a result of "failings at the structural level," including a saturated labor market that offers low-paying, part-time jobs with no benefits. This structural failure contributes to the inability of many families to earn enough to keep them above the poverty line.

Individual causes of poverty include personal choices and behaviors, such as substance abuse, criminal activity, and poor decision-making. However, these individual factors are often influenced by structural factors, such as limited educational opportunities and economic disparities. For instance, a person may choose to engage in criminal activity due to limited job opportunities and the allure of quick money.

#### 12.1a.3 Impacts of Poverty

Poverty has far-reaching impacts on individuals, families, and communities. It is associated with a range of negative outcomes, including poor health, low educational attainment, and increased risk of social exclusion and discrimination. Poverty also has significant implications for food security, as it limits access to nutritious food and increases the risk of food insecurity.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the relationship between poverty and food security, exploring the challenges and opportunities for addressing food insecurity in the context of poverty.




#### 12.1b Role of Poverty in Food Security

Poverty plays a significant role in food security, particularly in the Global South. Food security is defined by the United Nations as the condition in which all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food. Poverty, on the other hand, is a state of being without sufficient access to the goods, services, and opportunities necessary for a decent standard of living. Therefore, poverty is a key determinant of food security.

#### 12.1b.1 Poverty and Hunger

Hunger is a direct consequence of poverty. According to the World Health Organization, hunger is a major public health issue that affects 690 million people worldwide. The majority of these people live in developing countries, where poverty is a significant factor contributing to hunger. Poverty limits people's ability to access food, as it often means they cannot afford to buy enough food to meet their nutritional needs. This is particularly true in urban areas, where the cost of living is often higher and the competition for resources is greater.

#### 12.1b.2 Poverty and Nutrition

Poverty also has a significant impact on nutrition. Malnutrition, which is a result of inadequate nutrition, is a major health issue among the poor. According to the World Health Organization, malnutrition is a key factor in the deaths of nearly 3 million children under the age of five each year. Poverty limits people's ability to access a diverse and nutritious diet, which is essential for good health. This is particularly true for women and children, who are often the most vulnerable members of a household.

#### 12.1b.3 Poverty and Agriculture

Poverty also affects agriculture, which is a key source of food and income for many people in the Global South. Poverty often means that small-scale farmers, who make up the majority of the rural poor, lack access to the necessary resources and technologies to increase their agricultural productivity. This limits their ability to grow enough food to meet their own needs, let alone to sell surplus produce for income. As a result, these farmers and their families often go hungry.

In conclusion, poverty plays a crucial role in food security. Addressing poverty is therefore a key step towards achieving food security in the Global South. This requires a multifaceted approach that includes improving agricultural productivity, increasing access to food, and addressing the social and economic exclusion that often accompanies poverty.

#### 12.1c Strategies to Reduce Poverty

Reducing poverty is a complex task that requires a multifaceted approach. In this section, we will explore some strategies that can be used to reduce poverty, particularly in the context of food security.

##### 12.1c.1 Improving Agricultural Productivity

As we have seen, poverty often limits people's ability to access a diverse and nutritious diet. This is particularly true for small-scale farmers in the Global South, who often lack access to the necessary resources and technologies to increase their agricultural productivity. Improving agricultural productivity can therefore be an effective strategy for reducing poverty and improving food security.

This can be achieved through various means, including:

- Increasing access to pro-poor technologies: As mentioned in the related context, improvements in agricultural productivity aimed at small-scale farmers will benefit the rural poor first. This can be achieved by increasing access to pro-poor technologies, which are designed to meet the specific needs and constraints of poor farmers.

- Investing in irrigation: According to the Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture, managing rainwater and soil moisture more effectively, and using supplemental and small-scale irrigation, hold the key to helping the greatest number of poor people. This can be achieved through targeted investments in irrigation infrastructure.

- Expanding cropped areas: Increasing the area under cultivation can also increase agricultural productivity. This can be achieved by providing poor farmers with access to land and resources.

##### 12.1c.2 Increasing Access to Food

In addition to improving agricultural productivity, increasing access to food is another key strategy for reducing poverty. This can be achieved through various means, including:

- Implementing food safety net programs: Food safety net programs, such as food stamps or food vouchers, can provide poor households with access to food. These programs can be particularly effective in urban areas, where the cost of living is often higher and the competition for resources is greater.

- Promoting social protection: Social protection measures, such as cash transfers or public works programs, can provide poor households with a regular income, which can be used to purchase food. These measures can also help to reduce the vulnerability of poor households to shocks, such as illness or natural disasters.

##### 12.1c.3 Addressing Social and Economic Exclusion

Finally, reducing poverty also requires addressing the social and economic exclusion that often accompanies poverty. This can be achieved by promoting social inclusion, which involves ensuring that poor people have equal access to resources, opportunities, and services. This can be achieved through various means, including:

- Promoting inclusive education: Education is a key tool for reducing poverty. However, poor children often face barriers to education, such as lack of access to schools or resources. Promoting inclusive education can help to ensure that all children, regardless of their socio-economic status, have equal access to education.

- Promoting inclusive employment: Poor people often face barriers to employment, such as lack of skills or discrimination. Promoting inclusive employment can help to ensure that poor people have equal opportunities to participate in the labor market.

In conclusion, reducing poverty is a complex task that requires a multifaceted approach. By improving agricultural productivity, increasing access to food, and addressing social and economic exclusion, we can work towards reducing poverty and improving food security in the Global South.




#### 12.1c Case Studies of Poverty and Food Security

To further understand the impact of poverty on food security, let's examine some case studies from the Global South.

#### 12.1c.1 Poverty and Food Security in Cartagena, Colombia

Cartagena, a major port city in Colombia, has a population of over 1.2 million people. The city is home to a diverse population, with a significant number of poor and vulnerable populations. According to the World Bank, over 30% of the population lives in poverty, with over 10% living in extreme poverty.

The city's food security is heavily dependent on its agricultural sector, which is primarily focused on the production of bananas, coffee, and shrimp. However, the city's food security is threatened by various factors, including climate change, economic instability, and social inequality.

Climate change has led to changes in weather patterns, resulting in more frequent and severe droughts and floods. These events have a direct impact on the city's agricultural sector, leading to food shortages and price increases. Economic instability, due to factors such as the global economic crisis and the Colombian conflict, has also contributed to food insecurity in the city. The high cost of living and the limited access to affordable food options have made it difficult for the city's poor and vulnerable populations to access adequate food.

#### 12.1c.2 Poverty and Food Security in Nairobi, Kenya

Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, is home to over 4 million people. The city has a diverse population, with a significant number of poor and vulnerable populations. According to the World Bank, over 40% of the population lives in poverty, with over 20% living in extreme poverty.

The city's food security is heavily dependent on its agricultural sector, which is primarily focused on the production of maize, beans, and milk. However, the city's food security is threatened by various factors, including climate change, economic instability, and social inequality.

Climate change has led to changes in weather patterns, resulting in more frequent and severe droughts and floods. These events have a direct impact on the city's agricultural sector, leading to food shortages and price increases. Economic instability, due to factors such as the global economic crisis and the Kenyan conflict, has also contributed to food insecurity in the city. The high cost of living and the limited access to affordable food options have made it difficult for the city's poor and vulnerable populations to access adequate food.

#### 12.1c.3 Poverty and Food Security in Dhaka, Bangladesh

Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, is home to over 18 million people. The city has a diverse population, with a significant number of poor and vulnerable populations. According to the World Bank, over 50% of the population lives in poverty, with over 25% living in extreme poverty.

The city's food security is heavily dependent on its agricultural sector, which is primarily focused on the production of rice, vegetables, and fish. However, the city's food security is threatened by various factors, including climate change, economic instability, and social inequality.

Climate change has led to changes in weather patterns, resulting in more frequent and severe floods and droughts. These events have a direct impact on the city's agricultural sector, leading to food shortages and price increases. Economic instability, due to factors such as the global economic crisis and the Bangladeshi conflict, has also contributed to food insecurity in the city. The high cost of living and the limited access to affordable food options have made it difficult for the city's poor and vulnerable populations to access adequate food.




#### 12.2a Understanding Poverty Reduction Strategies

Poverty reduction strategies are comprehensive plans developed by governments and international organizations to address the root causes of poverty and promote sustainable development. These strategies are designed to address the complex interplay between poverty, food security, and other social, economic, and environmental factors. They aim to create an enabling environment for poverty reduction by promoting economic growth, social inclusion, and good governance.

Poverty reduction strategies are typically developed through a participatory process that involves the active participation of the poor and vulnerable populations. This ensures that the strategies are responsive to the needs and aspirations of the people and promotes community ownership. The strategies are then implemented through a range of interventions, including policy reforms, public expenditures, and community-based programs.

The effectiveness of poverty reduction strategies is often evaluated based on their impact on poverty, food security, and other development outcomes. This involves monitoring and assessing the progress made towards the strategy's objectives and identifying areas for improvement. Lessons learned from these evaluations are used to inform the development of future strategies and policies.

#### 12.2b Poverty Reduction Strategies and Food Security

Food security is a key component of poverty reduction strategies. It is defined as the condition in which all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food. Poverty reduction strategies aim to improve food security by addressing the underlying causes of food insecurity, including poverty, lack of access to productive resources, and vulnerability to shocks and stresses.

Poverty reduction strategies also aim to promote sustainable food systems that are resilient to shocks and stresses. This involves promoting sustainable agricultural practices, diversifying food production systems, and improving market access for small-scale producers. It also involves strengthening social protection systems to ensure that the poor and vulnerable populations have access to adequate food and nutrition.

#### 12.2c Case Studies of Poverty Reduction Strategies

To further understand the role of poverty reduction strategies in promoting food security, let's examine some case studies from the Global South.

##### 12.2c.1 Poverty Reduction Strategy in Honduras

In 1999, 66 percent of Hondurans were poor. The government, with the support of international organizations, developed a Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) to address the root causes of poverty. The strategy was developed through a participatory process that involved the active participation of the poor and vulnerable populations. It covered a range of areas, including education and literacy, diet and nutrition, and access to potable water. The strategy was implemented through a range of interventions, including policy reforms, public expenditures, and community-based programs.

The PRS has been effective in reducing poverty and improving food security in Honduras. By 2015, the poverty rate had been reduced from 66 percent to 40 percent. The strategy has also improved food security by promoting sustainable food systems and strengthening social protection systems. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, including the need for more effective policy implementation and the need to address the root causes of poverty and inequality.

##### 12.2c.2 Poverty Reduction Strategy in Cartagena, Colombia

In Cartagena, Colombia, the government has implemented a poverty reduction strategy to address the high levels of poverty and food insecurity in the city. The strategy aims to improve food security by promoting sustainable food systems and strengthening social protection systems. It also aims to address the root causes of poverty, including economic instability, social inequality, and climate change.

The strategy has been effective in improving food security in Cartagena. The city's food security has been strengthened through the promotion of sustainable agricultural practices, the diversification of food production systems, and the improvement of market access for small-scale producers. The strategy has also strengthened social protection systems to ensure that the poor and vulnerable populations have access to adequate food and nutrition. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, including the need for more effective policy implementation and the need to address the root causes of poverty and inequality.

#### 12.2d Challenges and Opportunities for Action in Poverty Reduction Strategies

Despite the successes achieved in poverty reduction strategies, there are still significant challenges to be addressed. These challenges include the need for more effective policy implementation, the need to address the root causes of poverty and inequality, and the need to ensure the sustainability of poverty reduction efforts.

There are also opportunities for action in poverty reduction strategies. These opportunities include the potential for technology and innovation to improve the effectiveness of poverty reduction efforts, the potential for partnerships and collaboration to scale up successful interventions, and the potential for learning and adaptation to improve the design and implementation of poverty reduction strategies.

In conclusion, poverty reduction strategies play a crucial role in promoting food security and sustainable development in the Global South. They provide a comprehensive framework for addressing the root causes of poverty and promoting sustainable development. However, there is still much work to be done to ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of these strategies.

#### 12.2d.1 Challenges in Poverty Reduction Strategies

One of the main challenges in poverty reduction strategies is the need for more effective policy implementation. Despite the development of comprehensive strategies, many of these strategies are not fully implemented due to a lack of resources, capacity, and political will. This limits their effectiveness in reducing poverty and improving food security.

Another challenge is the need to address the root causes of poverty and inequality. Poverty reduction strategies often focus on addressing the symptoms of poverty, such as food insecurity, rather than the underlying causes. This can limit their effectiveness in reducing poverty in the long term.

Finally, there is a need to ensure the sustainability of poverty reduction efforts. Many strategies are funded by external donors, which can limit their sustainability. There is a need to develop strategies that are financially sustainable and can be implemented without external support.

#### 12.2d.2 Opportunities in Poverty Reduction Strategies

Despite these challenges, there are also opportunities for action in poverty reduction strategies. One of these opportunities is the potential for technology and innovation to improve the effectiveness of poverty reduction efforts. For example, the use of mobile technology can be used to improve the delivery of social protection programs and promote financial inclusion.

Partnerships and collaboration also present opportunities for scaling up successful interventions. By working together, different stakeholders can share resources, knowledge, and expertise to implement poverty reduction strategies on a larger scale.

Finally, there is an opportunity for learning and adaptation in poverty reduction strategies. By evaluating and learning from past experiences, strategies can be improved and adapted to better address the needs and challenges of different contexts.

In conclusion, poverty reduction strategies are crucial for promoting food security and sustainable development in the Global South. While there are challenges to be addressed, there are also opportunities for action that can help improve the effectiveness and sustainability of these strategies.

#### 12.2e Case Studies of Poverty Reduction Strategies

To further understand the challenges and opportunities in poverty reduction strategies, let's examine some case studies from the Global South.

##### 12.2e.1 Poverty Reduction Strategy in Honduras

In Honduras, the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) was implemented in 2001 with the goal of reducing the poverty rate from 70% to 40% by 2015. The strategy was developed through a participatory process that involved the active participation of the poor and vulnerable populations. It covered a range of areas, including education and literacy, diet and nutrition, and access to potable water.

Despite the efforts, the PRS faced several challenges. The strategy was not fully implemented due to a lack of resources and capacity. Additionally, the root causes of poverty, such as economic instability and social inequality, were not adequately addressed. This limited the effectiveness of the strategy in reducing poverty in the long term.

However, there were also opportunities for action. The PRS provided an opportunity for learning and adaptation. The strategy was evaluated and adjusted over time, leading to improvements in its effectiveness. Additionally, the strategy was implemented in a context of economic growth, which contributed to a reduction in the poverty rate.

##### 12.2e.2 Poverty Reduction Strategy in Cartagena, Colombia

In Cartagena, Colombia, a poverty reduction strategy was implemented in 2003 with the goal of reducing the poverty rate from 40% to 20% by 2015. The strategy was developed through a participatory process that involved the active participation of the poor and vulnerable populations. It covered a range of areas, including education and literacy, diet and nutrition, and access to potable water.

Similar to the PRS in Honduras, the strategy faced challenges in terms of implementation and addressing the root causes of poverty. However, there were also opportunities for action. The strategy provided an opportunity for technology and innovation, as mobile technology was used to improve the delivery of social protection programs. Additionally, partnerships and collaboration were used to scale up successful interventions, leading to a reduction in the poverty rate.

These case studies highlight the importance of addressing the challenges and leveraging the opportunities in poverty reduction strategies. They also underscore the need for a comprehensive and participatory approach to poverty reduction, as well as the importance of learning and adaptation in improving the effectiveness of these strategies.




#### 12.2b Role of Poverty Reduction in Food Security

Poverty reduction plays a crucial role in improving food security in the Global South. As mentioned earlier, poverty is a major factor contributing to food insecurity. Therefore, addressing poverty is essential for ensuring food security. Poverty reduction strategies, when effectively implemented, can contribute to improving food security in several ways.

Firstly, poverty reduction strategies aim to increase the incomes of the poor. This is achieved through various means, including policy reforms, public expenditures, and community-based programs. Increased incomes enable the poor to access more food, thereby improving their food security. This is particularly important in the Global South, where a large proportion of the population lives in poverty and is therefore food insecure.

Secondly, poverty reduction strategies aim to improve the livelihoods of the poor. This involves providing them with access to productive resources, such as land, capital, and technology. Improved livelihoods can enhance the poor's ability to produce and access food, thereby improving their food security. This is particularly important in the Global South, where many of the poor are small-scale farmers who rely on agriculture for their livelihoods.

Thirdly, poverty reduction strategies aim to promote social inclusion. This involves ensuring that the poor have equal access to basic services, such as education, health, and social protection. Improved access to these services can enhance the poor's ability to cope with shocks and stresses, thereby improving their food security. This is particularly important in the Global South, where many of the poor are marginalized and excluded from society.

Finally, poverty reduction strategies aim to promote good governance. This involves ensuring that the poor have a voice in decision-making processes and that their rights are respected. Improved governance can enhance the poor's ability to access resources and services, thereby improving their food security. This is particularly important in the Global South, where many of the poor face significant barriers to accessing resources and services due to corruption, lack of transparency, and other governance issues.

In conclusion, poverty reduction plays a crucial role in improving food security in the Global South. By addressing the root causes of poverty and promoting sustainable development, poverty reduction strategies can contribute to creating an enabling environment for food security. However, it is important to note that poverty reduction is not a panacea for food security. Other factors, such as climate change, conflict, and economic instability, also play a significant role in food security and need to be addressed.

#### 12.2c Case Studies of Poverty Reduction and Food Security

To further illustrate the role of poverty reduction in food security, let's examine some case studies from the Global South. These case studies will provide concrete examples of how poverty reduction strategies have been implemented and their impact on food security.

##### Case Study 1: Brazil's Zero Hunger Program

Brazil's Zero Hunger Program, launched in 2003, is a prime example of a successful poverty reduction strategy that has also improved food security. The program aimed to reduce extreme poverty and hunger by providing direct food aid to the poor, as well as implementing policies to increase the incomes of the poor and improve their livelihoods.

The program's direct food aid component, known as the "Basic Food Basket," provided a monthly supply of staple foods to households with extreme poverty. This helped to ensure that these households had access to adequate food. Additionally, the program implemented policies to increase the incomes of the poor, such as increasing minimum wages and providing conditional cash transfers to poor households.

The program also aimed to improve the livelihoods of the poor by providing them with access to productive resources, such as land and credit. This helped to enhance the poor's ability to produce and access food. Furthermore, the program promoted social inclusion by ensuring that the poor had access to basic services, such as education and health care.

The impact of the Zero Hunger Program on food security in Brazil has been significant. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the prevalence of hunger in Brazil declined from 14.3% in 2003 to 8.5% in 2013. This represents a 39% reduction in hunger over this period.

##### Case Study 2: India's National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme

India's National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) is another example of a successful poverty reduction strategy that has improved food security. Launched in 2005, the NREGS aims to provide employment to rural households, particularly those in the poorest districts, for at least 100 days per year.

The NREGS provides a wage guarantee of 100 rupees per day, which is significantly higher than the minimum wage in many rural areas. This helps to increase the incomes of the poor and improve their livelihoods. Additionally, the NREGS aims to create assets, such as irrigation canals and roads, which can enhance the poor's ability to produce and access food.

The impact of the NREGS on food security in India has been significant. According to the World Bank, the NREGS has helped to reduce poverty in India by 10 percentage points between 2005 and 2011. This represents a 15% reduction in poverty over this period. Furthermore, the NREGS has helped to improve food security by increasing the incomes of the poor and enhancing their ability to produce and access food.

These case studies demonstrate the potential of poverty reduction strategies to improve food security in the Global South. By addressing the root causes of poverty and promoting sustainable development, these strategies can help to create an enabling environment for food security. However, it is important to note that these strategies must be implemented in a way that is responsive to the specific needs and circumstances of each country and community.




#### 12.2c Case Studies of Successful Poverty Reduction Strategies

In this section, we will explore some case studies of successful poverty reduction strategies in the Global South. These case studies will provide practical examples of how poverty reduction strategies can be implemented and the impact they can have on food security.

##### Case Study 1: Poverty Reduction Strategy in Honduras

Honduras is a country in Central America that has implemented a successful poverty reduction strategy. The strategy, known as the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), was developed in consultation with the Honduran people and aimed to reduce poverty in the nation from 70 percent to 40 percent by 2015. The strategy was approved by major donors such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank in 2001.

The PRS covered a number of areas, including education and literacy, diet and nutrition, and access to potable water. In the area of education and literacy, the PRS aimed to have 70 percent of children completing year 10 (junior) at secondary school by 2015. In the area of diet and nutrition, the PRS aimed to reduce childhood malnutrition and provide access to potable water to 95 percent of the population.

The PRS was implemented through a participatory process that involved 3,500 people representing community organizations. This community ownership was essential for the strategy's long-term sustainability. The strategy was funded through an annual budget of 4.4 million Honduran lempiras, which was distributed to each of 18 of the Honduran Government departments.

The PRS has been successful in reducing poverty in Honduras. According to the World Bank, the poverty rate in Honduras fell from 66 percent in 1999 to 54 percent in 2005, and further to 42 percent in 2010. This reduction in poverty has had a positive impact on food security in the country.

##### Case Study 2: Poverty Reduction Strategy in Bangladesh

Bangladesh is another country in the Global South that has implemented a successful poverty reduction strategy. The strategy, known as the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), was developed in consultation with the Bangladeshi people and aimed to reduce poverty in the nation from 44 percent to 25 percent by 2015. The strategy was approved by major donors such as the IMF and the World Bank in 2002.

The PRSP covered a number of areas, including education, health, and agriculture. In the area of education, the PRSP aimed to increase the enrollment rate of primary school children from 70 percent to 90 percent by 2015. In the area of health, the PRSP aimed to reduce the maternal mortality rate and improve access to safe drinking water. In the area of agriculture, the PRSP aimed to increase agricultural productivity and reduce food insecurity.

The PRSP was implemented through a participatory process that involved 3,500 people representing community organizations. This community ownership was essential for the strategy's long-term sustainability. The strategy was funded through an annual budget of 4.4 million Honduran lempiras, which was distributed to each of 18 of the Honduran Government departments.

The PRSP has been successful in reducing poverty in Bangladesh. According to the World Bank, the poverty rate in Bangladesh fell from 44 percent in 2000 to 31 percent in 2010. This reduction in poverty has had a positive impact on food security in the country.




#### 12.3a Understanding Poverty Policies

Poverty policies are a crucial component of any government's strategy to address the issue of poverty. These policies are designed to provide a framework for addressing the root causes of poverty and to ensure that the poor have access to the necessary resources and opportunities to improve their living conditions. In this section, we will explore the concept of poverty policies and their role in promoting food security.

##### Poverty Policies and Food Security

Food security is a critical aspect of poverty reduction. As we have seen in the previous section, poverty can lead to food insecurity, which in turn can exacerbate poverty. Therefore, addressing food security is a key component of any poverty policy. 

Poverty policies can be used to address food security in several ways. For instance, they can be used to ensure that the poor have access to affordable and nutritious food. This can be achieved through policies that subsidize the cost of food, or through policies that promote the production and distribution of nutritious food. 

Poverty policies can also be used to address the underlying causes of food insecurity. For instance, they can be used to address issues such as lack of access to land, lack of education and skills, and lack of employment opportunities. By addressing these underlying causes, poverty policies can help to create a more conducive environment for food security.

##### Asset-Based Welfare and Poverty Policies

One approach to poverty policies is asset-based welfare. This approach is based on the idea that an economy can achieve a path towards prosperity if the individuals of the economy accumulate and acquire assets. In the context of poverty policies, asset-based welfare can be used to provide the poor with the necessary assets to improve their living conditions.

Asset-based policies can be used to provide the poor with assets such as land, housing, and credit. These assets can help the poor to improve their livelihoods and to become more resilient to shocks such as food price fluctuations. 

However, asset-based policies need to be carefully designed and implemented to ensure that they do not exacerbate existing inequalities. This can be achieved by ensuring that the poor have equal access to assets, and by ensuring that the policies are implemented in a way that is sensitive to the needs and circumstances of the poor.

In the next section, we will explore some case studies of successful poverty reduction strategies, which will provide practical examples of how poverty policies can be implemented and the impact they can have on food security.

#### 12.3b Analyzing the Impact of Poverty Policies on Food Security

The impact of poverty policies on food security can be analyzed from various perspectives. One of the key aspects to consider is the effectiveness of these policies in addressing the root causes of poverty and food insecurity. 

##### Impact of Poverty Policies on Food Security

Poverty policies, particularly asset-based policies, can have a significant impact on food security. By providing the poor with assets such as land, housing, and credit, these policies can help to improve their livelihoods and to become more resilient to shocks such as food price fluctuations. 

For instance, the provision of land can help the poor to engage in agricultural activities, thereby increasing their access to affordable and nutritious food. Similarly, the provision of credit can help the poor to start or expand their businesses, which can also contribute to food security. 

Moreover, poverty policies can also help to address the underlying causes of food insecurity. For instance, policies that promote education and skills development can help to improve the employability of the poor, thereby increasing their income and their ability to access food. 

##### Challenges and Opportunities

Despite these potential benefits, there are also challenges associated with the implementation of poverty policies. One of the main challenges is the issue of initial inequality. Asset-based policies may not be able to address this issue, as the poor may not have the necessary resources to participate in these policies. 

Another challenge is the issue of imbalance in asset building. In many cases, the poor may not have the same opportunities as the rich to build assets, which can limit the effectiveness of asset-based policies. 

However, there are also opportunities associated with poverty policies. For instance, the implementation of public intervention can help to increase access to assets such as land, housing, and credit. Similarly, infrastructural investments can help to improve access to services such as education and health care, which can also contribute to food security. 

##### Conclusion

In conclusion, poverty policies, particularly asset-based policies, can have a significant impact on food security. However, these policies need to be carefully designed and implemented to address the root causes of poverty and food insecurity, and to ensure that the poor have equal access to assets and opportunities. This requires a comprehensive approach that includes not only asset-based policies, but also policies that address issues such as education, skills development, and employment.

#### 12.3c Case Studies of Successful Poverty Policies

In this section, we will explore some case studies of successful poverty policies in the Global South. These case studies will provide practical examples of how poverty policies can be implemented and the impact they can have on food security.

##### Case Study 1: The Philippines

The Philippines has implemented a successful poverty reduction strategy that has had a significant impact on food security. The strategy, known as the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), was developed in consultation with civil society and donors, and was approved by the International Monetary Fund in 1999. The PRSP aimed to reduce poverty by promoting economic growth, improving social services, and empowering the poor.

One of the key components of the PRSP was the provision of assets to the poor. The government implemented a land reform program that aimed to distribute land to landless farmers. This program has helped to increase the incomes of poor farmers and to improve their food security.

The PRSP also included policies to improve education and health services, which have contributed to the empowerment of the poor. For instance, the government has implemented a conditional cash transfer program that provides cash transfers to poor households in exchange for sending their children to school and for regular health check-ups. This program has helped to improve the education and health outcomes of the poor, thereby contributing to food security.

##### Case Study 2: Brazil

Brazil has also implemented a successful poverty reduction strategy that has had a significant impact on food security. The strategy, known as the Zero Hunger Program, was launched in 2003 and aims to eradicate hunger and extreme poverty.

The Zero Hunger Program includes a range of policies to address poverty and food insecurity. One of the key components of the program is the provision of assets to the poor. The government has implemented a land reform program that aims to distribute land to landless farmers, and has also provided credit to poor households to support their economic activities.

The Zero Hunger Program also includes policies to improve education and health services, as well as policies to promote social inclusion and participation. For instance, the government has implemented a school feeding program that provides a daily meal to children in primary school, which has helped to improve the nutrition of children from poor households.

These case studies demonstrate the potential of poverty policies to address food security in the Global South. However, they also highlight the need for a comprehensive approach that includes not only asset-based policies, but also policies to improve education, health services, and social inclusion.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the challenge of feeding cities in the Global South is a complex one, with poverty and food security being two of the most significant factors. The urbanization of these regions has led to a rapid increase in the demand for food, which has put pressure on the already limited resources. This has resulted in a significant portion of the population living in poverty, with limited access to nutritious food. 

The issue of food security is further exacerbated by the lack of effective policies and programs aimed at addressing poverty. The policies and programs that do exist often fail to reach the most vulnerable populations, further exacerbating the issue of food insecurity. 

However, there are opportunities for action that can be taken to improve food security and reduce poverty in these regions. These include the implementation of more effective policies and programs, as well as the promotion of sustainable agricultural practices. 

The challenge of feeding cities in the Global South is a multifaceted one, but with concerted effort and action, it is a challenge that can be overcome.

#### 12.3b Role of Poverty Policies in Food Security

Poverty policies play a crucial role in promoting food security in the Global South. As we have seen in the previous section, poverty can lead to food insecurity, which in turn can exacerbate poverty. Therefore, addressing food security is a key component of any poverty policy.

##### Poverty Policies and Food Security

Poverty policies can be used to address food security in several ways. For instance, they can be used to ensure that the poor have access to affordable and nutritious food. This can be achieved through policies that subsidize the cost of food, or through policies that promote the production and distribution of nutritious food. 

Poverty policies can also be used to address the underlying causes of food insecurity. For instance, they can be used to address issues such as lack of access to land, lack of education and skills, and lack of employment opportunities. By addressing these underlying causes, poverty policies can help to create a more conducive environment for food security.

##### Asset-Based Welfare and Poverty Policies

One approach to poverty policies is asset-based welfare. This approach is based on the idea that an economy can achieve a path towards prosperity if the individuals of the economy accumulate and acquire assets. In the context of poverty policies, asset-based welfare can be used to provide the poor with the necessary assets to improve their living conditions.

Asset-based policies can be used to provide the poor with assets such as land, housing, and credit. These assets can help the poor to increase their income and improve their food security. For instance, providing the poor with land can help them to produce their own food, reducing their dependence on expensive food purchases. Similarly, providing the poor with housing can help them to reduce their housing costs, freeing up resources for food purchases. Finally, providing the poor with credit can help them to start their own businesses, which can generate additional income for food purchases.

In conclusion, poverty policies play a crucial role in promoting food security in the Global South. By addressing the root causes of poverty and providing the poor with the necessary assets, poverty policies can help to create a more conducive environment for food security.

#### 12.3c Case Studies of Poverty Policies and Food Security

Brazil's Zero Hunger Program, launched in 2003, is a prime example of a successful poverty policy that has significantly improved food security. The program aims to eradicate hunger and extreme poverty by 2024. It provides a range of benefits to the poor, including food vouchers, school meals, and cash transfers. The program has been credited with reducing the number of hungry people in Brazil by more than 60% between 2003 and 2013[^1^].

The Zero Hunger Program also includes policies to address the underlying causes of food insecurity. For instance, it provides training and support for small-scale farmers, helping them to increase their productivity and income. It also promotes the production and distribution of nutritious food, with a focus on local and regional food systems.

##### Case Study 2: India's National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme

India's National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) is another example of a successful poverty policy that has improved food security. Launched in 2005, the NREGS provides a guarantee of 100 days of employment per year to rural households. The work is primarily in the public sector, and the wages are set at a minimum of 60% of the statutory minimum wage[^2^].

The NREGS has been credited with reducing poverty and improving food security in rural India. It has also helped to create employment opportunities, which can reduce the risk of food insecurity due to lack of employment.

##### Case Study 3: South Africa's Child Support Grant

South Africa's Child Support Grant (CSG) is a cash transfer program that provides a monthly payment to the primary caregiver of every child under the age of 18. The grant is set at a level that is intended to meet the basic needs of the child, including food[^3^].

The CSG has been credited with reducing child poverty and improving food security in South Africa. It has also helped to reduce the incidence of child malnutrition, which is a key indicator of food security.

These case studies highlight the potential of poverty policies to improve food security in the Global South. They also underscore the importance of addressing the underlying causes of food insecurity, such as lack of employment opportunities and lack of access to land and resources.

We have seen how food insecurity and poverty are intertwined, with poverty often leading to food insecurity and food insecurity exacerbating poverty. We have also discussed the various factors that contribute to food insecurity and poverty in Cartagena, including economic, social, and political factors.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is the importance of addressing both food security and poverty simultaneously. While efforts to improve food security may alleviate some of the symptoms of poverty, it is ultimately insufficient to address the root causes of poverty. Similarly, addressing poverty alone may not necessarily improve food security, as poverty can lead to a lack of access to affordable and nutritious food.

To effectively address food security and poverty in Cartagena, it is crucial to take a holistic approach that addresses the underlying causes of both. This includes addressing economic inequality, improving access to education and healthcare, and promoting social inclusion. It also involves implementing policies and programs that prioritize food security and poverty reduction, such as food subsidies, school feeding programs, and social safety net programs.

In addition to these efforts, it is important to involve the community in the decision-making process and empower them to take ownership of their own food security and poverty reduction. This can be achieved through community-based initiatives and participatory planning processes.

Overall, addressing food security and poverty in Cartagena requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the complex interplay between economic, social, and political factors. By prioritizing the well-being of all members of the community, we can work towards creating a more food secure and poverty-free Cartagena.

### Section: 13.1 Understanding Gender:

Gender is a complex and multifaceted concept that has a significant impact on food security. It is not simply a binary category of male or female, but rather a social construct that is influenced by a variety of factors, including biology, social norms, and cultural expectations. In this section, we will explore the basics of gender and its role in shaping food security in the Global South.

#### 13.1a Basics of Gender

Gender is often used interchangeably with the term "sex," which refers to biological characteristics such as reproductive organs and hormones. However, it is important to note that gender is a social construct and is not determined by biology. It is shaped by a variety of factors, including social norms, cultural expectations, and personal identity.

In many societies, there are strict gender roles and expectations that dictate how individuals should behave based on their assigned sex. These roles and expectations can have a significant impact on food security. For example, in some cultures, women are responsible for preparing and serving food, while men are responsible for providing food for the family. This can limit women's access to food and decision-making power in regards to food.

Furthermore, gender-based discrimination and inequality can also impact food security. Women and girls may face discrimination in accessing education, employment, and healthcare, which can have a direct impact on their ability to obtain and consume food. In addition, women and girls may be more vulnerable to food insecurity due to their limited decision-making power and lack of access to resources.

It is important to note that gender is not limited to the binary categories of male and female. There are also individuals who identify as non-binary or gender non-conforming, who may face unique challenges and opportunities when it comes to food security.

In the next section, we will explore the relationship between gender and food security in more detail, and discuss potential solutions to address the challenges faced by women and girls in the Global South.

#### 13.1b Role of Gender in Food Security

Gender plays a crucial role in food security, as it affects access to resources, decision-making power, and vulnerability to food insecurity. In many societies, women are responsible for producing and preparing food, yet they often have limited access to resources such as land, credit, and education. This can limit their ability to produce enough food for their families and can lead to food insecurity.

Moreover, gender-based discrimination and inequality can also impact food security. Women and girls may face discrimination in accessing education, employment, and healthcare, which can have a direct impact on their ability to obtain and consume food. In addition, women and girls may be more vulnerable to food insecurity due to their limited decision-making power and lack of access to resources.

It is important to address these gender inequalities in order to improve food security in the Global South. This can be achieved through policies and programs that promote gender equality and empower women and girls. By providing women and girls with equal access to education, employment, and healthcare, we can improve their food security and overall well-being.

### Subsection: 13.1c Case Studies of Gender and Food Security

To further understand the impact of gender on food security, let us examine some case studies from the Global South.

#### Case Study 1: Women's Land Rights in Sub-Saharan Africa

In many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, women have limited or no rights to land ownership. This is due to customary laws and practices that prioritize male inheritance and land ownership. As a result, women have limited access to land, which is a crucial resource for food production. This can lead to food insecurity for women and their families.

However, there have been efforts to address this issue. For example, in Rwanda, a land reform law was passed in 1999 that granted women equal rights to land ownership. This has led to an increase in women's land ownership and has improved food security for women and their families.

#### Case Study 2: Gender-Based Violence and Food Security in South Asia

In South Asia, gender-based violence is a major issue that affects food security. Women and girls who experience violence may have limited access to food and decision-making power, which can lead to food insecurity. In addition, gender-based violence can also have a negative impact on women's mental and physical health, which can further exacerbate food insecurity.

To address this issue, there have been efforts to promote gender-sensitive approaches to food security programming. This includes involving women in decision-making processes and addressing gender-based violence through community-based interventions.

#### Case Study 3: Gender and Climate Change in Latin America

Climate change has a disproportionate impact on women and girls in Latin America. Women are often responsible for providing food for their families, and climate change can lead to changes in weather patterns and crop yields, making it more difficult for them to meet the food needs of their families. In addition, women may also face increased vulnerability to gender-based violence during natural disasters, which can further exacerbate food insecurity.

To address this issue, there have been efforts to promote gender-sensitive climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. This includes involving women in decision-making processes and providing them with training and resources to adapt to the impacts of climate change.

The Food and Agricultural Organization's (FAO) report, State of Food and Agriculture 2010-2011, highlights the urgency of closing the gender gap in agricultural resources. It emphasizes the need for increased investment in labor-saving and productivity-enhancing mechanisms, along with better infrastructure to enable women to engage in more productive activities. This not only improves food security but also has a ripple effect on other aspects of women's lives, such as education, health, and overall well-being.

#### Implementing Gender Policies in Food Security

Implementing gender policies in food security requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of gender inequality in food systems. This includes promoting gender equality in decision-making processes, providing women with equal access to resources, and addressing the social and cultural norms that perpetuate gender discrimination.

One effective way to implement gender policies is through the use of gender mainstreaming. This approach involves incorporating gender considerations into all aspects of food security programs and policies. By doing so, gender equality is promoted throughout the entire food system, rather than just addressing specific issues.

Another important aspect of implementing gender policies is involving women in decision-making processes. This not only promotes gender equality but also ensures that women's needs and perspectives are taken into account when making decisions that affect their food security.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, gender policies play a crucial role in addressing the challenges of food security in the Global South. By promoting gender equality and empowering women in all aspects of food systems, these policies can improve food security and have a positive impact on other aspects of women's lives. However, their effective implementation requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of gender inequality in food systems.

## Chapter: Feeding Cities in the Global South: Challenges and Opportunities for Action in Cartagena

### Introduction:

In recent years, the issue of food waste has gained significant attention in the global community. As the world's population continues to grow and urbanization increases, the amount of food waste generated has become a major concern. In the Global South, where resources are often limited, food waste not only has environmental implications but also has a significant impact on food security and nutrition. This chapter will explore the challenges and opportunities for addressing food waste in the context of urbanization in Cartagena, a city in the Global South.

Food waste is defined as any food that is discarded or uneaten, whether it is still edible or not. It is estimated that approximately one-third of all food produced globally is wasted, with the majority of this waste occurring in the Global South. This not only has economic implications, as food waste represents a loss of resources and potential income, but also has significant environmental impacts. Food waste contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and landfill waste, both of which have negative effects on the environment.

In Cartagena, where urbanization has led to a rapid increase in population and food consumption, the issue of food waste has become a pressing concern. As the city continues to grow, the amount of food waste generated also increases, putting pressure on already limited resources. This chapter will delve into the challenges faced by Cartagena in managing food waste and the opportunities for action that exist to address this issue.

Throughout this chapter, we will explore the various factors that contribute to food waste in Cartagena, including cultural and social norms, economic factors, and infrastructure limitations. We will also examine the potential solutions and strategies that can be implemented to reduce food waste and promote more sustainable food systems in the city. By understanding the challenges and opportunities for addressing food waste in Cartagena, we can work towards creating a more sustainable and equitable food future for all.





#### 13.3c Case Studies of Successful Gender Policies

To further illustrate the importance and effectiveness of gender policies in addressing food security, let's examine some case studies of successful gender policies in the Global South.

##### Case Study 1: Dominican Republic

In November 2009, the Dominican Republic became the first Latin American country to pledge to include a "gender perspective" in every information and communications technology (ICT) initiative and policy developed by the government. This was made possible by the Gender Evaluation Methodology (GEM), which was used to evaluate the impact of ICT policies on women's participation in local government. The GEM study revealed that despite the implementation of policies to promote women's participation, technical problems and ingrained inequalities were hindering their voices from being heard. This led to the development of more targeted policies to address these issues and promote gender equality in decision-making processes.

##### Case Study 2: Chhattisgarh State, India

In Chhattisgarh state, India, the GEM was used to evaluate why women, rural heads of village, were not actively participating in local government despite being numerous in number and having the opportunity to remotely communicate the needs of their villages through the use of a Simputer. The study revealed that technical problems and ingrained inequalities were preventing women from effectively utilizing the Simputers. This led to the development of policies to address these issues and promote gender equality in decision-making processes.

##### Case Study 3: Teacher Education Policy in India

In India, the GEM was used to evaluate the impact of a teacher education policy on promoting gender equality. The study revealed that while the policy had some positive effects, there were still significant gender disparities in terms of access to education and employment opportunities. This led to the development of more targeted policies to address these issues and promote gender equality in education.

These case studies demonstrate the importance of gender policies in addressing food security and the need for a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of gender inequality. By incorporating gender mainstreaming and using tools like the GEM, we can work towards creating more inclusive and equitable food systems in the Global South.
