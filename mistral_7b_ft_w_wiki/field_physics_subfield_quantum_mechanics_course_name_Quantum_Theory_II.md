### Introduction

Welcome to the first chapter of "Quantum Theory II: A Comprehensive Guide to Time-dependent Perturbation Theory, Symmetry in Quantum Mechanics, Scattering, and Relativistic Quantum Mechanics". This chapter will delve into the fascinating world of time-dependent perturbation theory, a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics.

Time-dependent perturbation theory is a mathematical framework that allows us to study the behavior of quantum systems under the influence of external forces or perturbations. It is a powerful tool that has been used to explain a wide range of phenomena in quantum physics, from the behavior of atoms in a laser field to the dynamics of quantum systems in condensed matter physics.

In this chapter, we will start by introducing the basic concepts of time-dependent perturbation theory, including the time-dependent Schrödinger equation and the perturbation Hamiltonian. We will then explore how these concepts can be used to describe the evolution of a quantum system under the influence of a perturbation.

We will also discuss the concept of perturbative solutions, which are solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation that are valid only when the perturbation is small. These solutions are particularly useful for understanding the behavior of quantum systems in the presence of weak perturbations.

Finally, we will introduce the concept of perturbation series, which is a mathematical tool that allows us to systematically expand the perturbative solutions in terms of the perturbation strength. This will provide us with a powerful tool for analyzing the behavior of quantum systems under the influence of perturbations of any strength.

Throughout this chapter, we will provide numerous examples and exercises to help you solidify your understanding of time-dependent perturbation theory. We hope that this chapter will serve as a solid foundation for the rest of the book, which will delve into more advanced topics in quantum mechanics.
