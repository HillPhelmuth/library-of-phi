### Section 1.1 Spectroscopy in frequency and time domains:

Spectroscopy is a powerful tool for studying the interaction of light with matter. It allows us to probe the electronic and vibrational states of molecules, providing valuable information about their structure and properties. In this section, we will explore the principles of spectroscopy in both the frequency and time domains.

#### 1.1a Introduction to Spectroscopy

Spectroscopy is a branch of science concerned with the spectra of electromagnetic radiation as a function of its wavelength or frequency, measured by spectrographic equipment and other techniques. The spectral measurement devices are referred to as spectrometers, spectrophotometers, spectrographs, or spectral analyzers. 

The basic setup for spectroscopic analysis in the laboratory begins with a sample to be analyzed, followed by a light source chosen from any desired range of the light spectrum. The light then passes through the sample to a dispersion array (diffraction grating instrument) and is captured by a photodiode. For astronomical purposes, the telescope must be equipped with the light dispersion device. 

Spectroscopy began with Isaac Newton splitting light with a prism, a key moment in the development of modern optics. This led to the study of visible light, which we call color, and later under the studies of James Clerk Maxwell came to include the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Although color is involved in spectroscopy, it is not equated with the color of elements or objects, which involve the absorption and reflection of certain electromagnetic waves to give objects a sense of color to our eyes. 

Rather, spectroscopy involves the splitting of light by a prism, diffraction grating, or similar instrument, to give off a particular discrete line pattern called a “spectrum” unique to each different type of element. Most elements are first put into a gaseous phase to allow the spectra to be examined, although today other methods can be used on different phases. Each element that is diffracted by a prism-like instrument is associated with atomic electronic transitions and polyatomic gases have their own absorption band system.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the principles of spectroscopy in the frequency domain, exploring the Beer-Lambert Law, the Franck-Condon Principle, and the Rayleigh Scattering Law. We will also discuss the practical aspects of spectroscopy, including the design and operation of spectroscopic instruments, as well as the interpretation of spectroscopic data.

#### 1.1b Spectroscopy in the Frequency Domain

Spectroscopy in the frequency domain involves the study of the interaction of light with matter as a function of frequency. This is particularly useful in understanding the electronic and vibrational states of molecules. 

The frequency domain spectroscopy is based on the Beer-Lambert Law, which states that the absorbance of a sample is directly proportional to its concentration and the path length of the light through the sample. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$
A = \epsilon \cdot c \cdot l
$$

where $A$ is the absorbance, $\epsilon$ is the molar absorptivity (a measure of how strongly a compound absorbs light), $c$ is the concentration of the sample, and $l$ is the path length of the light through the sample.

In the context of spectroscopy, the Beer-Lambert Law allows us to determine the concentration of a sample by measuring its absorbance at a specific frequency. This is possible because each molecule has a unique set of electronic and vibrational states that correspond to specific frequencies of light. When light of a particular frequency is passed through a sample, molecules in specific electronic and vibrational states will absorb that light, leading to a change in the absorbance.

The Franck-Condon Principle, named after the physicists James Franck and Peter-Doroshenko Condon, is another fundamental principle in spectroscopy. It states that the probability of a molecule transitioning from one vibrational state to another is proportional to the overlap of the two states. This principle is particularly useful in understanding the vibrational states of molecules.

The Rayleigh Scattering Law, named after the physicist Lord Rayleigh, describes the scattering of light by molecules. It states that the scattering of light is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength of the light. This law is particularly useful in understanding the scattering of light by molecules, which can provide valuable information about the size and shape of the molecules.

In the next section, we will explore the time domain aspects of spectroscopy, including the principles of time-resolved spectroscopy and pump-probe experiments.

#### 1.1c Spectroscopy in the Time Domain

Spectroscopy in the time domain involves the study of the interaction of light with matter as a function of time. This is particularly useful in understanding the dynamics of chemical reactions and the behavior of molecules in different environments.

The time domain spectroscopy is based on the pump-probe experiment, a technique that allows us to study the dynamics of a system by applying a pump pulse to the system and then probing the system at different times after the pump pulse. The pump pulse can be thought of as a way of exciting the system, while the probe pulse measures the response of the system to the excitation.

The pump-probe experiment can be represented mathematically as:

$$
P(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} E(t') S(t-t') dt'
$$

where $P(t)$ is the probe pulse, $E(t')$ is the pump pulse, and $S(t-t')$ is the system response to the pump pulse. The integral represents the convolution of the pump pulse and the system response.

The pump-probe experiment allows us to study the dynamics of a system by measuring the change in the system response over time. This can provide valuable information about the rates of chemical reactions, the lifetimes of excited states, and the interactions between molecules.

In the context of spectroscopy, the pump-probe experiment can be used to study the dynamics of electronic and vibrational transitions. For example, by applying a pump pulse that excites molecules from a ground electronic state to an excited electronic state, and then probing the system at different times after the pump pulse, we can study the dynamics of the electronic transition. This can provide valuable information about the energy levels of the molecules, the rates of electronic transitions, and the interactions between molecules.

In the next section, we will explore the principles of time-resolved spectroscopy, a technique that allows us to study the dynamics of a system by measuring the system response at different times after a perturbation.

#### 1.1d Applications of Spectroscopy

Spectroscopy, both in the frequency and time domains, has a wide range of applications in various fields of science and technology. In this section, we will discuss some of these applications, focusing on their relevance to experimental chemistry.

##### Molecular Electronic Transition

Spectroscopy is a powerful tool for studying molecular electronic transitions. As we have seen in the previous sections, the absorption of light by a molecule can excite an electron from a lower energy level to a higher one. This process is associated with a specific frequency of light, which is unique to each molecule. By studying the frequencies at which a molecule absorbs light, we can gain insights into its electronic structure.

For example, consider a molecule with a ground electronic state $S_0$ and an excited electronic state $S_1$. The energy difference between these two states, $\Delta E = E_1 - E_0$, corresponds to the frequency of light that can excite the molecule from $S_0$ to $S_1$. This frequency can be calculated using the equation:

$$
\Delta E = h\nu
$$

where $h$ is Planck's constant and $\nu$ is the frequency of the light.

##### Line Spectra

Spectroscopy is also used to study the line spectra of atoms and molecules. A line spectrum is a series of lines, each corresponding to a specific frequency of light. These lines are associated with atomic electronic transitions and polyatomic gases have their own absorption band system.

The frequencies of the lines in a line spectrum can be calculated using the Rydberg formula for hydrogen and the Lyman series formula for hydrogen and helium. These formulas are based on the quantum mechanical principles of energy conservation and the quantization of energy levels in atoms.

##### Spectroscopy in Astronomy

In astronomy, spectroscopy is used to study the composition and properties of celestial objects. By analyzing the light from a star or galaxy, astronomers can determine the elements present in the object and their relative abundances. This is done by studying the absorption lines in the spectrum of the light, which correspond to the frequencies at which the atoms and molecules in the object absorb light.

For example, the study of the line spectra of hydrogen and helium in the spectra of stars has led to the discovery of the Big Bang and the expansion of the universe. The redshift of the lines in the spectra of distant galaxies, due to the Doppler effect, provided the first evidence for the expansion of the universe.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the principles of spectroscopy, focusing on the principles of quantum mechanics that underlie these phenomena.

### Conclusion
