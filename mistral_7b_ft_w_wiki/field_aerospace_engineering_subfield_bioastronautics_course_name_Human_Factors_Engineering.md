## Foreward

Welcome to "Human Factors Engineering: A Comprehensive Guide". This book aims to provide a thorough understanding of human factors engineering, a field that is crucial in the design and evaluation of systems that involve human interaction. As technology continues to advance and become more integrated into our daily lives, the need for human factors engineering becomes increasingly important.

The book is structured to provide a comprehensive overview of human factors engineering, starting with an introduction to the field and its importance. It then delves into the various aspects of human factors engineering, including cognitive and physical abilities, decision-making, and user experience. The book also explores the role of human factors engineering in different industries, such as healthcare, transportation, and consumer electronics.

One of the key concepts covered in this book is the concept of human systems integration. This concept, as defined by Boehm-Davis et al. (2015), involves the integration of human and system components to achieve a common goal. It is a crucial aspect of human factors engineering, as it ensures that the system is designed and evaluated in a way that considers the capabilities and limitations of human users.

Another important aspect of human factors engineering is human performance modeling. This involves creating mathematical models to predict how humans will interact with a system. One popular model is the GOMS (goals, operators, methods, and selection rules) model, which was first introduced by Card et al. (1983). This model is used to model routine cognitive skills, where the operator has the correct knowledge of how to perform a task and simply needs to execute that knowledge.

However, as with any model, there are limitations to the GOMS model. For example, it may not be suitable for analyzing user error. To address this, John & Kieras (1996a, 1996b) extended the GOMS model to include error handling. This is just one example of how human factors engineering is a constantly evolving field, with new models and techniques being developed to improve the design and evaluation of systems.

In addition to these concepts, the book also covers the role of human factors engineering in the system development process. As Pew & Mavor (2007) suggest, human systems integration should be considered throughout the entire system development process, rather than just at the end. This ensures that the system is designed and evaluated in a way that considers the human user from the beginning.

I hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and professionals in the field of human factors engineering. It is my goal to provide a comprehensive guide that will help readers understand the importance of human factors engineering and how it can be applied in various industries. Thank you for joining me on this journey through the world of human factors engineering.

In the previous section, we discussed the fundamentals of human factors engineering and its history. In this section, we will delve deeper into the vision of human factors engineering and how it aligns with the broader field of engineering.

The vision of human factors engineering is to create products and systems that are safe, efficient, and effective for human use. This involves understanding the principles of human performance and limitations, as well as incorporating these principles into the design and evaluation of products and systems. By doing so, human factors engineers aim to improve the overall user experience and enhance human performance.

One of the key aspects of human factors engineering is the use of visual perception. As mentioned in the previous section, David Marr developed a multi-level theory of vision that analyzed the process of vision at different levels of abstraction. This theory has been further developed and expanded upon by many vision scientists, including Tomaso Poggio, who have embraced Marr's levels of analysis and employed them to further characterize vision from a computational perspective.

The "computational level" addresses the problems that the visual system must overcome at a high level of abstraction. The "algorithmic level" attempts to identify the strategy that may be used to solve these problems. Finally, the "implementational level" attempts to explain how solutions to these problems are realized in neural circuitry.

Marr suggested that it is possible to investigate vision at any of these levels independently. However, it is important to note that these levels are not mutually exclusive and often work together to create a comprehensive understanding of vision.

In the next section, we will explore the role of visual perception in human factors engineering and how it can be applied to create products and systems that are safe, efficient, and effective for human use.

In this section, we will explore some case studies that highlight the importance of space bioastronautics in human factors engineering.

#### Case Study 1: The International Space Station (ISS)

The International Space Station (ISS) is a multi-national collaborative project between NASA, Roscosmos, ESA, JAXA, and CSA. It has been continuously inhabited since 2000 and has been a valuable platform for studying the effects of space travel on the human body and mind.

One of the most significant findings from the ISS is the loss of bone and muscle mass in astronauts during long-duration space flights. This is due to the lack of gravity, which is essential for maintaining bone and muscle health. To mitigate this issue, astronauts on the ISS engage in regular exercise, including resistance training and aerobic exercises, to maintain their muscle and bone health.

The ISS has also been a platform for studying the psychological effects of space travel. Astronauts on the ISS have reported feelings of isolation and confinement, which can have a significant impact on their mental health. To address this issue, researchers have developed strategies to improve communication and social interaction between astronauts and their loved ones on Earth.

#### Case Study 2: The Mars Rover Missions

The Mars Rover missions, including Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance, have provided valuable insights into the effects of long-duration space travel on the human body and mind. These missions have also highlighted the importance of space bioastronautics in human factors engineering.

One of the most significant findings from the Mars Rover missions is the effects of radiation on the human body. Astronauts on these missions are exposed to high levels of radiation, which can have detrimental effects on their health. To mitigate this issue, researchers have developed strategies to protect astronauts from radiation, including shielding and pharmaceutical interventions.

The Mars Rover missions have also highlighted the importance of psychological resilience in space travel. Astronauts on these missions have reported feelings of isolation and confinement, which can have a significant impact on their mental health. To address this issue, researchers have developed strategies to improve communication and social interaction between astronauts and their loved ones on Earth.

#### Conclusion

These case studies highlight the importance of space bioastronautics in human factors engineering. By studying the effects of space travel on the human body and mind, researchers can develop strategies to mitigate these effects and improve the safety and effectiveness of space travel. As we continue to explore the universe, the role of space bioastronautics will only become more critical in ensuring the success of human spaceflight.
