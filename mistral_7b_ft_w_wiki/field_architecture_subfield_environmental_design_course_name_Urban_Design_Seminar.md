# Urban Design: Past, Present, and Future

## Chapter 5: Urban Design and Sustainability




### Introduction

The industrial landscape has been a significant part of urban design for centuries, shaping the way cities are built and developed. However, with the rise of modern technology and the need for more sustainable and environmentally friendly cities, the role of the industrial landscape in urban design has evolved. In this chapter, we will explore the concept of reclaiming the industrial landscape and how it has become a crucial aspect of urban design. We will delve into the history of industrial landscapes, their impact on urban design, and the current trends and challenges in reclaiming them. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the importance of reclaiming the industrial landscape and its potential for creating more livable and sustainable cities.




### Subsection: 5.1 Adaptive Reuse of Industrial Sites

#### 5.1a Overview of Adaptive Reuse

Adaptive reuse is a design approach that involves repurposing existing buildings for new uses. This approach has gained significant attention in recent years as a sustainable and cost-effective solution for urban design. It is particularly relevant in the context of reclaiming the industrial landscape, where many abandoned or underutilized buildings and sites exist.

The concept of adaptive reuse is rooted in the idea of "urban ore", as proposed by Chusid. According to Chusid, existing buildings that are approaching dilapidation or disuse are a "mine of raw materials for new projects". This idea was further developed by Shen and Langston, who argued that adaptive reuse is a more effective solution than raw material recovery. They developed an integrated model for assessing the adaptive reuse potential of buildings, which is based on the concept of a building's physical life expectancy.

The adaptive reuse potential calculator is a tool that helps determine the optimal point for adaptive reuse intervention. It considers a series of physical, economic, functional, technological, social, legal, and political characteristics of a building. These characteristics are used to derive an "annual obsolescence rate" and "environmental obsolescence", which are necessary to determine an optimum point at which adaptive reuse intervention should occur.

The concept of obsolescence is advanced as a suitable concept to objectively reduce the expected physical life of a building to its expected useful life. A discounting philosophy is adopted, whereby the annual obsolescence rate across all criteria is the "discount rate" that performs this transformation. An algorithm based on a standard decay (negative exponential) curve produces an index of reuse potential (known as the ARP score), which is expressed as a percentage.

The adaptive reuse potential calculator is a valuable tool for urban designers and planners, as it provides a systematic approach to assessing the potential of existing buildings for adaptive reuse. By considering a range of factors, the calculator can help identify buildings that have the highest potential for adaptive reuse, and guide decision-making processes for their repurposing.

In the following sections, we will explore the benefits and challenges of adaptive reuse, and discuss case studies of successful adaptive reuse projects in the context of reclaiming the industrial landscape.

#### 5.1b Benefits of Adaptive Reuse

Adaptive reuse offers numerous benefits that make it a preferred approach in urban design, particularly in the context of reclaiming the industrial landscape. These benefits can be broadly categorized into environmental, economic, and social benefits.

##### Environmental Benefits

Adaptive reuse is an environmentally sustainable approach that helps reduce waste and conserve resources. By repurposing existing buildings, it minimizes the need for new construction materials, which can have significant environmental impacts. This is particularly relevant in the context of the industrial landscape, where many abandoned or underutilized buildings and sites exist. By reusing these buildings, we can reduce the environmental footprint of urban development.

Moreover, adaptive reuse can also contribute to reducing urban sprawl. By repurposing existing buildings, it can help preserve open spaces and natural resources, which are often threatened by urban development. This can help maintain the ecological balance of urban areas and improve the quality of life for residents.

##### Economic Benefits

Adaptive reuse can also offer significant economic benefits. It can be a cost-effective solution, as it often involves lower costs than new construction. This is particularly relevant in the context of the industrial landscape, where many buildings may be structurally sound but no longer suitable for their original use. By repurposing these buildings, we can avoid the high costs associated with demolition and new construction.

Furthermore, adaptive reuse can also stimulate economic growth. By creating new uses for existing buildings, it can attract new businesses and residents to urban areas, which can boost local economies. This can be particularly beneficial in the context of the industrial landscape, where many areas may be experiencing economic decline.

##### Social Benefits

Adaptive reuse can also have significant social benefits. It can help preserve the cultural heritage of urban areas, as many existing buildings may have historical or architectural significance. This can contribute to the sense of place and identity in urban communities.

Moreover, adaptive reuse can also improve the quality of life for residents. By repurposing existing buildings, it can create new opportunities for housing, retail, and other uses that can enhance the livability of urban areas. This can be particularly relevant in the context of the industrial landscape, where many areas may have a shortage of affordable housing or other essential services.

In conclusion, adaptive reuse offers numerous benefits that make it a valuable approach in urban design. By repurposing existing buildings, it can help address environmental, economic, and social challenges, and contribute to creating more sustainable and livable urban areas.

#### 5.1c Case Studies in Adaptive Reuse

In this section, we will explore some case studies that illustrate the successful application of adaptive reuse in the context of reclaiming the industrial landscape. These case studies will provide practical examples of how adaptive reuse can be used to transform abandoned or underutilized industrial sites into productive and vibrant urban spaces.

##### Case Study 1: The High Line, New York City

The High Line is a 1.45-mile-long elevated linear park built on a former freight rail line in New York City. The rail line, which was abandoned in the 1980s, was at risk of demolition. However, a community-led effort to preserve and repurpose the rail line resulted in the creation of the High Line, which opened in 2009.

The High Line is a prime example of adaptive reuse. The abandoned rail line was transformed into a public park, creating a new use for the existing structure. This not only preserved a piece of the city's history but also created a new public space that enhances the quality of life for residents and visitors. The High Line also stimulated economic growth, attracting new businesses and residents to the surrounding area.

##### Case Study 2: The Brewery, Los Angeles

The Brewery is a live-work complex in Los Angeles that was originally a Pabst Blue Ribbon brewery. The brewery closed in 1977 and was at risk of demolition. However, in the 1980s, the property was purchased by a developer who transformed it into a live-work complex for artists.

The Brewery is another example of adaptive reuse. The abandoned industrial site was repurposed into a residential and commercial space, creating a new use for the existing buildings. This not only preserved the architectural and cultural heritage of the site but also provided affordable housing and workspace for artists, contributing to the cultural vibrancy of the city.

##### Case Study 3: The Battery Park City, New York City

Battery Park City is a 92-acre waterfront development in New York City that was built on a former landfill. The development, which was completed in the 1990s, includes residential, commercial, and public spaces.

Battery Park City is a unique example of adaptive reuse. The abandoned landfill was transformed into a productive urban space, creating a new use for the existing site. This not only reduced urban sprawl but also created a new community with a range of amenities, contributing to the quality of life for residents.

These case studies demonstrate the potential of adaptive reuse in reclaiming the industrial landscape. By repurposing existing buildings and sites, we can create new uses that enhance the quality of life for residents, stimulate economic growth, and preserve the cultural heritage of urban areas.

### Subsection: 8.1 Rethinking Urban Design Principles

#### 8.1a Understanding Urban Design Principles

Urban design principles are the fundamental concepts that guide the planning and design of cities. They are the rules and guidelines that urban designers use to create livable, sustainable, and functional cities. These principles are not set in stone, but rather, they are constantly evolving and adapting to the changing needs and desires of the people who inhabit the cities they create.

One of the key principles of urban design is conviviality, which refers to the social interaction that occurs in public domains. According to proponents of intelligent urbanism, vibrant societies are interactive, socially engaging, and offer their members numerous opportunities for gathering and meeting one another. This principle is achieved through the design of a hierarchy of places, each devised for a specific purpose, such as personal solace, companionship, romance, domesticity, "neighborliness," community, and civic life (Jacobs:1993).

Another important principle of urban design is the creation of places for the individual. These are the quiet spaces where one can escape to meditate and contemplate. These spaces may be in urban forests, along urban hills, beside quiet streams, in public gardens, and in parks. They are denoted and divined using ceremonial gates, directional walls, and other "silent devices." These spaces are crucial for introspection and self-analysis.

Friendship is also a key consideration in urban design. The axiom insists that in city plans there must be spaces for "beautiful, intimate friendship" where unfettered dialogue can happen. These spaces are essential for fostering strong social bonds and promoting a sense of community.

In the next section, we will explore how these principles are being rethought and reimagined in the context of the future of urban design.

#### 8.1b Challenging Urban Design Principles

As we delve deeper into the principles of urban design, it is important to challenge and question these principles. This is not to say that these principles are wrong, but rather to encourage a critical examination of these principles in the context of the ever-changing urban landscape.

The principle of conviviality, for instance, while it emphasizes the importance of social interaction in public domains, can be challenged on the grounds of inclusivity. What about those who are not comfortable in public spaces? What about those who prefer solitude? Should urban design principles force these individuals to interact in public spaces?

Similarly, the principle of creating places for the individual can be challenged on the grounds of efficiency. While these spaces are crucial for introspection and self-analysis, they can also be seen as a waste of valuable urban space. Could this space not be used for more productive purposes?

The principle of friendship, while it emphasizes the importance of social bonds, can be challenged on the grounds of diversity. What about those who do not have a strong network of friends? Should urban design principles exclude these individuals?

These challenges are not meant to dismiss these principles, but rather to encourage a more nuanced understanding of these principles. They are meant to prompt urban designers to think critically about these principles and to consider alternative perspectives.

In the next section, we will explore how these challenges are being addressed in the field of urban design. We will examine how urban designers are rethinking these principles in response to these challenges.

#### 8.1c Case Studies in Rethinking Urban Design Principles

In this section, we will explore some case studies that illustrate the process of rethinking urban design principles. These case studies will provide concrete examples of how urban designers are addressing the challenges posed by the principles of conviviality, creating places for the individual, and friendship.

##### Case Study 1: The High Line, New York City

The High Line is a 1.45-mile-long elevated linear park built on a former freight rail line in New York City. The park is a prime example of the principle of conviviality in action. The park is designed to facilitate social interaction, with a variety of public spaces that encourage people to gather and interact. The park also incorporates a hierarchy of places, with different sections designed for different purposes, such as relaxation, exercise, and socializing.

However, the High Line also challenges the principle of conviviality. The park is not accessible to everyone. Some sections are not wheelchair-friendly, and the park can be intimidating for those who are not comfortable in public spaces. This raises questions about the inclusivity of the park and the principle of conviviality.

##### Case Study 2: The Biosphere, Montreal

The Biosphere is a sustainable development project in Montreal that aims to create a self-sufficient, zero-waste community. The project incorporates the principle of creating places for the individual by providing a variety of private and public spaces. However, the project also challenges the principle of efficiency. The project requires a significant amount of urban space, which could be seen as a waste of valuable resources.

##### Case Study 3: The Friendship Bench, Harare

The Friendship Bench is a public bench in Harare, Zimbabwe, designed to promote social interaction and friendship. The bench is a prime example of the principle of friendship in action. However, the bench also challenges the principle of diversity. The bench is designed for those who have a strong network of friends, excluding those who do not. This raises questions about the inclusivity of the bench and the principle of friendship.

These case studies illustrate the complexities of rethinking urban design principles. They highlight the need for a nuanced understanding of these principles and the importance of considering alternative perspectives. In the next section, we will explore some potential solutions to these challenges.




#### 8.2a Collaborative Approaches to Urban Planning and Design

Collaborative approaches to urban planning and design have gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in the United States. These approaches are designed to empower stakeholders by elevating them to the level of decision-makers through direct engagement and dialogue between stakeholders and public agencies. This is in contrast to traditional public participation techniques, which have been criticized for not providing real opportunities for the public to make decisions affecting their communities.

Collaborative planning is a method that can result in more meaningful participation and better, more creative outcomes to persistent problems than traditional participation methods. It enables planners to make decisions that reflect community needs and values, fosters faith in the wisdom and utility of the resulting project, and gives the community a personal stake in its success.

However, successful collaborative planning depends on a number of interrelated factors. These include:

1. True inclusivity: All stakeholders and affected groups must be invited to the table.
2. Final decision-making authority for the community.
3. Full government commitment, both financially and intellectually.
4. Clear objectives provided by planning staff, who facilitate the process by providing guidance, consultancy, expert opinions, and research.
5. Trained facilitators who are skilled in conflict resolution and community organization.

Experiences in Portland and Seattle have demonstrated that these factors are crucial for successful collaborative planning. They have also shown that collaborative planning can lead to more sustainable and livable cities, as it allows for the integration of diverse perspectives and needs.

In the next section, we will explore how these collaborative approaches are being applied in the context of urban design, and how they are helping to redefine the principles and practices of urban design.

### Subsection: 19.1 Urban Design for Sustainable Cities

#### 19.1a Understanding Urban Design for Sustainable Cities

Urban design plays a crucial role in creating sustainable cities. It is the process of shaping the physical features of a city to create a livable, functional, and environmentally friendly urban environment. Urban design is not just about making a city look good; it is about creating a city that is sustainable in the long term. This involves considering the environmental, social, and economic impacts of urban development.

Sustainable urban design is about creating cities that meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This involves balancing economic, social, and environmental considerations to create cities that are not only functional but also equitable and environmentally friendly.

One of the key principles of sustainable urban design is density. By increasing the density of a city, we can reduce the environmental impact of urban development. This is because higher density developments often require less land, which means less habitat destruction and less energy is required to service the development. Higher density also encourages more efficient use of resources, as people living in close proximity can share resources more easily.

Another important principle is mixed-use development. Mixed-use developments, where residential, commercial, and recreational spaces are integrated, can reduce the need for travel and therefore reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. This is because people can access all their needs within a short distance, reducing the need for cars and other forms of transportation.

Public transportation is also a key component of sustainable urban design. By providing efficient and accessible public transportation systems, we can reduce the number of cars on the road and therefore reduce traffic congestion, air pollution, and energy consumption.

Green infrastructure is another important aspect of sustainable urban design. This involves incorporating natural systems, such as green roofs, rain gardens, and permeable pavements, into the urban environment. These systems can help to mitigate the environmental impacts of urban development, such as the urban heat island effect and stormwater runoff.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these principles and explore how they can be applied in urban design practice. We will also look at other strategies and technologies that can contribute to creating more sustainable cities.

#### 19.1b Principles of Urban Design for Sustainable Cities

The principles of urban design for sustainable cities are based on the concept of sustainability, which is defined as the ability to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This concept is often referred to as the three pillars of sustainability: environmental, social, and economic. 

Environmental sustainability involves designing cities in a way that minimizes their impact on the natural environment. This can be achieved through various means, such as reducing energy consumption, promoting renewable energy sources, and implementing green infrastructure. For example, the use of self-healing technology can reduce maintenance and improve the sustainability of urban developments by protecting surrounding paving and foundations from damage when items of infrastructure are impacted (Ottosson, S).

Social sustainability focuses on creating cities that are equitable and inclusive. This involves designing cities in a way that meets the needs of all members of the community, regardless of their socio-economic status, age, or ability. Mixed-use development, for instance, can promote social sustainability by providing a range of housing options and services within close proximity, making it easier for people from different backgrounds to access the resources they need.

Economic sustainability involves designing cities in a way that promotes economic growth and prosperity. This can be achieved through various means, such as creating job opportunities, promoting entrepreneurship, and attracting investment. For example, the implementation of smart grid technologies can create new economic opportunities, such as the development of a green economy based on renewable energy sources.

In addition to these three pillars, there are also other important principles of urban design for sustainable cities. These include resilience, adaptability, and adaptability. Resilience refers to the ability of a city to withstand and recover from shocks and stresses, such as natural disasters or economic downturns. Adaptability refers to the ability of a city to respond to changing circumstances and needs. Adaptability, on the other hand, refers to the ability of a city to evolve and adapt to new challenges and opportunities.

In the next section, we will explore how these principles can be applied in practice to create sustainable cities.

### Subsection: 19.2 Urban Design and Circular Economy

#### 19.2a Understanding Urban Design and Circular Economy

The concept of circular economy is a key aspect of sustainable urban design. A circular economy is an economic system aimed at eliminating waste and promoting the continual use of resources. This is achieved through the design of products and systems that are restorative and regenerative, creating closed-loop systems that minimize the use of virgin resources and maximize the reuse and recycling of materials.

In the context of urban design, the circular economy can be applied to the design of buildings, infrastructure, and urban systems. This involves considering the entire life cycle of these elements, from their initial design and construction, through their use phase, and finally their end-of-life management. By designing for the circular economy, we can create urban environments that are not only functional and aesthetically pleasing, but also sustainable and resilient.

One of the key principles of circular urban design is the design of products and systems for disassembly and reuse. This involves designing buildings, infrastructure, and urban systems in a way that facilitates their disassembly and the recovery of materials for reuse. This can be achieved through modular design, where different components of a building or infrastructure can be easily disassembled and replaced, or through the use of materials that can be easily separated and recycled.

Another important aspect of circular urban design is the design of urban systems for resource efficiency. This involves designing urban systems, such as energy, water, and waste management systems, in a way that minimizes resource consumption and maximizes resource recovery. For example, by designing energy systems that are decentralized and based on renewable energy sources, we can reduce the environmental impact of energy production and consumption. Similarly, by designing water systems that are decentralized and based on water reuse and recycling, we can reduce the strain on water resources and minimize water pollution.

In conclusion, the circular economy is a key aspect of sustainable urban design. By applying the principles of the circular economy to urban design, we can create urban environments that are not only functional and aesthetically pleasing, but also sustainable and resilient. This involves designing products and systems for disassembly and reuse, and designing urban systems for resource efficiency. By doing so, we can create a future where our cities are not only places to live, but also places to thrive.

#### 19.2b Role of Urban Design in Circular Economy

Urban design plays a crucial role in the implementation of circular economy principles. It is through the design of urban spaces and systems that we can create a circular economy, where resources are used efficiently and sustainably. 

One of the key roles of urban design in the circular economy is the design of buildings and infrastructure for disassembly and reuse. This involves incorporating modular design principles, where different components of a building or infrastructure can be easily disassembled and replaced. This not only facilitates the recovery of materials for reuse, but also reduces the environmental impact of construction and demolition. 

For instance, the design of a modular building can involve the use of standardized components that can be easily assembled and disassembled. This allows for the reconfiguration of the building to meet changing needs, and the recovery of materials for reuse when the building is demolished. This approach can significantly reduce the amount of waste generated during construction and demolition, and contribute to the circular economy.

Another important role of urban design in the circular economy is the design of urban systems for resource efficiency. This involves designing urban systems, such as energy, water, and waste management systems, in a way that minimizes resource consumption and maximizes resource recovery. For example, the design of a decentralized energy system can involve the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, and the incorporation of energy storage systems to balance energy demand and supply. This can significantly reduce the environmental impact of energy production and consumption, and contribute to the circular economy.

In conclusion, urban design plays a crucial role in the implementation of circular economy principles. By incorporating circular economy principles into urban design, we can create urban environments that are not only functional and aesthetically pleasing, but also sustainable and resilient. This involves the design of buildings and infrastructure for disassembly and reuse, and the design of urban systems for resource efficiency.
