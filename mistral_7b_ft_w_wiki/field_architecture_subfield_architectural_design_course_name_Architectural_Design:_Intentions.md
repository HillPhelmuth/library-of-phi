# Architectural Design: Intentions":


## Foreward

Welcome to "Architectural Design: Intentions", a comprehensive exploration of the principles, processes, and applications of architectural design. This book aims to provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental concepts and methodologies that guide architectural design, and how they are applied in practice.

The book is structured around the concept of architectural design values, which are the principles and intentions that guide architects and designers in their decision-making processes. These values are not static, but evolve over time and across different architectural movements and schools of thought. They are also influenced by a variety of factors, including cultural, social, economic, and environmental considerations.

The book begins by exploring the concept of architectural design values, and how they are shaped by the pluralism in design outcomes that exists within architecture and design. It delves into the differences in values and intentions between different architectural movements and schools of architecture, and how these differences are reflected in the diverse aesthetic realities within these domains.

The book then moves on to discuss the principles and processes of architectural design, including the role of aesthetics, functionality, sustainability, and user experience in the design process. It also examines the various methodologies and tools used in architectural design, such as computer-aided design (CAD), building information modeling (BIM), and virtual design and construction (VDC).

Finally, the book looks at the applications of architectural design, exploring how these principles, processes, and methodologies are applied in practice. It examines case studies from a variety of architectural contexts, including residential, commercial, and public buildings, as well as urban planning and landscape design.

"Architectural Design: Intentions" is intended for advanced undergraduate students at MIT, but it is also a valuable resource for professionals in the field of architecture and design. It is our hope that this book will not only deepen your understanding of architectural design, but also inspire you to think critically and creatively about the built environment.

Thank you for joining us on this journey through the world of architectural design. We hope you find this book informative and engaging.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the concept of architectural design intentions and how they shape the design process. We have discussed the importance of understanding the intentions behind a design, as they can greatly influence the outcome and success of a project. We have also examined the role of the architect in translating these intentions into a tangible design, and the challenges that may arise in this process.

Through our exploration, we have seen that architectural design intentions are not always clear or easily defined. They can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the client's needs, the site conditions, and the architect's personal style and philosophy. As such, it is crucial for architects to have a deep understanding of their own intentions and how they align with the project at hand.

As we move forward in our study of architectural design, it is important to keep in mind the concept of intentions and how they guide our design decisions. By understanding and articulating our intentions, we can create more meaningful and successful designs that truly reflect the needs and desires of our clients and the surrounding community.

### Exercises
#### Exercise 1
Reflect on a past design project and identify the intentions that guided your design decisions. How did these intentions shape the final outcome of the project?

#### Exercise 2
Choose a building or structure in your local area and research the architectural design intentions behind its creation. How do these intentions align with the building's function and context?

#### Exercise 3
Consider a hypothetical design project and create a list of potential design intentions. Discuss how these intentions may influence the design process and outcome.

#### Exercise 4
Interview an architect and ask them about their design intentions and how they translate them into a tangible design. What challenges do they face in this process?

#### Exercise 5
Research a controversial architectural design and analyze the intentions behind it. How do these intentions contribute to the controversy surrounding the design?

## Chapter: Architectural Design: Intentions

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we explored the concept of architectural design and its various aspects. We discussed the importance of understanding the context and constraints of a project, as well as the role of creativity and innovation in the design process. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of architectural design and focus on the intentions behind it.

Intentions play a crucial role in the design process, as they guide the decisions and choices made by the architect. They are the driving force behind the design and can greatly impact the final outcome. In this chapter, we will explore the different types of intentions that can influence architectural design, such as functional, aesthetic, and sustainable intentions.

We will also discuss how these intentions can be translated into design solutions, and how they can be balanced and integrated to create a cohesive and successful design. Additionally, we will examine the importance of considering the intentions of all stakeholders involved in the project, including the client, the community, and the environment.

By understanding the intentions behind architectural design, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the design process and the role of the architect. We can also learn how to effectively communicate and collaborate with other professionals involved in the project, leading to more successful and impactful designs. So let us dive into the world of architectural design intentions and discover the power and influence they hold.

## Chapter 2: Design Process:




### Introduction

In the realm of architectural design, the process of creating a structure is a complex and intricate one. It involves not only the physical construction of the building, but also the careful consideration of various factors such as functionality, aesthetics, and sustainability. This chapter, "Drawing and Design," delves into the fundamental aspects of architectural design, focusing on the initial stages of the design process.

The chapter begins by exploring the role of drawing in architectural design. Drawing is a fundamental tool in the architect's arsenal, allowing them to visualize and communicate their design ideas. It is through these drawings that architects can effectively convey their design intentions to clients, engineers, and other stakeholders. The chapter will discuss the different types of drawings used in architectural design, such as schematic drawings, working drawings, and construction drawings, and how each serves a specific purpose in the design process.

Following this, the chapter will delve into the design process itself. This includes the initial conceptualization of the design, the development of the design, and the finalization of the design. Each of these stages will be explored in detail, providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of the design process.

Throughout the chapter, the importance of intentionality in architectural design will be emphasized. Intentionality refers to the conscious and deliberate decisions made by the architect in the design process. These decisions are not merely random choices, but rather, they are informed by the architect's understanding of the project's context, the building's function, and the architect's design philosophy.

In conclusion, this chapter aims to provide readers with a solid foundation in the principles and processes of architectural design. By understanding the role of drawing in architectural design and the stages of the design process, readers will be better equipped to create meaningful and intentional architectural designs.




### Section: 2.1 Set-up Space:

#### 2.1a Space Requirements

The first step in setting up a space for architectural design is understanding the space requirements. These requirements are determined by the intended function of the space, the number of people who will be using the space, and the specific design considerations of the project.

For instance, a small studio apartment may require a different set of space requirements than a large office building. The studio apartment may need to accommodate a bedroom, living room, and kitchen, while the office building may need to accommodate multiple workspaces, meeting rooms, and common areas.

In addition to the physical requirements, there are also psychological requirements to consider. For example, the concept of "desire lines" in architecture refers to the paths that people naturally take when moving through a space, often deviating from the intended path. Understanding these desire lines can inform the design of the space, creating a more intuitive and user-friendly environment.

The space requirements are not static, but rather evolve as the design process progresses. As the design evolves, the space requirements may change, and the architect must be prepared to adapt the design accordingly.

In the next section, we will discuss how to translate these space requirements into a set of design parameters, which will guide the architectural design process.

#### 2.1b Space Planning

Once the space requirements have been established, the next step is space planning. This involves organizing the space in a way that meets the established requirements while also creating a functional and aesthetically pleasing environment.

Space planning is a complex process that involves a deep understanding of the principles of architectural design. It requires the architect to consider a wide range of factors, including the intended function of the space, the needs and preferences of the users, the available resources, and the constraints of the project.

One of the key tools in space planning is the use of architectural drawings. These drawings provide a visual representation of the space, allowing the architect to test different design ideas and make necessary adjustments. They also serve as a communication tool, allowing the architect to effectively convey their design intentions to clients, engineers, and other stakeholders.

In the context of the MacBook Air (Intel-based) and PowerBook G4, space planning can be particularly challenging due to the limited space available. However, it also presents an opportunity for creative solutions, as the architect must find ways to maximize the available space while still meeting the established space requirements.

For instance, the MacBook Air (Intel-based) has a small form factor, which can be both a challenge and an opportunity. On one hand, it presents a limited space for design, but on the other hand, it allows for a more intimate and personal design experience. The architect must find ways to make the most of this limited space, creating a design that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

Similarly, the PowerBook G4, with its small size and light weight, presents a unique set of space planning challenges. The architect must find ways to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing design within this limited space, while also taking into account the specific needs and preferences of the user.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the key principles and strategies for effective space planning in architectural design.

#### 2.1c Space Standards

After establishing the space requirements and planning the space, the next step is to consider space standards. Space standards are guidelines that define the minimum and maximum dimensions for different types of spaces within a building. These standards are often set by building codes and regulations, and they are designed to ensure the safety and functionality of the building.

In the context of architectural design, space standards are an important consideration. They provide a framework for the design of the space, helping the architect to create a design that is both functional and compliant with building codes and regulations.

For instance, the MacBook Air (Intel-based) and PowerBook G4, both have specific space standards that must be considered in the design process. These standards include the minimum and maximum dimensions for the device, as well as the minimum and maximum dimensions for the display. These standards are set by the manufacturer and are designed to ensure the functionality and safety of the device.

In addition to these manufacturer-specific standards, there are also industry-wide space standards that must be considered. These include the minimum and maximum dimensions for different types of spaces within a building, such as bedrooms, living rooms, and kitchens. These standards are set by building codes and regulations, and they are designed to ensure the safety and functionality of the building.

When designing a space, it is important for the architect to consider these space standards. They provide a framework for the design, helping the architect to create a design that is both functional and compliant with building codes and regulations. However, it is also important for the architect to consider these standards in a flexible and creative way, using them as a starting point for the design rather than a strict set of rules.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the key principles and strategies for effective space design in architectural design.

#### 2.1d Space Categories

After establishing the space requirements, planning the space, and considering space standards, the next step in architectural design is to categorize the space. Space categorization is a crucial part of the design process as it helps to define the purpose and function of different areas within the building. This categorization is often based on the intended use of the space, such as living areas, sleeping areas, or working areas.

In the context of architectural design, space categorization is an important consideration. It provides a framework for the design of the space, helping the architect to create a design that is both functional and compliant with building codes and regulations.

For instance, the MacBook Air (Intel-based) and PowerBook G4, both have specific space categories that must be considered in the design process. These categories include the living area, the sleeping area, and the working area. These categories are defined by the manufacturer and are designed to ensure the functionality and safety of the device.

In addition to these manufacturer-specific categories, there are also industry-wide space categories that must be considered. These include the living area, the sleeping area, and the working area. These categories are set by building codes and regulations, and they are designed to ensure the safety and functionality of the building.

When categorizing a space, it is important for the architect to consider the intended use of the space. This can be determined by the client, the function of the building, or the specific requirements of the project. Once the space has been categorized, the architect can then use this information to guide the design of the space.

For example, if a space is categorized as a living area, the architect might consider including features such as a comfortable seating area, a television, and a coffee table. If a space is categorized as a sleeping area, the architect might consider including features such as a bed, a nightstand, and a closet.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the key principles and strategies for effective space categorization in architectural design.

#### 2.1e Space Planning Strategies

After categorizing the space, the next step in architectural design is to develop a space planning strategy. Space planning strategies are a set of principles and techniques used to organize and arrange the space within a building. These strategies are designed to create a functional and efficient layout that meets the needs and requirements of the users.

In the context of architectural design, space planning strategies are an important consideration. They provide a framework for the design of the space, helping the architect to create a design that is both functional and compliant with building codes and regulations.

For instance, the MacBook Air (Intel-based) and PowerBook G4, both have specific space planning strategies that must be considered in the design process. These strategies include the use of modular furniture, flexible layouts, and multi-functional spaces. These strategies are designed to maximize the use of space and create a flexible and adaptable environment.

In addition to these manufacturer-specific strategies, there are also industry-wide space planning strategies that must be considered. These include the use of open-plan layouts, the integration of natural light, and the use of sustainable materials. These strategies are set by building codes and regulations, and they are designed to ensure the safety and functionality of the building.

When developing a space planning strategy, it is important for the architect to consider the specific needs and requirements of the users. This can be determined by conducting a space needs analysis, which involves identifying the activities that will take place in the space, the number of people who will use the space, and the desired level of privacy and comfort.

Once the space needs have been identified, the architect can then use this information to develop a space planning strategy. This strategy should be based on the principles of functionality, efficiency, and sustainability. It should also consider the space standards and categories that have been established for the project.

For example, if the space needs analysis reveals that the space will be used for both working and relaxing, the architect might consider using a flexible layout that can be easily reconfigured to accommodate different activities. This could involve using modular furniture that can be easily moved and rearranged, or creating a multi-functional space that can be used for both work and relaxation.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the key principles and strategies for effective space planning in architectural design.

#### 2.1f Space Design Techniques

After developing a space planning strategy, the next step in architectural design is to apply space design techniques. Space design techniques are a set of methods and tools used to create a detailed design of the space. These techniques are designed to translate the space planning strategy into a tangible and practical design.

In the context of architectural design, space design techniques are an important consideration. They provide a means for the architect to communicate their design intentions to the client, the construction team, and the end-users. They also allow the architect to test and refine their design ideas, ensuring that the final design meets the needs and requirements of the users.

For instance, the MacBook Air (Intel-based) and PowerBook G4, both have specific space design techniques that must be considered in the design process. These techniques include the use of computer-aided design (CAD) software, the creation of 3D models, and the use of virtual reality (VR) technology. These techniques are designed to provide a realistic and immersive representation of the space, allowing the architect to visualize and test their design ideas.

In addition to these manufacturer-specific techniques, there are also industry-wide space design techniques that must be considered. These include the use of building information modeling (BIM), the integration of sustainability metrics, and the use of lean product development principles. These techniques are set by industry standards and best practices, and they are designed to ensure the quality and efficiency of the design process.

When applying space design techniques, it is important for the architect to consider the specific needs and requirements of the users. This can be determined by conducting a space needs analysis, which involves identifying the activities that will take place in the space, the number of people who will use the space, and the desired level of privacy and comfort.

This process is essential as it sets the foundation for the schematic design, where the architect begins to translate these functional requirements into spatial solutions.

Schematic design, on the other hand, is a creative and iterative process where the architect explores various spatial solutions to meet the programmatic requirements. It is a phase where the architect begins to visualize the building in three dimensions, and refines the design based on the principles of functionality, efficiency, and aesthetics.

In this chapter, we will explore the methodologies and tools used in programming and schematic design, and how these processes are interconnected. We will also discuss the role of collaboration and communication in these processes, and how they contribute to the overall success of the architectural design.

As we delve deeper into the world of architectural design, it is important to remember that programming and schematic design are not isolated processes. They are part of a larger design process that involves a series of iterations and refinements. By understanding and mastering these processes, architects can create buildings that are not only functional and efficient, but also aesthetically pleasing and responsive to the needs of their occupants.
