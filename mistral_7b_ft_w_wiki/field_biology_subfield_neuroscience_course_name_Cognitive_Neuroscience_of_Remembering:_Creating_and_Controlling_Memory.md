## Foreward

Welcome to "The Comprehensive Guide to Cognitive Neuroscience of Remembering: Creating and Controlling Memory". This book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the cognitive and neural processes involved in remembering, and how we can use this knowledge to create and control our memories.

The study of memory is a vast and complex field, with numerous theories and models proposed by researchers. In this book, we will delve into the intricacies of these theories and models, exploring their strengths and limitations, and how they contribute to our understanding of memory.

One such theory is the "remember" versus "know" model, which proposes that our judgments of familiarity are accompanied by retrieval of partial contextual details. This model suggests that when we "remember" something, we are able to differentiate the corresponding source correctly, while "know" responses are accompanied by a loss of memory for episodic detail.

Another important aspect of memory is the role of eye movements. Experiments have shown that individuals who are better at remembering tend to have more clustered eye fixations, suggesting a link between eye movements and memory encoding.

This book will also explore the concept of source memory, which is the ability to recall the source of a memory. This is a crucial aspect of memory, as it allows us to distinguish between our own memories and those of others.

Throughout this book, we will also discuss the implications of these theories and models for our understanding of memory disorders and how we can use this knowledge to develop effective memory interventions.

I hope this book will serve as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and anyone interested in the fascinating field of cognitive neuroscience of remembering. Let us embark on this journey together, exploring the intricacies of memory and how we can harness its power to create and control our own memories.

### Subsection: 1.2 PFC and Cognitive Control I

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a crucial role in cognitive control, which is the ability to control one's thoughts and actions. This section will delve into the specifics of how the PFC contributes to cognitive control, with a focus on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).

#### 1.2a PFC and Cognitive Control

The DLPFC is a region of the PFC that is particularly involved in cognitive control. It is responsible for maintaining and updating information in working memory, which is a crucial aspect of cognitive control. Working memory is the ability to hold and manipulate information in our minds for a short period of time. It is essential for tasks that require us to keep track of multiple pieces of information, such as mental arithmetic or following instructions.

The DLPFC also plays a role in inhibitory control, which is the ability to suppress inappropriate or distracting information. This is crucial for tasks that require us to focus on a specific aspect of a stimulus, such as the Stroop color-word task. In this task, participants are asked to name the color of the ink in which a word is printed, even if the word itself is a different color. This task requires participants to inhibit their automatic response to read the word and instead focus on the color of the ink.

The DLPFC is also involved in cognitive flexibility, which is the ability to switch between different cognitive sets or rules. This is crucial for tasks that require us to adapt to changing circumstances, such as the Eriksen flanker task. In this task, participants are asked to identify the direction of a central arrow, surrounded by other arrows pointing in different directions. This task requires participants to switch their attention between the central arrow and the flanking arrows, depending on the task instructions.

The DLPFC is thought to contribute to these aspects of cognitive control through its connections with other brain regions. For instance, it is connected to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which is involved in error detection and conflict monitoring. The DLPFC also has connections with the parietal lobe, which is involved in integrating sensory information.

In the next section, we will explore how the PFC contributes to emotional control, another important aspect of cognitive control.

#### 1.2b PFC and Cognitive Control II

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) continues to play a crucial role in cognitive control, particularly in the context of emotional control. The PFC, specifically the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), is involved in the regulation of emotional responses. This is particularly important in situations where emotional responses may interfere with cognitive control.

The OFC is thought to be involved in the processing of reward and punishment, which are key factors in emotional control. It is also involved in decision making, particularly in situations where decisions have emotional implications. For instance, in the Iowa Gambling Task, participants are asked to make decisions about which decks of cards to choose from, with the knowledge that some decks are associated with larger immediate rewards but larger future losses. The OFC is thought to be involved in the processing of this information and in the decision-making process.

The OFC is also involved in the processing of social information. This is particularly important in the context of emotional control, as social interactions often involve complex emotional dynamics. For instance, in the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, participants are asked to identify the emotions expressed in a series of photographs of people's eyes. The OFC is thought to be involved in this task, particularly in the interpretation of subtle emotional cues.

The PFC, particularly the OFC, is also involved in the regulation of behavior. This is particularly important in situations where behavioral responses may be influenced by emotional factors. For instance, in the Go/No-Go task, participants are asked to respond to a series of stimuli, with the instruction to respond to some stimuli and not to respond to others. The PFC, particularly the OFC, is thought to be involved in this task, particularly in the inhibition of inappropriate responses.

In conclusion, the PFC plays a crucial role in cognitive control, particularly in the context of emotional control. Its involvement in cognitive control is thought to be mediated by its connections with other brain regions, particularly the ACC and the parietal lobe. Future research will continue to explore the specific mechanisms by which the PFC contributes to cognitive control.

#### 1.2c PFC and Cognitive Control III

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) continues to be a key player in cognitive control, particularly in the context of cognitive flexibility. The PFC, specifically the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), is involved in the ability to switch between different cognitive sets or rules. This is crucial for tasks that require us to adapt to changing circumstances, such as the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test.

The DLPFC is thought to be involved in the maintenance and manipulation of information in working memory. This is particularly important in tasks that require us to hold and manipulate information in our minds for a short period of time. For instance, in the N-back task, participants are asked to compare a series of stimuli presented on a computer screen with a stimulus presented N trials back. The DLPFC is thought to be involved in this task, particularly in the maintenance and manipulation of the stimuli in working memory.

The DLPFC is also involved in the processing of complex information. This is particularly important in tasks that require us to make decisions based on complex information, such as the Tower of London task. In this task, participants are asked to rearrange a series of colored balls on a board according to a specific rule. The DLPFC is thought to be involved in this task, particularly in the processing of the rule and in the planning and execution of the rearrangement.

The PFC, particularly the DLPFC, is also involved in the regulation of behavior. This is particularly important in situations where behavioral responses may be influenced by cognitive factors. For instance, in the Stroop color-word task, participants are asked to name the color of a word printed in a color that may or may not match the meaning of the word. The PFC, particularly the DLPFC, is thought to be involved in this task, particularly in the inhibition of the automatic response to read the word and the execution of the correct response.

In conclusion, the PFC plays a crucial role in cognitive control, particularly in the context of cognitive flexibility. Its involvement in cognitive control is thought to be mediated by its connections with other brain regions, particularly the ACC and the parietal lobe. Future research will continue to explore the specific mechanisms by which the PFC contributes to cognitive control.

## Chapter: Chapter 2: Hippocampus and Episodic Memory

### Introduction

The hippocampus, a small seahorse-shaped structure deep within the brain, plays a pivotal role in the formation of new memories, particularly episodic memories. Episodic memory refers to the recall of specific events or experiences that occurred in the past. This chapter, "Hippocampus and Episodic Memory," delves into the intricate relationship between the hippocampus and episodic memory, exploring how the hippocampus facilitates the encoding, storage, and retrieval of episodic memories.

The hippocampus is a complex structure that is integral to the process of memory formation. It is responsible for the conversion of short-term memories into long-term memories. This process, known as consolidation, is crucial for the permanent storage of memories. The hippocampus also plays a key role in the retrieval of memories, particularly those that are emotionally charged or complex.

Episodic memory, on the other hand, is a type of memory that allows us to recall specific events or experiences from our past. It is a form of autobiographical memory, and it is often the first type of memory that children develop. Episodic memory is particularly vulnerable to damage or disease, and disruptions in episodic memory can have profound impacts on an individual's daily life.

In this chapter, we will explore the anatomy and function of the hippocampus, and how it contributes to episodic memory. We will also discuss the role of the hippocampus in learning and memory disorders, and how research in this area is advancing our understanding of these conditions.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a comprehensive understanding of the hippocampus and its role in episodic memory, as well as the broader implications of this research for our understanding of learning and memory.
