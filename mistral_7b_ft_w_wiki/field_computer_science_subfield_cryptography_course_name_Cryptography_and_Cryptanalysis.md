### Section: 1.1 Basic Protocols:

Public-key encryption is a powerful tool that allows for secure communication over insecure channels. In this section, we will explore the basic protocols used in public-key encryption, including key generation, encryption, and decryption.

#### 1.1a Overview

Public-key encryption is a type of asymmetric encryption, where the encryption and decryption keys are different. This is in contrast to symmetric encryption, where the encryption and decryption keys are the same. The use of different keys in public-key encryption provides a level of security that is not possible with symmetric encryption.

The basic protocols used in public-key encryption include key generation, encryption, and decryption. These protocols are used to generate and distribute public and private keys, encrypt and decrypt messages, and verify the authenticity of a message.

Key generation is the process of creating a public and private key pair. This is done using a mathematical algorithm, such as the RSA algorithm, which takes in a large prime number and generates a public and private key pair. The public key is then distributed to the sender, while the private key is kept secret by the receiver.

Encryption is the process of converting a plaintext message into a ciphertext message. This is done using the public key of the receiver. The sender encrypts the message using the receiver's public key, which is publicly available. This ensures that only the receiver, who has the corresponding private key, can decrypt the message.

Decryption is the process of converting a ciphertext message back into a plaintext message. This is done using the private key of the receiver. The receiver uses their private key to decrypt the ciphertext message, revealing the original plaintext message.

In addition to these basic protocols, there are also more advanced protocols used in public-key encryption, such as key exchange and digital signatures. Key exchange is used to securely exchange public keys between two parties, while digital signatures are used to authenticate the sender of a message.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical foundations of public-key encryption and explore the different types of public-key encryption algorithms.

#### 1.1b Key Generation

Key generation is a crucial step in the public-key encryption process. It is the process of creating a public and private key pair, which are used for encryption and decryption. The key generation process is based on the principles of modular arithmetic and the concept of a trapdoor function.

The key generation process begins with the selection of a large prime number, typically of at least 1024 bits. This prime number is used as the modulus in the RSA algorithm. The RSA algorithm then uses this modulus to generate a public and private key pair.

The public key, denoted as $e$, is a small integer that is co-prime to the modulus. It is used for encryption and is publicly available. The private key, denoted as $d$, is a large integer that is the inverse of $e$ modulo the modulus. It is used for decryption and is kept secret by the receiver.

The key generation process also involves the selection of a random number, denoted as $p$, which is used as the seed for the random number generator. This random number is used to generate the private key $d$ and the public key $e$.

The key generation process is repeated multiple times to ensure that the resulting key pair is unique and secure. The resulting public and private keys are then used for encryption and decryption in the public-key encryption protocol.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of public-key encryption algorithms and their respective strengths and weaknesses.

#### 1.1c Encryption and Decryption

Encryption and decryption are the fundamental operations in public-key encryption. These operations are used to securely transmit information over an insecure channel. In this section, we will explore the encryption and decryption processes in detail.

##### Encryption

Encryption is the process of converting a plaintext message into a ciphertext message. This is done using the public key of the receiver, which is publicly available. The sender encrypts the message using the receiver's public key, which ensures that only the receiver, who has the corresponding private key, can decrypt the message.

The encryption process begins with the conversion of the plaintext message into a numerical representation. This is typically done using the ASCII or Unicode encoding schemes. The numerical representation of the message is then raised to the power of the public key $e$ modulo the modulus $n$. This results in the ciphertext message.

Mathematically, the encryption process can be represented as:

$$
c = m^e \mod n
$$

where $c$ is the ciphertext message, $m$ is the plaintext message, and $e$ and $n$ are the public and modulus keys, respectively.

##### Decryption

Decryption is the process of converting a ciphertext message back into a plaintext message. This is done using the private key of the receiver, which is kept secret. The receiver uses their private key $d$ to decrypt the ciphertext message, revealing the original plaintext message.

The decryption process begins with the conversion of the ciphertext message into a numerical representation. This is then raised to the power of the private key $d$ modulo the modulus $n$. This results in the plaintext message.

Mathematically, the decryption process can be represented as:

$$
m = c^d \mod n
$$

where $m$ is the plaintext message, $c$ is the ciphertext message, and $d$ and $n$ are the private and modulus keys, respectively.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of public-key encryption algorithms and their respective strengths and weaknesses.

#### 1.1d Key Exchange

Key exchange is a crucial aspect of public-key encryption, particularly in the context of secure communication over an insecure channel. It is the process by which two parties, Alice and Bob, can establish a shared secret key that can be used for symmetric encryption. This shared key is used to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data.

##### Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

One of the most widely used key exchange protocols is the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange. This protocol allows Alice and Bob to establish a shared secret key without the risk of an eavesdropper intercepting the key.

The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange begins with Alice and Bob agreeing on a common modulus $n$ and a generator $g$ of the multiplicative group of integers modulo $n$. Alice then chooses a secret key $a$ and computes $A = g^a \mod n$. Similarly, Bob chooses a secret key $b$ and computes $B = g^b \mod n$.

Alice then sends $A$ to Bob, and Bob sends $B$ to Alice. Alice can then compute the shared secret key $K = B^a \mod n$, and Bob can compute the shared secret key $K = A^b \mod n$.

The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange is secure against eavesdropping because an eavesdropper, Eve, would not be able to compute the shared secret key $K$ even if she intercepts $A$ and $B$. This is because Eve does not know the secret keys $a$ and $b$ used by Alice and Bob, respectively.

##### RSA Key Exchange

Another popular key exchange protocol is the RSA Key Exchange. This protocol is based on the RSA cryptosystem, which is a public-key encryption system.

The RSA Key Exchange begins with Alice and Bob agreeing on a public key $e$ and a private key $d$ such that $ed = 1 \mod \phi(n)$, where $n$ is the modulus and $\phi(n)$ is the Euler's totient function. Alice then sends her public key $e$ to Bob, and Bob sends his public key $e$ to Alice.

Alice can then compute the shared secret key $K = m^d \mod n$, where $m$ is a random message chosen by Alice. Similarly, Bob can compute the shared secret key $K = m^d \mod n$.

The RSA Key Exchange is secure against eavesdropping because an eavesdropper, Eve, would not be able to compute the shared secret key $K$ even if she intercepts the public keys $e$ and the message $m$. This is because Eve does not know the private key $d$ used by Alice and Bob, respectively.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of public-key encryption algorithms and their respective strengths and weaknesses.

#### 1.1e Digital Signatures

Digital signatures are an essential component of public-key encryption, providing a means for a sender to authenticate a message and ensure its integrity. They are used in a variety of applications, including secure communication, electronic commerce, and digital rights management.

##### RSA Digital Signature

The RSA Digital Signature is a widely used digital signature scheme based on the RSA cryptosystem. It allows a sender, Alice, to sign a message $m$ using her private key $d$ and her public key $e$. The signed message, denoted as $s$, is computed as:

$$
s = m^d \mod n
$$

where $n$ is the modulus and $e$ and $d$ are the public and private keys, respectively.

The signed message $s$ can then be sent to a receiver, Bob, along with the message $m$. Bob can verify the authenticity of the message by computing:

$$
s^e \mod n = m^e \mod n = m
$$

where $e$ is the public key. If the result is equal to the message $m$, Bob can be assured that the message was indeed signed by Alice.

The RSA Digital Signature is secure against forgery because an adversary, Eve, would not be able to compute the signature $s$ even if she intercepts the message $m$ and the public key $e$. This is because Eve does not know the private key $d$ used by Alice.

##### ECDSA Digital Signature

The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is another popular digital signature scheme. It is based on the elliptic curve cryptography and is used in applications where low computational complexity is required.

The ECDSA Digital Signature begins with Alice choosing a random nonce $k$ and computing the signature $r$ and $s$ as:

$$
r = (x \mod n) + 1
$$

$$
s = k^{-1} \mod n
$$

where $x$ is the $x$-coordinate of the point $Q = kG$ on the elliptic curve, $G$ is the generator of the curve, and $n$ is the order of the curve.

The signature $r$ and $s$ are then sent to Bob along with the message $m$. Bob can verify the authenticity of the message by computing:

$$
x = \frac{r - 1}{k} \mod n
$$

$$
y = \frac{s - 1}{k} \mod n
$$

$$
Q = xG + yG
$$

If the $x$-coordinate of the point $Q$ is equal to $r$, Bob can be assured that the message was indeed signed by Alice.

The ECDSA Digital Signature is secure against forgery because an adversary, Eve, would not be able to compute the signature $r$ and $s$ even if she intercepts the message $m$ and the public key $Q$. This is because Eve does not know the private key $k$ used by Alice.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of public-key encryption algorithms and their respective strengths and weaknesses.

#### 1.1f Applications of Public-key Encryption

Public-key encryption has a wide range of applications in various fields. It is used in secure communication, electronic commerce, digital rights management, and many other areas. In this section, we will explore some of these applications in more detail.

##### Secure Communication

Public-key encryption is used in secure communication to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted data. The RSA Digital Signature and the ECDSA Digital Signature, as discussed in the previous section, are commonly used for this purpose. These digital signatures allow a sender to authenticate a message and ensure its integrity, providing a means for a receiver to verify the authenticity of the message.

##### Electronic Commerce

Public-key encryption plays a crucial role in electronic commerce. It is used in secure communication between a buyer and a seller, to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted data. It is also used in digital wallets, where public-key encryption is used to securely store and manage digital assets.

##### Digital Rights Management

Public-key encryption is used in digital rights management (DRM) systems to control access to digital content. The sender encrypts the content using the receiver's public key, ensuring that only the intended receiver can decrypt and access the content. This is particularly useful in the context of copyright protection, where content creators can control who can access their content.

##### Other Applications

Public-key encryption has many other applications. It is used in key exchange protocols, such as the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange and the RSA Key Exchange, to establish shared secret keys. It is also used in public-key cryptography schemes, such as the ElGamal Encryption and the Schnorr Signature, which provide a means for a sender to encrypt a message or sign a message without revealing their private key.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical foundations of public-key encryption, exploring the principles and algorithms that underpin these applications.

Public-key encryption is a powerful tool that allows for secure communication over insecure channels. In this section, we will explore the basic protocols used in public-key encryption, including key generation, encryption, and decryption.

#### 1.1b RSA Encryption

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) encryption is a widely used public-key encryption algorithm. It is based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors. The algorithm works by generating a public and private key pair, where the public key is used for encryption and the private key is used for decryption.

The key generation process for RSA encryption involves selecting two large prime numbers, p and q, and calculating the product of these two numbers, n. The public key is then calculated as e, where e is a number that is relatively prime to (p-1)(q-1). The private key is calculated as d, where d is the inverse of e modulo (p-1)(q-1).

To encrypt a message using RSA encryption, the sender first converts the plaintext message into a number, m, using a one-to-one mapping. The sender then raises m to the power of e modulo n, resulting in a ciphertext message, c. This ciphertext message is then sent to the receiver.

To decrypt the message, the receiver raises the ciphertext message, c, to the power of d modulo n. This results in the original plaintext message, m.

RSA encryption is a powerful and widely used encryption algorithm, but it is not without its vulnerabilities. For example, if an attacker can obtain the private key of the receiver, they can decrypt any message encrypted with that key. Additionally, there have been advancements in factorization techniques that have made it easier to break RSA encryption with sufficiently large keys.

In the next section, we will explore other basic protocols used in public-key encryption, including key exchange and digital signatures.
