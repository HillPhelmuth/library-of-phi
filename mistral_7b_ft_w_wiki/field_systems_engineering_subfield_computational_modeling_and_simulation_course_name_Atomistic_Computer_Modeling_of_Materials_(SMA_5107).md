## Chapter 1: Introduction and Case Studies:




### Subsection 1.1a Introduction to Atomistic Computer Modeling

Atomistic computer modeling is a powerful tool that allows us to simulate and study the behavior of materials at the atomic level. By using computer algorithms, we can create virtual models of materials and observe their properties and behavior under different conditions. This technique has revolutionized the field of materials science, allowing researchers to gain insights into the behavior of materials that would have been impossible to obtain through traditional experimental methods.

In this section, we will provide an overview of atomistic computer modeling and its applications in materials science. We will also discuss the different types of models and simulation techniques used in this field.

#### Types of Models

There are two main types of models used in atomistic computer modeling: classical models and quantum models. Classical models, also known as classical molecular dynamics (CMD), use classical mechanics to describe the interactions between atoms. These models are based on the Lennard-Jones potential, which describes the interactions between atoms as a function of their distance.

On the other hand, quantum models use quantum mechanics to describe the behavior of atoms. These models are more accurate than classical models, but they are also more computationally intensive. One popular quantum model is the Schr√∂dinger equation, which describes the wave-like behavior of electrons in atoms.

#### Simulation Techniques

There are two main simulation techniques used in atomistic computer modeling: molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. MD simulations use classical mechanics to simulate the movement of atoms over time, while MC simulations use random sampling to calculate the average behavior of a system.

MD simulations are more commonly used due to their ability to capture the dynamics of a system. They are also more accurate than MC simulations, but they require more computational resources. MC simulations, on the other hand, are more suitable for systems with a large number of atoms and can provide valuable insights into the behavior of materials.

#### Applications of Atomistic Computer Modeling

Atomistic computer modeling has a wide range of applications in materials science. It is used to study the behavior of materials under different conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and external forces. It is also used to design new materials with specific properties and to understand the mechanisms of material failure.

One of the most significant advantages of atomistic computer modeling is its ability to predict the behavior of materials before they are physically created. This allows researchers to optimize the properties of materials and reduce the cost and time of experimental testing.

In the next section, we will explore some case studies that demonstrate the practical applications of atomistic computer modeling in materials science. These case studies will provide a deeper understanding of the techniques and methods used in this field.


## Chapter 1: Introduction and Case Studies:




### Subsection 1.1b Potential Energy Surfaces and Potentials

In the previous section, we discussed the different types of models and simulation techniques used in atomistic computer modeling. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of potential energy surfaces and potentials, which are crucial in understanding the behavior of materials at the atomic level.

#### Potential Energy Surfaces

A potential energy surface (PES) is a graphical representation of the potential energy of a system as a function of its coordinates. In the case of materials science, the coordinates represent the positions of the atoms in the material. The PES is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of materials, as it allows us to visualize the energy landscape of a system and identify potential energy barriers or minima.

The PES is typically represented as a three-dimensional graph, with each axis representing a different coordinate. However, it can also be represented as a two-dimensional graph, as shown in the case of the H + H<sub>2</sub> reaction. In this case, the progression of the reaction is plotted by the use of isoenergetic lines.

#### Potentials

Potentials are mathematical functions that describe the interactions between atoms in a system. They are used to calculate the potential energy of a system at a given set of coordinates. In atomistic computer modeling, potentials are often represented as a sum of individual potentials, each representing a specific type of interaction between atoms.

One commonly used potential is the Lennard-Jones potential, which describes the interactions between atoms as a function of their distance. It is used in classical models and is based on the assumption that the interactions between atoms are purely repulsive at short distances and attractive at longer distances.

Another commonly used potential is the Schr√∂dinger equation, which is used in quantum models. It describes the wave-like behavior of electrons in atoms and is used to calculate the potential energy of a system at a given set of coordinates.

#### Supercells and Relaxation

In atomistic computer modeling, it is often necessary to simulate a system that is larger than the unit cell of a material. This is achieved by using a supercell, which is a larger unit cell that contains multiple copies of the unit cell. By using a supercell, we can simulate a larger system while still maintaining the periodic boundary conditions.

Relaxation is another important concept in atomistic computer modeling. It refers to the process of optimizing the positions of atoms in a system to minimize the total energy. This is typically done by using optimization algorithms, such as the conjugate gradient method, to find the equilibrium positions of the atoms.

### Conclusion

In this section, we have explored the concept of potential energy surfaces and potentials, which are crucial in understanding the behavior of materials at the atomic level. We have also discussed the use of supercells and relaxation in atomistic computer modeling. In the next section, we will apply these concepts to real-world case studies to gain a deeper understanding of their applications.


## Chapter 1:: Introduction and Case Studies:




### Subsection 1.1c Supercells and Periodic Boundary Conditions

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of potential energy surfaces and potentials. In this section, we will explore the use of supercells and periodic boundary conditions in atomistic computer modeling.

#### Supercells

A supercell is a unit cell that is repeated in all directions to create a larger simulation box. This allows for the study of larger systems without the need for a prohibitively large number of atoms. The supercell is defined by a set of lattice vectors, which determine the positions of the atoms within the unit cell.

The use of supercells is particularly useful in the study of materials with periodic structures, such as crystals. By repeating the unit cell in all directions, we can create a larger system that is representative of the bulk material.

#### Periodic Boundary Conditions

Periodic boundary conditions (PBC) are mathematical constraints that are applied to the supercell to ensure that the system is periodic. These conditions are necessary to maintain the periodicity of the system and to avoid unphysical interactions between atoms at the boundaries of the supercell.

There are several types of PBC, including the minimum image convention and the Ewald summation method. The choice of PBC depends on the specific system being studied and the level of accuracy required.

#### Supercells and Periodic Boundary Conditions in Atomistic Computer Modeling

In atomistic computer modeling, supercells and PBC are used to study the behavior of materials at the atomic level. By creating a larger system using a supercell and applying PBC, we can simulate the behavior of a bulk material and study its properties.

The use of supercells and PBC allows for the study of complex materials and systems that would not be possible with a single unit cell. It also allows for the inclusion of periodic structures, which are common in many materials.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of models and simulation techniques used in atomistic computer modeling, including the use of supercells and PBC.

### Subsection 1.1d Atomic Relaxation Techniques

Atomic relaxation is a crucial aspect of atomistic computer modeling. It involves the optimization of atomic positions within a system to minimize the total energy. This process is necessary to obtain accurate results and to ensure that the system is in a stable equilibrium.

#### Atomic Relaxation Techniques

There are several techniques for atomic relaxation, including the conjugate gradient method, the steepest descent method, and the Newton-Raphson method. Each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of method depends on the specific system being studied.

The conjugate gradient method is a popular choice for atomic relaxation due to its efficiency and robustness. It is an iterative method that uses a conjugate direction search to minimize the total energy. The steepest descent method, on the other hand, is a first-order optimization algorithm that uses the gradient of the total energy to determine the direction of the next step. The Newton-Raphson method is a second-order optimization algorithm that uses the Hessian matrix of the total energy to determine the direction of the next step.

#### Atomic Relaxation in Atomistic Computer Modeling

In atomistic computer modeling, atomic relaxation is used to optimize the atomic positions within a system. This is necessary to obtain accurate results and to ensure that the system is in a stable equilibrium. The choice of relaxation technique depends on the specific system being studied and the level of accuracy required.

The conjugate gradient method is often used for large-scale systems due to its efficiency. The steepest descent method is useful for systems with a high degree of symmetry. The Newton-Raphson method is typically used for systems with a low degree of symmetry and a high level of accuracy.

#### Atomic Relaxation and Supercells

Atomic relaxation is particularly important in the study of materials with periodic structures, such as crystals. In these cases, the use of supercells and periodic boundary conditions (PBC) is necessary to create a larger system that is representative of the bulk material.
