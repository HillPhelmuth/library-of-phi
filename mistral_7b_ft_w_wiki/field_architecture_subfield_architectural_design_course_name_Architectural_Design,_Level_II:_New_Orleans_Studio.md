When giving feedback, it is important to be specific and constructive. This means identifying specific aspects of the design that could be improved, and suggesting ways to improve them. It is also important to be respectful and avoid personal attacks. Feedback should be focused on the design, not the designer.

#### 2.2b.2 Receiving Feedback

Receiving feedback can be challenging, but it is important to remember that it is meant to help improve the design. It is important to listen actively and take notes. If you disagree with a suggestion, it is okay to say so, but it is important to consider the feedback and think about how it could be applied.

#### 2.2b.3 Responding to Feedback

After receiving feedback, it is important to respond in a timely manner. This can be done by revising the design based on the feedback, and then presenting the revised design for further discussion. It is also important to thank the person who provided the feedback.

#### 2.2b.4 Giving and Receiving Feedback in a Critique

In a critique, feedback is given and received in a structured and organized manner. The presenter begins by presenting their design, followed by a discussion of the design's objectives, context, and key features. The presenter then opens the floor for feedback, which is given by the other participants. The presenter then responds to the feedback and presents a revised design for further discussion. This process continues until the design is refined and improved.

#### 2.2b.5 Giving and Receiving Feedback in a Design Studio

In a design studio, feedback is given and received on a regular basis. This allows for a continuous improvement of the design, as well as the development of critical thinking and communication skills. It is important to remember that feedback is a two-way street, and both giving and receiving feedback are important skills for architects to develop.




#### 2.2c Iterative Design Process

Iterative design is a crucial aspect of the design process. It allows architects to continuously improve and refine their designs based on feedback and testing. This process is essential in creating innovative and effective solutions.

#### 2.2c.1 The Importance of Iterative Design

Iterative design is important because it allows architects to address the unpredictable nature of user needs and behaviors. User testing can often reveal that even carefully evaluated ideas will be inadequate when confronted with a user test. Therefore, it is important for designers to be prepared to completely abandon old ideas in favor of new ideas that are more equipped to suit user needs.

#### 2.2c.2 The Process of Iterative Design

The process of iterative design involves several steps. First, a design is created and implemented using a breadboard or prototype. This allows for testing and feedback without the need for a finalized design. Once the design works, improvements or incremental changes may be applied to the breadboard to increase or improve functionality over the original design. This process continues until the design is finalized, at which point the design can be translated into a proper circuit board or structure.

#### 2.2c.3 Fast Prototyping Tools

One approach to iterative design is to use fast prototyping tools. These tools allow for quick and efficient creation of prototypes, making it easier to test and refine designs. This can save time and resources, allowing for a more efficient design process.

#### 2.2c.4 The Role of Feedback in Iterative Design

Feedback plays a crucial role in the iterative design process. It allows architects to receive constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement from their peers and instructors. This feedback can then be used to refine and enhance the design, leading to a more effective and innovative solution.

#### 2.2c.5 The Role of Critiques in Iterative Design

Critiques also play a crucial role in the iterative design process. They provide a structured and organized way for architects to give and receive feedback on their designs. This allows for a more thorough and thoughtful discussion of the design, leading to a more refined and effective solution.

#### 2.2c.6 The Role of the Design Studio in Iterative Design

The design studio is an important space for iterative design. It allows for a collaborative and interactive environment where architects can continuously improve and refine their designs through discussion, feedback, and testing. This process is essential in creating innovative and effective solutions.




#### 2.3a Preparing for Pin-up

The pin-up is a crucial part of the design process, providing an opportunity for students to present their work and receive feedback from their peers and instructors. To prepare for the pin-up, students should follow these steps:

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the design process, a critical aspect of architectural design. We have delved into the various stages of the process, from conceptualization to final design. We have also discussed the importance of each stage and how they contribute to the overall design. The design process is not a linear one, but rather a cyclical one, where each stage informs the next. It is a process that requires careful consideration, creativity, and a deep understanding of architectural principles.

The design process is not just about creating a visually appealing structure, but also about solving problems, meeting the needs of the users, and responding to the context in which the building is situated. It is a process that requires a deep understanding of the principles of architecture, as well as the ability to apply these principles in a creative and innovative way.

In conclusion, the design process is a complex and multifaceted one, but with a solid understanding of the principles of architecture and a systematic approach, it can be mastered. It is a process that requires continuous learning and refinement, and one that is at the heart of architectural design.

By setting boundaries and managing their time effectively, architects can ensure that they are not overworking themselves and are able to spend time on other important aspects of their lives. This can lead to improved overall well-being and productivity.

#### 5.4b Strategies for Effective Time Management

There are several strategies that architects can use to effectively manage their time. One such strategy is the Pomodoro Technique, which involves breaking down work into 25-minute intervals, with short breaks in between. This technique helps architects stay focused and productive, as they are able to break down their work into manageable chunks and take regular breaks.

Another strategy is the Eisenhower Matrix, which helps architects prioritize their tasks based on their level of urgency and importance. By using this matrix, architects can ensure that they are devoting their time and effort to the tasks that are most important and need to be completed in a timely manner.

Additionally, architects can use time management software, such as Trello or Asana, to help them track and manage their tasks. These tools allow architects to create and prioritize tasks, set deadlines, and track their progress. This can be especially helpful for larger projects with multiple team members.

#### 5.4c Balancing Design and Deadlines

One of the biggest challenges for architects is balancing the design process with meeting project deadlines. As architects, we are often faced with the dilemma of wanting to create a perfect design, while also needing to meet project deadlines. This can be a difficult balance to strike, but with effective time management strategies, it is possible.

One way to balance design and deadlines is to prioritize tasks based on their level of urgency and importance. By using the Eisenhower Matrix, architects can ensure that they are devoting their time and effort to the tasks that are most important and need to be completed in a timely manner. This can help architects stay on track and meet project deadlines without sacrificing the quality of their design.

Another strategy is to break down the design process into smaller, more manageable tasks. By breaking down the design process into smaller tasks, architects can ensure that they are making progress towards their overall design goals while also meeting project deadlines. This can also help architects stay organized and on track with their work.

In addition, architects can also use time management software to help them track and manage their tasks. These tools allow architects to create and prioritize tasks, set deadlines, and track their progress. This can be especially helpful for larger projects with multiple team members, as it allows for better communication and collaboration.

By using these strategies, architects can effectively balance design and deadlines, ensuring that they are able to create high-quality designs while also meeting project deadlines. This is crucial for success in the competitive field of architecture.

This will allow us to present complex design concepts and calculations in a clear and accessible manner.

So let's dive into the world of architectural design for resilience in New Orleans and explore how we can create buildings and urban spaces that are better equipped to withstand the challenges of the future.




### Section: 6.1 Understanding Resilience in Architecture:

Resilience in architecture is a crucial aspect of designing buildings and urban spaces that can withstand the challenges of the future. In this section, we will explore the concept of resilience in architecture and its importance in the context of New Orleans.

#### 6.1a Defining Resilience in Architecture

Resilience in architecture can be defined as the ability of a building or urban space to withstand and recover from disruptive events or changes. These events can range from natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods, to social and economic changes. The concept of resilience in architecture is closely related to the concept of sustainability, as both aim to create long-term solutions that can adapt to changing conditions.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines resilience as "the ability to maintain or rapidly recover essential functions in the face of internal or external changes or disruptions." This definition highlights the importance of being able to maintain essential functions, even in the face of disruptions. In the context of architecture, this means designing buildings and urban spaces that can continue to function even when faced with unexpected challenges.

The concept of resilience in architecture is also closely tied to the concept of adaptability. Adaptability refers to the ability of a building or urban space to change and adapt to new conditions. This is crucial in the face of changing environmental conditions, such as climate change, as well as social and economic changes. By incorporating adaptability into the design process, architects can create buildings and urban spaces that can evolve and thrive in the face of uncertainty.

#### 6.1b The Importance of Resilience in New Orleans

The city of New Orleans has a rich architectural history and a unique cultural identity. However, it also faces significant challenges in terms of environmental resilience. The city is prone to natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods, and has experienced devastating events such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005. These events have highlighted the importance of designing for resilience in New Orleans.

Incorporating resilience into architectural design in New Orleans is crucial for creating buildings and urban spaces that can withstand and recover from disruptive events. This is especially important in the face of climate change, as the city is expected to experience more frequent and severe natural disasters in the future. By designing for resilience, architects can help mitigate the impact of these events and create a more sustainable and resilient built environment.

#### 6.1c Case Studies of Resilience in Architecture

To further illustrate the importance of resilience in architecture, let's take a look at some case studies of resilient design in New Orleans. One example is the redesign of the Lower Ninth Ward, a neighborhood that was severely impacted by Hurricane Katrina. The redesign incorporated principles of resilience, such as incorporating green infrastructure and creating a more walkable and bikeable community. This has helped the neighborhood to better withstand future natural disasters and improve the quality of life for its residents.

Another example is the design of the New Orleans Convention Center, which was heavily damaged by Hurricane Katrina. The redesign incorporated features such as a green roof and rain gardens, as well as incorporating the building into the city's stormwater management system. This has not only improved the building's resilience, but also its sustainability and overall impact on the community.

Incorporating resilience into architectural design is crucial for creating buildings and urban spaces that can withstand and recover from disruptive events. By understanding the concept of resilience and its importance in the context of New Orleans, architects can create more sustainable and resilient built environments that can adapt to changing conditions and continue to function in the face of uncertainty.

#### Structural resilience

In most developed nations, all new developments are assessed for flood risks. The aim is to ensure flood risk is taken into account in all stages of the planning process to avoid inappropriate development in areas of high risk. When development is required in areas of high risk, structures should be built to flood-resistant standards and living or working areas should be raised well above the worst-case scenario flood levels. For existing structures in high-risk areas, funding should be allocated to i.e. raise the electrical wiring/sockets so any water that enters the home can not reach the electrics. Other solutions are to raise these structures to appropriate heights or make them floating or considerations should be made to relocate or rebuild structures on higher ground. A house in Mexico Beach, Florida which survived Hurricane Michael is an example of a house built to survive tidal surge.

The pre-Incan Uru people of Lake Titicaca in Peru have lived on floating islands made of reeds for hundreds of years. The practice began as an innovative form of protection from competition for land by various groups, and it continues to support the Uru homeland. The manual technique is used to build homes resting on hand-made islands all from simple reeds from the totora plant. Similarly, in the southern wetlands of Iraq, the Marsh Arabs (Arab al-Ahwār) have lived for centuries on floating islands and in arched buildings all constructed exclusively from the local qasab reeds. Without any nails, wood, or glass, buildings are assembled by hand as quickly as within a day. Another aspect of these villages, called Al Tahla, is that the built homes can also be disassembled in a day, transported, and reassembled .

#### Emergency response

As with any disaster, the response to a disaster in New Orleans must be swift and effective. The city has a well-established emergency management system, but it is important to also consider the resilience of the city's architecture in the face of a disaster. This includes not only the structural resilience of buildings, but also the resilience of the city's infrastructure and social networks.

One aspect of emergency response that is often overlooked is the role of community resilience. As mentioned in the Think Resilience course, community resilience is crucial in the face of complex challenges. In the context of New Orleans, this means building a community that is able to bounce back from a disaster and continue functioning even in the face of disruptions. This can be achieved through community organizing, education, and the development of local resources and networks.

### Subsection: 6.1c Case Studies of Resilient Architecture

In this section, we will explore some case studies of resilient architecture in New Orleans. These examples will provide a deeper understanding of the principles and strategies discussed in the previous section.

#### Case Study 1: The New Orleans Museum of Art

The New Orleans Museum of Art (NOMA) is a prime example of resilient architecture in the city. Designed by the renowned architectural firm of T.P.A.S., the museum is situated on a site that was previously a parking lot and a gas station. The design team had to contend with the site's history and the challenges it presented, such as the presence of underground fuel tanks and the need for extensive soil remediation.

The NOMA project is a testament to the principles of resilience in architecture. The design team incorporated the concept of "adaptive reuse," repurposing an existing structure (the former World War II-era U.S. Mint) instead of demolishing and rebuilding. This not only reduced waste but also provided a strong foundation for the museum's resilience. The building's existing structure was reinforced to withstand future storms, and the design incorporated features such as green roofs and rain gardens to manage stormwater runoff.

The NOMA project also exemplifies the principle of "systems thinking." The design team considered the museum's impact on the surrounding community and the city as a whole. They worked closely with local schools to provide educational opportunities for students, and they collaborated with local businesses to ensure the project's economic viability.

#### Case Study 2: The Lower Ninth Ward Center for Sustainable Engagement and Development

The Lower Ninth Ward Center for Sustainable Engagement and Development (CSED) is another example of resilient architecture in New Orleans. The CSED was designed by the architecture firm of Eskew+Dumez+Ripple and is located in the Lower Ninth Ward, one of the areas most severely affected by Hurricane Katrina.

The CSED is a model of sustainable and resilient design. The building is designed to withstand future storms and flooding, and it incorporates features such as solar panels and rainwater harvesting to reduce its environmental impact. The design also includes community spaces for education, cultural events, and social gatherings, fostering a sense of community resilience.

The CSED project demonstrates the importance of community engagement in resilient architecture. The design team worked closely with the local community to understand their needs and aspirations, and to involve them in the design process. This not only ensured that the building met the community's needs but also fostered a sense of ownership and resilience among the community members.

#### Case Study 3: The New Orleans Jazz Market

The New Orleans Jazz Market is a cultural and educational facility designed by the architecture firm of Waggonner & Ball. The Jazz Market is located in the Tremé neighborhood, one of the oldest and most culturally significant neighborhoods in New Orleans.

The Jazz Market is a prime example of adaptive reuse in resilient architecture. The building was originally a school, and the design team repurposed the existing structure to create a vibrant cultural and educational space. The design incorporates features such as green roofs and rain gardens to manage stormwater runoff, and it includes spaces for music education, performance, and community gatherings.

The Jazz Market project illustrates the principle of "cultural resilience" in architecture. The design team worked closely with the local community to preserve and celebrate the neighborhood's cultural heritage, while also creating a resilient and sustainable building.

These case studies provide valuable insights into the principles and strategies of resilient architecture in New Orleans. They demonstrate the importance of considering the site's history, incorporating systems thinking, engaging the community, and preserving cultural heritage in the design process.




### Subsection: 6.2a Design Strategies for Resilience

Incorporating resilience into architectural design is a complex and multifaceted process. It requires a deep understanding of the principles of resilience, as well as the ability to apply these principles in a practical and effective manner. In this section, we will explore some key design strategies for resilience in New Orleans.

#### 6.2a.1 Adaptive Reuse

Adaptive reuse is a design strategy that involves repurposing existing structures for new uses. This strategy is particularly relevant in New Orleans, where many historic buildings have been damaged or destroyed by hurricanes. Adaptive reuse not only preserves these historic structures, but also reduces waste and promotes sustainability.

The New Orleans Museum of Art (NOMA) is a prime example of adaptive reuse. The museum was built in a former World War II-era U.S. Mint, which was repurposed to serve as the museum's main building. This not only preserved a historic structure, but also provided a strong foundation for the museum's resilience. The building's existing structure was reinforced to withstand future storms, and the design incorporated features such as green roofs and rain gardens to manage stormwater runoff.

#### 6.2a.2 Systems Thinking

Systems thinking is a design strategy that involves considering the interconnectedness and interdependence of different elements in a system. In the context of architectural design, this means considering not just the building itself, but also its impact on the surrounding community and the city as a whole.

The Lower Ninth Ward Center for Sustainable Engagement and Development (CSED) is a prime example of systems thinking in architectural design. The CSED was designed to serve as a hub for sustainable development in the Lower Ninth Ward, one of the areas most severely affected by Hurricane Katrina. The design team worked closely with local schools, businesses, and community organizations to ensure that the CSED would not only serve the needs of the community, but also contribute to the community's resilience.

#### 6.2a.3 Redundancy and Rapidity

Redundancy and rapidity are two key properties of resilience identified by researchers at the MCEER (Multi-Hazard Earthquake Engineering research center). Redundancy refers to the ability of a system to continue functioning even if one component fails. In architectural design, this could mean incorporating backup systems or alternative routes for essential services.

Rapidity, on the other hand, refers to the ability of a system to quickly recover from a disruption. In architectural design, this could mean incorporating features that allow for rapid restoration of services after a disruption.

The New Orleans Museum of Art (NOMA) is a prime example of these properties. The museum's existing structure was reinforced to withstand future storms, and the design incorporated features such as backup generators and alternative routes for essential services. This not only increases the museum's resilience, but also allows it to quickly recover from disruptions.

#### 6.2a.4 Resourcefulness

Resourcefulness is another key property of resilience identified by researchers at the MCEER. It refers to the ability of a system to make effective use of available resources. In architectural design, this could mean incorporating features that promote resource conservation or reuse.

The New Orleans Museum of Art (NOMA) is a prime example of resourcefulness. The museum's design incorporates features such as green roofs and rain gardens to manage stormwater runoff, reducing the need for municipal water and sewer services. The museum also incorporates features such as energy-efficient lighting and HVAC systems, reducing its energy consumption and promoting sustainability.

#### 6.2a.5 Recovery and Risk Avoidance

Recovery and risk avoidance are two key strategies for resilience identified by Laboy and Fannon. Recovery refers to the ability of a system to bounce back from a disruption. In architectural design, this could mean incorporating features that facilitate rapid restoration of services after a disruption.

Risk avoidance, on the other hand, refers to the ability of a system to avoid or mitigate potential risks. In architectural design, this could mean conducting thorough site assessments and incorporating features that reduce vulnerability to potential risks.

The New Orleans Museum of Art (NOMA) is a prime example of these strategies. The museum's design incorporates features that facilitate rapid restoration of services after a disruption, such as backup generators and alternative routes for essential services. The museum also conducted a thorough site assessment before construction, which helped identify potential risks and incorporate features that reduce vulnerability to these risks.

In conclusion, incorporating resilience into architectural design is a complex and multifaceted process. It requires a deep understanding of the principles of resilience, as well as the ability to apply these principles in a practical and effective manner. The New Orleans Museum of Art (NOMA) serves as a prime example of how these principles can be applied in architectural design, demonstrating the importance of adaptive reuse, systems thinking, redundancy and rapidity, resourcefulness, recovery, and risk avoidance in promoting resilience.




### Subsection: 6.2b Resilient Materials and Construction Techniques

Incorporating resilience into architectural design is not just about the design of the building itself, but also about the materials and construction techniques used. In this section, we will explore some key resilient materials and construction techniques that can be used in New Orleans.

#### 6.2b.1 Resilient Materials

Resilient materials are those that can withstand and recover from the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes. These materials are often durable, flexible, and able to absorb and dissipate energy. Some examples of resilient materials include:

- **Reinforced Concrete:** Reinforced concrete is a common material used in construction due to its strength and durability. It can withstand high winds and water pressure, making it ideal for buildings in hurricane-prone areas.

- **Steel:** Steel is another strong and durable material that can withstand high winds and water pressure. It is often used in the construction of high-rise buildings and bridges.

- **Composite Materials:** Composite materials, such as fiberglass and carbon fiber, are lightweight but strong. They can withstand high winds and water pressure, and are often used in the construction of high-rise buildings and bridges.

#### 6.2b.2 Construction Techniques

In addition to using resilient materials, there are also specific construction techniques that can enhance the resilience of a building. These techniques include:

- **Base Isolation:** Base isolation is a technique used to reduce the effects of ground motion on a building. It involves isolating the building from the ground by using resilient materials or devices that can absorb and dissipate energy.

- **Ductile Design:** Ductile design is a technique that allows a building to deform and bend without breaking. This is particularly important in hurricane-prone areas, as it can help a building withstand high winds and water pressure.

- **Rainscreen Construction:** Rainscreen construction is a technique used to protect a building from water infiltration. It involves creating a gap between the exterior wall and the building's skin, which allows water to drain away from the building.

- **Green Roofs:** Green roofs are a type of roof that is covered with vegetation. They can help absorb and dissipate energy from wind and water, making them a resilient feature for buildings in hurricane-prone areas.

By incorporating these resilient materials and construction techniques, architects can design buildings that are better equipped to withstand the effects of natural disasters and promote the resilience of the New Orleans community.
