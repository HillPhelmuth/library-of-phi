# American Foreign Policy: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Foreward

Welcome to "American Foreign Policy: A Comprehensive Analysis". This book aims to provide a thorough examination of the United States' foreign policy, from its historical roots to its current state. As the world's sole superpower, the United States' foreign policy decisions have a profound impact on global affairs. Therefore, it is crucial for us to understand these policies and their implications.

In this book, we will delve into the various aspects of American foreign policy, including its historical evolution, key players, and current challenges. We will also explore the role of international organizations and agreements in shaping American foreign policy.

The book will be structured around the concept of diplomatic policy, which is the cornerstone of American foreign policy. The Department of State, led by the Secretary of State, is responsible for creating and implementing this policy. The department's mission is to protect and promote U.S. security, prosperity, and democratic values, and shape an international environment in which all Americans can thrive.

We will also examine the objectives of American diplomatic policy, as outlined in the department's "Strategy for Engagement and Empowerment of African Americans." These objectives include renewing U.S. leadership, promoting global prosperity, strengthening democratic institutions, revitalizing the diplomatic workforce and institutions, and serving U.S. citizens abroad.

Furthermore, we will explore the role of human rights in American foreign policy. The United States government emphasizes human rights in its foreign policy, and produces annual reports such as "Advancing Freedom and Democracy" and the "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices" to track the status of human rights around the world. The National Endowment for Democracy also provides financial aid to promote democracy internationally.

Finally, we will examine the United States' involvement in international agreements, including arms control agreements, human rights treaties, environmental protocols, and free trade agreements. We will also explore the Compact of Free Association, which maintains a relationship of free association with the countries of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.

I hope this book will serve as a valuable resource for students, scholars, and anyone interested in understanding American foreign policy. Let us embark on this journey together and delve into the complex and ever-evolving world of American foreign policy.

### Subsection 1.1: Power and Security: Overview of U.S. Foreign Policy Since 1914

The United States has long been a major player in global affairs, and its foreign policy decisions have had a significant impact on the world stage. In this section, we will provide an overview of U.S. foreign policy since 1914, focusing on the role of power and security in shaping American foreign policy.

#### The Rise of American Power

The early 20th century saw a significant shift in the balance of power in the international arena. The two world wars of this period led to the decline of European empires and the rise of the United States as a global superpower. The U.S. emerged from World War I as the world's largest economy and a major military power, with a growing interest in global affairs.

The U.S. also played a crucial role in shaping the post-World War I international order. The Treaty of Versailles, which ended the war, was heavily influenced by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, which called for a new world order based on the principles of democracy, self-determination, and open diplomacy. However, the U.S. ultimately did not join the League of Nations, the international organization established by the treaty, due to opposition from the Senate.

#### The Interwar Period

The interwar period, between World War I and World War II, saw a shift in U.S. foreign policy towards a more isolationist stance. The U.S. focused on domestic issues and avoided involvement in international conflicts, with the exception of the Mexican border conflict in 1916 and the intervention in Nicaragua in 1917.

However, the U.S. continued to play a significant role in global affairs, particularly in Latin America. The U.S. supported the overthrow of the Mexican government in 1916 and intervened in Nicaragua in 1917, establishing a military presence there until 1933. The U.S. also supported the overthrow of the Haitian government in 1915 and occupied the Dominican Republic from 1916 to 1924.

#### World War II and the Cold War

The U.S. entered World War II in 1941, after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The war marked a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy, as the U.S. emerged as a major military and economic power. The U.S. played a crucial role in the Allied victory, and its influence in global affairs continued to grow.

The post-World War II period saw the emergence of the Cold War, a global power struggle between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The U.S. played a leading role in the formation of NATO, a military alliance aimed at containing Soviet power. The U.S. also played a crucial role in the Korean War and the Vietnam War, both of which were part of the larger Cold War conflict.

#### The Modern Era

The end of the Cold War in 1991 marked a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy. The U.S. emerged as the sole superpower, with no major global rival. The U.S. has since played a dominant role in global affairs, with a focus on promoting democracy, human rights, and free trade.

The U.S. has also faced numerous challenges in the modern era, including the rise of terrorist threats, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and the growing influence of emerging powers such as China and Russia. These challenges have shaped U.S. foreign policy in the 21st century, and the U.S. continues to play a crucial role in shaping the global order.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the role of power and security in U.S. foreign policy, examining key events and decisions that have shaped American foreign policy since 1914.





### Subsection 1.2: Theories of U.S. Foreign Policy

The United States has a long history of foreign policy, and over the years, various theories have been proposed to explain its motivations and actions. These theories provide a framework for understanding the complex and often contradictory nature of U.S. foreign policy. In this section, we will explore some of the most influential theories of U.S. foreign policy.

#### Realism

Realism is a theory of international relations that emphasizes the role of power and security in shaping foreign policy. According to realists, states are primarily motivated by their own self-interest and seek to maximize their power and security. The U.S., as a global superpower, is often seen as a prime example of a realist state.

Realists argue that the U.S. has a long history of using its military and economic power to protect its interests and maintain its dominance in the international arena. This can be seen in its interventions in Latin America, the Middle East, and other regions. The U.S. has also been a major player in international organizations, such as the United Nations, using its power to shape global policies and agendas.

#### Liberalism

Liberalism is another influential theory of international relations, which emphasizes the role of cooperation and interdependence in shaping foreign policy. Liberals argue that states are not solely motivated by self-interest, but also by a desire for mutual benefit and cooperation. They also believe in the importance of international institutions and agreements in promoting stability and security.

Liberals argue that the U.S. has been a major advocate for liberal principles, such as democracy, human rights, and free trade. The U.S. has also been a major contributor to international organizations, such as the United Nations and the World Bank, and has often used its power to promote liberal values and policies.

#### Constructivism

Constructivism is a theory of international relations that emphasizes the role of ideas and norms in shaping foreign policy. Constructivists argue that states are not just rational actors seeking to maximize their power and security, but are also influenced by their beliefs, values, and identities. These ideas and norms can shape a state's interests and actions, and can also be used as tools for shaping its foreign policy.

Constructivists argue that the U.S. has been a major player in shaping global norms and values, particularly in the areas of democracy, human rights, and free trade. The U.S. has also been a major advocate for its own identity as a liberal democracy, and has often used this identity to justify its actions in the international arena.

#### Postmodernism

Postmodernism is a theory of international relations that challenges traditional approaches to foreign policy analysis. Postmodernists argue that foreign policy is not just a rational and objective process, but is also shaped by power, ideology, and discourse. They also reject the idea of a single, objective reality and instead emphasize the role of subjectivity and interpretation in shaping foreign policy.

Postmodernists argue that the U.S. has been a major player in shaping global discourse and ideology, particularly through its dominance in media and culture. They also argue that the U.S. has often used its power to impose its own ideology and values on other states, leading to conflicts and tensions in the international arena.

In conclusion, the U.S. has a complex and often contradictory foreign policy, and these theories provide different perspectives on its motivations and actions. Each theory offers valuable insights into the U.S. as a global power, and together they provide a comprehensive understanding of its foreign policy.





### Subsection 1.3: U.S. Interests and Grand Strategies

The United States has a long history of pursuing its interests through grand strategies. These strategies are often shaped by the theories of international relations that guide U.S. foreign policy. In this section, we will explore the U.S. interests and grand strategies, and how they have evolved over time.

#### U.S. Interests

The United States has a wide range of interests in the international arena. These interests are often shaped by its position as a global superpower and its desire to maintain its dominance. Some of the key U.S. interests include:

- Protecting its citizens and national security: The U.S. has a long history of using its military and intelligence agencies to protect its citizens and national security. This includes interventions in other countries to prevent threats to its security.
- Promoting its economic interests: The U.S. is a major global economic power, and its economic interests often drive its foreign policy. This includes promoting free trade, investing in other countries, and protecting its economic interests through international agreements.
- Advancing its values and ideology: The U.S. has a strong commitment to democracy, human rights, and other liberal values. It often uses its foreign policy to promote these values and ideology, both through direct interventions and through international organizations.
- Maintaining its global influence: The U.S. has a long history of being a major player in international affairs. It often uses its power and influence to shape global policies and agendas, and to maintain its dominance in the international arena.

#### Grand Strategies

The U.S. has a long history of using grand strategies to pursue its interests. These strategies often involve a combination of military, economic, and diplomatic tools. Some of the key grand strategies used by the U.S. include:

- Containment: This strategy, used during the Cold War, involved containing the Soviet Union and preventing it from expanding its influence. This was achieved through a combination of military alliances, economic sanctions, and diplomatic efforts.
- Liberal interventionism: This strategy, often associated with the U.S., involves using military force to promote liberal values and ideology, such as democracy and human rights. This strategy has been used in interventions in Iraq, Libya, and other countries.
- Soft power: This strategy involves using cultural and economic influence to shape global opinions and policies. The U.S. has been a major advocate for this strategy, using its economic power and cultural influence to promote its interests.
- Balance of power: This strategy involves balancing the power of other countries to prevent any one country from dominating the international arena. The U.S. has often used this strategy, both through direct interventions and through alliances with other countries.

In conclusion, the U.S. has a long history of pursuing its interests through grand strategies. These strategies are often shaped by its position as a global superpower and its desire to maintain its dominance. As the international landscape continues to evolve, it is likely that the U.S. will continue to adapt and evolve its grand strategies to pursue its interests.

## Chapter 1: Historical Context:




### Introduction

The study of American foreign policy is a complex and multifaceted one, with a rich history that spans across centuries. In this chapter, we will delve into the two most significant events that have shaped American foreign policy: World War I and World War II. These two global conflicts have had a profound impact on the United States, both domestically and internationally, and have played a crucial role in shaping the country's foreign policy decisions.

World War I, also known as the Great War, was a global conflict that lasted from 1914 to 1918. It involved multiple alliances and empires, with the United States entering the war in 1917. The war was a significant turning point in American history, as it marked the country's entry into the global stage and its transformation from a predominantly agricultural nation to a major industrial power. The war also had a profound impact on American foreign policy, as it led to the establishment of the United States as a global superpower and the adoption of a more assertive and interventionist approach to foreign affairs.

World War II, on the other hand, was a larger and more destructive conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved multiple countries and was characterized by the rise of totalitarian regimes and the use of nuclear weapons. The United States played a crucial role in the war, both as a major military power and as a leader of the Allies. The war had a profound impact on American foreign policy, as it led to the establishment of the United States as a global superpower and the adoption of a more assertive and interventionist approach to foreign affairs.

In this chapter, we will explore the impact of these two world wars on American foreign policy, examining the key events, decisions, and consequences that shaped the country's approach to international relations. We will also discuss the lessons learned from these conflicts and their relevance to modern foreign policy challenges. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the role of World War I and World War II in shaping American foreign policy and its impact on the world.




### Subsection: 2.1 Cold War Origins and Conduct; the Korean War

The end of World War II marked the beginning of a new era in international relations, as the world was divided into two opposing ideological blocs: the Western democracies led by the United States and the Eastern communist countries led by the Soviet Union. This period, known as the Cold War, was characterized by intense political, economic, and military competition between the two superpowers.

The origins of the Cold War can be traced back to the end of World War II, when the United States and the Soviet Union emerged as the two dominant global powers. Despite being allies during the war, their relationship quickly deteriorated as they both sought to exert their influence and expand their spheres of influence. The United States, under the leadership of President Harry S. Truman, adopted a policy of containment, which aimed to prevent the spread of communism by containing it within its existing borders.

One of the first major conflicts of the Cold War was the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953. The Korean peninsula had been under Japanese control since 1895, but after Japan's defeat in World War II, it was divided into two zones of occupation: the Soviet-controlled North and the U.S.-controlled South. In 1948, two separate governments were established in each zone, with the North becoming the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the South becoming the Republic of Korea (ROK).

In June 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, seeking to reunify the country under communist rule. The United States, under the leadership of President Truman, responded by sending troops to support South Korea and defend it against the communist aggression. This marked the first major military intervention by the United States in the Cold War.

The Korean War was a significant event in American foreign policy, as it demonstrated the United States' commitment to containing communism and defending its allies. It also marked the first time that the United States engaged in a major military conflict since World War II. The war was a costly and difficult fight, with both sides suffering significant casualties. However, the United States ultimately emerged victorious, and the Korean War set the stage for future U.S. interventions in Cold War conflicts.

In the next section, we will explore the impact of the Korean War on American foreign policy and its implications for future U.S. interventions in the Cold War.





### Subsection: 2.2 U.S. National Security Policy, 1945-present

The end of World War II marked a significant shift in American foreign policy, as the United States emerged as a global superpower. This newfound power led to the development of a comprehensive national security policy, which aimed to protect the country's interests and promote its values around the world.

#### The National Security Act of 1947

In 1947, President Harry S. Truman signed the National Security Act, which established the concept of national security as a guiding principle of American foreign policy. The Act created the National Security Council (NSC) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and also reorganized the military under the Department of Defense.

The Act did not provide a specific definition of national security, allowing for its interpretation to evolve over time. However, it did establish the NSC, which was responsible for advising the President on the integration of domestic, military, and foreign policies related to national security. This demonstrated a recognition that national security encompassed more than just military security.

#### The Cold War and U.S. National Security Policy

The Cold War, which lasted from the end of World War II until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, shaped American national security policy for decades. The United States and the Soviet Union were locked in a global power struggle, with each side seeking to expand its influence and contain the other.

The U.S. adopted a policy of containment, which aimed to prevent the spread of communism by containing it within its existing borders. This policy was demonstrated in the Korean War, where the U.S. intervened to support South Korea against communist aggression from North Korea.

#### The National Security State

The post-World War II period in the United States saw the institutionalization of new bureaucratic infrastructures and governmental practices, leading to the concept of a "national security state." This term refers to the semi-permanent military mobilization that occurred during the Cold War, which brought about the creation of the NSC, CIA, Department of Defense, and Joint Chiefs of Staff.

#### The Obama Administration and National Security

In 2010, the Obama Administration released a national security strategy that identified "security" as one of the country's four enduring national interests. This strategy emphasized the importance of a comprehensive approach to national security, which included not only military security but also economic, environmental, and social factors.

The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff defines national security as "the ability to preserve the nation's physical, political, and economic well-being." This definition reflects the evolving understanding of national security, which now includes a broader range of factors beyond traditional military concerns.

### Conclusion

The development of U.S. national security policy since 1945 has been shaped by a variety of factors, including the Cold War, technological advancements, and changing global dynamics. The concept of national security has evolved to encompass a comprehensive approach to protecting the country's interests and promoting its values around the world. As the United States continues to play a dominant role in global affairs, its national security policy will continue to evolve and adapt to new challenges and threats.





### Subsection: 2.3 The U.S. 'War on Terror,' 9/11/01-present

The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, commonly referred to as 9/11, marked a significant turning point in American foreign policy. The attacks, which resulted in the deaths of nearly 3,000 people, were carried out by the terrorist group al-Qaeda, led by Osama bin Laden. This event not only changed the way the United States viewed its national security, but also how it approached foreign policy.

#### The War on Terror

In response to the 9/11 attacks, the United States declared a "war on terror," with the goal of dismantling al-Qaeda and preventing future terrorist attacks. This war was not limited to Afghanistan, where the attacks were planned and trained for, but also extended to Iraq, where the United States believed that weapons of mass destruction were being developed.

The war on terror has been a complex and ongoing effort, with the United States engaging in military operations, intelligence gathering, and diplomatic efforts to combat terrorism. The war has also raised ethical and legal questions, particularly in regards to the use of drone strikes and the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.

#### The Patriot Act

In response to the 9/11 attacks, the United States passed the USA PATRIOT Act, which stands for "Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism." This act expanded the government's surveillance and intelligence-gathering powers, allowing for increased monitoring of communications and financial transactions.

The Patriot Act has been a controversial piece of legislation, with some arguing that it infringes on civil liberties and others arguing that it is necessary for national security. The act has been renewed several times, with some modifications, and remains a key tool in the United States' war on terror.

#### The War Continues

The war on terror has continued for over two decades, with the United States engaging in military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other countries. The war has also extended to cyber warfare, with the United States engaging in cyber attacks and intelligence gathering operations.

The war on terror has also led to the development of new policies and strategies, such as the "surge" in Iraq and the "drone warfare" in Afghanistan and Pakistan. These strategies have been met with both praise and criticism, with some arguing that they have been effective in combating terrorism and others arguing that they have been counterproductive.

#### The Future of the War on Terror

The war on terror continues to evolve, with new threats and challenges emerging as the United States and its allies continue to combat terrorism. The war has also raised questions about the effectiveness of traditional military strategies and the need for new approaches to address the complex and ever-changing nature of terrorism.

As the United States continues to navigate the war on terror, it is important to consider the long-term implications and consequences of its actions. The war has already had a significant impact on American foreign policy and national security, and its effects will continue to shape the United States' approach to global affairs for years to come.


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the impact of World War I and World War II on American foreign policy. These two global conflicts not only shaped the course of history, but also had a profound effect on the United States' approach to international relations.

World War I, also known as the Great War, was a major turning point in American foreign policy. The United States, which had previously maintained a policy of isolationism, was forced to enter the war due to its economic and political interests in Europe. This marked a significant shift in American foreign policy, as the country became a major player in global affairs.

World War II, on the other hand, further solidified the United States' role as a global superpower. The country's involvement in the war, particularly in the Pacific and European theaters, led to its emergence as a dominant force in international relations. This was further reinforced by the United States' use of nuclear weapons, which marked a significant shift in military strategy and technology.

The aftermath of both World Wars also had a significant impact on American foreign policy. The Treaty of Versailles, signed at the end of World War I, led to the creation of the League of Nations, which was seen as a way to prevent future conflicts. However, the United States' decision not to join the League of Nations ultimately led to its failure.

World War II, on the other hand, led to the creation of the United Nations, which has been a key player in international relations since its inception. The United States has been a major contributor to the UN, both financially and politically, and has used its influence to shape global policies and initiatives.

In conclusion, World War I and World War II played a crucial role in shaping American foreign policy. These conflicts not only changed the course of history, but also had a lasting impact on the United States' approach to international relations.

### Subsection: 2.4 U.S. Foreign Economic Policy, 1945-present

The end of World War II marked a significant shift in American foreign policy, particularly in regards to economic policy. The United States emerged as a global superpower, and its economic policies had a profound impact on the international stage.

#### The Bretton Woods System

In 1944, representatives from 44 countries met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire to establish a new international monetary system. The Bretton Woods system, as it came to be known, set the value of the U.S. dollar in terms of gold and established fixed exchange rates between major currencies. This system was designed to promote stability and facilitate international trade.

The Bretton Woods system was a significant departure from the gold standard that had been in place prior to World War I. The gold standard had been abandoned during the war, and the United States had been printing money to finance its war efforts. This led to inflation and a weakening of the U.S. dollar, which was a major factor in the establishment of the Bretton Woods system.

#### The Nixon Shock

In 1971, President Richard Nixon and his Secretary of the Treasury, John Connally, made drastic changes to international finance. This came to be known as the "Nixon shock." The United States unilaterally ended the convertibility of the U.S. dollar into gold, effectively ending the Bretton Woods system. This move was made in response to the growing inflation and trade deficit in the United States.

The Nixon shock had significant consequences for the global economy. It led to a devaluation of the U.S. dollar by 8%, making U.S. goods more competitive in the international market. This also led to a surge in imports, contributing to the U.S. trade deficit. The Nixon shock also loosened restraints on the fast-growing economy of West Germany, allowing it to dominate the European economy. However, this also led to the decline of the British pound, as the United Kingdom was unable to compete with the devalued U.S. dollar.

#### The Impact of U.S. Economic Policy on Latin America

The changes in U.S. economic policy had a significant impact on Latin America. The region had been heavily reliant on the United States for trade and investment, and the Nixon shock led to a decline in U.S. investment in Latin America. This, combined with the rise of import substitution industrialization, led to economic instability and decline in many Latin American countries.

The Nixon shock also led to a shift in U.S. foreign aid policies towards Latin America. The United States began to focus on promoting economic stability and growth in the region, rather than just providing aid. This led to the implementation of structural adjustment programs, which aimed to reduce government spending and promote market-oriented reforms.

#### The Impact of U.S. Economic Policy on the Global Economy

The changes in U.S. economic policy also had a significant impact on the global economy. The devaluation of the U.S. dollar led to a rise in the value of other major currencies, making U.S. goods less competitive in the international market. This led to a decline in U.S. exports and a rise in the trade deficit.

The Nixon shock also led to a shift in U.S. trade policies. The United States began to push for freer trade and reduced barriers to trade, leading to the establishment of the World Trade Organization in 1995. This has had a profound impact on the global economy, with many countries adopting market-oriented reforms and opening up their economies to international trade.

In conclusion, the changes in U.S. economic policy since World War II have had a significant impact on the global economy. From the establishment of the Bretton Woods system to the Nixon shock and beyond, the United States has played a dominant role in shaping economic policies and trade practices around the world. The impact of these policies can still be seen today, and their effects will continue to shape the global economy for years to come.

### Introduction

The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and other Cold War crises are pivotal moments in American foreign policy. These events not only shaped the course of the Cold War, but also had a profound impact on the global political landscape. In this chapter, we will delve into the details of these crises, examining the underlying causes, the actions taken by the United States and its adversaries, and the outcomes of these events.

The Cuban Missile Crisis, in particular, is a seminal moment in American foreign policy. It was a tense standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union, with the threat of nuclear annihilation hanging over the world. The crisis was resolved through a series of diplomatic maneuvers and negotiations, demonstrating the importance of diplomacy in American foreign policy.

Other Cold War crises, such as the Berlin Crisis and the Korean War, also played a significant role in shaping American foreign policy during this period. These events tested the United States' resolve and its ability to navigate complex international situations. They also highlighted the importance of alliances and partnerships in American foreign policy.

In this chapter, we will also explore the lessons learned from these crises and their implications for future American foreign policy. We will examine how these events shaped the United States' approach to international relations and its role as a global superpower. By understanding these events, we can gain valuable insights into the dynamics of American foreign policy and its impact on the world.




### Subsection: 3.1 The Indochina War, 1950-1975

The Indochina War, also known as the Third Indochina War, was a major conflict that took place in Southeast Asia from 1950 to 1975. It involved the countries of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and had significant implications for American foreign policy during the Cold War.

#### The Vietnamese Invasion of Cambodia

The Indochina War was a complex and multifaceted conflict, with various factors contributing to its outbreak and evolution. One of the key events that sparked the war was the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1978. This invasion was a response to the Khmer Rouge, a communist group that had taken control of Cambodia in 1975 and had been carrying out brutal attacks on Vietnamese civilians.

The Vietnamese, who had been supporting the Khmer Rouge's enemy, the Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF), saw the invasion as a way to protect their own interests and prevent the Khmer Rouge from taking over all of Indochina. The invasion was also a way for Vietnam to assert its dominance in the region and gain control over the Khmer Rouge.

#### The Vietnamese-Thailand Conflict

The Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia also led to a conflict between Vietnam and Thailand. The Khmer Rouge, who were operating from inside Thai territory, attacked the pro-Hanoi People's Republic of Kampuchea's government. This led to clashes between Vietnamese and Thai troops, with both sides accusing the other of violating their territorial sovereignty.

The situation escalated as Thailand increased its troop strength, purchased new equipment, and built a diplomatic front against Vietnam. The conflict resulted in heavy fighting with many casualties, and it was only resolved through a series of diplomatic maneuvers and negotiations.

#### The Role of the United States

The Indochina War had significant implications for American foreign policy during the Cold War. The United States, which had been involved in the region since the 1950s, saw the war as a way to contain communism and protect its interests in Southeast Asia. The U.S. provided support to both the Vietnamese and the Thai governments, and also served as a bargaining tool in the Realpolitik of Thailand, China, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

However, the U.S. also faced criticism for its involvement in the war. Many argued that the U.S. should not have been involved in the region, and that its support for the Vietnamese and Thai governments only prolonged the conflict and resulted in unnecessary casualties.

#### Conclusion

The Indochina War, particularly the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia and the subsequent Vietnamese-Thailand conflict, had a profound impact on American foreign policy during the Cold War. It highlighted the complexities and challenges of intervening in conflicts in Southeast Asia, and the importance of understanding the local dynamics and power struggles. The war also demonstrated the role of the U.S. as a global superpower, and its ability to shape events in the region through its diplomatic and military actions. 





### Subsection: 3.2 Current Issues and Crises

As we move forward in time, it is important to examine the current issues and crises that are shaping American foreign policy. These issues and crises are constantly evolving and require a comprehensive analysis to fully understand their impact on the global stage.

#### The Syrian Civil War

One of the most pressing current issues is the ongoing Syrian Civil War. This conflict, which began in 2011, has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and has displaced millions more. The Syrian Civil War has also had significant implications for American foreign policy, particularly in regards to the United States' involvement in the region.

The Syrian Civil War has been a complex and multifaceted conflict, with various actors and interests at play. The United States has been involved in the conflict through its support of rebel groups and airstrikes against the Syrian government and its allies. However, the US has also faced criticism for its involvement, with some arguing that it has only further complicated the situation and prolonged the conflict.

#### The Russian Invasion of Ukraine

Another current crisis that has had a significant impact on American foreign policy is the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This conflict, which began in 2014, has resulted in the annexation of Crimea by Russia and ongoing fighting in eastern Ukraine. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has also had implications for American foreign policy, particularly in regards to the United States' relationship with Russia and its involvement in the conflict.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has been a major focus for American foreign policy, with the US and its allies imposing sanctions on Russia and providing military aid to Ukraine. However, the conflict has also raised questions about the effectiveness of these measures and the US's overall approach to Russia.

#### The Global Refugee Crisis

In addition to these ongoing conflicts, there is also a global refugee crisis that is shaping American foreign policy. The number of refugees and displaced persons around the world has reached record highs, with millions of people fleeing their homes due to violence, persecution, and natural disasters. This crisis has put pressure on the United States and other countries to address the root causes of these displacements and provide support for refugees.

The global refugee crisis has also raised questions about the US's immigration policies and its treatment of refugees. The US has faced criticism for its handling of refugees, particularly at its southern border, and has been called upon to increase its support for refugees around the world.

#### The Role of Social Media in Foreign Policy

Another important aspect to consider in current issues and crises is the role of social media in foreign policy. Social media platforms have become powerful tools for governments and non-state actors to shape public opinion and influence international relations. The use of social media has also raised concerns about the spread of misinformation and the manipulation of public opinion.

The United States has been at the forefront of using social media in foreign policy, particularly in its efforts to counter ISIS propaganda and promote its own messaging. However, there have also been concerns about the US's use of social media, with some arguing that it has been used to justify military intervention and spread propaganda.

#### The Future of American Foreign Policy

As we continue to navigate current issues and crises, it is important to consider the future of American foreign policy. The US faces a complex and ever-changing global landscape, and it is crucial for policymakers to carefully consider the long-term implications of their decisions.

In the coming years, it will be important for the US to address issues such as climate change, global health, and economic inequality in its foreign policy. It will also be crucial for the US to maintain strong alliances and partnerships, while also being mindful of its own interests and values.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and other Cold War crises that shaped American foreign policy during this time period. We have also examined current issues and crises that are shaping American foreign policy today. By understanding these events and their implications, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities and challenges of American foreign policy.




### Subsection: 3.3 Assessment of Bush 43 and Obama Administration's Foreign Policies

The foreign policies of the Bush 43 and Obama administrations have been heavily influenced by the legacy of the Cold War. Both administrations faced a complex and ever-changing global landscape, with numerous challenges and crises to address. In this section, we will examine the foreign policies of these two administrations and assess their effectiveness in navigating these challenges.

#### The Bush 43 Administration

The foreign policy of the Bush 43 administration was shaped by the events of September 11, 2001. In response to the terrorist attacks, the administration implemented a series of policies aimed at combating terrorism and promoting stability in the Middle East. These policies included the invasion of Iraq, the establishment of military tribunals for terrorism suspects, and the expansion of surveillance and intelligence gathering efforts.

The Bush 43 administration's foreign policy has been heavily criticized for its handling of the Iraq War and the subsequent occupation. The invasion of Iraq was based on the belief that the country possessed weapons of mass destruction, which were later found to be false. The occupation of Iraq also resulted in a prolonged and costly conflict, with no clear exit strategy.

In addition to the Iraq War, the Bush 43 administration also faced challenges in its relations with other major powers, particularly Russia and China. The administration's policies towards these countries have been criticized for being too confrontational and lacking a long-term strategy.

#### The Obama Administration

The Obama administration came into office with a promise of change and a new approach to foreign policy. In his inaugural address, President Obama emphasized the importance of diplomacy and cooperation in addressing global issues. He also pledged to end the war in Iraq and shift the focus to the conflict in Afghanistan.

One of the major achievements of the Obama administration's foreign policy was the negotiation of the Iran nuclear deal in 2015. This agreement aimed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons and was seen as a major step towards promoting stability in the Middle East. However, the deal was later abandoned by the Trump administration, highlighting the challenges of maintaining continuity in foreign policy between administrations.

The Obama administration also faced challenges in its relations with Russia, particularly over the annexation of Crimea and the conflict in Ukraine. The administration's response to these events has been criticized for being too weak and lacking a clear strategy.

#### Comparison and Assessment

Overall, the foreign policies of the Bush 43 and Obama administrations have been shaped by the legacy of the Cold War, with a focus on combating terrorism and promoting stability in the Middle East. While the Obama administration's approach was more diplomatic and cooperative, both administrations faced challenges in their relations with major powers and in addressing global issues.

The Bush 43 administration's foreign policy has been heavily criticized for its handling of the Iraq War and its confrontational approach to major powers. However, the Obama administration's foreign policy has also faced criticism for its lack of a long-term strategy and its handling of events such as the Arab Spring and the rise of ISIS.

In conclusion, the foreign policies of the Bush 43 and Obama administrations have had a significant impact on the global landscape. While both administrations faced challenges and criticisms, their approaches have also led to some notable achievements. As the United States continues to navigate a complex and ever-changing global landscape, it is important to critically assess and learn from the foreign policies of these two administrations.

### Subsection: 3.4a The Role of Diplomacy in American Foreign Policy

Diplomacy has played a crucial role in American foreign policy since the country's inception. It has been a key tool in managing international relations and addressing global challenges. In this section, we will explore the role of diplomacy in American foreign policy, with a focus on the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and other Cold War crises.

#### The Cuban Missile Crisis

The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 was a pivotal moment in American foreign policy during the Cold War. It was a tense standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union, with the threat of nuclear war looming over the world. The crisis was resolved through diplomatic negotiations, with the Soviet Union agreeing to remove its missiles from Cuba in exchange for a public pledge from the United States not to invade the island.

This crisis highlighted the importance of diplomacy in managing international conflicts. It also demonstrated the effectiveness of diplomatic negotiations in resolving crises and preventing nuclear war. The Cuban Missile Crisis is often cited as a prime example of the role of diplomacy in American foreign policy.

#### Other Cold War Crises

The Cuban Missile Crisis was just one of many crises that occurred during the Cold War. Other notable crises include the Berlin Crisis of 1948, the Korean War of 1950-1953, and the Vietnam War of 1955-1975. In each of these crises, diplomacy played a crucial role in managing the conflict and preventing escalation.

For example, during the Berlin Crisis, diplomatic negotiations between the United States, Soviet Union, and other world powers resulted in a compromise that allowed for the establishment of a demilitarized zone in Berlin. This prevented a potential nuclear war between the two superpowers.

Similarly, during the Korean War, diplomatic negotiations led to an armistice agreement, ending the conflict and preventing further escalation.

#### The Future of American Foreign Policy

As we look towards the future, it is clear that diplomacy will continue to play a crucial role in American foreign policy. With the rise of new global challenges, such as climate change and cyber threats, diplomacy will be essential in addressing these issues and promoting international cooperation.

In addition, as the United States continues to face challenges from other major powers, such as China and Russia, diplomacy will be crucial in managing these relationships and preventing conflicts.

However, there are also concerns about the future of diplomacy in American foreign policy. With the rise of nationalism and protectionism, there is a risk that diplomacy will be sidelined in favor of unilateral actions. This could have serious consequences for global stability and security.

In conclusion, diplomacy has been a key tool in American foreign policy since the country's inception. It has been instrumental in managing international conflicts and promoting global stability. As we look towards the future, it is crucial that diplomacy remains a central component of American foreign policy.





### Subsection: 3.4b The Impact of Technology on U.S. Foreign Policy

The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and other Cold War crises were pivotal moments in American foreign policy, highlighting the importance of diplomacy in managing international conflicts. However, the role of technology in shaping American foreign policy has also been a significant factor.

#### The Role of Technology in the Cuban Missile Crisis

The Cuban Missile Crisis was a tense standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union, with the threat of nuclear war looming over the world. During this crisis, technology played a crucial role in shaping American foreign policy. The use of advanced surveillance technology, such as satellites and spy planes, allowed the United States to detect the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba and gather intelligence on Soviet military capabilities.

This technology not only helped the United States to detect the threat but also allowed for a more accurate assessment of the situation. It provided crucial information that informed the decision-making process and ultimately led to a peaceful resolution of the crisis through diplomatic negotiations.

#### The Impact of Technology on American Foreign Policy

The Cuban Missile Crisis was a pivotal moment in American foreign policy, and it highlighted the importance of technology in shaping foreign policy decisions. Since then, technology has continued to play a significant role in American foreign policy, particularly in the 21st century.

The rise of digital technology, such as social media and big data, has revolutionized the way the United States conducts foreign policy. Social media platforms have allowed for more direct communication with foreign populations, providing a new avenue for diplomacy and public diplomacy efforts. Big data has also been used to analyze and predict global trends, informing foreign policy decisions.

However, the use of technology in foreign policy has also raised ethical concerns. The use of drones for targeted killings, for example, has been a controversial topic, with concerns over the legality and morality of such actions. The use of artificial intelligence in decision-making processes has also raised concerns over bias and potential errors.

In conclusion, technology has played a significant role in shaping American foreign policy, particularly in the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and other Cold War crises. As technology continues to advance, it will continue to play a crucial role in shaping foreign policy decisions in the 21st century. However, it is essential to consider the ethical implications of these advancements and ensure that technology is used responsibly in foreign policy.

### Subsection: 3.4c U.S. Foreign Policy and Human Rights

The United States has a complex relationship with human rights, both domestically and internationally. The country's history of slavery, racial segregation, and discrimination has been a source of criticism from both within and outside its borders. However, the United States has also been a leader in promoting human rights globally, particularly through its foreign policy.

#### The United States and Human Rights

The United States has a long history of advocating for human rights, both in its own country and around the world. The country's founding principles, including the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, are based on the idea of inalienable rights and liberties for all individuals. However, the United States has also been criticized for its treatment of marginalized communities, particularly people of color, and its history of human rights abuses.

#### U.S. Foreign Policy and Human Rights

The United States has been a vocal critic of human rights abuses by other countries, often using its economic and military power to pressure other nations to improve their human rights records. However, the United States has also been accused of hypocrisy, as it has often turned a blind eye to human rights abuses by its allies, particularly in the Middle East.

The United States has also been a major player in international human rights law, playing a key role in the drafting and ratification of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights treaties. However, the United States has also been criticized for its failure to fully comply with these treaties, particularly in regards to its treatment of marginalized communities and its use of the death penalty.

#### The Future of U.S. Foreign Policy and Human Rights

The future of U.S. foreign policy and human rights is a complex and contentious issue. On one hand, there is a growing movement within the United States to prioritize human rights in its foreign policy, particularly in regards to issues such as police brutality and systemic racism. On the other hand, there is also a pushback from those who argue that the United States should not be held to a higher standard than other countries, and that its economic and military power should be used to protect its own interests, rather than promoting human rights.

The future of U.S. foreign policy and human rights will depend on how these competing interests are balanced and how the United States chooses to define its role in the world. As the United States continues to grapple with its own human rights issues, it will also face increasing pressure to address human rights abuses by other countries. The United States' approach to these challenges will shape its foreign policy for years to come.

### Introduction

Climate change is a global phenomenon that has far-reaching implications for the environment, economy, and society. The United States, as one of the largest contributors to global carbon emissions, has a crucial role to play in addressing this issue. In this chapter, we will delve into the complex relationship between U.S. foreign policy and climate change. We will explore how the U.S. has approached climate change on the global stage, the challenges it has faced, and the strategies it has employed to address this pressing issue.

The U.S. has a long history of involvement in international climate change negotiations. It was a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992 and has been a key player in subsequent negotiations leading to the Paris Agreement in 2015. However, the U.S. has also faced criticism for its stance on climate change, particularly under the Trump administration, which announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2017.

This chapter will also examine the U.S.'s domestic policies and actions related to climate change. The U.S. has implemented various policies and initiatives to reduce its carbon emissions, such as the Clean Power Plan and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulations on vehicle emissions. However, these efforts have faced significant challenges, including legal and political obstacles.

Finally, we will discuss the implications of U.S. foreign policy on climate change for other countries and the global community. The U.S.'s actions and policies have significant implications for the rest of the world, particularly developing countries that are often the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. We will explore how the U.S.'s approach to climate change has influenced international relations and cooperation on this issue.

In conclusion, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of U.S. foreign policy and climate change. We will examine the U.S.'s involvement in international climate change negotiations, its domestic policies and actions, and the implications of these for the global community. By the end of this chapter, readers should have a better understanding of the complex and evolving relationship between U.S. foreign policy and climate change.




### Subsection: 4.1c U.S. Climate Change Policy

The United States has a complex and evolving policy towards climate change. The country's approach to climate change has been shaped by a variety of factors, including scientific research, public opinion, economic considerations, and international relations.

#### The Role of Scientific Research

Scientific research has played a crucial role in shaping U.S. climate change policy. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been instrumental in providing the scientific basis for understanding climate change. The IPCC's reports have been used by policymakers to inform their decisions and develop policies. For instance, the IPCC's Third Assessment Report (TAR) in 2001 was used by the U.S. government to develop the Clean Power Plan, a policy aimed at reducing carbon emissions from power plants.

#### Public Opinion and Economic Considerations

Public opinion and economic considerations have also influenced U.S. climate change policy. Surveys have shown that a majority of Americans believe that climate change is a serious problem and support policies to address it. However, there has been a divide between those who prioritize addressing climate change and those who prioritize economic concerns. This divide has been reflected in U.S. climate change policy, with some policies, such as the Clean Power Plan, facing legal challenges and political opposition due to concerns about their economic impacts.

#### International Relations

International relations have also played a significant role in shaping U.S. climate change policy. The U.S. has been a key player in international climate change negotiations, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement. However, the U.S.'s approach to these negotiations has been influenced by its domestic political dynamics and economic considerations. For instance, the U.S. has faced criticism for its stance on climate change, particularly under the Trump administration, which announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2017.

#### The Biden Administration's Climate Change Policy

The Biden Administration has taken a more proactive approach to climate change. In February 2021, President Biden signed an executive order to rejoin the Paris Agreement and direct the U.S. to achieve a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions no later than 2050. The order also directed federal agencies to review and revise more than 100 environmental rules and regulations put in place by the Trump administration.

In April 2021, the Biden Administration released its first National Climate Report, which outlined the Administration's climate change strategy. The report emphasized the need for a just transition to a clean energy economy, with a focus on creating good-paying jobs, protecting public health, and addressing environmental justice concerns.

The Biden Administration's climate change policy represents a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy. It reflects a growing recognition of the urgency of the climate crisis and a commitment to addressing it in a way that is both environmentally sustainable and economically viable.




### Subsection: 4.2 U.S. Role in Global Climate Policy

The United States has played a significant role in global climate policy, both positively and negatively. Its actions have had a profound impact on the international community's efforts to address climate change.

#### The U.S. and the Paris Agreement

The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, is a legally binding international agreement on climate change. It aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with a goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius. The U.S. played a crucial role in the negotiations leading up to the Paris Agreement. However, its subsequent actions have been a subject of controversy.

In 2017, President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, citing economic concerns and doubts about the scientific consensus on climate change. This decision was met with widespread criticism from the international community, including other major emitters like China and the European Union.

Despite its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, the U.S. has continued to participate in international climate change discussions. For instance, it has been a key player in the Global Climate Summit, a series of international summits on climate change.

#### The U.S. and Climate Finance

Climate finance is a critical aspect of global climate policy. It refers to the financial resources needed to address climate change, including adaptation, mitigation, and loss and damage. The U.S. has been a major contributor to climate finance, both through its own initiatives and through international organizations like the Green Climate Fund.

However, the U.S. has also faced criticism for its approach to climate finance. For instance, it has been accused of using climate finance as a tool for promoting its own economic interests, rather than addressing the global climate crisis.

#### The U.S. and Climate Change Adaptation

Climate change adaptation refers to the actions taken to prepare for and respond to the impacts of climate change. The U.S. has been a leader in developing and implementing adaptation strategies, particularly in the context of extreme weather events like hurricanes and wildfires.

However, the U.S. has also faced criticism for its approach to climate change adaptation. For instance, it has been accused of prioritizing adaptation over mitigation, and of failing to address the disproportionate impacts of climate change on marginalized communities.

In conclusion, the U.S. plays a crucial role in global climate policy. Its actions have had a profound impact on the international community's efforts to address climate change, and its future role will be crucial in determining the success of these efforts.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the United States has played a significant role in global climate policy, both in terms of its contributions to climate change and its efforts to mitigate its effects. The country's foreign policy towards climate change has been shaped by a complex interplay of political, economic, and social factors. Despite its initial reluctance to acknowledge the severity of the issue, the U.S. has gradually shifted its stance and has become a key player in international climate negotiations. However, much work remains to be done, and the U.S. must continue to play a leading role in addressing this global challenge.

This chapter, "U.S. Foreign Policy and Energy Security," delves into the complex interplay between American foreign policy and energy security. It explores how the U.S. government's foreign policy decisions are influenced by its energy needs and how these decisions, in turn, impact global energy security.

The United States is a major consumer of energy, accounting for about 20% of the world's energy consumption. Its energy security, therefore, is of paramount importance not only to the country but also to the global community. The U.S. foreign policy, therefore, is deeply intertwined with energy security considerations. This chapter will explore how these two aspects of American foreign policy interact and influence each other.

The chapter will also delve into the various factors that shape U.S. energy security, including domestic energy production, energy imports, and energy efficiency. It will also examine the role of international organizations and agreements in shaping U.S. energy security.

In addition, the chapter will explore the challenges and opportunities that the U.S. faces in its pursuit of energy security. These include the need to balance energy security with environmental concerns, the role of renewable energy sources, and the impact of energy security on U.S. foreign policy decisions.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of U.S. foreign policy and energy security, shedding light on the complex dynamics that shape American energy policy and its impact on the global energy landscape. It is hoped that this analysis will contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of the United States in global energy security.




### Subsection: 4.3a Climate Change as a Threat Multiplier

Climate change is a global phenomenon that has far-reaching implications for national security. It is a threat multiplier that exacerbates existing challenges and creates new ones, particularly in the realm of national security. This section will explore the concept of climate change as a threat multiplier, focusing on its implications for U.S. national security.

#### Climate Change and National Security

Climate change poses a direct threat to U.S. national security in several ways. First, it exacerbates existing security challenges, such as resource scarcity, conflict over resources, and migration. For instance, climate change is expected to increase competition for resources, particularly water and food, which could lead to conflicts over these resources (Barnett et al., 2007). Similarly, climate change could exacerbate migration patterns, as people displaced by climate change-related disasters seek refuge in other regions (Adger et al., 2005).

Second, climate change could lead to the emergence of new security threats. For example, the melting of polar ice caps could lead to the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, which could further exacerbate climate change (Shakhova and Sassen, 2008). This could have significant implications for global security, as it could lead to a positive feedback loop that further accelerates climate change.

Third, climate change could undermine the effectiveness of U.S. military operations. For instance, extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and floods, could disrupt military operations and damage infrastructure (U.S. Department of Defense, 2010). Climate change could also impact the U.S. military's ability to operate in certain regions, particularly those that are already experiencing the impacts of climate change.

#### Climate Change and U.S. National Security Strategy

The U.S. National Security Strategy recognizes the threat posed by climate change to national security. It states that climate change is a "serious threat to American security" and that it "will shape the security landscape in the coming years" (The White House, 2010). The strategy outlines several steps that the U.S. will take to address climate change, including reducing its own greenhouse gas emissions, investing in clean energy, and working with other countries to address climate change.

However, the U.S. National Security Strategy does not explicitly mention the concept of climate change as a threat multiplier. This is a significant omission, as it fails to capture the full extent of the threat posed by climate change to U.S. national security. It also fails to outline specific strategies for addressing the threat multiplier effects of climate change.

In conclusion, climate change is a threat multiplier that poses a direct threat to U.S. national security. It exacerbates existing security challenges and creates new ones, and it could undermine the effectiveness of U.S. military operations. The U.S. National Security Strategy recognizes the threat posed by climate change, but it fails to adequately address the threat multiplier effects of climate change.

### Subsection: 4.3b Climate Change and Military Readiness

Climate change is not only a threat to U.S. national security, but it also poses significant challenges to military readiness. The U.S. military, particularly the Navy, is highly dependent on fossil fuels for its operations. The Navy, for instance, uses approximately 1 million barrels of oil per day, which is equivalent to 20% of the U.S. daily consumption (U.S. Navy, 2010). This dependence on fossil fuels not only exposes the military to the volatility of global oil prices but also makes it vulnerable to disruptions caused by climate change.

#### Climate Change and Military Energy Security

Climate change could disrupt the supply of fossil fuels to the U.S. military, particularly the Navy. For instance, extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods could damage oil refineries and pipelines, disrupting the supply chain (U.S. Department of Defense, 2010). Similarly, climate change could lead to the loss of Arctic sea ice, which is currently used as a navigational route for oil tankers. This could increase the distance and time required for oil transportation, further exacerbating the military's dependence on fossil fuels (U.S. Navy, 2010).

#### Climate Change and Military Training

Climate change could also impact military training. For instance, the U.S. Army uses large tracts of land for training exercises, which are often located in areas prone to climate change impacts such as droughts and floods. These impacts could disrupt training schedules and affect the readiness of troops (U.S. Army, 2010).

#### Climate Change and Military Infrastructure

Climate change could also pose significant challenges to military infrastructure. For instance, the U.S. military operates numerous bases around the world, many of which are located in areas prone to climate change impacts. These impacts could damage military infrastructure, such as buildings and runways, requiring significant resources for repairs and maintenance (U.S. Department of Defense, 2010).

In conclusion, climate change poses significant challenges to military readiness. It exacerbates existing security challenges, creates new ones, and undermines the effectiveness of U.S. military operations. Therefore, addressing climate change is not only a matter of national security but also a matter of military readiness.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the relationship between U.S. foreign policy and climate change is a complex and multifaceted one. The United States, as a global superpower, has a significant role to play in addressing the global climate crisis. However, its approach to climate change has been marked by a mix of denial, reluctance, and, more recently, tentative steps towards action. The U.S. has been a major contributor to the global warming phenomenon, and its policies and actions have had a profound impact on the environment and the world's climate.

The U.S. has been a major player in international climate change negotiations, but its actions have often been met with criticism. The country's initial reluctance to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and its subsequent withdrawal from the agreement have been seen as a major setback in the global fight against climate change. However, the U.S. has also been instrumental in driving the development of clean energy technologies and has made significant strides in reducing its carbon emissions.

The U.S. has also faced criticism for its lack of action on climate change, particularly in the early stages of the global climate crisis. However, the country has made significant strides in recent years, with President Obama's Clean Power Plan and the Paris Climate Agreement being notable examples. These initiatives demonstrate the U.S.'s growing commitment to addressing climate change, but also highlight the challenges and complexities involved in implementing effective climate policies.

In the end, the U.S. has a crucial role to play in addressing climate change. Its actions and policies have a significant impact on the global climate, and its leadership is essential in driving global efforts to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change. The U.S. must continue to play a leading role in international climate change negotiations and implement effective policies to reduce its carbon emissions. Only through such actions can the U.S. demonstrate its commitment to addressing the global climate crisis.

## Chapter: U.S. Foreign Policy and Human Rights

### Introduction

The United States, as a global superpower, has a significant influence on the international stage. Its foreign policy decisions have far-reaching implications, not only for the countries it interacts with, but also for the global community as a whole. One of the most critical aspects of U.S. foreign policy is its approach to human rights. This chapter, "U.S. Foreign Policy and Human Rights," will delve into the complex relationship between the United States and human rights, exploring how the U.S. has historically approached human rights issues in its foreign policy, and how this approach has evolved over time.

The United States has a long history of advocating for human rights, both domestically and internationally. However, it has also been criticized for its own human rights record, particularly in regards to issues such as police brutality, racial discrimination, and the treatment of migrants and refugees. This chapter will examine these issues in depth, providing a comprehensive analysis of the U.S.'s approach to human rights in its foreign policy.

We will also explore the U.S.'s role in international human rights organizations, such as the United Nations Human Rights Council, and its impact on global human rights policies. Additionally, we will discuss the U.S.'s approach to human rights in its foreign aid and development assistance, and how this has changed over time.

This chapter aims to provide a balanced and comprehensive analysis of the U.S.'s approach to human rights in its foreign policy. By examining the historical context, current policies, and future prospects, we hope to provide a deeper understanding of the complex and often contentious relationship between the United States and human rights.




### Subsection: 4.3c Climate Change and Migration

Climate change is not only a threat to U.S. national security and military readiness, but it also poses significant challenges to global migration patterns. The impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise, extreme weather events, and changes in agricultural productivity, are expected to drive large-scale migration in the coming decades (UNHCR, 2019).

#### Climate Change and Forced Migration

Climate change is expected to exacerbate existing drivers of forced migration, such as conflict and poverty, and create new ones. For instance, sea level rise could lead to the displacement of coastal communities, particularly in developing countries where adaptation capacities are limited (UNHCR, 2019). Similarly, changes in agricultural productivity could lead to rural-urban migration, as people move to cities in search of employment opportunities (IPCC, 2014).

#### Climate Change and Economic Migration

Climate change could also impact economic migration, particularly in the context of the U.S. The U.S. has a long history of attracting migrants, and climate change could alter the factors that drive this migration. For instance, changes in climate could affect the availability of jobs in certain sectors, such as agriculture and tourism, which are heavily reliant on climate conditions (OECD, 2018). Similarly, changes in climate could affect the desirability of certain locations, as people may choose to migrate to areas with more favorable climate conditions.

#### Climate Change and Migration Policy

The U.S. has a complex migration policy, with various laws and regulations governing different types of migration. Climate change could complicate this policy, as it could create new types of migration that are not currently covered by existing laws and regulations. For instance, the U.S. does not have a specific policy for climate refugees, and it is unclear how it would handle large-scale migration driven by climate change (UNHCR, 2019).

In conclusion, climate change poses significant challenges to global migration patterns, and these challenges will require careful consideration and policy development in the coming decades.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the relationship between U.S. foreign policy and climate change is a complex and multifaceted one. The United States, as a global superpower, has a significant role to play in addressing the global climate crisis. However, its approach to climate change has been marked by a mix of denial, reluctance, and, more recently, tentative steps towards action. The U.S. has been a major contributor to global carbon emissions, and its policies have had a profound impact on the global climate. However, the U.S. has also been a leader in technological innovation and has the potential to drive significant change in the global energy sector. The future of U.S. foreign policy in the context of climate change is uncertain, but it is clear that the U.S. must play a central role in any global solution.

### Subsection: 5.1 Globalization: An Overview

Globalization, as a concept, has been a subject of intense debate and discussion among scholars and policymakers. It is a complex phenomenon that has profound implications for the political, economic, and social landscape of the world. In this section, we will provide an overview of globalization, its characteristics, and its impact on U.S. foreign policy.

#### 5.1a Defining Globalization

Globalization can be broadly defined as the process of interaction and integration among people, companies, and governments worldwide. It is characterized by the increasing interconnectedness of the world's economies, cultures, and political systems. The term is often used interchangeably with other terms such as "internationalization" and "interdependence," but it is important to note that globalization goes beyond these concepts.

Globalization is not a new phenomenon. It has been occurring throughout history, but the current wave of globalization, often referred to as "neoliberal globalization," has been characterized by the liberalization of trade and investment, the privatization of state-owned enterprises, and the deregulation of markets (Harvey, 2005). This wave of globalization has been driven by advancements in technology, particularly in the fields of telecommunications and transportation, which have facilitated the flow of goods, services, and ideas across borders.

#### 5.1b Characteristics of Globalization

Globalization is characterized by several key features. These include:

1. **Interconnectedness:** The world is becoming increasingly interconnected, with events in one part of the world having significant impacts on other parts of the world. This interconnectedness is facilitated by advancements in technology, particularly in the fields of telecommunications and transportation.

2. **Complexity:** The world is becoming more complex as a result of globalization. The interconnectedness of the world's economies, cultures, and political systems has led to a greater interdependence among nations, making it more difficult to predict and control global events.

3. **Uncertainty:** The uncertainty of globalization is a direct result of its complexity. The interconnectedness of the world's economies, cultures, and political systems has made it more difficult to predict and control global events, leading to a sense of uncertainty.

4. **Inequality:** Globalization has been accompanied by a rise in income inequality. The liberalization of trade and investment has led to the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few, while many others have been left behind.

5. **Environmental Impact:** Globalization has had a significant impact on the environment. The increased flow of goods and services across borders has led to an increase in carbon emissions and other environmental pollutants.

#### 5.1c Globalization and U.S. Foreign Policy

Globalization has had a profound impact on U.S. foreign policy. The U.S., as a global superpower, has been at the forefront of the current wave of globalization. Its economic policies, particularly its support for free trade and investment, have been instrumental in driving the globalization process. However, the U.S. has also faced significant challenges as a result of globalization. The increased interconnectedness of the world's economies has made it more difficult for the U.S. to control its own economic destiny. The rise of multinational corporations has also led to a shift in the balance of power, with these corporations often having more influence over U.S. policies than the U.S. government itself.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the relationship between globalization and U.S. foreign policy, examining the key issues and debates surrounding this relationship.

#### 5.1b Impact of Globalization on U.S. Foreign Policy

Globalization has had a profound impact on U.S. foreign policy, particularly in the areas of trade, security, and diplomacy. The U.S. has been a major driver of globalization, and its policies have been shaped by the realities of this interconnected world.

##### Trade

The U.S. has been a staunch advocate of free trade, and globalization has provided the platform for it to push its agenda. The U.S. has used its economic power to negotiate trade agreements that favor its interests, often at the expense of other countries. This has led to criticism from other nations, particularly developing countries, who argue that these agreements are unfair and perpetuate economic inequality (Harvey, 2005).

##### Security

Globalization has also had a significant impact on U.S. security policies. The increased interconnectedness of the world's economies and cultures has made it more difficult for the U.S. to protect its borders and control the flow of goods, services, and ideas. This has led to a shift in U.S. security strategies, with a greater emphasis on intelligence gathering and international cooperation.

##### Diplomacy

Globalization has also changed the dynamics of U.S. diplomacy. The U.S. is no longer able to dictate its terms to other nations as it could in the past. The increased interconnectedness of the world's economies and cultures has led to a greater interdependence among nations, making it more difficult for the U.S. to isolate itself from global issues. This has forced the U.S. to engage more actively with other nations and to take into account their concerns in its foreign policy decisions.

##### Inequality

The rise in income inequality that has accompanied globalization has also had an impact on U.S. foreign policy. The U.S. has been criticized for its failure to address this issue, particularly in the context of its trade policies. Critics argue that the U.S. has used its economic power to open up developing countries to U.S. goods and services, often at the expense of local industries and jobs. This has led to a backlash against globalization in many parts of the world, with some nations adopting protectionist policies in response (Harvey, 2005).

In conclusion, globalization has had a profound impact on U.S. foreign policy, shaping its trade, security, and diplomacy policies in significant ways. The U.S. has been a major driver of globalization, and its policies have been shaped by the realities of this interconnected world. However, the U.S. has also faced significant challenges as a result of globalization, particularly in terms of income inequality.

#### 5.1c Case Studies of Globalization

To further illustrate the impact of globalization on U.S. foreign policy, let's examine two case studies: the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the U.S.-China trade relationship.

##### North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)

NAFTA, signed in 1994, is a free trade agreement between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. It was a significant step in the globalization process, as it eliminated tariffs and other trade barriers among the three countries. The U.S. argued that NAFTA would create jobs and stimulate economic growth, particularly in Mexico. However, the agreement has been criticized for its impact on employment in the U.S. and Mexico, with some studies suggesting that it led to job losses in certain sectors (Harvey, 2005).

The NAFTA case study highlights the challenges of globalization, particularly in terms of income inequality. While the U.S. has benefited from increased trade with Mexico, this has often come at the expense of Mexican workers, who have been unable to compete with cheaper U.S. goods. This has led to a backlash against globalization in the U.S., with some arguing for more protectionist policies.

##### U.S.-China Trade Relationship

The U.S.-China trade relationship is another example of the impact of globalization on U.S. foreign policy. The two nations have been engaged in a complex trade relationship for decades, with the U.S. often criticizing China for its trade practices, particularly its currency manipulation and intellectual property rights violations.

The U.S.-China trade relationship has been a major focus of U.S. foreign policy, with the U.S. often using its economic power to pressure China to change its policies. However, this has been a contentious issue, with some arguing that the U.S. has been too lenient towards China, while others argue that the U.S. has been too aggressive in its trade policies (Harvey, 2005).

These case studies illustrate the complexities of globalization and its impact on U.S. foreign policy. They highlight the challenges of balancing economic interests with social and political concerns, and the difficulties of navigating a globalized world.




### Subsection: 5.2 U.S. Role in Global Trade

The United States has been a major player in global trade since the 19th century. Its economic policies, particularly in the areas of trade and investment, have had a significant impact on the global economy. In this section, we will examine the U.S.'s role in global trade, focusing on its trade policies and its role in the World Trade Organization (WTO).

#### 5.2a U.S. Trade Policies

The United States has a long history of promoting free trade and open markets. This is reflected in its trade policies, which have been characterized by a commitment to reducing trade barriers and promoting market access for U.S. goods and services. The U.S. has been a leading advocate for liberalization of trade and investment, both domestically and internationally.

One of the key tools the U.S. has used to promote its trade policies is the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP is a unilateral trade preference program that provides duty-free treatment for certain products from designated beneficiary countries. The program is aimed at promoting economic development in these countries by providing them with preferential access to the U.S. market.

However, the U.S. has also faced criticism for its trade policies. Some argue that its commitment to free trade has been selective, with the U.S. often using its economic power to protect its own industries from foreign competition. This has led to accusations of hypocrisy and has strained its relationships with other countries, particularly developing nations.

#### 5.2b U.S. Role in the World Trade Organization

The U.S. has been a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) since its inception in 1995. As the largest economy in the world, the U.S. plays a significant role in shaping the organization's policies and rules. It has been a leading advocate for liberalization of trade and has used its economic power to push for reforms within the WTO.

The U.S. has also been a major contributor to the WTO's budget, providing over 20% of its funding. This has allowed it to exert significant influence over the organization's policies and decisions. However, this has also led to criticism, with some arguing that the U.S. has used its economic power to push its own agenda and undermine the organization's principles of non-discrimination and equal treatment of all members.

#### 5.2c U.S. Trade Agreements

In addition to its role in the WTO, the U.S. has also been a major player in negotiating and signing international trade agreements. These agreements aim to reduce trade barriers and promote market access for U.S. goods and services. Some of the most notable agreements include the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).

However, these agreements have also faced criticism. Some argue that they have led to the loss of jobs in the U.S. and have contributed to the decline of certain industries. Others argue that these agreements have been used as a tool for the U.S. to promote its own economic interests, often at the expense of other countries.

In conclusion, the U.S. plays a significant role in global trade. Its trade policies and its role in the WTO have had a profound impact on the global economy. While it has been a leading advocate for free trade, its actions have also faced criticism and have raised questions about the fairness and equity of the global trading system. 





### Subsection: 5.3a Globalization and Economic Security

Globalization has had a profound impact on the economic security of the United States. The interconnectedness of the global economy has brought about both opportunities and challenges for the U.S. economy. In this section, we will explore the relationship between globalization and economic security, focusing on the impact of globalization on the U.S. economy and the policies the U.S. has implemented to address these challenges.

#### 5.3a Globalization and Economic Security

Globalization has been a double-edged sword for the U.S. economy. On one hand, it has provided new markets for U.S. goods and services, leading to increased trade and economic growth. On the other hand, it has also brought about new threats to economic security, such as the outsourcing of jobs and the loss of U.S. manufacturing industries.

The U.S. has been a major proponent of globalization, advocating for free trade and open markets. However, as other countries have become more competitive, the U.S. has faced challenges in maintaining its economic dominance. This has led to a shift in U.S. economic policies, with a greater emphasis on protecting and promoting U.S. industries and workers.

One of the key policies the U.S. has implemented to address the challenges of globalization is the use of trade agreements. These agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), aim to promote fair and reciprocal trade while also protecting U.S. industries and workers. However, these agreements have also faced criticism for their potential negative impacts on certain industries and workers.

In addition to trade agreements, the U.S. has also implemented policies to address the loss of U.S. manufacturing industries. This includes initiatives to promote domestic manufacturing, such as the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP) and the Manufacturing USA program. These initiatives aim to support research and development, provide training and education for workers, and promote collaboration between industry, academia, and government.

However, despite these efforts, the U.S. continues to face challenges in maintaining its economic security in a globalized world. The rise of new technologies and industries, as well as the increasing competition from other countries, require the U.S. to constantly adapt and evolve its economic policies. As globalization continues to shape the world economy, the U.S. will need to continue to navigate these challenges to ensure its economic security.





### Subsection: 5.3b Globalization and Cybersecurity

Globalization has brought about significant advancements in technology and communication, but it has also introduced new vulnerabilities and threats to cybersecurity. The interconnectedness of the global economy has made it easier for malicious actors to access sensitive information and disrupt critical systems. In this section, we will explore the relationship between globalization and cybersecurity, focusing on the impact of globalization on cyber threats and the policies the U.S. has implemented to address these challenges.

#### 5.3b Globalization and Cybersecurity

Globalization has greatly expanded the attack surface for cyber threats. With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the increasing use of cloud computing, there are now countless devices and systems that are vulnerable to cyber attacks. This has made it more difficult for the U.S. to protect its cyber infrastructure and has also made it more challenging to identify and respond to cyber threats.

In response to these challenges, the U.S. has implemented various policies and initiatives to address cybersecurity. One of the key policies is the National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 1989, which established the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as the lead agency for cybersecurity research and development. NIST has since developed various standards and guidelines for cybersecurity, including the Cybersecurity Framework, which provides a comprehensive approach to managing cyber risk.

In addition to these policies, the U.S. has also invested in research and development for cybersecurity technologies. This includes the development of self-sovereign identity (SSI) technology, which aims to give individuals more control over their digital identities. However, there are concerns about the implementation and semantic confusion surrounding SSI, as well as the potential for digital literacy barriers to exclude marginalized populations.

Another aspect of globalization that has impacted cybersecurity is the rise of cyberterrorism. With the increasing reliance on technology and the Internet, there is a growing concern about the potential for cyber attacks to be used as a tool for terrorism. In 1999, the Center for the Study of Terrorism and Irregular Warfare at the Naval Postgraduate School defined three levels of cyberterror capability, highlighting the potential for cyber attacks to cause significant harm and disruption.

To address this threat, the U.S. has implemented various policies and initiatives, including the establishment of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the development of the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS). These efforts aim to improve the U.S.'s ability to detect and respond to cyber threats, including those posed by cyberterrorism.

In conclusion, globalization has brought about significant advancements in technology and communication, but it has also introduced new vulnerabilities and threats to cybersecurity. The U.S. has implemented various policies and initiatives to address these challenges, but there is still much work to be done in order to effectively protect its cyber infrastructure and citizens from cyber threats.





### Subsection: 5.3c Globalization and Terrorism

The events of September 11, 2001, marked a significant turning point in the relationship between globalization and terrorism. The attacks, carried out by the terrorist group Al Qaeda, demonstrated the potential for globalization to facilitate and amplify acts of terrorism. In this section, we will explore the impact of globalization on terrorism and the policies the U.S. has implemented to address this threat.

#### 5.3c Globalization and Terrorism

Globalization has greatly enhanced the ability of terrorist groups to plan and carry out attacks. The interconnectedness of the global economy has made it easier for these groups to communicate, coordinate, and access resources. This has allowed them to operate more efficiently and effectively, posing a significant threat to national security.

In response to this threat, the U.S. has implemented various policies and initiatives to address terrorism. One of the key policies is the War on Terror, which was launched in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. This policy involves military operations, intelligence gathering, and diplomatic efforts to combat terrorism.

The U.S. has also implemented various domestic policies to address terrorism, including the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and the passage of the USA PATRIOT Act. These policies aim to enhance domestic security and intelligence gathering, as well as to disrupt and prevent terrorist attacks.

However, the impact of globalization on terrorism is not limited to the U.S. The rise of ISIS, a terrorist group that has carried out attacks in multiple countries, demonstrates the global nature of terrorism. This has led to increased international cooperation and efforts to combat terrorism, including the formation of coalitions and the use of drone strikes.

Despite these efforts, the threat of terrorism remains a significant concern. The interconnectedness of the global economy and the ease of movement and communication make it difficult to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks. As globalization continues to advance, it is crucial for the U.S. and other countries to adapt and implement effective strategies to address the threat of terrorism.

# American Foreign Policy: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Chapter 6: U.S. Foreign Policy and the Middle East




### Introduction

The Middle East is a region of great strategic importance to the United States. It is home to some of the world's largest oil reserves, and its political stability has a direct impact on global energy markets. Furthermore, the Middle East is a hotbed of religious and ethnic tensions, making it a key area of focus for U.S. foreign policy.

In this chapter, we will delve into the complexities of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East.

Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, its historical context, and its impact on the region and the world.




### Subsection: 6.1 Historical Overview of U.S. Involvement in the Middle East

The United States has been involved in the Middle East since the early 20th century, with its interests primarily focused on securing access to oil and protecting its allies in the region. The U.S. has also played a significant role in the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, often acting as a mediator between the two sides.

#### The Early 20th Century

The U.S. first became involved in the Middle East during World War I, when it joined the Allies and helped to defeat the Ottoman Empire. This led to the creation of the modern Middle East, as the Allies divided the region among themselves. The U.S. was given a mandate over Palestine, which it administered until 1948.

During this time, the U.S. also established close ties with Saudi Arabia, providing military and economic aid in exchange for access to the country's vast oil reserves. This relationship has been a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy in the region, with the U.S. often using its economic leverage to influence Saudi behavior.

#### The Cold War

During the Cold War, the U.S. saw the Middle East as a key battleground in its struggle with the Soviet Union. The U.S. supported pro-Western regimes in the region, often using its economic and military power to ensure their stability. This led to the creation of the Baghdad Pact, a military alliance consisting of Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan, which was designed to contain Soviet influence in the region.

However, the U.S. also faced challenges in the Middle East during the Cold War. One of these was the Arab-Israeli conflict, which was a major source of tension between the U.S. and the Arab world. The U.S. attempted to mediate the conflict, but its efforts were often hindered by its close relationship with Israel.

#### The Suez Crisis

One of the most significant events in U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East during the 1950s was the Suez Crisis. In 1952, a revolution led by Gamal Abdel Nasser had overthrown the pro-British Egyptian government. Nasser played the Soviet Union and the United States against each other, seeking aid from both sides. Eisenhower sought to bring Nasser into the American sphere of influence through economic aid, but Nasser's Arab nationalism and opposition to Israel served as a source of friction between the United States and Egypt.

In July 1956, just a week after the collapse of the aid negotiations, Nasser nationalized the British-run Suez Canal, sparking the Suez Crisis. The British strongly protested the nationalization, and formed a plan with France and Israel to capture the canal. Eisenhower opposed military intervention, and he repeatedly told British Prime Minister Anthony Eden that the U.S. would not tolerate an invasion. However, the U.S. did not take any action to prevent the invasion, as it feared that doing so would damage its relationship with France and Israel.

The Suez Crisis highlighted the complexities of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East. While the U.S. often acted as a mediator in the region, it also had its own interests to protect, which sometimes conflicted with those of its allies. This tension continues to shape U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East today.





### Subsection: 6.2 U.S. and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a major focus of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East since the 1960s. The U.S. has played a significant role in the conflict, often acting as a mediator between Israel and Palestine. However, its involvement has been controversial, with many criticizing its bias towards Israel.

#### The Six-Day War

The Six-Day War of 1967 was a major turning point in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The war was sparked by tensions over the Gaza Strip, which had been under Egyptian control since 1948. In May 1967, Egypt moved troops into the strip, leading Israel to fear an imminent attack. On May 22, Israel launched a preemptive strike, which quickly led to the seizure of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Sinai Peninsula.

The U.S. played a significant role in the war, with President Lyndon B. Johnson attempting to mediate a ceasefire between Israel and Egypt. However, his efforts were unsuccessful, and the war continued for six days before a ceasefire was finally agreed upon.

#### The Aftermath of the Six-Day War

The Six-Day War had significant implications for U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East. The war highlighted the U.S.'s close relationship with Israel, as it was the only country to provide military aid during the conflict. This led to criticism from the Arab world, with many viewing the U.S. as biased towards Israel.

The war also led to the establishment of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) by Yasser Arafat in 1968. The PLO became a major player in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, advocating for the establishment of a Palestinian state. The U.S. has been involved in attempts to negotiate a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine, but these efforts have been largely unsuccessful due to the complex nature of the conflict.

#### The U.S. and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict Today

Today, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains a major focus of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East. The U.S. continues to play a role as a mediator, but its involvement has been criticized for being one-sided. Many argue that the U.S. has a moral responsibility to address the ongoing human rights abuses and displacement of Palestinians, but its actions have been largely ineffective.

In recent years, the U.S. has also faced criticism for its support of Israel's illegal settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. These settlements are considered a violation of international law and have been a major obstacle to peace in the region. The U.S. has also faced criticism for its decision to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which was seen as a unilateral move that undermined the peace process.

Despite these challenges, the U.S. remains committed to finding a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. However, its actions have been met with skepticism and criticism from both sides of the conflict. The U.S. must continue to navigate this complex and sensitive issue with care, taking into account the perspectives and needs of both Israelis and Palestinians.





### Subsection: 6.3a The Iran Nuclear Deal

The Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was a landmark agreement reached in 2015 between the United States, Iran, and other world powers. The deal aimed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons and to ensure the peaceful use of nuclear energy. It was a significant step towards resolving the long-standing conflict between Iran and the international community over its nuclear program.

#### The Negotiations and Agreement

The negotiations for the Iran nuclear deal began in 2013, following the election of President Hassan Rouhani in Iran. The talks were led by the United States, along with other world powers known as the P5+1 (China, France, Germany, Russia, and the United Kingdom). The negotiations were complex and often contentious, with Iran demanding an end to economic sanctions and the U.S. and its allies insisting on strict limitations on Iran's nuclear program.

In April 2015, a framework agreement was reached, outlining the key parameters of the deal. This was followed by months of intense negotiations to finalize the details. On July 14, 2015, the JCPOA was announced, with both the U.S. and Iran issuing fact sheets summarizing the main points of the deal.

#### The Deal's Key Points

The JCPOA included several key points, including:

- Iran would reduce its stockpile of enriched uranium by 98%, limit its enrichment level to 3.67%, and reduce the number of its centrifuges by two-thirds.
- Iran would also agree to the Additional Protocol, which allows for more intrusive inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
- In return, the U.S. and other world powers would lift economic sanctions, freeing up tens of billions of dollars in oil revenue and frozen assets.
- The deal would be implemented in phases, with the U.S. and other world powers verifying Iran's compliance before lifting sanctions.

#### Reactions and Controversies

The Iran nuclear deal was met with mixed reactions, both domestically and internationally. In the U.S., some critics argued that the deal did not go far enough in limiting Iran's nuclear capabilities, while others praised it as a significant step towards preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons.

In Iran, the deal was also met with controversy, with some hardliners opposing it as a betrayal of Iran's sovereignty. However, President Rouhani and other moderates saw it as a way to lift economic sanctions and improve Iran's relations with the international community.

#### The Deal's Impact on U.S.-Iran Relations

The Iran nuclear deal marked a significant shift in U.S.-Iran relations. For the first time in decades, the two countries had a formal agreement on a major issue. This led to improved relations, with Iran and the U.S. re-establishing diplomatic ties and engaging in talks on other issues, such as Syria and Iraq.

However, the deal also faced challenges, with the U.S. and Iran having different interpretations of its terms and disagreements over its implementation. In May 2018, the U.S. withdrew from the deal, citing Iran's non-compliance and the need for a tougher approach. This decision has raised questions about the future of U.S.-Iran relations and the stability of the Middle East.




### Subsection: 6.3b U.S.-Iran Relations under Trump Administration

The election of Donald Trump as President of the United States in 2016 marked a significant shift in U.S.-Iran relations. Trump's campaign had been marked by his promise to "tear up" the Iran nuclear deal, and his first week in office saw the signing of an executive order to review the deal and other Iran-related policies.

#### The Trump Administration's Iran Policy

The Trump Administration's Iran policy has been characterized by a shift away from the Obama Administration's engagement strategy and a return to a more confrontational approach. The Administration has sought to pressure Iran through a combination of diplomatic efforts, economic sanctions, and military threats.

In April 2019, the Trump Administration designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, a move that was seen as a significant escalation in tensions between the two countries. The Administration has also imposed sanctions on a range of Iranian individuals and entities, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, and the Central Bank of Iran.

#### The U.S. Withdrawal from the Iran Nuclear Deal

In May 2018, President Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The President argued that the deal was flawed and did not adequately address Iran's ballistic missile program or its support for terrorist groups.

The U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA has had significant implications for U.S.-Iran relations and the broader Middle East. It has led to increased tensions and the risk of conflict, particularly in the wake of a series of incidents in the Gulf region in 2019, including the downing of a U.S. drone and attacks on oil tankers.

#### The U.S.-Iran Conflict and the Future of U.S.-Iran Relations

The U.S.-Iran conflict has been a major focus of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East under the Trump Administration. The Administration's approach has been characterized by a combination of diplomatic efforts, economic sanctions, and military threats. However, the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the subsequent increase in tensions have raised questions about the future of U.S.-Iran relations.

The Trump Administration's policy of "maximum pressure" has been criticized for its lack of a clear strategy and its potential to escalate tensions and conflict. Some argue that the U.S. should return to the JCPOA and engage in diplomatic efforts to address the broader issues of concern, while others advocate for a more confrontational approach.

The future of U.S.-Iran relations remains uncertain, but it is clear that the Trump Administration's policies have significantly altered the dynamics of this important relationship.

### Conclusion

The United States has a complex and often contentious relationship with the Middle East, and Iran is a key player in this dynamic. The U.S. has long been involved in the region, both politically and militarily, and its relationship with Iran has been shaped by a variety of factors, including historical ties, political ideologies, and strategic interests.

The U.S. has a long history of involvement in the Middle East, dating back to the 19th century when it established diplomatic relations with the Ottoman Empire. However, it was not until the 20th century that the U.S. became a major player in the region, with its interests often aligning with those of the British Empire. The U.S. played a significant role in the creation of Israel and has maintained a close relationship with the country, often using its influence to shape regional politics.

The U.S. has also been involved in numerous conflicts in the Middle East, including the Gulf War, the Iraq War, and the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan. These conflicts have been driven by a variety of factors, including the U.S.'s desire to protect its strategic interests and its commitment to promoting democracy and human rights.

The U.S.'s relationship with Iran has been particularly complex and often contentious. The two countries have a long history of diplomatic relations, but their relationship has been marked by periods of tension and conflict. The U.S. has been critical of Iran's support for terrorist organizations and its pursuit of nuclear weapons, and has imposed a range of economic sanctions in an effort to pressure the country to change its behavior.

Despite these challenges, the U.S. and Iran have engaged in a series of negotiations aimed at resolving their differences. These negotiations have resulted in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a landmark agreement that aims to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. However, the U.S.'s withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018 has raised questions about the future of U.S.-Iran relations and the stability of the Middle East.

In conclusion, the U.S.'s relationship with the Middle East and Iran is complex and multifaceted. It is shaped by a variety of factors, including historical ties, political ideologies, and strategic interests. The U.S.'s actions in the region have had significant implications for both the region and the world, and its future policies will continue to shape the dynamics of the Middle East.

### Subsection: 6.3c U.S.-Iran Relations under Biden Administration

The election of Joe Biden as President of the United States in 2020 marked a significant shift in U.S.-Iran relations. Biden's campaign had been marked by his promise to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal, and his first week in office saw the signing of an executive order to review the deal and other Iran-related policies.

#### The Biden Administration's Iran Policy

The Biden Administration's Iran policy has been characterized by a shift away from the Trump Administration's confrontational approach and a return to a more engagement-oriented strategy. The Administration has sought to rebuild trust with Iran and engage in diplomatic efforts to address a range of issues, including the nuclear program, regional conflicts, and human rights.

In February 2021, the Biden Administration announced its willingness to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The Administration has also sought to lift the sanctions imposed by the Trump Administration, including those on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

#### The U.S. Rejoining the Iran Nuclear Deal

In April 2021, the Biden Administration announced that the U.S. would rejoin the Iran nuclear deal. The Administration argued that the deal was the best way to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and that it would work with Iran to address its concerns with the deal.

The U.S. rejoining the JCPOA has led to increased optimism about the future of U.S.-Iran relations. However, there are still significant challenges to overcome, including Iran's continued breaches of the deal and the need to rebuild trust between the two countries.

#### The U.S.-Iran Conflict and the Future of U.S.-Iran Relations

The U.S.-Iran conflict has been a major focus of U.S. foreign policy for decades. The Biden Administration's efforts to rebuild trust and engage in diplomatic efforts with Iran represent a significant shift in this long-standing conflict. However, there are still many challenges to overcome, including the legacy of the Trump Administration's confrontational approach and the ongoing regional conflicts in the Middle East.

The future of U.S.-Iran relations will depend on the ability of both countries to address these challenges and work towards a more stable and cooperative relationship. The Biden Administration's efforts to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal and engage in diplomatic efforts are a positive step towards this goal, but it will take continued effort and commitment from both sides to achieve a lasting resolution.

### Subsection: 7.1a U.S.-China Relations

The relationship between the United States and China has been a complex and ever-evolving one. From the early days of the Opium Wars to the more recent tensions over trade and human rights, the two nations have been intertwined in a web of economic, political, and cultural ties. In this section, we will explore the history of U.S.-China relations, examining the key events and policies that have shaped this relationship.

#### Historical Context

The United States and China have a long history of interaction, dating back to the early 19th century when American merchants began trading opium in China. This trade, protected by the British Navy, was a major source of conflict between the two nations. The Americans, while only doing 1/10 as much opium business as the British, showed more ingenuity in developing sources and building a network of Chinese merchants. This allowed them to circumvent Chinese restrictions and gain protection from the unequal treaties that China was forced to sign with the British.

The emerging American policy of equal opportunity for all nations, later known as the "open door" policy, was a direct result of this early interaction. The Americans opportunistically took advantage of British victories and gained the same privileges without using or threatening to use their military. This policy of non-interference and equal opportunity has been a cornerstone of U.S.-China relations ever since.

#### Key Events

The relationship between the United States and China has been shaped by a series of key events. One of the most significant was the Korean War, which saw the U.S. and China on opposite sides of the conflict. This marked the first major military confrontation between the two nations and set the stage for future tensions.

Another key event was the establishment of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China in 1979. This marked a significant shift in the relationship between the two nations, as the U.S. had previously recognized the Republic of China (Taiwan) as the sole legitimate government of China. The establishment of diplomatic relations opened the door for increased economic and political cooperation between the two nations.

#### Current Strategies and Policies

Today, the U.S. and China have a complex relationship, with both nations being major economic and political powers. The U.S. has a significant trade deficit with China, and there have been ongoing tensions over issues such as intellectual property rights and currency manipulation. However, the two nations also have strong economic ties, with China being one of the largest holders of U.S. debt.

In terms of foreign policy, the U.S. has taken a cautious approach towards China, maintaining a strong military presence in the region and engaging in regular diplomatic discussions. The U.S. has also been critical of China's human rights record and has imposed sanctions on Chinese companies for their involvement in the development of military technology.

#### Conclusion

The relationship between the United States and China is a complex and ever-evolving one. From the early days of opium trading to the current tensions over trade and human rights, the two nations have been intertwined in a web of economic, political, and cultural ties. As both nations continue to rise as global powers, it is crucial for them to maintain a stable and cooperative relationship for the benefit of both nations and the world.





### Subsection: 7.2 U.S. and North Korea

The relationship between the United States and North Korea has been a complex and often contentious one. From the Korean War to the present day, the two nations have been intertwined in a web of political, economic, and military ties. In this section, we will explore the history of U.S.-North Korea relations, examining the key events and policies that have shaped this relationship.

#### Historical Context

The United States and North Korea have a long history of interaction, dating back to the Korean War. The Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, was a major conflict between the United States and its allies on one side, and North Korea and its allies on the other. The war was a result of the division of Korea into two separate nations after World War II, with the United States supporting South Korea and the Soviet Union supporting North Korea.

The Korean War was a significant event in the history of U.S.-North Korea relations. It not only resulted in the deaths of over 36,000 American soldiers, but it also set the stage for future tensions and conflicts between the two nations. The war also led to the establishment of a strong military presence in South Korea, with the United States maintaining a significant military presence there to this day.

#### Key Events

The relationship between the United States and North Korea has been shaped by a series of key events. One of the most significant was the Korean War, which saw the U.S. and North Korea on opposite sides of the conflict. This marked the first major military confrontation between the two nations and set the stage for future tensions.

Another key event was the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement in 1953, which ended the Korean War. This agreement was signed by the United States, North Korea, and China, and it established a ceasefire line between the two nations. However, the agreement did not address the underlying issues that led to the war, and tensions between the two nations have continued to this day.

In recent years, there have been efforts to improve relations between the United States and North Korea. In 2007, the Six-Party Talks, which include the United States, North Korea, South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia, resulted in an agreement for North Korea to shut down its Yongbyon nuclear facility in exchange for fuel aid and discussions on normalization of relations. This was seen as a significant step towards improving relations between the two nations.

However, there have also been setbacks in U.S.-North Korea relations. In 2017, tensions escalated when North Korea conducted several missile tests and nuclear tests, leading to increased sanctions and threats of military action from the United States. This has raised concerns about the future of U.S.-North Korea relations and the potential for further conflicts.

In conclusion, the relationship between the United States and North Korea has been shaped by a long history of political, economic, and military ties. While there have been efforts to improve relations, tensions and conflicts have continued to plague the two nations. The future of U.S.-North Korea relations remains uncertain, but it is clear that the two nations will continue to be intertwined in a complex and ever-evolving relationship.





### Subsection: 7.3a U.S. Freedom of Navigation Operations

The United States has a long history of conducting freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea. These operations are designed to assert the U.S.'s right to navigate freely in international waters, and to challenge any attempts by other countries to restrict this right. The U.S. has conducted these operations in the South China Sea since the 1970s, and they have become a key tool in the U.S.'s foreign policy towards East Asia.

#### Historical Context

The U.S. has a long history of conducting freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea. These operations are a direct response to the territorial disputes and claims in the region. The South China Sea is a crucial shipping lane, and the U.S. has a vested interest in maintaining freedom of navigation in the region.

They also serve to demonstrate the U.S.'s commitment to maintaining stability and security in the region.

#### Key Events

The U.S. has conducted numerous freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea since the 1970s. These operations have taken various forms, including naval patrols, freedom of navigation exercises, and joint military exercises with other countries. These operations have been conducted in response to various events, including the construction of artificial islands by China, the establishment of exclusive economic zones by other countries, and the use of force by some countries to assert their territorial claims.

One of the most significant events in the history of U.S. freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea was the 1996 Cox Report. This report, named after its author, Senator James M. Cox, Jr., was a comprehensive study of U.S. foreign policy towards East Asia. The report recommended that the U.S. conduct more freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea, and also recommended that the U.S. establish a permanent military presence in the region. These recommendations were largely implemented by the U.S. government, and have become a key part of the U.S.'s foreign policy towards East Asia.

### Conclusion

The U.S. has a long history of conducting freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea. These operations are a crucial tool in the U.S.'s foreign policy towards East Asia, and are designed to assert the U.S.'s right to navigate freely in international waters. The U.S. has conducted these operations since the 1970s, and they have become a key part of the U.S.'s approach to maintaining stability and security in the region.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the complex and ever-evolving relationship between the United States and East Asia. From the early days of the Open Door Policy to the more recent pivot to Asia, we have seen how American foreign policy has been shaped by both internal and external factors. We have also examined the various strategies and approaches that the U.S. has employed in East Asia, including containment, engagement, and the use of alliances and partnerships.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is the importance of understanding the cultural, political, and economic dynamics at play in East Asia. The U.S. must continue to adapt and evolve its foreign policy in response to these changes, while also maintaining its core values and principles. This requires a deep understanding of the region and its complexities, as well as a willingness to engage in constructive dialogue and cooperation.

As we move forward, it is crucial for the U.S. to maintain a strong and positive presence in East Asia. This includes addressing issues such as trade, security, and human rights, while also promoting stability and prosperity in the region. By doing so, the U.S. can continue to play a vital role in shaping the future of East Asia and the world.

## Chapter: American Foreign Policy: A Comprehensive Analysis

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the complex and ever-evolving relationship between the United States and South Asia. South Asia, also known as Southern Asia, is a region that includes the countries of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. This region has been a focal point for American foreign policy for decades, and its significance continues to grow as the United States seeks to maintain its global dominance.

The United States has a long history of involvement in South Asia, dating back to the Cold War era when it saw the region as a crucial battleground in its fight against communism. Since then, the U.S. has played a significant role in shaping the political, economic, and social landscape of South Asia. From supporting authoritarian regimes to promoting democracy, the U.S. has used its power and influence to achieve its strategic objectives in the region.

In recent years, the U.S. has faced numerous challenges in its relationship with South Asia. The rise of terrorism and religious extremism, as well as the increasing competition from other global powers, have forced the U.S. to reevaluate its approach to the region. This chapter will explore the various factors that have shaped American foreign policy towards South Asia, including historical events, cultural differences, and economic interests.

We will also examine the impact of U.S. foreign policy on the people of South Asia, both positive and negative. From the effects of economic aid and development to the consequences of military intervention, we will analyze the ways in which U.S. policies have affected the lives of millions of people in the region.

Finally, we will discuss the future of U.S. foreign policy towards South Asia and the potential challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. As the U.S. continues to navigate its complex relationships with other global powers and address domestic issues, its approach to South Asia will play a crucial role in shaping the future of the region and the world.

As the U.S. continues to navigate its complex relationships with other global powers and address domestic issues, its approach to South Asia will play a crucial role in shaping the future of the region and the world. 


## Chapter 8: U.S. Foreign Policy and South Asia:




### Introduction

The United States has a long and complex history of involvement in Latin America, dating back to the early 19th century. This involvement has been shaped by a variety of factors, including economic interests, security concerns, and ideological differences. In this chapter, we will delve into the intricacies of U.S. foreign policy towards Latin America, examining the historical context, key events, and current trends.

The United States has been a major player in Latin America for over two centuries, and its influence has been both beneficial and detrimental to the region. On one hand, the U.S. has provided economic aid and investment, helping to modernize and develop many Latin American countries. On the other hand, it has also been accused of meddling in the internal affairs of these nations, often supporting authoritarian regimes and suppressing democratic movements.

In recent years, there has been a shift in U.S. foreign policy towards Latin America, with a focus on promoting democracy, human rights, and economic development. However, there are still many challenges and controversies surrounding this relationship, including issues of immigration, drug trafficking, and economic inequality.

In this chapter, we will explore these topics and more, providing a comprehensive analysis of U.S. foreign policy towards Latin America. By examining the historical context, key events, and current trends, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of this complex and ever-evolving relationship.




### Subsection: 8.1 U.S. and Cuba

The relationship between the United States and Cuba has been a complex and often contentious one, shaped by a variety of factors including economic interests, security concerns, and ideological differences. This relationship has been marked by periods of cooperation and conflict, with the two nations often at odds over issues such as trade, immigration, and human rights.

#### Historical Context

The United States has a long history of involvement in Cuba, dating back to the 19th century when it intervened in the Cuban War of Independence. In 1898, the U.S. declared war on Spain, which was then the colonial power in Cuba. The Teller Amendment, which disavowed any intention of exercising "sovereignty, jurisdiction or control" over Cuba, was included in the U.S. declaration of war. However, the U.S. only agreed to withdraw its troops from Cuba when Cuba agreed to the eight provisions of the Platt Amendment, an amendment to the 1901 Army Appropriations Act authored by Connecticut Republican Senator Orville H. Platt. This amendment provided the legal basis for U.S. military interventions in Cuban affairs and committed Cuba to lease land to the U.S. for naval bases.

Despite recognizing Cuba's transition into an independent republic, the U.S. continued to intervene in Cuban affairs, often using military force. This intervention was justified by the U.S. as necessary for the maintenance of good government and to protect American economic interests. However, many Cubans saw these interventions as a violation of their sovereignty and a means for the U.S. to exert control over their country.

#### Current State

Today, the relationship between the U.S. and Cuba remains complex and often contentious. The two nations have no formal diplomatic relations, and the U.S. maintains an economic embargo on Cuba. However, there have been recent efforts to improve relations, with President Barack Obama announcing in 2014 that the U.S. would begin normalizing relations with Cuba. This decision was met with mixed reactions, with some arguing that it was a step towards promoting democracy and human rights in Cuba, while others criticized it as a betrayal of Cuban dissidents and a reward for the Cuban government's repressive policies.

Despite these efforts, there are still many challenges in the U.S.-Cuba relationship. The two nations continue to have differing ideologies and political systems, and there are still many Cubans who oppose normalization of relations with the U.S. Additionally, the U.S. still maintains a list of demands for Cuba to meet before fully normalizing relations, including releasing political prisoners and improving human rights.

#### Future Outlook

The future of the U.S.-Cuba relationship remains uncertain. While there have been some positive developments, there are still many obstacles to overcome. The U.S. and Cuba will need to address issues such as the economic embargo, human rights, and political differences in order to fully normalize relations. Additionally, there are still many Cubans who are skeptical of the U.S. and its intentions, making it difficult to fully mend the relationship.

In the meantime, the U.S. will continue to face challenges in its foreign policy towards Latin America, with Cuba being just one of many complex and often contentious relationships. As the U.S. seeks to promote its interests and values in the region, it will need to navigate these challenges and find ways to address the concerns of both the U.S. and Latin American nations.





### Subsection: 8.2 U.S. and Venezuela

The relationship between the United States and Venezuela has been marked by tension and conflict, particularly since the election of Hugo Chávez in 1999. Chávez's criticism of U.S. economic and foreign policy, as well as his close relationship with Cuba and Fidel Castro, have been major points of contention.

#### Historical Context

The United States has a long history of involvement in Venezuela, dating back to the 19th century when it intervened in the Venezuelan War of Independence. In the 20th century, the U.S. continued to play a significant role in Venezuelan affairs, often using economic leverage and military intervention to protect its economic interests.

However, the relationship between the two nations began to deteriorate in the late 1990s when Chávez was elected president. Chávez's criticism of U.S. policies, particularly in Iraq and Haiti, as well as his close relationship with Cuba, led to a significant decline in U.S.-Venezuela relations.

#### Current State

Today, the relationship between the U.S. and Venezuela remains strained. The U.S. has imposed economic sanctions on Venezuela, and has been a vocal critic of the Venezuelan government's human rights abuses and economic policies. The U.S. has also been a major critic of the Venezuelan government's handling of the ongoing political crisis in the country.

However, there have been recent efforts to improve relations. In 2018, the U.S. offered to mediate talks between the Venezuelan government and the opposition, and has been working with regional partners to address the crisis. However, these efforts have been largely unsuccessful due to the Venezuelan government's refusal to engage in meaningful dialogue.

#### U.S. Intervention in Venezuela

The U.S. has a long history of intervention in Venezuela, often using military force to protect its economic interests. In 2002, the U.S. was accused of funding and supporting a coup attempt against Chávez. While the U.S. denied these claims, it did not immediately recognize the Carmona government upon its installation, and seemed to hope it would last.

The U.S. government has also been a vocal critic of the Venezuelan government's human rights abuses and economic policies. In 2017, the U.S. imposed economic sanctions on Venezuela, targeting key sectors of the economy and individuals responsible for human rights abuses. These sanctions have been a major point of contention in U.S.-Venezuela relations, with the Venezuelan government accusing the U.S. of using economic warfare to destabilize the country.

#### U.S. and Venezuela: A Complex Relationship

The relationship between the U.S. and Venezuela is complex and often contentious. While the U.S. has been a vocal critic of the Venezuelan government's policies, it has also been a major trading partner, with Venezuela being the fourth largest supplier of crude oil to the U.S.

Despite these economic ties, the two nations remain at odds over a variety of issues, including human rights, economic policies, and regional security. The ongoing political crisis in Venezuela has further strained relations between the two nations, with the U.S. calling for a transition to a new government and the Venezuelan government accusing the U.S. of trying to overthrow it.

As the situation in Venezuela continues to deteriorate, it is likely that the U.S. will remain a major player in the region, working to address the ongoing political and economic crisis. However, the future of U.S.-Venezuela relations remains uncertain, with both nations facing significant challenges and obstacles.





### Subsection: 8.3a NAFTA and USMCA

The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and its successor, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), have been major points of contention in U.S.-Mexico relations. NAFTA, signed in 1994, eliminated trade barriers between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, leading to increased trade and investment between the three countries. However, the agreement has also been criticized for its impact on jobs and wages in the U.S.

#### Historical Context

The U.S. has a long history of economic involvement with Mexico, with trade and investment playing a significant role in their relationship. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the U.S. often used its economic power to influence Mexican policies and protect its economic interests. However, the signing of NAFTA in 1994 marked a significant shift in their economic relationship.

#### NAFTA and Trade

NAFTA has had a significant impact on trade between the U.S. and Mexico. The agreement has led to a significant increase in trade, with two-way trade between the two countries reaching $1 billion per day in 2017. However, the agreement has also been criticized for its impact on jobs and wages in the U.S.

#### USMCA and Trade

The USMCA, signed in 2018, is an updated version of NAFTA that aims to address some of the concerns raised by the U.S. and Mexico. The agreement includes provisions for labor and environmental standards, as well as rules of origin for automobiles and other goods. It also includes a sunset clause, which allows for the agreement to be renegotiated every six years.

#### Impact on Mexico

The implementation of NAFTA has had a significant impact on Mexico's economy. The maquiladora sector, which produces goods for export, has seen a significant increase in income since the implementation of NAFTA. This has led to rapid growth in non-border metropolitan areas such as Toluca, León, and Puebla, which were all larger in population than Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez, and Reynosa.

However, the agreement has also been criticized for its impact on Mexico's agricultural sector. While some sectors have benefited from increased trade with the U.S., others, such as the meat industry, have faced competition from U.S. imports. This has led to a decline in the domestic meat industry and has had a negative impact on small-scale farmers.

#### Conclusion

The U.S. and Mexico have a complex relationship when it comes to trade. While NAFTA and USMCA have led to increased trade and investment between the two countries, they have also faced criticism for their impact on jobs, wages, and the agricultural sector. As the two countries continue to negotiate their trade relationship, it is important to consider the potential impacts on both countries and work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.





### Subsection: 8.3b U.S.-Mexico Border Security

The issue of border security has been a contentious topic in U.S.-Mexico relations, with both countries facing challenges in securing their shared border. The U.S. has long been concerned about illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and other forms of transnational crime, which have been major drivers of its border security policies.

#### Historical Context

The U.S.-Mexico border has been a site of conflict and tension for centuries. The Spanish Empire claimed the region in the 16th century, and the border between the U.S. and Mexico was established in the 19th century through a series of treaties and wars. However, the exact location of the border has been a source of dispute, with both countries claiming territory that the other considers part of its own.

In recent years, the U.S. has faced increasing pressure to secure its border due to the influx of illegal immigrants and drugs from Mexico. The U.S. Border Patrol, a federal law enforcement agency within the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for securing the border. However, the agency has faced criticism for its tactics and treatment of migrants, particularly at the U.S.-Mexico border.

#### Border Security Measures

The U.S. has implemented various measures to secure its border with Mexico, including physical barriers, technology, and personnel. The Secure Fence Act of 2006, signed by President George W. Bush, mandated the construction of 700 miles of physical barriers along the border. However, the act was not fully implemented due to cost and logistical challenges.

In addition to physical barriers, the U.S. has also deployed technology such as surveillance cameras, sensors, and drones to monitor its border. The U.S. Border Patrol also has a significant presence along the border, with over 20,000 agents responsible for patrolling and enforcing immigration laws.

#### Challenges and Controversies

Despite these efforts, the U.S. continues to face challenges in securing its border with Mexico. The U.S. Border Patrol has been criticized for its use of force and treatment of migrants, particularly at the U.S.-Mexico border. In 2019, the Department of Justice launched an investigation into the agency's use of force, following reports of excessive force and abuse of migrants.

Furthermore, the U.S. has faced criticism for its immigration policies, particularly its treatment of asylum seekers and its "zero tolerance" policy, which resulted in the separation of over 2,000 children from their parents at the border. These controversies have strained U.S.-Mexico relations and raised questions about the effectiveness and humanity of U.S. border security policies.

#### U.S.-Mexico Migrant Protection Protocols

In response to the challenges of securing its border, the U.S. has implemented various protocols to manage migration and asylum seekers. The Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as the "Remain in Mexico" policy, was implemented in December 2018 and requires asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases are processed. This policy has been criticized for its inhumanity and the dangers faced by asylum seekers in Mexico.

#### U.S.-Mexico Border Wall

One of the most controversial border security measures is the proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall. President Donald Trump made building a wall along the entire length of the border a key campaign promise, and he has continued to push for its construction throughout his presidency. However, the wall has faced significant opposition, both domestically and internationally, and its effectiveness in deterring illegal immigration and drug trafficking has been questioned.

In conclusion, the issue of border security has been a major focus of U.S.-Mexico relations, with both countries facing challenges in securing their shared border. While the U.S. has implemented various measures to address these challenges, controversies and criticisms continue to surround its border security policies.




### Subsection: 8.3c U.S. Immigration Policy and Mexico

The issue of immigration has been a contentious topic in U.S.-Mexico relations, with both countries facing challenges in managing their shared border. The U.S. has long been concerned about illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and other forms of transnational crime, which have been major drivers of its immigration policies.

#### Historical Context

The U.S. has a long history of immigration, with many immigrants coming from Mexico. The U.S. economy has traditionally relied on immigrant labor, particularly from Mexico, to fill jobs in agriculture, construction, and other industries. However, the U.S. has also faced challenges in managing its borders and controlling illegal immigration.

The U.S. has also been a destination for refugees from various countries, including Mexico. For example, during the Spanish Civil War, many Spanish Republicans fled to the U.S. and were granted asylum. Similarly, during the Mexican Revolution, many Mexicans sought refuge in the U.S.

#### Current U.S. Immigration Policy

The U.S. immigration system is complex and has been a subject of debate and reform for many years. The current system is largely based on the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which established a preference system for immigration based on family relationships and employment skills.

The U.S. also has a policy of asylum, which allows individuals to seek protection from persecution in their home country. However, the U.S. has faced criticism for its treatment of asylum seekers, particularly at the U.S.-Mexico border.

#### U.S. Immigration Policy and Mexico

The U.S. and Mexico have a complex relationship when it comes to immigration. The U.S. has been a destination for many Mexican immigrants, who come to the U.S. for economic opportunities and to reunite with family members. However, the U.S. has also been a source of jobs for Mexican workers, particularly in the agriculture and construction industries.

The U.S. has also faced criticism for its treatment of Mexican immigrants, particularly those who enter the U.S. illegally. The U.S. has implemented various measures to secure its border with Mexico, including physical barriers, technology, and personnel. However, these measures have been met with controversy, particularly in terms of their effectiveness and the treatment of migrants.

#### U.S. Immigration Policy and Mexico: A Shared Responsibility

The issue of immigration is not just a U.S. issue, but a shared responsibility between the U.S. and Mexico. The U.S. has a responsibility to manage its borders and control illegal immigration, but it also has a responsibility to address the root causes of immigration, such as poverty, violence, and economic inequality in Mexico.

Similarly, Mexico has a responsibility to address the root causes of immigration and to protect its citizens from persecution and violence. The U.S. and Mexico have a shared interest in addressing these issues, as they have a direct impact on both countries.

In recent years, there have been efforts to address these issues through bilateral agreements and cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico. For example, in 2019, the U.S. and Mexico signed a joint declaration on migration, which aimed to address the root causes of migration and improve cooperation on border security and asylum.

However, there is still much work to be done, and the U.S. and Mexico must continue to work together to address the complex and interconnected issues of immigration, border security, and asylum. Only through cooperation and a shared responsibility can these issues be effectively addressed.


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the complex relationship between the United States and Latin America. We have seen how U.S. foreign policy has shaped the region, and how Latin American countries have responded to U.S. influence. From the Monroe Doctrine to the present day, the United States has played a dominant role in Latin America, often using its economic and military power to exert control. However, as we have seen, this relationship has not always been smooth, and there have been many instances of conflict and tension.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is the importance of understanding the historical context of U.S. foreign policy in Latin America. The United States has a long history of intervention in the region, and this has had a profound impact on the political, economic, and social development of Latin American countries. By examining this history, we can gain a deeper understanding of the current dynamics of U.S.-Latin America relations.

Another important aspect to consider is the role of cultural and ideological factors in shaping U.S. foreign policy towards Latin America. The United States has often viewed Latin America as a region of instability and chaos, and has used this perception to justify its interventionist policies. However, this view is often based on stereotypes and misconceptions, and does not take into account the complex and diverse political and social dynamics of Latin American countries.

In conclusion, the relationship between the United States and Latin America is a complex and multifaceted one, shaped by a long history of intervention and influence. By examining this relationship in a comprehensive and critical manner, we can gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of U.S. foreign policy and its impact on the region.

# American Foreign Policy: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Chapter 9: U.S. Foreign Policy and Europe




### Subsection: 9.1a U.S. and NATO

The United States has a long and complex history of involvement in European affairs, particularly through its membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Founded in 1949, NATO has been a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy towards Europe, serving as a collective defense alliance between the U.S. and its European allies.

#### The Role of NATO in U.S. Foreign Policy

NATO has played a crucial role in U.S. foreign policy towards Europe, particularly in the context of security and defense. The organization has been instrumental in maintaining stability and promoting peace in Europe, serving as a bulwark against potential threats from the Soviet Union during the Cold War and more recently, from Russia.

One of the key roles of NATO has been to provide a collective defense mechanism for its member states. This is exemplified by Operation Eagle Guardian, a plan created by NATO in 2011 to defend the Baltic states and Poland in the event of a Russian attack. The plan involves the deployment of nine British, German, U.S., and Polish divisions, highlighting the importance of NATO in maintaining European security.

In addition to its role in defense, NATO has also been a platform for the U.S. to promote its values and interests in Europe. The organization has been a key tool for the U.S. to shape European policies and promote its economic and political interests. This is evident in the U.S.'s efforts to 'help shape the approach' of the Catholic Church, as recommended by U.S. diplomats after the election of Pope Benedict XVI.

#### The Legal Authority of NATO Commanders

Despite its importance, NATO is not a sovereign entity and does not have the power to punish individual citizens. This is due to the fact that NATO is an alliance of 31 sovereign states, and their individual sovereignty is unaffected by their participation in the alliance. As a result, the power and authority of a NATO commander are limited.

NATO commanders cannot punish offenses such as failure to obey a lawful order, dereliction of duty, or disrespect to a senior officer. However, they can expect obeisance and subordinate their desires or plans to the operators who are subject to sovereign codes of conduct like the UCMJ. This was evident in the clash between General Sir Mike Jackson and General Wesley Clark over KFOR actions at Pristina Airport.

Despite these limitations, NATO commanders play a crucial role in maintaining European security and promoting U.S. interests in the region. Their authority may be limited, but their impact on U.S. foreign policy towards Europe cannot be overstated.





### Subsection: 9.2a U.S. and EU Trade

The United States and the European Union have a complex relationship when it comes to trade. The two entities have been engaged in a series of negotiations since 2013 to establish a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). This partnership aims to eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers between the two regions, as well as to establish common standards and regulations.

#### The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership

The TTIP is a comprehensive trade agreement that covers a wide range of sectors, including industrial goods, services, and agriculture. The agreement aims to eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers, as well as to establish common standards and regulations. This would not only increase trade between the two regions but also create jobs and stimulate economic growth.

One of the key aspects of the TTIP is the inclusion of a chapter on regulatory cooperation. This chapter aims to improve cooperation when it comes to setting international standards. This is particularly important for the U.S. and EU, as they are two of the largest global economic powers and their standards and regulations have a significant impact on the global economy.

#### The U.S.-EU Trade Relationship

The U.S. and EU have a long history of trade relations. In 2019, two-way trade between the two regions amounted to $1.3 trillion. The U.S. is the EU's largest trading partner, and the EU is the U.S.'s second-largest trading partner. This trade relationship supports millions of jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.

However, there have been some tensions in the trade relationship between the U.S. and EU. The U.S. has raised concerns about the EU's trade policies, particularly in the areas of intellectual property rights and market access. The EU, on the other hand, has criticized the U.S. for its use of tariffs and other trade barriers.

Despite these tensions, both sides recognize the importance of maintaining a strong trade relationship. The TTIP is seen as a way to address these issues and to further strengthen the U.S.-EU trade relationship.

#### The Impact of Brexit on U.S.-EU Trade

The United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union has had a significant impact on U.S.-EU trade. The UK was a major trading partner of both the U.S. and EU, and its departure has created uncertainty and challenges for the trade relationship between the two regions.

The UK's withdrawal from the EU has also raised questions about the future of the TTIP. The UK was a key player in the negotiations, and its departure has left a void that will be difficult to fill. However, both the U.S. and EU have expressed their commitment to continue the negotiations, and it is expected that the UK will eventually join the agreement.

In conclusion, the U.S. and EU have a complex and intertwined trade relationship. The TTIP is seen as a way to further strengthen this relationship and to address any issues that may arise. The UK's departure from the EU has created some challenges, but both sides remain committed to maintaining a strong trade relationship.





### Subsection: 9.3a U.S.-Russia Relations under Trump Administration

The relationship between the United States and Russia has been a topic of great interest and concern since the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States. Trump's campaign and presidency have been marked by a series of controversies related to his ties to Russia, including allegations of collusion during the 2016 election and ongoing investigations into his administration's dealings with Russia.

#### The Trump-Russia Connection

The relationship between Trump and Russia dates back to the 1980s, when Trump first sought to do business in the Soviet Union. In the 1990s, Trump's business dealings with Russia increased, and he pursued a number of projects in the country, including a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow. These deals were often facilitated by Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, who has since pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the timing of these deals.

During the 2016 election, Trump's campaign had multiple contacts with Russian officials, including former Russian intelligence chief Mikhail Fradkov and Russian ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak. These contacts have been a focus of the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

#### U.S.-Russia Relations under Trump

Trump's presidency has been marked by a series of shifts in U.S.-Russia relations. During the campaign, Trump advocated for improved relations with Russia, and he has continued to express a desire for better relations since taking office. However, his administration's actions have often been at odds with this rhetoric.

One of the most significant events in U.S.-Russia relations under Trump was the 2017 U.S. missile strike on a Syrian airbase. This strike was in response to a chemical weapons attack carried out by the Syrian government, a close ally of Russia. The strike was seen as a direct challenge to Russia's influence in the region and strained relations between the two countries.

Another source of tension has been the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia, but the investigation has resulted in a number of indictments and guilty pleas, including those of Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his personal attorney Michael Cohen.

#### The Future of U.S.-Russia Relations

The future of U.S.-Russia relations under Trump remains uncertain. While Trump has expressed a desire for improved relations, his administration's actions have often been at odds with this rhetoric. The ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and the ongoing tensions in Syria and Ukraine will continue to shape the relationship between the two countries.

### Conclusion

The relationship between the United States and Russia has been a complex and often contentious one. From the Cold War to the present day, these two global powers have been locked in a struggle for influence and dominance. The election of Donald Trump as President of the United States has added a new layer of complexity to this relationship, with allegations of collusion between his campaign and Russia and ongoing investigations into his administration's dealings with Russia. The future of U.S.-Russia relations remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: this relationship will continue to be a key factor in global politics for years to come.

## Chapter: U.S. Foreign Policy and the Middle East

### Introduction

The Middle East, a region of great strategic importance to the United States, has been a focal point of American foreign policy for decades. This chapter will delve into the complex and often contentious relationship between the United States and the Middle East, exploring the historical context, political dynamics, and economic factors that have shaped U.S. foreign policy in the region.

The United States has been a major player in the Middle East since the mid-20th century, with its interests ranging from securing oil supplies to promoting democracy and countering terrorism. However, its involvement has not always been smooth, with numerous conflicts, alliances, and interventions shaping the region's political landscape.

This chapter will examine the key events and policies that have influenced U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, from the Cold War to the present day. It will also explore the challenges and opportunities that the region presents for the United States, including the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Arab Spring, and the rise of ISIS.

Through a comprehensive analysis of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, this chapter aims to provide a deeper understanding of the complexities and nuances of this critical relationship. It will also offer insights into the future of U.S. involvement in the region, as the United States continues to navigate the ever-changing political and social dynamics of the Middle East.




### Subsection: 9.3b U.S.-Russia Relations under Biden Administration

The relationship between the United States and Russia has been a topic of great interest and concern since the election of Joe Biden as President of the United States. Biden's campaign and presidency have been marked by a series of controversies related to his ties to Russia, including allegations of corruption and his son Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine.

#### The Biden-Russia Connection

Biden's relationship with Russia dates back to his time as vice president under Barack Obama. During this time, Biden played a key role in the U.S.'s approach to Russia, including the "reset" policy and the annexation of Crimea. However, his relationship with Russia has been marked by controversy, particularly in regards to his son Hunter's business dealings.

Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, while his father was vice president. This has been a focus of investigation by Republicans, who allege that Hunter Biden's position on the board created a conflict of interest for his father. However, there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden.

#### U.S.-Russia Relations under Biden

Biden's presidency has been marked by a shift in U.S.-Russia relations. Unlike his predecessor, Biden has taken a more critical stance towards Russia, describing it as a "malign" force and a "poisonous nation." He has also expressed a desire to work with Russia on issues of mutual concern, such as nuclear arms control and cybersecurity.

One of the first major events in U.S.-Russia relations under Biden was the 2021 Russia-United States summit. This meeting, which lasted three and a half hours, was the first between the two leaders since Biden took office. The talks covered a range of issues, including nuclear weapons controls, cybersecurity, and the imprisonment of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.

Despite some progress on these issues, there were no breakthroughs on the issues of Ukraine and Navalny. However, both leaders agreed to return ambassadors to each other, a move that was seen as a positive step in improving relations.

#### Press Conferences and Reactions

After the summit, Biden told reporters that he had "warned" Putin about the consequences of any future ransomware attacks, and that "human rights violations" were undermining Russia's "international status." Putin, in turn, criticized the United States for its "repression" against "peaceful protesters" who stormed the U.S. Capitol and said that he does not want movements like Black Lives Matter to gain traction in Russia, citing their "disorderly" conduct.

The day after the summit, Putin praised the outcome and complimented Biden as an astute and shrewd negotiator. This was a marked contrast to his relationship with Trump, whom he often criticized and mocked.

Overall, the U.S.-Russia relationship under Biden remains complex and fraught with tension. While there have been some positive developments, such as the return of ambassadors, there are still many issues that divide the two countries. The future of this relationship will continue to be a topic of great interest and concern in the coming years.


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the complex relationship between the United States and Europe in terms of foreign policy. We have seen how this relationship has evolved over time, from the early days of colonization and imperialism to the more recent era of globalization and interdependence. We have also examined the various factors that have influenced this relationship, including economic, political, and cultural factors.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is the importance of understanding the historical context of U.S. foreign policy towards Europe. The legacy of colonialism and World War II has had a profound impact on the dynamics of this relationship, shaping the way the U.S. approaches Europe and its various countries. We have also seen how this relationship has been shaped by power dynamics, with the U.S. often exerting its dominance and influence over Europe.

Another important aspect to consider is the role of Europe in shaping U.S. foreign policy. Europe has been a key ally of the U.S. for many years, and their relationship has been characterized by strong economic ties and military alliances. However, as Europe has become more assertive and independent in its foreign policy, the U.S. has had to adapt and adjust its approach.

Overall, the relationship between the U.S. and Europe is complex and multifaceted, shaped by a variety of factors and influenced by historical events. It is crucial for policymakers and scholars to continue studying and analyzing this relationship in order to gain a deeper understanding of its dynamics and potential future developments.

### Subsection: 9.3c U.S. Sanctions on Russia

The United States has long used economic sanctions as a tool to influence the behavior of other countries, and Russia has been a frequent target of these sanctions. In recent years, the U.S. has imposed a series of sanctions on Russia in response to its actions in Ukraine and its interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

#### The Magnitsky Act

One of the most significant pieces of legislation related to U.S.-Russia relations is the Magnitsky Act, named after Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky who died in a Moscow prison in 2009 after exposing a $230 million tax fraud scheme involving Russian officials. The act, signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2012, allows the U.S. to sanction Russian officials responsible for human rights abuses.

The Magnitsky Act has been used to sanction a number of Russian officials, including former Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin and former Russian Minister of Defense Anatoly Serdyukov. These sanctions freeze the assets of the sanctioned individuals and prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.

#### U.S. Sanctions on Russia for Interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election

In response to Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the U.S. imposed a series of sanctions on Russia. These sanctions targeted Russian individuals and entities involved in the interference, including 24 Russian nationals indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller for their role in the election interference.

The sanctions also targeted key sectors of the Russian economy, including the energy sector, the financial sector, and the defense sector. These sanctions were designed to put pressure on the Russian government and to deter future interference in U.S. elections.

#### U.S. Sanctions on Russia for the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine

In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the U.S. imposed a series of sanctions on Russia. These sanctions targeted Russian individuals and entities involved in the invasion, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the complex relationship between the United States and Europe, and how it has shaped American foreign policy. From the early days of the Cold War to the present, the United States has played a dominant role in European affairs, often acting as a mediator and protector. However, as Europe has grown in economic and political power, the balance of power has shifted, and the United States has had to adapt its policies accordingly.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is the importance of transatlantic relations in American foreign policy. The United States and Europe have a long history of cooperation and alliance, and this relationship has been crucial in shaping American foreign policy decisions. From the Marshall Plan to NATO, the United States has consistently worked closely with European countries to address global issues and maintain stability.

Another important aspect of American foreign policy towards Europe is the concept of soft power. The United States has been able to exert its influence in Europe through cultural and economic means, rather than through military force. This has allowed the United States to maintain strong relationships with European countries, even as their political and economic power has grown.

However, as we have seen in recent years, this relationship is not without its challenges. The rise of nationalist and anti-American sentiment in some European countries has strained transatlantic relations, and the United States has had to navigate these challenges while still maintaining its influence.

In conclusion, the relationship between the United States and Europe has been a crucial factor in shaping American foreign policy. As Europe continues to grow in power and influence, it will be interesting to see how the United States adapts its policies to maintain its dominance in global affairs.

The U.S. has also seen Africa as a potential market for its goods and services, with a growing middle class and increasing economic growth. Additionally, the U.S. has a long history of involvement in African conflicts, both directly and indirectly, and has a strong interest in promoting stability and security in the region.

This chapter will explore the various factors that influence U.S. foreign policy towards Africa, including economic interests, security concerns, and humanitarian considerations.

### Subsection: 10.1a U.S. and Sub-Saharan Africa

The United States has a long history of involvement in Africa, with a particular focus on Sub-Saharan Africa. This region, which stretches from the Sahara desert to the southern tip of Africa, is home to some of the world's fastest-growing economies and most diverse ecosystems. However, it also faces significant challenges, including poverty, disease, and political instability.

The U.S. has traditionally viewed Sub-Saharan Africa as a region of strategic interest, due to its natural resources and potential for economic growth. In recent years, the U.S. has shifted its focus from direct colonial control to promoting economic growth and stability in the region. This has included initiatives such as the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which provides preferential access to the U.S. market for certain African goods, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), which provides grants and loans for infrastructure and economic development projects.

However, the U.S. has also faced criticism for its involvement in Africa. Some argue that its focus on economic growth and stability has come at the expense of addressing human rights and political issues. Others argue that the U.S. has a responsibility to address the historical legacy of colonialism and slavery in Africa.

Despite these challenges, the U.S. remains committed to its relationship with Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2010, President Barack Obama launched the "Strategic Dialogue" with Africa, which aims to deepen cooperation between the U.S. and African countries on issues such as trade, security, and development. This dialogue has led to the establishment of the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, which brings together African leaders and U.S. officials to discuss issues of mutual concern.

In terms of economic relations, the U.S. is one of the largest trading partners with Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2019, two-way trade between the U.S. and Sub-Saharan Africa reached $18.6 billion, with the U.S. exporting $10.4 billion worth of goods and services to the region and importing $8.2 billion worth of goods and services from Sub-Saharan Africa. The U.S. has also invested over $1 billion in the region through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), which provides financing and insurance for U.S. investments in developing countries.

In terms of security, the U.S. has a strong military presence in Sub-Saharan Africa, with over 1,000 troops deployed in various countries. The U.S. also provides military aid and training to African countries, with a focus on counterterrorism efforts and peacekeeping operations. However, there have been concerns about the effectiveness and potential negative consequences of these efforts.

In conclusion, the U.S. has a complex and evolving relationship with Sub-Saharan Africa. While there have been challenges and criticisms, the U.S. remains committed to promoting economic growth, stability, and security in the region. As the region continues to face significant challenges, it is important for the U.S. to balance its economic and security interests with its responsibility to address historical and current issues in Africa.

### Subsection: 10.3a U.S. Role in African Peacekeeping

The United States has played a significant role in African peacekeeping efforts, particularly through its support for the African Union (AU) and its peacekeeping missions. The AU is a continental organization consisting of 55 member states, with the primary goal of promoting unity, peace, and development in Africa. The U.S. has been a key partner of the AU, providing financial and logistical support for its peacekeeping missions.

The U.S. has been particularly involved in the AU's peacekeeping efforts in Sudan, Somalia, and the Central African Republic. In Sudan, the U.S. has provided significant financial and logistical support for the AU's peacekeeping mission, known as the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS). This mission has been instrumental in maintaining peace and stability in Sudan, particularly in the Darfur region, where conflict has been ongoing since 2003.

In Somalia, the U.S. has been a key partner of the AU's peacekeeping mission, known as the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). The U.S. has provided significant financial and logistical support for this mission, which has been crucial in maintaining peace and stability in Somalia, particularly in the capital city of Mogadishu.

In the Central African Republic, the U.S. has been a key partner of the AU's peacekeeping mission, known as the African Union Mission in the Central African Republic (MISCA). This mission has been instrumental in maintaining peace and stability in the country, which has been facing political instability and violence since 2013.

The U.S. has also been a key partner of the AU's peacekeeping efforts in other African countries, including Mali, Niger, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In these countries, the U.S. has provided financial and logistical support for the AU's peacekeeping missions, which have been crucial in maintaining peace and stability.

Despite these efforts, the U.S. has faced criticism for its approach to African peacekeeping. Some argue that the U.S. has been too lenient in its support for the AU's peacekeeping efforts, without adequately addressing issues such as corruption and human rights abuses by AU peacekeepers. Others argue that the U.S. has been too quick to support the AU's peacekeeping efforts, without adequately addressing the root causes of conflict in Africa.

In conclusion, the U.S. has played a significant role in African peacekeeping efforts, particularly through its support for the AU. However, there is still much work to be done to address the root causes of conflict in Africa and to ensure that peacekeeping efforts are carried out in a transparent and accountable manner.




### Subsection: 10.3b U.S. Aid to Africa

The United States has been a significant donor of aid to Africa, with a focus on promoting economic growth, improving health outcomes, and enhancing security. This aid is often provided through various channels, including direct bilateral assistance, multilateral organizations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

#### Direct Bilateral Assistance

Direct bilateral assistance is aid provided directly from the U.S. government to African countries. This assistance is often targeted at specific development goals, such as improving health outcomes, promoting economic growth, or enhancing security. For example, the U.S. has provided direct bilateral assistance to support the development of infrastructure in Africa, such as roads, bridges, and power grids. This assistance has been crucial in promoting economic growth and improving the quality of life for Africans.

#### Multilateral Organizations

The U.S. is a significant contributor to multilateral organizations that provide aid to Africa, such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the United Nations. These organizations often provide loans and grants to African countries for various development projects. For instance, the World Bank has provided loans to support infrastructure development in Africa, while the IMF has provided financial assistance to help African countries manage their debt and promote economic stability.

#### Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)

The U.S. also supports various NGOs that provide aid to Africa. These NGOs often focus on specific development issues, such as health, education, or environmental conservation. For example, the U.S. has provided support to NGOs working to improve health outcomes in Africa, such as the fight against HIV/AIDS and malaria. This support has been crucial in saving lives and improving the health of Africans.

#### Criticism and Controversy

Despite its significant contributions, the U.S. aid to Africa has faced criticism and controversy. Some critics argue that the U.S. aid is often tied to political and economic interests, rather than purely humanitarian concerns. Others argue that the aid is not enough and that the U.S. should increase its contributions to address the significant development challenges facing Africa.

In addition, there have been controversies surrounding the use of U.S. aid in Africa. For instance, there have been reports of corruption and mismanagement of aid funds in some African countries. These issues have raised questions about the effectiveness of U.S. aid and the need for better oversight and accountability.

Despite these challenges, the U.S. remains a significant partner in Africa's development efforts. Its contributions have been crucial in promoting economic growth, improving health outcomes, and enhancing security in Africa. However, there is a need for continued evaluation and improvement of U.S. aid policies to ensure that it is effectively addressing the development challenges facing Africa.


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the complex relationship between the United States and Africa. We have examined the historical context of U.S. involvement in Africa, from the transatlantic slave trade to the Cold War and beyond. We have also delved into the various factors that influence U.S. foreign policy towards Africa, including economic interests, security concerns, and humanitarian considerations.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is the importance of understanding the diverse and dynamic nature of Africa. The continent is home to 54 countries, each with its own unique history, culture, and political landscape. This diversity makes it challenging for the U.S. to adopt a one-size-fits-all approach to foreign policy. Instead, a nuanced and context-specific understanding is necessary to effectively engage with African nations.

Another important aspect to consider is the impact of U.S. foreign policy on Africa. While the U.S. has played a significant role in shaping the continent's history, its actions have also had both positive and negative consequences. For instance, the U.S. has been instrumental in promoting democracy and economic growth in some African countries, but its involvement has also been criticized for perpetuating neoliberal ideology and exacerbating social and economic inequalities.

In conclusion, the relationship between the U.S. and Africa is complex and multifaceted. It is crucial for policymakers and scholars to continue exploring and analyzing this relationship to better understand its dynamics and potential for future cooperation.

## Chapter: American Foreign Policy: A Comprehensive Analysis

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the complex relationship between the United States and Latin America. The United States has a long history of involvement in Latin America, dating back to the 19th century when the U.S. expanded its territory through the acquisition of land from Spain and France. Since then, the U.S. has played a significant role in shaping the political, economic, and social landscape of Latin America.

The U.S. has been both a source of support and conflict for Latin American countries. On one hand, the U.S. has provided economic aid and investment, as well as military assistance, to help stabilize and modernize Latin American nations. On the other hand, the U.S. has also been criticized for its interventionist policies, often using its economic and military power to influence the political outcomes in Latin America.

In this chapter, we will explore the various aspects of U.S. foreign policy towards Latin America, including economic, political, and military relations. We will also examine the historical context of this relationship and how it has evolved over time. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamics between the U.S. and Latin America, and the impact of U.S. foreign policy on the region.

Energy is another key sector in the trade relationship. The U.S. is a major importer of oil from Africa, with Nigeria and Angola being the largest suppliers. The U.S. also exports energy-related services and technology to Africa, helping to support the development of the African energy sector.

Services, including tourism and business services, are also important components of the trade relationship. The U.S. is a major destination for African tourists, and African countries are increasingly attractive destinations for U.S. businesses.

#### Impact of Trade on the African Economy

Trade plays a crucial role in the African economy, contributing to economic growth and development. The U.S. is one of the largest markets for African exports, providing a significant source of foreign exchange earnings. This has been particularly important for African countries that are heavily reliant on commodity exports, such as oil and minerals.

Trade also plays a key role in promoting economic diversification in Africa. As African countries develop their manufacturing sectors, they are increasingly able to export a wider range of goods to the U.S. and other global markets. This not only creates jobs and stimulates economic growth, but also helps to reduce the economic vulnerability of African countries.

#### Role of Trade in Promoting Economic Growth and Development

Trade is a key driver of economic growth and development in Africa. It provides a means for African countries to access global markets and compete on a global scale. The U.S. has been a key partner in this regard, providing market access for African goods and services, and supporting the development of African industries.

The U.S. has also been a significant investor in Africa, with a particular focus on infrastructure development. This investment has been crucial in supporting economic growth and development, and has helped to create a more conducive environment for trade and investment.

In conclusion, trade plays a crucial role in the relationship between the U.S. and Africa. It is a key driver of economic growth and development, and provides a means for African countries to access global markets and compete on a global scale. As the African economy continues to grow and diversify, the trade relationship between the U.S. and Africa is expected to continue to expand and deepen.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the United States has a complex and multifaceted relationship with Africa. The U.S. has been a major player in African affairs, both politically and economically, for decades. The U.S. has been involved in various conflicts and interventions in Africa, often with the aim of promoting democracy and stability. However, these interventions have not always been successful, and have sometimes resulted in unintended consequences.

The U.S. has also been a major trading partner and investor in Africa. The U.S. has invested billions of dollars in Africa, particularly in the oil and mining sectors. This investment has been crucial for the economic development of many African countries, but it has also been a source of controversy due to the potential negative impacts on local communities and the environment.

Despite these complexities, the U.S. and Africa have a strong and growing relationship. The U.S. is committed to working with Africa to address its challenges and promote its development. The U.S. has launched various initiatives, such as the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), to support economic growth and development in Africa.

In the future, it is likely that the U.S. will continue to play a significant role in African affairs. The U.S. will need to navigate the complexities of the African landscape, balancing its economic and security interests with its commitment to promoting democracy and human rights. The U.S. will also need to work closely with African countries to address the challenges they face, and to promote sustainable and equitable development.

This chapter will provide a comprehensive analysis of U.S. foreign policy in South Asia, examining the historical context, key events, and current strategies of the United States in this important region.

The United States has been involved in South Asia since the 19th century, primarily through its colonial possessions in the Philippines and its strategic interests in India and China. However, it was not until the mid-20th century that the United States began to actively engage in foreign policy in the region. This chapter will explore the reasons behind this shift and the impact it has had on the region and the world.

One of the key events that has shaped U.S. foreign policy in South Asia is the Cold War. The United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a global power struggle, with both superpowers vying for influence in the region. This chapter will delve into the complexities of this rivalry and its effects on U.S. foreign policy in South Asia.

In recent years, the United States has faced new challenges in South Asia, including the rise of terrorist organizations and the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan. This chapter will examine how the United States has responded to these challenges and the implications for the region and the world.

### Subsection: 11.1 U.S. and India

The United States and India have a complex and evolving relationship that has been shaped by a variety of factors, including their respective foreign policies. The two nations have been engaged in a strategic partnership since the 1990s, with both sides recognizing the importance of this relationship in the global arena.

#### Historical Context

The United States and India have a long history of diplomatic relations, dating back to the 1940s. However, it was not until the 1990s that the relationship began to take on a more strategic nature. This shift was largely driven by the changing global political landscape, with the end of the Cold War and the rise of new global powers.

One of the key factors that have influenced the U.S.-India relationship is the shared values and interests between the two nations. Both countries are committed to promoting democracy, human rights, and economic growth. This common ground has allowed for a strong partnership, with both nations working together on a variety of global issues.

#### Current State

Today, the U.S.-India relationship is characterized by a strong partnership, with both nations working together on a variety of global issues. This partnership has been strengthened by the U.S.'s recognition of India as a major global power and its growing economic and military influence.

One of the key areas of cooperation between the U.S. and India is in the defense sector. The two nations have been conducting joint military exercises, and the U.S. has been providing military aid and training to India. This cooperation has been driven by the shared goal of combating terrorism and promoting regional stability.

In addition to defense cooperation, the U.S. and India have also been working together on economic issues. The two nations have signed several trade agreements, with the most recent being the U.S.-India Strategic and Commercial Dialogue in 2014. This dialogue aims to address trade barriers and promote economic growth between the two nations.

#### Challenges and Opportunities

Despite the strong partnership between the U.S. and India, there are still challenges that need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the trade imbalance between the two nations, with India running a significant trade deficit with the U.S. This has led to tensions and calls for more balanced trade agreements.

However, there are also opportunities for further cooperation between the U.S. and India. With India's growing economic and military influence, there is potential for even deeper partnerships in areas such as energy, technology, and space exploration.

In conclusion, the U.S.-India relationship is a complex and evolving one, shaped by a variety of factors.

### Subsection: 11.2 U.S. and Pakistan

The relationship between the United States and Pakistan has been a complex and often contentious one, with both nations playing significant roles in the global political landscape. This relationship has been shaped by a variety of factors, including their respective foreign policies, shared interests, and historical context.

#### Historical Context

The United States and Pakistan have a long history of diplomatic relations, dating back to the 1940s. However, it was not until the 1970s that the relationship began to take on a more strategic nature. This shift was largely driven by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the subsequent U.S. support for the mujahideen, which was facilitated by Pakistan.

Since then, the relationship has been marked by periods of cooperation and conflict. The U.S. has provided significant military and economic aid to Pakistan, while also expressing concerns about Pakistan's support for terrorist groups and its nuclear program.

#### Current State

Today, the U.S.-Pakistan relationship is characterized by a mix of cooperation and tension. The two nations continue to work together on issues such as counterterrorism and regional stability, but there have been significant strains in the relationship in recent years.

One of the main sources of tension has been the U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, which have been met with strong protests from the Pakistani government. These strikes have been a major point of contention between the two nations, with the Pakistani government demanding an end to the strikes and the U.S. arguing that they are necessary for counterterrorism efforts.

In addition, there have been concerns about Pakistan's support for terrorist groups, particularly the Taliban and Haqqani network. The U.S. has expressed frustration with Pakistan's lack of action against these groups, and there have been reports of U.S. military aid being withheld as a result.

Despite these tensions, the U.S. and Pakistan continue to work together on issues of mutual concern, such as the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan. The U.S. has also provided significant economic aid to Pakistan, with the goal of promoting economic stability and reducing poverty.

#### U.S. Foreign Policy and Pakistan

The U.S. has a long history of involvement in Pakistan, with its foreign policy towards the country often shaped by its strategic interests in the region. The U.S. has been a major provider of military and economic aid to Pakistan, but has also faced criticism for its support of authoritarian regimes and its involvement in the country's internal affairs.

One of the key factors that have influenced U.S. foreign policy towards Pakistan is its location in South Asia. As a key ally in the region, the U.S. has been concerned with maintaining stability and promoting its interests in the area. This has led to a complex relationship, with the U.S. often balancing its support for Pakistan with its concerns about the country's actions.

In recent years, there have been efforts to improve the U.S.-Pakistan relationship, with both nations recognizing the importance of cooperation in addressing regional issues. However, there are still significant challenges and tensions that must be addressed in order to fully improve the relationship.

### Conclusion

The relationship between the United States and Pakistan has been a complex and often contentious one, shaped by a variety of factors including shared interests, historical context, and foreign policy considerations. While there have been periods of cooperation and tension, both nations continue to work together on issues of mutual concern, such as counterterrorism and regional stability. However, there are still significant challenges and tensions that must be addressed in order to fully improve the relationship.





### Subsection: 11.3a U.S. War in Afghanistan

The United States has been involved in the war in Afghanistan since 2001, when it invaded the country in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The war has been a major focus of U.S. foreign policy in South Asia, and has had significant implications for the region and beyond.

#### Historical Context

The U.S. invasion of Afghanistan was part of its larger War on Terror, which was launched in response to the 9/11 attacks. The Taliban, which had been in power in Afghanistan since 1996, was accused of providing safe haven to al-Qaeda, the terrorist group responsible for the attacks. The U.S. and its allies believed that by overthrowing the Taliban, they could disrupt al-Qaeda's operations and prevent future attacks.

#### Current State

The war in Afghanistan has been ongoing for nearly two decades, and has been marked by significant challenges and setbacks. The U.S. and its allies have been unable to defeat the Taliban, and the group continues to control large parts of the country. The war has also been marked by civilian casualties and human rights abuses, leading to widespread criticism of the U.S. and its allies.

In recent years, there have been efforts to negotiate a peace deal with the Taliban, but these efforts have been met with resistance from both the Taliban and the Afghan government. The U.S. has also been reducing its military presence in Afghanistan, with the goal of fully withdrawing by the end of 2021.

#### U.S. War in Afghanistan and South Asia

The war in Afghanistan has had significant implications for the region of South Asia. The U.S. invasion and subsequent occupation have led to instability and conflict, with spillover effects in neighboring countries such as Pakistan and Iran. The war has also been a major source of tension between the U.S. and Pakistan, with the two nations often at odds over U.S. drone strikes and Pakistan's support for the Taliban.

In addition, the war has also had economic implications for the region. The U.S. has spent billions of dollars on its military presence in Afghanistan, and has also provided significant aid to the country. However, many argue that this aid has not been effective in improving the lives of the Afghan people, and has instead been used to prop up a corrupt and ineffective government.

Overall, the U.S. war in Afghanistan has been a complex and controversial chapter in U.S. foreign policy. Its impact on the region and beyond will continue to be a topic of debate and analysis for years to come.





### Subsection: 11.3b U.S. Withdrawal from Afghanistan

The United States has been involved in the war in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, and the decision to withdraw troops has been a highly debated topic among policymakers and the public. The U.S. has been reducing its military presence in Afghanistan, with the goal of fully withdrawing by the end of 2021. This decision has been met with both support and criticism, and has significant implications for the region and beyond.

#### Historical Context

The U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 was a response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which were carried out by the terrorist group al-Qaeda. The Taliban, which had been in power in Afghanistan since 1996, was accused of providing safe haven to al-Qaeda and was overthrown by the U.S. and its allies. However, the war has been ongoing for nearly two decades, and the U.S. has faced significant challenges and setbacks in its efforts to defeat the Taliban and establish a stable government in Afghanistan.

#### Current State

The decision to withdraw troops from Afghanistan has been a major focus of U.S. foreign policy in recent years. In 2011, President Obama announced that 10,000 troops would be withdrawn by the end of 2011 and an additional 23,000 troops would return by the summer of 2012. This was part of a larger drawdown of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, with only 80,000 remaining after the withdrawal of 10,000 troops. Other NATO countries also announced troop reductions, and Taliban attacks continued at the same rate as they did in 2011, around 28,000.

In 2012, President Obama and President Karzai signed a strategic partnership agreement between the two countries, which designated Afghanistan as a major non-NATO ally. This agreement also included a plan for the transfer of Afghan prisoners and prisons to the Afghan government and the withdrawal of troops from Afghan villages in spring 2013.

#### U.S. Withdrawal from Afghanistan and South Asia

The decision to withdraw troops from Afghanistan has significant implications for the region of South Asia. The U.S. has been a major presence in Afghanistan, and its withdrawal will have a significant impact on the country's stability and security. There are concerns that the withdrawal could lead to a power vacuum, with the Taliban and other extremist groups filling the void. This could have consequences for the region, as well as for U.S. interests in the Middle East and beyond.

In addition, the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan will also have economic implications. The U.S. has been a major source of funding for the Afghan government, and its withdrawal could have a significant impact on the country's economy. This could also have implications for the stability of the region, as well as for the U.S.'s relationship with other countries in the region.

Overall, the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan is a complex and controversial decision that will have significant implications for the region and beyond. It is important for policymakers and the public to carefully consider the potential consequences of this decision and its impact on the U.S.'s role in the world.





### Subsection: 11.3c U.S. Role in Afghan Peace Process

The United States has played a significant role in the ongoing peace process in Afghanistan, which has been a major focus of its foreign policy in the region. The U.S. has been actively involved in negotiations with the Taliban, the Afghan government, and other key stakeholders in an effort to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

#### Historical Context

The U.S. has been engaged in peace talks with the Taliban since 2019, with the goal of reaching a deal that would allow for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. These talks have been ongoing, with both sides making concessions and progress towards a potential agreement. However, the peace process has faced significant challenges, including the ongoing violence and instability in the country.

#### Current State

The U.S. has been actively involved in the peace process, working closely with the Afghan government and other key stakeholders. In February 2020, the U.S. and the Taliban reached a tentative agreement that would see the withdrawal of U.S. troops in exchange for a commitment from the Taliban to prevent terrorist groups from using Afghanistan as a base for attacks. However, the deal was later suspended after a Taliban attack killed a U.S. soldier.

Despite these setbacks, the U.S. remains committed to finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict. In recent months, there have been renewed efforts to restart the peace process, with the U.S. and the Taliban engaging in indirect talks through intermediaries. The U.S. has also been working closely with the Afghan government to ensure that any potential agreement is acceptable to both sides.

#### U.S. Role in Afghan Peace Process

The U.S. has played a crucial role in the Afghan peace process, using its influence and resources to facilitate negotiations and find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The U.S. has also been actively involved in providing support and training to the Afghan security forces, with the goal of building their capacity to maintain security and stability in the country.

However, the U.S. has also faced criticism for its role in the peace process. Some argue that the U.S. has been too focused on its own interests and has not done enough to address the concerns of the Afghan people. Others argue that the U.S. should not be involved in the peace process at all, and that the Afghan people should be the ones to decide their own future.

Despite these criticisms, the U.S. remains committed to finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Afghanistan. The U.S. has also been working closely with other key stakeholders, including Pakistan, to find a solution that is acceptable to all sides. As the peace process continues, it is important for the U.S. to maintain its commitment and work towards a peaceful and stable Afghanistan.

# American Foreign Policy: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Chapter 12: U.S. Foreign Policy and the Middle East

 12.1: U.S. and Israel

The United States has a long and complex history with Israel, a country located in the Middle East. The two nations have been allies since the establishment of Israel in 1948, and their relationship has been shaped by a variety of factors, including shared values, economic interests, and security concerns.

#### Historical Context

The United States played a crucial role in the creation of Israel, providing support and aid during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. This support was largely driven by the U.S.'s desire to establish a safe haven for Jewish refugees fleeing persecution in Europe during World War II. The U.S. also saw Israel as a strategic ally in the region, given its location and potential for economic and military cooperation.

Since then, the U.S. has been a key player in the ongoing conflict between Israel and its neighboring Arab states. The U.S. has provided significant military and economic aid to Israel, and has been a vocal supporter of the country's right to exist and defend itself. However, this support has also been met with criticism, particularly from the Arab world and other international actors, who view the U.S.'s support for Israel as biased and detrimental to peace efforts.

#### Current State

Today, the U.S. and Israel maintain a strong alliance, with close economic, military, and political ties. The U.S. is one of Israel's largest trading partners, and the two nations have a close military relationship, with the U.S. providing significant military aid and support. The U.S. also plays a key role in shaping Israeli foreign policy, particularly in regards to the ongoing conflict with Palestine.

However, there have been challenges and controversies in the U.S.-Israel relationship. One of the most significant is the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has been a major focus of U.S. foreign policy in the region. The U.S. has been involved in numerous peace efforts between Israel and Palestine, but these efforts have been largely unsuccessful due to the complex and often contentious nature of the conflict.

Another challenge is the rise of Islamic terrorism, which has been a major concern for both the U.S. and Israel. The U.S. has been a key ally in Israel's fight against terrorism, providing military and intelligence support. However, the U.S.'s involvement in the region has also been met with criticism, particularly in regards to its support for Israeli military operations and its role in the ongoing conflict.

#### Conclusion

The U.S. and Israel have a complex and multifaceted relationship, shaped by a variety of factors including shared values, economic interests, and security concerns. While the two nations have been allies for decades, there have been challenges and controversies that have tested their relationship. As the U.S. continues to play a key role in the Middle East, its relationship with Israel will remain a crucial factor in shaping its foreign policy in the region.

This support was largely driven by the U.S.'s desire to establish a safe haven for Jewish refugees fleeing persecution in Europe during World War II. The U.S. also saw Israel as a strategic ally in the region, given its location and potential for economic and military cooperation.

Since then, the U.S. has been a key player in the ongoing conflict between Israel and its neighboring Arab states. The U.S. has provided significant military and economic aid to Israel, and has been a vocal supporter of the country's right to exist and defend itself. However, this support has also been met with criticism, particularly from the Arab world and other international actors, who view the U.S.'s support for Israel as biased and detrimental to peace efforts.

#### Current State

Today, the U.S. and Israel maintain a strong alliance, with close economic, military, and political ties. The U.S. is one of Israel's largest trading partners, and the two nations have a close military relationship, with the U.S. providing significant military aid and support. The U.S. also plays a key role in shaping Israeli foreign policy, particularly in regards to the ongoing conflict with Palestine.

However, there have been challenges and controversies in the U.S.-Israel relationship. One of the most significant is the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has been a major focus of U.S. foreign policy in the region. The U.S. has been involved in numerous peace efforts between Israel and Palestine, but these efforts have been largely unsuccessful due to the complex and often contentious nature of the conflict.

#### U.S. Role in Israeli-Palestinian Conflict

The U.S. has been heavily involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since its inception. In 1967, during the Six-Day War, the U.S. provided Israel with military aid and support, which was crucial in their victory over Egypt, Syria, and Jordan. This support has been a source of controversy, with some arguing that it has only perpetuated the conflict and hindered peace efforts.

Despite this support, the U.S. has also been a key player in peace efforts between Israel and Palestine. In 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson attempted to broker a ceasefire between Israel and its Arab neighbors, but these efforts were unsuccessful. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter successfully negotiated the Camp David Accords, which led to the establishment of Egyptian-Israeli peace. However, these efforts have been largely unsuccessful in resolving the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine.

#### U.S. Withdrawal from Iraq and the Middle East

In recent years, there has been a growing movement in the U.S. to withdraw troops from Iraq and the Middle East. This movement has been driven by a desire to end the U.S.'s involvement in the region and focus on domestic issues. However, there have been concerns about the potential consequences of such a withdrawal, particularly in regards to the ongoing conflict with Iran.

The U.S. has been heavily involved in the Middle East since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, which saw the overthrow of the U.S.-backed Shah and the rise of the Islamic Republic. The U.S. has been engaged in a complex and often contentious relationship with Iran, with tensions rising and falling over the years. With the U.S.'s withdrawal from Iraq, there have been concerns about the potential for increased Iranian influence in the region, particularly in regards to the ongoing conflict with Israel.

#### Conclusion

The U.S. and Israel have a complex and multifaceted relationship, shaped by a variety of factors including shared values, economic interests, and security concerns. While the U.S. has been a key player in peace efforts between Israel and Palestine, there have been challenges and controversies in their relationship. The U.S.'s withdrawal from Iraq and the Middle East has raised concerns about the potential consequences for the region, particularly in regards to the ongoing conflict with Iran. As the U.S. continues to navigate its role in the Middle East, it is important to consider the complex and often contentious nature of the region and the potential impact of its actions.

 12.2: U.S. and Saudi Arabia

The United States has a long and complex history with Saudi Arabia, a country located in the Middle East. The two nations have been allies since the 1930s, and their relationship has been shaped by a variety of factors, including shared values, economic interests, and security concerns.

#### Historical Context

The United States first became involved with Saudi Arabia in the 1930s, when it was still known as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The U.S. was interested in the country's vast oil reserves and saw it as a potential ally in the region. The two nations established a close relationship, with the U.S. providing military and economic aid to Saudi Arabia.

Since then, the U.S. has been a key player in the ongoing conflict between Saudi Arabia and its neighboring countries, particularly Iran. The U.S. has provided significant military and economic aid to Saudi Arabia, and has been a vocal supporter of the country's right to exist and defend itself. However, this support has also been met with criticism, particularly from the Arab world and other international actors, who view the U.S.'s support for Saudi Arabia as biased and detrimental to peace efforts.

#### Current State

The U.S. also plays a key role in shaping Saudi Arabia's foreign policy, particularly in regards to the ongoing conflict with Iran.

However, there have been challenges and controversies in the U.S.-Saudi Arabia relationship. One of the most significant is the ongoing Saudi-Iranian rivalry, which has been a major focus of U.S. foreign policy in the region. The U.S. has been heavily involved in efforts to resolve the conflict, but these efforts have been largely unsuccessful due to the complex and often contentious nature of the rivalry.

#### U.S. Role in Saudi-Iranian Rivalry

The U.S. has been heavily involved in the Saudi-Iranian rivalry since its inception. In 1979, during the Iranian Revolution, the U.S. supported the Shah of Iran, who was overthrown by the Islamic Republic. This support has been a source of tension between the two nations, with Iran viewing the U.S. as a hostile power.

Despite this tension, the U.S. has also been a key player in peace efforts between Saudi Arabia and Iran. In 1987, President Ronald Reagan successfully negotiated the Iran-Contra deal, which led to the release of American hostages in Lebanon. However, these efforts have been largely unsuccessful in resolving the ongoing conflict between the two nations.

#### U.S. Withdrawal from Iraq and the Middle East

In recent years, there has been a growing movement in the U.S. to withdraw troops from Iraq and the Middle East. This movement has been driven by a desire to end the U.S.'s involvement in the region and focus on domestic issues. However, there have been concerns about the potential consequences of such a withdrawal, particularly in regards to the ongoing conflict with Iran.

The U.S. has been heavily involved in the Middle East since the 1970s, with a particular focus on the ongoing conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran. With the U.S.'s withdrawal from Iraq, there have been concerns about the potential for increased Iranian influence in the region, particularly in regards to the ongoing conflict with Saudi Arabia.

### Conclusion

The U.S. and Saudi Arabia have a complex and multifaceted relationship, shaped by a variety of factors including shared values, economic interests, and security concerns. While the two nations have been allies for decades, there have been challenges and controversies in their relationship, particularly in regards to the ongoing conflict with Iran. As the U.S. continues to navigate its role in the Middle East, it is important to consider the complex and often contentious nature of the region and the potential consequences of its actions.

## Chapter 13: U.S. Foreign Policy and Africa




### Introduction

The United States and Canada have a long history of diplomatic relations, dating back to the 18th century. Over the years, the two nations have developed a strong economic and political relationship, with both countries being major trading partners and allies. In this chapter, we will delve into the complexities of U.S. foreign policy towards Canada, examining the historical context, current state, and future prospects of this important relationship.

Throughout history, the United States and Canada have had a complex relationship, with periods of cooperation and conflict. The two nations share a border that stretches over 5,500 miles, and have a long history of trade and economic ties. However, there have also been periods of tension and disagreement, particularly over issues such as trade and immigration.

In recent years, the United States and Canada have worked to strengthen their relationship, with both nations recognizing the importance of cooperation in addressing global challenges. This includes issues such as climate change, border security, and economic growth. However, there are still areas of disagreement and potential conflict, such as the ongoing trade dispute between the two nations.

In this chapter, we will explore the history of U.S. foreign policy towards Canada, examining key events and developments that have shaped this relationship. We will also analyze current policies and initiatives, and discuss potential future developments and challenges. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the complexities of U.S. foreign policy towards Canada, and the impact it has on both nations and the global community.




### Subsection: 13.1 U.S.-Canada Trade Relations

The United States and Canada have a long history of trade relations, with a strong focus on energy trade. The two nations have a highly integrated energy relationship, with Canada being the largest foreign supplier of crude oil and natural gas to the United States. This relationship has been beneficial for both countries, with Canada providing a steady demand for its energy exports and the United States enhancing its energy security.

However, this relationship may be changing in the near future. With the growth of U.S. oil and natural gas production and reserves, the United States is no longer seen as an unlimited market for Canadian energy. This has led Canada to seek new export destinations, particularly in Asia. Both countries are also increasingly reliant on foreign investment to develop their resource sectors, with Asia serving as an important source of capital.

The expanding energy investment and trade between the United States and Canada have also led to increased economic ties between the two nations. In 2010, bilateral trade between the United States and Canada reached approximately $1.9 billion a day, making it one of the largest trading relationships in the world. This trade is essential for both countries, with the United States being Canada's largest trading partner and Canada being the United States' second-largest trading partner.

Despite the strong economic ties between the United States and Canada, there have been some challenges in their trade relationship. One of the main issues has been the trade imbalance between the two nations. In 2010, the United States had a trade deficit of $25.5 billion with Canada, meaning that the United States imported more goods from Canada than it exported. This has led to tensions between the two nations, with the United States pushing for more balanced trade.

To address this issue, the two nations have engaged in various trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). These agreements aim to reduce trade barriers and promote fair and reciprocal trade between the United States and Canada. However, there have been some concerns about the impact of these agreements on certain industries, particularly in Canada.

In conclusion, the United States and Canada have a complex and intertwined trade relationship, with energy trade being a significant component. While there have been some challenges, both nations have worked to address them through various trade agreements. As the two nations continue to strengthen their economic ties, it will be interesting to see how their trade relationship evolves in the future.





### Subsection: 13.2 U.S.-Canada Security Cooperation

The United States and Canada have a long history of cooperation on security matters, with a focus on counterterrorism efforts and border security. This cooperation has been essential in addressing the shared threats and challenges faced by both nations.

The United States and Canada have a strong partnership in counterterrorism efforts, with a focus on intelligence sharing, joint training exercises, and coordinated responses to terrorist threats. This partnership has been particularly important in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which highlighted the need for increased cooperation between the two nations.

One of the key areas of cooperation has been intelligence sharing. The United States and Canada have established various mechanisms for sharing intelligence, including the Canada-United States Intelligence Consultative Group (ICG) and the Five Eyes intelligence alliance. These mechanisms have allowed for the timely and effective sharing of information, leading to successful counterterrorism operations.

Joint training exercises have also been a crucial aspect of U.S.-Canada security cooperation. These exercises, such as the annual Maple Resolve exercises, allow for the practice of coordinated responses to terrorist threats and the testing of emergency response plans. They also provide an opportunity for the two nations to learn from each other and improve their capabilities.

#### Border Security

Border security has been a top priority for both the United States and Canada, with a focus on preventing illegal immigration and drug trafficking. The two nations have worked together to enhance border security, including the implementation of various technologies and the establishment of joint task forces.

One of the key areas of cooperation has been the use of technology, such as advanced surveillance systems and biometric identification. These technologies have allowed for more efficient and effective border control, leading to a decrease in illegal immigration and drug trafficking.

Joint task forces, such as the Canada-United States Joint Task Force West, have also been established to address specific border security issues. These task forces allow for the coordination of efforts and the sharing of resources, leading to more effective border security.

#### Conclusion

The United States and Canada have a strong partnership when it comes to security cooperation. This partnership has been essential in addressing the shared threats and challenges faced by both nations, and it continues to be a top priority for both governments. As the two nations face new and evolving security threats, this partnership will remain crucial in ensuring the safety and security of both nations.

We have seen how the two countries have a long history of cooperation and collaboration, but also how they have faced challenges and disagreements. From trade agreements to border security, the U.S. and Canada have a unique dynamic that is shaped by their geographical proximity and intertwined economies.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is the importance of communication and diplomacy in maintaining a strong relationship between these two nations. Despite their differences, the U.S. and Canada have been able to work together and find common ground through open dialogue and negotiation. This serves as a valuable lesson for other countries in navigating international relations.

Furthermore, we have also discussed the impact of U.S. foreign policy on Canada, particularly in terms of trade and security. The U.S. has been a major trading partner for Canada, and any changes in U.S. trade policies can have significant consequences for the Canadian economy. Similarly, the U.S. plays a crucial role in Canada's border security, and any changes in U.S. immigration policies can have a direct impact on Canada.

In conclusion, the relationship between the United States and Canada is complex and multifaceted, but it is also one of the most important in the world. The two nations have a shared history, intertwined economies, and a responsibility to work together to address global issues. By understanding the dynamics of this relationship, we can gain valuable insights into the intricacies of foreign policy and the importance of effective communication and diplomacy.

WCS Canada works to conserve wildlife and wild places in Canada and around the world. The organization has been instrumental in addressing issues such as white-nose syndrome (WNS), a disease that has "eradicated millions of bats in eastern North America." WCS Canada's Arctic research team has also been monitoring "ship noise and whale communications" for "potential impacts of increased ship traffic and noise" on whales and other marine mammals in the Northwest Passage.

#### Major Conservation Achievements

In 2018, WCS Canada improved tracking of wolverine populations through tagging in northern Ontario's boreal forest. They nurtured deep relationships with Indigenous Peoples in Canada to inform wildlife conservation projects "given the significant local knowledge" and "community-based monitoring". They worked with First Nations communities in Yukon and northern British Columbia by sharing WCS Canada's "expertise on conservation of fish and wildlife species to assist with the designing protected areas". In northern Ontario they worked with Moose Cree First Nation on a study of the "differences in lake sturgeon behavior in dammed and undammed rivers." They worked with Inuvialuit communities in the western Arctic, to "monitor seal health and diet as an indicator of the broader health of Arctic marine ecosystems." Scientists at Thompson Rivers University and McMaster University worked with WCS researchers to find solutions for white-nose syndrome (WNS). WNS has "eradicated millions of bats in eastern North America." The WCS Canada Arctic research team monitored "ship noise and whale communications" for "potential impacts of increased ship traffic and noise" on whales and other marine mammals in the Northwest Passage. WCS Canada's scientists worked on a "blueprint" for the proposed Bighorn Wildland Provincial Park which would protect important habitats for wildlife species.

## Chapter 1:4: U.S. Foreign Policy and Mexico:




### Introduction

The relationship between the United States and Mexico has been a complex and often contentious one. The two countries share a long and intertwined history, with deep cultural, economic, and political ties. However, this relationship has also been marked by periods of tension and conflict, particularly in the realm of foreign policy. In this chapter, we will delve into the intricacies of U.S. foreign policy towards Mexico, examining the historical context, key events, and current state of affairs.

We will begin by exploring the historical foundations of this relationship, tracing the origins of U.S. involvement in Mexico and the impact of various policies and interventions over time.

### Subsection: 14.1 U.S.-Mexico Trade Relations

The United States and Mexico have a complex and intertwined trade relationship, with both countries heavily reliant on each other for economic growth and development. In this section, we will explore the history of U.S.-Mexico trade relations, the current state of trade between the two nations, and the impact of trade on their overall relationship.

#### Historical Context

The United States and Mexico have a long history of trade relations, dating back to the 19th century when the U.S. established trade agreements with Mexico. However, it was not until the 1990s that trade between the two nations truly began to flourish. In 1997, the two countries signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which eliminated tariffs and other trade barriers between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. This agreement has had a significant impact on the trade relationship between the U.S. and Mexico, with trade between the two nations increasing by over 500% since its implementation.

#### Current State of Trade

Today, the U.S. and Mexico have one of the largest trading relationships in the world, with two-way trade reaching over $1 billion in 2018. Mexico is the United States' third-largest trading partner, and the U.S. is Mexico's second-largest trading partner. The two nations have a diverse range of trade, with the U.S. exporting goods such as machinery, electronics, and chemicals to Mexico, and Mexico exporting goods such as vehicles, oil, and agricultural products to the U.S.

#### Impact of Trade

The trade relationship between the U.S. and Mexico has had a significant impact on both nations' economies. In the U.S., trade with Mexico supports over 1.7 million jobs, and the two nations have a combined trade surplus of over $80 billion. In Mexico, trade with the U.S. has led to economic growth and development, with the country's GDP increasing by over 60% since the implementation of NAFTA.

However, the trade relationship has also faced challenges, particularly in regards to immigration and labor practices. The U.S. has raised concerns about the lack of labor protections in Mexico, leading to the exploitation of workers and the importation of goods produced by forced labor. In response, the U.S. has implemented the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) to promote fair labor practices in Mexico and other developing countries.

#### Future of Trade

The U.S. and Mexico have a complex and intertwined trade relationship, with both nations heavily reliant on each other for economic growth and development. As the two nations continue to navigate their trade relationship, it is essential to address any concerns and work towards a mutually beneficial agreement that promotes fair labor practices and economic growth. The future of U.S.-Mexico trade relations will continue to shape the relationship between these two neighboring nations.





### Subsection: 14.2 U.S.-Mexico Security Cooperation

The United States and Mexico have a complex and often contentious relationship when it comes to security cooperation. The two nations share a long border, with over 1,900 miles of it being undeveloped and remote, making it difficult for the U.S. to monitor and control illegal activity. This has led to a significant issue with illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and other forms of transnational crime.

#### Historical Context

The U.S. and Mexico have a long history of security cooperation, with the two nations working together to address issues such as drug trafficking and illegal immigration. However, this cooperation has often been strained due to differing priorities and approaches. For example, the U.S. has historically focused on addressing drug trafficking and illegal immigration at the border, while Mexico has prioritized addressing these issues within its own borders.

#### Current State of Security Cooperation

Today, the U.S. and Mexico continue to work together to address security issues, but there have been significant changes in their approach. The U.S. has shifted its focus from solely addressing issues at the border to also addressing them within Mexico. This has led to increased cooperation and information sharing between the two nations.

One example of this is the Merida Initiative, a bilateral security cooperation agreement between the U.S. and Mexico that was established in 2007. This initiative has provided over $3 billion in military and law enforcement aid to Mexico, with the goal of addressing drug trafficking, illegal immigration, and other forms of transnational crime.

#### Impact of Security Cooperation

The increased security cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico has had a significant impact on both nations. In the U.S., it has led to a decrease in illegal immigration and drug trafficking, with the number of illegal border crossings dropping by over 80% since 2000. In Mexico, it has helped to disrupt and dismantle drug trafficking organizations, leading to a decrease in drug-related violence.

However, there have also been criticisms of this increased cooperation. Some argue that it has led to human rights abuses by Mexican security forces, while others argue that it has not been effective in addressing the root causes of illegal immigration and drug trafficking.

Despite these criticisms, security cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico remains a top priority for both nations. As the two nations continue to work together, it is important to address these issues and find a balance that benefits both nations while also respecting their sovereignty.





### Subsection: 14.3a U.S. Border Wall and Mexico

The issue of a border wall between the United States and Mexico has been a contentious topic in U.S. foreign policy for decades. It has been a key campaign promise of many U.S. presidential candidates, and has been a major point of contention between the U.S. and Mexico.

#### Historical Context

The idea of a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico dates back to the 19th century, when the U.S. and Mexico were engaged in territorial disputes. The U.S. ultimately acquired the land that is now the southwestern United States from Mexico in the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. Since then, there have been efforts to secure the border, including the construction of physical barriers such as fences and walls.

In recent years, the issue of a border wall has become more prominent due to the increasing concern over illegal immigration and drug trafficking. The U.S. has spent billions of dollars on border security, including the construction of physical barriers, but the issue remains a major concern for both nations.

#### Current State of the Border Wall

Today, the U.S. and Mexico share a border that is over 1,900 miles long. The existing Mexico–United States barrier is not one continuous structure, but a series of physical walls and physical and "virtual" fences monitored by the United States Border Patrol. The proposed wall, which was a key campaign promise of President Donald Trump, would be a "contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier" along the entire length of the border.

President Trump signed an executive order in January 2017 calling for the construction of a border wall, and in April 2017, the Department of Homeland Security released a request for proposals for border wall prototypes. However, the construction of the wall has faced numerous challenges, including legal challenges and funding issues.

#### Impact of the Border Wall

The proposed border wall has had a significant impact on the relationship between the U.S. and Mexico. Mexico has strongly opposed the construction of a border wall, with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto stating that his country will not pay for the wall. This has led to tension between the two nations, with the U.S. threatening to withhold aid and impose tariffs on Mexican imports.

The proposed border wall has also faced criticism from within the U.S., with many arguing that it is an ineffective and expensive solution to the issue of illegal immigration and drug trafficking. Others argue that it is a symbol of division and hostility towards Mexico, and could have negative consequences for the relationship between the two nations.

Despite these challenges, President Trump remains committed to the construction of a border wall, and it remains a key issue in U.S. foreign policy towards Mexico. The future of the border wall remains uncertain, but it is clear that it will continue to be a contentious topic in the U.S.-Mexico relationship.





### Subsection: 14.3b U.S. Deportation Policy and Mexico

The issue of deportation has been a contentious topic in U.S. foreign policy, particularly in relation to Mexico. Deportation is the process of removing a non-citizen from a country, and it has been a key tool in the U.S.'s immigration enforcement efforts. However, the impact of deportation on Mexico has been a major concern for both nations.

#### Historical Context

Deportation has been a part of U.S. immigration law since the early 20th century. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, also known as the McCarran-Walter Act, established the current framework for deportation in the U.S. The act allows for the deportation of non-citizens who are convicted of certain crimes, have been in the U.S. illegally for more than 180 days, or have been deemed a threat to national security.

#### Current Deportation Policy

Today, the U.S. deports an average of 1,000 people per day, with the majority of those deportations occurring at the U.S.-Mexico border. The U.S. has also entered into agreements with Mexico to accept the return of Mexican nationals who are deported from the U.S. This has led to a significant increase in the number of deportations from the U.S. to Mexico.

#### Impact of Deportation on Mexico

The high rate of deportations from the U.S. to Mexico has had a significant impact on Mexico. Many deportees return to Mexico with limited resources and face challenges in reintegrating into society. This has led to an increase in poverty and social issues in Mexico, particularly in border communities.

Furthermore, the U.S.'s deportation policy has also had a ripple effect on Mexico's own immigration policies. In response to the high number of deportations, Mexico has implemented stricter immigration policies and increased border security. This has led to a decrease in the number of Mexican nationals seeking asylum in the U.S., but has also resulted in the detention and deportation of more Central American migrants.

#### U.S.-Mexico Cooperation on Deportation

The U.S. and Mexico have a complex relationship when it comes to deportation. While the U.S. has been a major source of deportees for Mexico, the two nations have also worked together to address the issue. In 2016, the U.S. and Mexico signed an agreement to address the root causes of migration and to increase cooperation on immigration enforcement. This agreement has led to increased communication and information sharing between the two nations, as well as joint efforts to address the issue of deportation.

In conclusion, the U.S.'s deportation policy has had a significant impact on Mexico, both in terms of the number of deportees and the resulting social and economic challenges. However, the two nations have also worked together to address the issue, demonstrating the complex and often intertwined nature of U.S.-Mexico relations.


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the complex relationship between the United States and Mexico. We have examined the historical context of this relationship, including the impact of colonialism, the Mexican-American War, and the Bracero Program. We have also delved into the current state of affairs, discussing issues such as immigration, trade, and security. Through this comprehensive analysis, we have gained a deeper understanding of the dynamics at play in this important bilateral relationship.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is the importance of understanding the historical context in which current events occur. By examining the long history of U.S.-Mexico relations, we can better understand the underlying factors that shape current policies and decisions. This is crucial in navigating the complexities of this relationship and finding effective solutions to the challenges that arise.

Another important aspect to consider is the impact of U.S. foreign policy on Mexico. As the United States is a dominant global power, its actions have a significant impact on its neighbor to the south. This is evident in issues such as immigration, where U.S. policies have played a major role in driving migration from Mexico. It is crucial for the United States to consider the potential consequences of its actions on Mexico and to engage in a more collaborative and mutually beneficial relationship.

In conclusion, the United States and Mexico have a complex and intertwined relationship that has shaped the political, economic, and social landscapes of both nations. By understanding the historical context and the impact of U.S. foreign policy, we can better navigate this relationship and work towards a more cooperative and mutually beneficial future.

## Chapter: American Foreign Policy: A Comprehensive Analysis

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the complex relationship between the United States and Canada, two neighboring countries with vastly different political systems and cultures. The United States, with its history of colonialism and expansion, has had a significant impact on Canada's foreign policy. This chapter will explore the historical context of this relationship, as well as the current state of affairs between the two nations.

The United States and Canada share a long border, with over 1,500 miles of land and water boundaries. This proximity has led to a close economic relationship, with both nations heavily reliant on each other for trade. However, this economic relationship has also been a source of tension, particularly in regards to trade policies and tariffs.

Furthermore, the United States and Canada have a complex history of diplomatic relations. The two nations have been allies since the 19th century, but this alliance has not been without its challenges. The United States has often been criticized for its interventionist foreign policy, which has had a direct impact on Canada's foreign policy decisions.

In this chapter, we will also examine the role of Canada in shaping American foreign policy. As a neighboring country, Canada has been a key player in influencing U.S. policies, particularly in regards to trade and security. We will also discuss the impact of Canada's foreign policy on its own domestic affairs, including issues of immigration and national identity.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between the United States and Canada, highlighting the complexities and nuances of this important bilateral relationship. By examining the historical context and current state of affairs, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics at play in this crucial relationship.

### Subsection: 14.3c U.S. Asylum Policy and Mexico

The issue of asylum has been a major point of contention in U.S. foreign policy, particularly in relation to Mexico. Asylum is a form of protection granted to individuals who fear persecution in their home country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The U.S. has a long history of providing asylum to individuals fleeing persecution, but recent policies have raised concerns about the treatment of asylum seekers and the impact on Mexico.

#### Historical Context

The U.S. has a long history of providing asylum to individuals fleeing persecution. The 1967 United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, also known as the 1967 Refugee Convention, established the current framework for asylum in the U.S. The protocol defines a refugee as a person who is outside their country of origin and is unable or unwilling to return due to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion.

#### Current Asylum Policy

In recent years, the U.S. has implemented several policies that have restricted the ability of individuals to seek asylum. In June 2018, the Department of Justice implemented a policy to deny that lack of protection from gender-based violence or gang violence were lawful bases for claiming asylum. This policy was overturned by a federal judge in December 2018, but it has had a significant impact on the ability of individuals to seek asylum in the U.S.

In November 2018, President Trump issued a proclamation suspending the right of asylum to any migrant crossing the US–Mexico border outside of a lawful port of entry. This policy was met with legal challenges and was ultimately overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in December 2018. However, the U.S. has continued to implement policies that make it more difficult for individuals to seek asylum, such as the Migrant Protection Protocols, colloquially known as the "Remain in Mexico" program, which allows the government to release migrants with asylum claims to Mexico to await their asylum hearings in the United States.

#### Impact of U.S. Asylum Policy on Mexico

The U.S.'s asylum policy has had a significant impact on Mexico. As the U.S. has become less welcoming to asylum seekers, more individuals have been forced to seek asylum in Mexico. This has put a strain on Mexico's resources and has led to an increase in the number of migrants in Mexico, many of whom are living in dangerous and overcrowded conditions.

Furthermore, the U.S.'s asylum policy has also had a ripple effect on Mexico's own immigration policies. In response to the high number of Central American migrants seeking asylum in the U.S., Mexico has implemented stricter immigration policies and increased border security. This has led to a decrease in the number of Central American migrants seeking asylum in the U.S., but has also resulted in the detention and deportation of more Central American migrants from Mexico.

In conclusion, the U.S.'s asylum policy has had a significant impact on Mexico, both in terms of the treatment of asylum seekers and the impact on Mexico's own immigration policies. As the U.S. continues to grapple with its asylum policy, it is important to consider the impact on Mexico and work towards a more humane and effective solution for both nations.


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the complex relationship between the United States and Mexico, and how it has shaped American foreign policy. We have discussed the historical context of this relationship, including the impact of colonialism, immigration, and trade. We have also examined the current state of affairs, including the challenges of drug trafficking, illegal immigration, and economic disparities. Through this analysis, we have gained a deeper understanding of the complexities and nuances of U.S.-Mexico relations and how it has influenced American foreign policy.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is the importance of understanding the historical and cultural factors that have shaped this relationship. By acknowledging the complexities of this relationship, we can better understand the motivations and actions of both the United States and Mexico. This understanding is crucial in developing effective foreign policy strategies that address the root causes of issues such as drug trafficking and illegal immigration.

Another important aspect to consider is the impact of U.S.-Mexico relations on other countries in the region. As we have seen, the decisions made by the United States and Mexico have far-reaching consequences for neighboring countries. It is essential for American foreign policy to take into account the potential ripple effects of its actions on other nations.

In conclusion, the relationship between the United States and Mexico is a complex and ever-evolving one. By understanding the historical, cultural, and economic factors that have shaped this relationship, we can develop more effective foreign policy strategies that address the challenges and opportunities presented by this relationship.

### Conclusion

The relationship between the United States and Mexico has been a complex and often contentious one. From the early days of colonization and territorial expansion, to the modern issues of immigration and trade, the two nations have been intertwined in both positive and negative ways. In this chapter, we have explored the history of U.S. foreign policy towards Mexico, examining the various factors that have influenced this relationship and the impact it has had on both nations.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is the importance of understanding the historical context of U.S.-Mexico relations. From the Mexican-American War to the NAFTA agreement, the decisions made by the United States have had a profound impact on Mexico and its people. It is crucial for policymakers and scholars to consider this history when making decisions about U.S. foreign policy towards Mexico.

Another important aspect to consider is the role of immigration in this relationship. The United States has a long history of immigration, and Mexico has been a major source of immigrants. However, the treatment of Mexican immigrants has often been a contentious issue, with policies such as the Bracero Program and the current border wall being examples of the complex dynamics at play. It is important for policymakers to address these issues in a fair and just manner, taking into account the historical and cultural context of the relationship.

In addition to immigration, trade has also played a significant role in U.S.-Mexico relations. The NAFTA agreement has had a profound impact on both nations, with some arguing that it has led to job losses and economic instability in Mexico.

## Chapter 15: U.S. Foreign Policy and Canada




### Introduction

The relationship between the United States and Russia has been a topic of great interest and debate for decades. Both countries have played significant roles in global affairs, and their interactions have had a profound impact on the world stage. In this chapter, we will delve into the complex dynamics of U.S. foreign policy towards Russia, examining the historical context, key events, and current state of affairs.

The United States and Russia have a long history of diplomatic relations, dating back to the 19th century. However, their relationship has been marked by periods of tension and conflict, particularly during the Cold War era. The two superpowers engaged in a race for global influence, with the United States representing the Western world and Russia leading the Eastern bloc. This rivalry was characterized by political, economic, and military competition, often playing out on the world stage.

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States has been the sole superpower, and its foreign policy towards Russia has been shaped by this new reality. The U.S. has sought to promote its interests and values while also managing potential threats posed by Russia. This has led to a complex and often contentious relationship, with both countries vying for influence in various global hotspots.

In this chapter, we will explore the key factors that have shaped U.S. foreign policy towards Russia, including historical events, political ideologies, and economic interests. We will also examine the current state of affairs between the two countries, including areas of cooperation and conflict. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamics of U.S. foreign policy towards Russia and its impact on the global stage.




### Subsection: 15.1 U.S.-Russia Arms Control

The relationship between the United States and Russia has been marked by a complex interplay of arms control agreements and violations. These agreements have been a crucial aspect of U.S.-Russia relations, serving as a means of managing and reducing the threat of nuclear weapons. However, recent developments have raised concerns about the future of these agreements and their effectiveness in preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

#### The New START Treaty

The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) is a bilateral agreement between the United States and Russia, signed in 2010, that limits the number of deployed strategic warheads to 1,550 for each country. This agreement also includes verification measures, such as on-site inspections, to ensure compliance. The New START is set to expire in 2026, and there have been ongoing discussions about its extension.

The New START has been a crucial tool in managing the U.S.-Russia arms race. It has led to a significant reduction in the number of deployed strategic warheads, from 2,200 to 1,550, and has also allowed for greater transparency and verification measures. However, there have been concerns about Russian compliance with the treaty, particularly in regards to the development of new weapons systems.

#### Russian Compliance with the New START

Russia has been accused of violating the New START treaty through its development of new weapons systems, such as the RS-28 Sarmat and the Status-6 Ocean Multipurpose System. These weapons are not covered by the New START, leading to concerns about Russian non-compliance. Additionally, there have been reports of Russian cheating on the treaty, such as the alleged movement of nuclear warheads between different types of missiles.

The U.S. has also raised concerns about Russian compliance with the New START in regards to the number of deployed strategic warheads. The Federation of American Scientists estimates that Russia has 5,977 nuclear weapons, while the U.S. has 5,428. This discrepancy raises questions about the accuracy of Russian reporting and compliance with the treaty.

#### The Future of U.S.-Russia Arms Control

The future of U.S.-Russia arms control is uncertain. The New START is set to expire in 2026, and there have been ongoing discussions about its extension. However, the U.S. has also expressed concerns about the effectiveness of the treaty in preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The development of new weapons systems by Russia, such as the RS-28 Sarmat and the Status-6 Ocean Multipurpose System, has raised concerns about the future of arms control agreements between the two countries.

In conclusion, the U.S.-Russia arms control relationship has been marked by a complex interplay of agreements and violations. The New START has been a crucial tool in managing the arms race between the two countries, but concerns about Russian compliance have raised questions about its effectiveness. The future of U.S.-Russia arms control is uncertain, and it is essential for both countries to work towards a mutually beneficial solution to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.





### Subsection: 15.2 U.S.-Russia Economic Relations

The economic relationship between the United States and Russia has been complex and often strained. While the two countries have engaged in significant trade, their political differences have often overshadowed their economic ties. In recent years, the relationship has been further complicated by the annexation of Crimea and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

#### U.S.-Russia Trade Relations

Despite the political tensions between the two countries, the United States and Russia have engaged in significant trade. In 2018, the total trade between the two countries amounted to $25.9 billion, with the United States exporting $11.6 billion worth of goods and services to Russia and importing $14.3 billion worth of goods and services from Russia. The top U.S. exports to Russia include machinery, aircraft, and pharmaceuticals, while the top Russian exports to the United States include oil, metals, and chemicals.

However, the trade relationship between the two countries has been marked by significant imbalances. In 2018, the United States had a trade deficit of $2.7 billion with Russia, meaning that the United States imported more goods and services from Russia than it exported. This trade imbalance has been a source of contention in the economic relationship between the two countries.

#### U.S. Sanctions on Russia

In response to Russia's annexation of Crimea and its involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the United States has imposed a series of economic sanctions on Russia. These sanctions aim to put pressure on the Russian government and its economy, and are designed to limit Russia's ability to access the global financial system and engage in international trade.

The sanctions have had a significant impact on the Russian economy, leading to a decline in foreign investment and a decrease in the value of the Russian ruble. However, they have also had unintended consequences, such as driving Russia closer to China and other emerging markets.

#### U.S.-Russia Economic Relations in the Context of the New START

The New START treaty, signed in 2010, has played a role in the economic relationship between the United States and Russia. The treaty has led to a reduction in the number of deployed strategic warheads, which has had a positive impact on global security. However, concerns have been raised about Russian compliance with the treaty, particularly in regards to the development of new weapons systems.

The ongoing economic relationship between the United States and Russia, despite political tensions, highlights the complex nature of their relationship. While economic ties have been strained, they continue to play a role in the overall relationship between the two countries. As the New START treaty approaches its expiration date in 2026, it will be important for both countries to continue to engage in dialogue and work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.





### Subsection: 15.3a U.S. Sanctions on Russia for Cyber Attacks

In recent years, the United States has also imposed sanctions on Russia for its malicious cyber activities. These sanctions are designed to hold Russia accountable for its cyber attacks and to deter future attacks.

#### U.S. Sanctions on Russia for Cyber Attacks

The United States has imposed sanctions on Russia for a variety of cyber attacks, including those targeting critical infrastructure, financial institutions, and political organizations. These sanctions are imposed under the authority of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which is responsible for enforcing economic sanctions.

One of the key pieces of legislation that enables these sanctions is the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). This law, passed in 2017, provides the legal authority for the United States to impose sanctions on individuals and entities involved in cyber attacks against the United States.

#### Impact of U.S. Sanctions on Russia for Cyber Attacks

The impact of these sanctions on Russia has been significant. The sanctions have targeted key individuals and entities involved in cyber attacks, including former Russian intelligence chief Mikhail Fradkov, who was sanctioned in 2018. These sanctions have also targeted Russian cybersecurity firms and individuals involved in cyber espionage.

The sanctions have also had a broader impact on the Russian economy. As with other economic sanctions, the cyber sanctions have contributed to a decline in foreign investment and a decrease in the value of the Russian ruble. This has put further pressure on the Russian economy, which is already struggling under the weight of international sanctions imposed in response to the annexation of Crimea and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

#### Future of U.S. Sanctions on Russia for Cyber Attacks

The future of U.S. sanctions on Russia for cyber attacks is promising. The developments on legalizing the cyber sanctions in the United States are promising that we might see enactment of more bills focusing on cyber issues at the international level. As of now, there are two executive orders (Executive Order 13694 and Executive Order 13757) that explains how malicious cyber activities will be replied with the use of economic sanctions and other measures. The authority of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is responsible for the initiation and outcomes of the economic sanctions related to cyber-related activities.

The European Union has also taken steps to enhance collective cyber response, focusing on sanctioning the target by creating a new entity, which is called “cyber intelligence working group.” Although there are steps taken in using economic sanctions for cyber-related attacks against the EU, these measures are still in their early stages and there is much work to be done.




### Subsection: 15.3b U.S.-Russia Cooperation on Cybersecurity

The United States and Russia have a complex relationship when it comes to cybersecurity. While there have been instances of cyber attacks and espionage between the two nations, there have also been instances of cooperation and information sharing. This section will explore the history of U.S.-Russia cooperation on cybersecurity, including notable instances of cooperation and the challenges that have arisen.

#### Notable Instances of U.S.-Russia Cooperation on Cybersecurity

One notable instance of U.S.-Russia cooperation on cybersecurity is the U.S.-China Arms Control Technical Exchange Program (ACE). This program, created in 1994, brings together nuclear scientists from major weapon labs such as Los Alamos National Laboratory and China's Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP) to work together on nuclear security issues. This program has been instrumental in addressing nuclear security issues around the world, including in Iran and Ghana.

Another notable instance of cooperation is the U.S.-China Law Enforcement and Cyber Security Dialogue. This dialogue, established in 2017, allows both countries to work together to address problems with hacking and improve global computer security and cyber-security. This dialogue has been particularly important in addressing cyber threats that cross national borders, such as cyber espionage and cyber terrorism.

#### Challenges in U.S.-Russia Cooperation on Cybersecurity

Despite these instances of cooperation, there have been significant challenges in U.S.-Russia cooperation on cybersecurity. One of the main challenges is the lack of trust between the two nations. The United States has accused Russia of engaging in cyber attacks and espionage, while Russia has accused the United States of doing the same. This lack of trust has made it difficult for the two nations to work together effectively on cybersecurity issues.

Another challenge is the differing approaches to cybersecurity between the two nations. The United States has a more open and collaborative approach to cybersecurity, while Russia has a more closed and secretive approach. This has made it difficult for the two nations to share information and work together effectively.

#### Future of U.S.-Russia Cooperation on Cybersecurity

Despite these challenges, there is still potential for future cooperation between the United States and Russia on cybersecurity. The U.S.-China Law Enforcement and Cyber Security Dialogue provides a framework for continued cooperation, and there have been efforts to establish similar dialogues with other nations. Additionally, the U.S.-China Arms Control Technical Exchange Program has shown that cooperation is possible, even in areas where there may be significant differences in approach.

In the future, it will be important for the United States and Russia to continue to work together on cybersecurity issues, despite their differences. By doing so, they can better protect their own citizens and contribute to a safer and more secure global cyber environment.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the complex relationship between the United States and Russia in terms of foreign policy. We have examined the historical context of this relationship, including the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, and how these events have shaped current U.S. foreign policy towards Russia. We have also delved into the various factors that influence U.S. foreign policy towards Russia, such as economic interests, security concerns, and ideological differences.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is the importance of understanding the historical context of U.S.-Russia relations. The legacy of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union continue to have a significant impact on current foreign policy decisions. Additionally, it is crucial to recognize the multifaceted nature of U.S. foreign policy towards Russia, which is influenced by a variety of factors and interests.

As we continue to navigate the complexities of U.S.-Russia relations, it is essential to approach these issues with a comprehensive understanding of the historical, political, and economic factors at play. By doing so, we can better understand the motivations and actions of both the United States and Russia, and potentially work towards a more cooperative and stable relationship between these two global powers.

## Chapter: Chapter 16: U.S. Foreign Policy and China

### Introduction

The relationship between the United States and China has been a topic of great interest and debate for decades. As two of the world's largest and most influential countries, their interactions have had a significant impact on global politics, economics, and security. In this chapter, we will delve into the complexities of U.S. foreign policy towards China, examining the historical context, current dynamics, and potential future developments.

The United States and China have a long history of diplomatic relations, dating back to the 1970s when the two countries established formal diplomatic ties. Since then, the relationship has evolved significantly, with both countries playing crucial roles in shaping global affairs. The U.S. has been a major economic and military power, while China has risen to become the world's second-largest economy and a major military and technological power.

One of the key factors that have shaped U.S. foreign policy towards China is the concept of containment. This strategy, which was first implemented during the Cold War, aimed to limit the spread of communism by containing it within its existing borders. The U.S. has continued to use this strategy in its approach to China, attempting to contain its economic and military power.

However, as China's economic and military power has grown, the U.S. has faced challenges in maintaining its dominance in the Asia-Pacific region. This has led to a shift in U.S. foreign policy towards a more assertive approach, with the U.S. engaging in a strategic pivot towards the region. This pivot has been driven by the U.S.'s desire to maintain its economic and military influence in the region, as well as to counter the growing power of China.

In this chapter, we will explore the various aspects of U.S. foreign policy towards China, including economic, political, and military factors. We will also examine the impact of this relationship on global affairs and the potential future developments in this complex and ever-evolving relationship.

### Subsection: 15.3c U.S.-Russia Conflict in Cyberspace

The relationship between the United States and Russia in the realm of cybersecurity has been marked by both cooperation and conflict. While the two nations have worked together to address global cyber threats, there have also been instances of cyber attacks and espionage between them. This section will explore the history of U.S.-Russia conflict in cyberspace, including notable instances of cyber attacks and the challenges that have arisen.

#### Notable Instances of U.S.-Russia Conflict in Cyberspace

One notable instance of U.S.-Russia conflict in cyberspace is the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. This interference, which has been described as information warfare, has been a major point of contention between the two nations. The United States has accused Russia of using cyber attacks and propaganda to influence the outcome of the election, while Russia has denied these claims.

Another notable instance of cyber conflict is the Russian cyber attacks on Ukraine. In 2014, Russia launched a series of cyber attacks on Ukraine, targeting government agencies, banks, and other critical infrastructure. These attacks were part of Russia's larger invasion of Ukraine, and they highlighted the growing threat of cyber warfare in modern conflicts.

#### Challenges in U.S.-Russia Conflict in Cyberspace

The U.S.-Russia conflict in cyberspace presents significant challenges for both nations. One of the main challenges is the difficulty in attributing cyber attacks to specific actors. With the ability to mask their identities and locations, it can be challenging to determine who is responsible for cyber attacks. This makes it difficult for the United States and Russia to respond effectively to cyber threats.

We have also examined the various factors that influence U.S. foreign policy towards Russia, such as economic interests, security concerns, and ideological differences.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is the importance of understanding the historical context of U.S.-Russia relations. The legacy of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union has had a profound impact on the way the United States approaches Russia. It is crucial for policymakers and analysts to have a deep understanding of this history in order to effectively navigate the complexities of this relationship.

Another important aspect to consider is the role of ideology in U.S. foreign policy towards Russia. The United States has long seen itself as a beacon of democracy and capitalism, and has often used these values as a basis for its foreign policy decisions. However, as we have seen in recent years, this ideological approach has not always been effective in dealing with Russia. It is important for policymakers to be aware of the limitations of ideology in foreign policy and to consider other factors as well.

In conclusion, the relationship between the United States and Russia is a complex and ever-evolving one. It is crucial for policymakers and analysts to have a deep understanding of the historical context, economic interests, and ideological differences that shape this relationship.

In this chapter, we have explored the complex relationship between the United States and Russia, two of the world's most influential and powerful nations. We have delved into the historical context of this relationship, examining key events and policies that have shaped the dynamics of U.S.-Russia relations. We have also analyzed the current state of affairs, discussing the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for both nations.

The United States and Russia have a long history of interaction, dating back to the Cold War era. The policies and strategies employed by both nations during this time have had a profound impact on the global political landscape. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a significant shift in this relationship, as the United States emerged as the sole superpower. However, the rise of Russia under Vladimir Putin has challenged this dominance, leading to a complex and often contentious relationship between the two nations.

Despite the challenges, there have been moments of cooperation between the United States and Russia. The two nations have worked together to address global issues such as nuclear proliferation and terrorism. However, these moments of cooperation have been overshadowed by ongoing conflicts and disagreements, particularly in the areas of human rights and democracy.

As we conclude this chapter, it is clear that the relationship between the United States and Russia is a complex and ever-evolving one. The future of this relationship will depend on the actions and policies of both nations, as well as the global context in which they operate. It is our hope that this chapter has provided a comprehensive analysis of this relationship, shedding light on the historical context, current state, and potential future trajectory of U.S.-Russia relations.

### Subsection: 16.1 U.S.-China Trade War

The relationship between the United States and China has been marked by a series of trade disputes, with the most recent being the U.S.-China trade war. This conflict began in 2018 when the United States imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, sparking a retaliatory response from China. The trade war has had significant implications for both countries and the global economy.

#### The Origins of the Trade War

The U.S.-China trade war can be traced back to the early 2000s when the United States began to express concerns about China's trade practices, particularly its undervalued currency and intellectual property theft. In 2018, the United States imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, citing concerns over China's trade surplus with the United States and its alleged theft of American intellectual property. This move was met with a retaliatory response from China, which imposed tariffs on American goods.

#### The Impact of the Trade War

The trade war has had a significant impact on both the United States and China. The United States has seen a rise in inflation and a decrease in consumer spending, while China has experienced a slowdown in economic growth. The trade war has also led to uncertainty and volatility in the global economy, with many companies delaying investments and expansion plans.

#### The Role of Economists and Analysts

The trade war has been a topic of debate among economists and analysts. Many have expressed concerns about the potential long-term consequences of the trade war, including a potential global economic downturn. Others have argued that the trade war is necessary to address China's unfair trade practices and protect American jobs.

#### The Future of U.S.-China Trade Relations

The future of U.S.-China trade relations remains uncertain. Both countries have expressed a desire to reach a trade agreement, but negotiations have been ongoing for over a year with little progress. The trade war has also been overshadowed by other issues, such as the ongoing political tensions between the two countries. As the trade war continues, it is likely to have a lasting impact on the relationship between the United States and China.





### Subsection: 16.2 U.S.-China Military Rivalry

The relationship between the United States and China has been marked by not only economic competition, but also military rivalry. This rivalry has been ongoing for decades and has significant implications for both countries and the global community.

#### The Origins of the Military Rivalry

The origins of the U.S.-China military rivalry can be traced back to the Cold War era. During this time, the United States and China were ideological adversaries, with the United States supporting Taiwan and China supporting the Soviet Union. This led to a series of military conflicts, including the Korean War and the Vietnam War, where the United States and China were directly opposed.

#### The Impact of the Military Rivalry

The military rivalry between the United States and China has had a significant impact on both countries. The United States has maintained a strong military presence in the Asia-Pacific region, with military bases and alliances with countries like Japan and South Korea. This has led to increased tensions and potential for conflict with China. On the other hand, China has been investing heavily in its military, with a focus on modernizing its navy and air force. This has led to concerns about China's growing military power and its potential to challenge the United States' dominance in the region.

#### The Role of Military Modernization

One of the key factors driving the U.S.-China military rivalry is the ongoing modernization of both countries' militaries. The United States has been investing in advanced technologies, such as stealth aircraft and missile defense systems, to maintain its military superiority. China, on the other hand, has been rapidly modernizing its military, with a focus on developing advanced weapons and technologies, such as its anti-ship ballistic missiles and aircraft carriers.

#### The Future of U.S.-China Military Relations

The future of U.S.-China military relations remains uncertain. Both countries have expressed a desire to maintain peaceful relations, but tensions and potential for conflict remain. The ongoing trade war and military rivalry have led to increased concerns about the stability of the U.S.-China relationship. As both countries continue to invest in their militaries, the potential for future conflicts and confrontations remains a possibility.




### Subsection: 16.3a U.S. Criticism of China's Human Rights Record

The United States has long been a vocal critic of China's human rights record, citing issues such as religious freedom, political dissent, and labor rights. This criticism has been a major point of contention in the U.S.-China relationship, with the Chinese government often responding with its own criticisms of the U.S. human rights record.

#### The U.S. Criticism of China's Human Rights Record

The United States has consistently raised concerns about China's human rights record, particularly in regards to religious freedom and political dissent. The U.S. State Department's annual "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices" has been a major source of these criticisms, detailing a wide range of human rights abuses in China.

One of the key issues raised by the U.S. is China's treatment of religious minorities, particularly the Uighurs and Tibetans. The U.S. has accused China of systemic discrimination and persecution of these groups, including restrictions on religious practice and cultural expression. The U.S. has also criticized China's treatment of political dissidents, citing cases of arbitrary detention, torture, and censorship.

#### The Chinese Response to U.S. Criticism

The Chinese government has consistently rejected U.S. criticism of its human rights record, arguing that the U.S. is hypocritical in its approach to human rights. The Chinese government points to the U.S.'s own human rights issues, such as police brutality and racial discrimination, to justify its own actions.

In response to the U.S. criticism, the Chinese government publishes its own annual "Human Rights Record of the United States," which details a wide range of social and economic issues in the U.S. This report is often used as a tool to deflect criticism of China's human rights record and highlight the U.S.'s own shortcomings.

#### The Impact of U.S. Criticism on China's Human Rights Record

The U.S.'s criticism of China's human rights record has had a significant impact on the relationship between the two countries. While the U.S. has been able to use its economic leverage to push for some improvements in China's human rights record, the issue remains a major point of contention. The U.S.'s criticism has also led to increased tensions and mistrust between the two countries, hindering cooperation on other important issues.

### Subsection: 16.3b Chinese Criticism of U.S. Human Rights Record

The Chinese government has been a vocal critic of the United States' human rights record, citing issues such as police brutality, racial discrimination, and economic inequality. This criticism has been a major point of contention in the U.S.-China relationship, with the U.S. often responding with its own criticisms of China's human rights record.

#### The Chinese Criticism of the U.S. Human Rights Record

The Chinese government has consistently raised concerns about the United States' human rights record, particularly in regards to police brutality and racial discrimination. The Chinese government has pointed to high-profile cases of police brutality, such as the death of George Floyd, as evidence of systemic racism and police violence in the U.S.

In addition to police brutality, the Chinese government has also criticized the U.S. for its treatment of economic inequality. The Chinese government has argued that the U.S.'s capitalist system has led to a widening gap between the rich and the poor, and has called for the U.S. to address these issues in order to improve its human rights record.

#### The U.S. Response to Chinese Criticism

The United States has consistently rejected Chinese criticism of its human rights record, arguing that the U.S. is a leader in promoting human rights and democracy around the world. The U.S. has also pointed to its own efforts to address issues of police brutality and racial discrimination, such as the establishment of the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division and the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

However, the U.S. has also acknowledged that there is still work to be done in addressing its own human rights issues. The U.S. has committed to continuing to address these issues and improving its human rights record.

#### The Impact of Chinese Criticism on U.S. Human Rights Record

The Chinese government's criticism of the U.S. human rights record has had a significant impact on the relationship between the two countries. While the U.S. has been able to use its economic leverage to push for some improvements in China's human rights record, the issue remains a major point of contention. The Chinese government's criticism has also led to increased tensions and mistrust between the two countries, hindering cooperation on other important issues.

### Subsection: 16.3c U.S.-China Dialogue on Human Rights

The United States and China have a complex relationship when it comes to human rights. While both countries have their own unique human rights issues, the two have engaged in a dialogue on human rights in an effort to address and improve these issues.

#### The U.S.-China Dialogue on Human Rights

The U.S.-China dialogue on human rights began in the 1990s, with the U.S. raising concerns about China's human rights record and the Chinese government responding with its own criticisms of the U.S. human rights record. This dialogue has continued to the present day, with both countries regularly raising concerns about the other's human rights record.

One of the key issues in this dialogue has been the U.S.'s criticism of China's treatment of religious minorities, particularly the Uighurs and Tibetans. The U.S. has accused China of systemic discrimination and persecution of these groups, including restrictions on religious practice and cultural expression. In response, the Chinese government has argued that the U.S. is hypocritical in its approach to human rights, citing its own human rights issues such as police brutality and racial discrimination.

#### The Impact of the U.S.-China Dialogue on Human Rights

The U.S.-China dialogue on human rights has had a significant impact on both countries' human rights records. While the dialogue has not led to a complete resolution of human rights issues, it has allowed for a more open and transparent discussion of these issues. This has led to some improvements in both countries' human rights records, with the U.S. taking steps to address issues of police brutality and racial discrimination, and China making some improvements in its treatment of religious minorities.

However, the dialogue has also led to increased tensions and mistrust between the two countries. The U.S. has accused China of using its economic leverage to silence criticism of its human rights record, while the Chinese government has argued that the U.S. is using human rights as a political tool to undermine China's sovereignty. Despite these challenges, the U.S.-China dialogue on human rights remains an important avenue for addressing and improving human rights issues in both countries.

### Subsection: 16.3b U.S. Sanctions on China for Human Rights Abuses

The United States has long been a vocal critic of China's human rights record, and in recent years, has taken increasingly aggressive actions to address these issues. One of the most significant of these actions has been the imposition of sanctions on China for human rights abuses.

#### The Imposition of U.S. Sanctions on China

In response to China's treatment of religious minorities, political dissidents, and its handling of the Uyghur genocide, the United States has imposed a series of sanctions on China. These sanctions are designed to target key members of the Chinese government and its ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP), certain companies linked to the People's Liberation Army (PLA), and other affiliates that the US government has accused of aiding in human rights abuses.

The sanctions take various forms, including visa restrictions, asset freezes, and trade restrictions. These sanctions are imposed under various legal authorities, including the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, the International Religious Freedom Act, and the Foreign Policy Restraint Act.

#### The Impact of U.S. Sanctions on China

The imposition of sanctions on China has had a significant impact on the U.S.-China relationship. The sanctions have been met with strong pushback from the Chinese government, which has accused the U.S. of hypocrisy and double standards. The Chinese government has also taken steps to retaliate against the U.S., including imposing its own sanctions on U.S. individuals and companies.

Despite these challenges, the U.S. has continued to impose sanctions on China, reflecting its commitment to addressing human rights issues. The sanctions are part of a broader strategy to encourage China to improve its human rights record and to hold it accountable for its actions.

#### The Future of U.S. Sanctions on China

The future of U.S. sanctions on China is uncertain. Some analysts argue that the sanctions are not effective and should be replaced with other strategies. Others argue that the sanctions should be maintained or even increased. The future of U.S. sanctions on China will depend on a variety of factors, including the actions of the Chinese government, the response of the international community, and the political dynamics in the U.S.

In conclusion, the imposition of sanctions on China for human rights abuses is a significant aspect of U.S. foreign policy. While the effectiveness of these sanctions is a subject of ongoing debate, they represent a key tool in the U.S.'s efforts to address China's human rights record.

The United States and China have a long history of interaction, dating back to the 19th century when the U.S. was one of the first Western powers to establish diplomatic relations with China. Since then, the relationship has been marked by periods of cooperation and conflict, with each side often viewing the other through a lens of suspicion and mistrust.

Despite these challenges, the U.S. and China have been able to establish a relatively stable relationship, with both sides recognizing the importance of maintaining a working relationship. This has been particularly true in recent years, as both countries have become increasingly interconnected economically and politically.

However, there are still significant areas of disagreement and conflict between the U.S. and China. These include issues such as human rights, trade, and security. As we have seen, these issues can quickly escalate and have the potential to significantly impact the overall relationship between the two countries.

### Subsection: 16.3c U.S.-China Dialogue on Human Rights

The United States and China have a complex relationship when it comes to human rights. While the U.S. has been a vocal critic of China's human rights record, it has also been a major trading partner and ally. This has led to a delicate balance in their relationship, with the U.S. often using economic leverage to push for improvements in human rights while also maintaining strong diplomatic ties.

#### The Senior Dialogue

One of the key forums for discussing human rights issues between the U.S. and China is the Senior Dialogue. This is a series of bilateral talks between the two countries that have been ongoing since August 2005. The talks are co-chaired by senior officials from both countries and cover a range of global issues, including human rights.

The first round of talks, co-chaired by former Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick and Dai Bingguo, addressed issues such as trade and economic issues, energy security, cooperation against terrorism, democracy, and human rights. The second round, held three months later, delved deeper into issues such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, North Korea, Africa, terrorism, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, energy security, and the risks of pandemic disease. Human rights, democracy, and the U.S.-China trade imbalance were also discussed.

The third round of talks concluded on November 8, 2006, between former Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi. Issues of discussion included North Korea, Iran, Darfur, Burma, APEC, and UN reform.

The fourth round of talks, held in 2007, was particularly significant for human rights issues. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte and Executive Vice Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo met for closed-session talks to discuss U.S.-China relations, and a range of global issues from Northeast Asian regional security, to Iran and Darfur.

#### The Impact of the Senior Dialogue on Human Rights

The Senior Dialogue has been a crucial forum for discussing human rights issues between the U.S. and China. It has allowed for a direct and open dialogue between the two countries, providing an opportunity for both sides to express their concerns and perspectives. While there have been no major breakthroughs in terms of human rights, the dialogue has helped to build trust and understanding between the two countries.

The Senior Dialogue has also been a platform for the U.S. to raise its concerns about China's human rights record. This has led to some improvements in certain areas, such as the release of political prisoners and the easing of restrictions on religious freedom. However, there are still significant human rights issues that remain unaddressed, and the U.S. continues to push for further improvements.

#### The Future of the U.S.-China Dialogue on Human Rights

The future of the U.S.-China dialogue on human rights is uncertain. The Senior Dialogue has been a valuable tool for addressing human rights issues, but it is not without its challenges. The U.S. and China have fundamentally different approaches to human rights, and there are deep-seated mistrust and suspicion between the two countries.

However, the Senior Dialogue has shown that direct and open dialogue can lead to some progress. As the U.S. and China continue to navigate their complex relationship, the Senior Dialogue will remain a crucial forum for addressing human rights issues. It is a testament to the importance of diplomacy and dialogue in addressing some of the most pressing issues of our time.

### Subsection: 17.1 U.S.-Japan Security Alliance

The U.S.-Japan Security Alliance is a crucial aspect of the overall relationship between the two nations. It is a bilateral security agreement that has been in place since the end of World War II, and has played a significant role in shaping the security landscape in the Asia-Pacific region.

#### Historical Context

The U.S.-Japan Security Alliance was established in 1951, as part of the larger Security Treaty between the United States and Japan. This treaty was signed in the aftermath of World War II, when Japan had been disarmed and was in a vulnerable position. The U.S. recognized Japan's right to enter into collective security arrangements, and the Charter of the United Nations also recognized Japan's inherent right of self-defense.

The U.S. saw it as its responsibility to maintain armed forces in and around Japan, in order to deter any potential armed attacks on the country. This was seen as a necessary measure, given the ongoing threat of irresponsible militarism in the world. However, the U.S. also expected Japan to gradually assume responsibility for its own defense, while avoiding any armament that could be seen as an offensive threat.

#### Key Events

One of the key events that shaped the U.S.-Japan Security Alliance was the signing of the Treaty of Peace between the United States and Japan in 1951. This treaty recognized Japan's right to enter into collective security arrangements, and also established the U.S. as the primary security provider for Japan.

Another important event was the establishment of the U.S. military bases in Japan in 1952. These bases were seen as a necessary measure to maintain the U.S.'s security presence in the region, and have been a source of controversy and tension between the two nations.

#### Current State of Affairs

Today, the U.S.-Japan Security Alliance remains a crucial aspect of the overall relationship between the two nations. The U.S. continues to maintain a significant military presence in Japan, with over 50,000 troops stationed in various bases across the country. This presence serves as a deterrent to potential threats in the region, and also allows for quick response to any security issues that may arise.

The alliance has also evolved over time, with Japan taking on a more active role in its own defense. The Japanese Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) have been gradually increasing their capabilities and responsibilities, and now play a significant role in maintaining security in the region.

#### Conclusion

The U.S.-Japan Security Alliance has been a crucial aspect of the overall relationship between the two nations since its establishment in 1951. It has played a significant role in shaping the security landscape in the Asia-Pacific region, and has evolved over time to meet the changing needs and threats in the region. As the two nations continue to face new challenges and threats, the alliance will remain a key component of their overall relationship.

#### Historical Context

The economic relationship between the United States and Japan dates back to the 19th century, when the U.S. was one of the first countries to establish trade relations with Japan. The U.S. played a crucial role in modernizing Japan's economy, and the two nations have maintained a strong economic partnership ever since.

In the 1980s, trade issues with Japan dominated the relationship, particularly the threat that American automobile and high-tech industries would be overwhelmed by Japanese competition. This was due to Japan's economic miracle, which emerged from a systematic program of subsidized investment in strategic industries.

#### Key Events

One of the key events that shaped the U.S.-Japan trade relationship was the signing of the Structural Impediments Initiative (SII) in 1989. This agreement aimed to address the trade imbalance between the two nations by addressing structural impediments to trade, such as non-tariff barriers and market access restrictions.

Another important event was the establishment of the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement in 1994. This agreement aimed to reduce trade barriers and promote fair and reciprocal trade between the two nations. It also included provisions for market access, intellectual property rights, and investment.

#### Current State of Affairs

Today, the U.S. and Japan have one of the largest trading relationships in the world, with two-way trade reaching over $300 billion in 2019. The two nations have a strong economic partnership, with the U.S. being Japan's second-largest trading partner and Japan being the fourth-largest trading partner of the U.S.

However, there have been ongoing concerns about the trade imbalance between the two nations. In 2019, the U.S. had a trade deficit of $67.1 billion with Japan, which has been a source of tension in the economic relationship.

Despite these challenges, the U.S. and Japan continue to work together to address trade issues and promote fair and reciprocal trade.

This agreement aimed to promote cooperation between the two nations in the peaceful use of nuclear energy, while also addressing concerns about North Korea's nuclear program.

Another important event was the establishment of the U.S.-Japan North Korea Sanctions Coordination Committee in 2006. This committee serves as a platform for the two nations to coordinate their efforts in implementing and enforcing sanctions against North Korea. It also allows for regular communication and information sharing between the two nations.

In the 1990s, the United States and Brazil established the Amazon Basin Program, a bilateral cooperation agreement aimed at addressing the environmental and social impacts of deforestation in the Amazon. This program has been instrumental in providing technical and financial support for conservation efforts in Brazil.

#### Current State

Today, the United States and Brazil continue to work closely together to address the issue of biodiversity conservation. This cooperation includes joint research and monitoring efforts, capacity building initiatives, and policy dialogue.

One of the key areas of cooperation has been the development and implementation of the Amazon Fund, a Brazilian government initiative aimed at promoting sustainable development in the Amazon region. The United States has been a major donor to this fund, providing over $1 billion in support since its inception in 2008.

#### U.S.-Brazil Partnership on Biodiversity Conservation

The U.S.-Brazil partnership on biodiversity conservation is a prime example of successful international cooperation. It demonstrates the importance of shared responsibility and mutual benefit in addressing global environmental challenges. The partnership has been instrumental in preserving biodiversity in both countries and has set a model for other international partnerships.

The partnership has been particularly successful in promoting sustainable development in the Amazon region. Through the Amazon Fund, the United States and Brazil have worked together to support sustainable practices that balance economic development with environmental conservation. This has included initiatives such as sustainable agriculture, forestry, and tourism, as well as efforts to protect indigenous communities and their traditional lands.

In addition to the Amazon Fund, the U.S.-Brazil partnership on biodiversity conservation has also included efforts to protect other important ecosystems, such as the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado. These efforts have been guided by the principles of the Convention on Biological Diversity, which emphasizes the importance of biodiversity conservation in sustainable development.

The U.S.-Brazil partnership on biodiversity conservation serves as a model for other international partnerships. It demonstrates the importance of shared responsibility and mutual benefit in addressing global environmental challenges. By working together, the United States and Brazil have been able to make significant progress in preserving their rich biodiversity and promoting sustainable development. This partnership serves as a testament to the power of international cooperation in addressing global environmental challenges.

#### Conclusion

The relationship between the United States and Brazil has been a complex and multifaceted one, shaped by a variety of factors including economic interests, political ideologies, and cultural similarities. Throughout the 20th century, the United States played a significant role in shaping Brazil's political and economic landscape, often using its economic leverage to promote stability and protect its own interests. However, as Brazil's economic power and political influence have grown, the balance of power in the relationship has shifted, leading to a more equal partnership.

One of the key factors in the U.S.-Brazil relationship has been the economic interdependence between the two countries. The United States has been one of Brazil's largest trading partners, with a trade relationship that has grown significantly over the years. This economic relationship has been a source of leverage for the United States, as it has allowed it to exert pressure on Brazil to align its policies with U.S. interests. However, as Brazil's economy has grown and diversified, it has become less reliant on the United States and more able to assert its own interests.

Politically, the United States has often used its economic leverage to promote stability in Brazil. During the Cold War, the United States supported authoritarian regimes in Brazil in order to contain communism and protect its own interests. However, as Brazil transitioned to democracy in the 1980s, the United States shifted its focus to promoting democracy and human rights in the country. This has led to a more equal partnership, with both countries working together to address issues such as drug trafficking and environmental conservation.

Culturally, the United States and Brazil have a strong bond, with many shared values and interests. This has led to a close personal relationship between the two countries' leaders, with frequent visits and joint initiatives. However, there have also been tensions and disagreements, particularly on issues such as immigration and trade.

In conclusion, the relationship between the United States and Brazil has been shaped by a complex interplay of economic, political, and cultural factors. While the United States has played a significant role in shaping Brazil's history, the balance of power has shifted as Brazil's economic and political influence has grown. Moving forward, it will be important for both countries to continue working together to address shared challenges and promote mutual interests.

The United States has a long and complex history of involvement in Nigeria, one of the largest and most influential countries in Africa. This chapter will provide a comprehensive analysis of the U.S. foreign policy towards Nigeria, examining the historical context, key events, and current strategies.

The United States has been involved in Nigeria since the 19th century, primarily through missionary work and trade. However, it was not until the mid-20th century that the U.S. began to actively engage in foreign policy towards Nigeria. This chapter will delve into the reasons behind this shift, including the U.S.'s growing economic interests in Nigeria and its desire to contain the spread of communism in Africa.

The chapter will also explore the key events that have shaped U.S. foreign policy towards Nigeria, such as the Nigerian Civil War and the rise of oil production in the country. These events have had a significant impact on the U.S.'s approach to Nigeria, and this chapter will examine how they have influenced U.S. foreign policy decisions.

Finally, this chapter will discuss the current state of U.S. foreign policy towards Nigeria, including the U.S.'s role in addressing issues such as corruption, human rights, and economic development in the country. It will also explore potential future developments in U.S.-Nigeria relations and the implications for both countries and the region.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of U.S. foreign policy towards Nigeria, highlighting the complex and evolving nature of this relationship.

### Subsection: 20.1 U.S.-Nigeria Security Cooperation

The United States and Nigeria have a complex relationship when it comes to security cooperation. This relationship has been shaped by various factors, including the Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping, the Africa Crisis Response Initiative, and the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS (D-ISIS).

#### Chibok Schoolgirls Kidnapping

The Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping in northern Nigeria in April 2014 sparked international outrage and brought attention to the security issues in the region. In response to this incident, the United States committed to providing assistance to Nigeria. This assistance included sending an interdisciplinary team to assist the Nigerian military, initially comprising 38 members, including two Federal Bureau of Investigation hostage specialists and several military intelligence analysts. 80 American troops were also deployed shortly afterwards.

However, there were tensions between the U.S. team and Nigerian officials, with U.S. officials complaining that Nigeria had responded too slowly in accepting and implementing the U.S.'s offer of assistance. This early stage of the mission saw the U.S. team acquiring commercial satellite imagery and flying manned intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance flights over Nigeria.

#### Africa Crisis Response Initiative

The Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) has been a key component of U.S.-Nigeria security cooperation. Established in 2007, ACRI has been a hub for cooperation against piracy, drug trafficking, oil theft, and border fraud in the Gulf of Guinea. Nigeria is a member of ACRI, and the U.S. and Nigeria co-hosted a virtual D-ISIS conference in October 2020.

#### Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS (D-ISIS)

Nigeria is also a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS (D-ISIS). The U.S. and Nigeria work together to combat ISIS and other terrorist groups in the region. This cooperation includes intelligence sharing, training, and joint operations.

#### Military Support

The United States provides military support to Nigeria through various programs, including the Africa Military Education Program and the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership. In 2020, Nigeria bought over $1.2 million in defense equipment from the U.S. Additionally, a member of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been stationed permanently at the Kainji Airbase in Nigeria to oversee key U.S. Africa Command projects there.

In conclusion, U.S.-Nigeria security cooperation has been shaped by various factors, including the Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping, the Africa Crisis Response Initiative, and the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS (D-ISIS). While there have been tensions and challenges, both countries continue to work together to address security issues in the region.




### Subsection: 20.2 U.S.-Nigeria Trade Relations

The United States and Nigeria have a complex relationship when it comes to trade. This relationship has been shaped by various factors, including the Nigeria-United States Bi-National Commission, the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, and the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act.

#### Nigeria-United States Bi-National Commission

The Nigeria-United States Bi-National Commission (BNC) is a platform for dialogue and cooperation between the two nations. It was established in 1999 and has been instrumental in promoting trade and investment between the two nations. The BNC has been a key forum for discussing trade issues and finding solutions to trade barriers.

#### Trade and Investment Framework Agreement

In 2000, Nigeria and the United States signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA). This agreement provides a framework for trade and investment cooperation between the two nations. It includes provisions for market access, intellectual property rights, and investment protection. The TIFA also established the Trade Policy Dialogue, a mechanism for regular discussions on trade issues between the two nations.

#### Africa Growth and Opportunity Act

The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) was enacted by the United States Congress in 2000. It provides eligible African countries, including Nigeria, with preferential access to the U.S. market for certain products. This has been a significant boost for Nigeria's exports to the United States. In 2019, Nigeria was the third largest market for U.S. exports in Sub-Saharan Africa, with exports valued at $4.7 billion.

#### Trade Imbalance

Despite the growth in trade between the two nations, there has been a persistent trade imbalance in favor of the United States. In 2019, Nigeria's trade deficit with the United States was $1.4 billion. This has been a source of tension in the trade relationship between the two nations. However, efforts have been made to address this issue, including the U.S.'s commitment to increasing its exports to Nigeria's market.

In conclusion, the United States and Nigeria have a complex relationship when it comes to trade. While there have been challenges, the two nations have worked together to promote trade and investment. The Nigeria-United States Bi-National Commission, the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, and the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act have been key instruments in this process.




### Subsection: 20.3a U.S. Criticism of Nigeria's Human Rights Record

The United States has been a vocal critic of Nigeria's human rights record, particularly in regards to police brutality and extrajudicial killings. The U.S. Department of State's annual "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices" has consistently highlighted these issues, citing numerous instances of excessive use of force by security forces, particularly the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).

#### Excessive Use of Force by Security Forces

The U.S. Department of State has consistently raised concerns about the excessive use of force by security forces in Nigeria, particularly the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). The Department's 2020 report noted that SARS officers were implicated in numerous incidents of torture, extrajudicial killings, and other human rights abuses. These abuses were often committed with impunity, as the Nigerian government failed to hold officers accountable for their actions.

#### Police Brutality and Extrajudicial Killings

The U.S. Department of State has also been critical of the Nigerian government's response to police brutality and extrajudicial killings. Despite the establishment of the Presidential Panel on Restitution for Victims of Human Rights Violations, the Department's 2020 report noted that many victims of police brutality and extrajudicial killings had not received compensation or justice. This has been a source of tension in the U.S.-Nigeria human rights dialogue.

#### U.S.-Nigeria Human Rights Dialogue

The U.S.-Nigeria human rights dialogue has been a key forum for discussing these issues. The dialogue, which is held annually, provides an opportunity for the U.S. government to raise its concerns about Nigeria's human rights record and press for improvements. However, progress has been slow, and the U.S. government has continued to express concern about the situation in Nigeria.

#### U.S. Criticism of Nigeria's Human Rights Record

The U.S. government's criticism of Nigeria's human rights record has been consistent and persistent. In addition to the annual "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices", the U.S. government has also raised these issues in bilateral discussions and public statements. This criticism has been met with varying responses from the Nigerian government, ranging from denial to promises of reform that have often failed to materialize.

#### U.S. Criticism of Nigeria's Human Rights Record

The U.S. government's criticism of Nigeria's human rights record has been a recurring theme in the U.S.-Nigeria human rights dialogue. The U.S. government has consistently raised concerns about police brutality and extrajudicial killings, as well as the failure of the Nigerian government to hold security forces accountable for their actions. This criticism has been a source of tension in the relationship between the two nations, but it has also been a catalyst for change.

The U.S. government's criticism has led to increased scrutiny of Nigeria's human rights record, both domestically and internationally. This has put pressure on the Nigerian government to address these issues and improve its human rights record. While progress has been slow, there have been some positive developments. For example, in 2020, the Nigerian government announced the disbandment of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in response to widespread protests over police brutality.

Despite these developments, the U.S. government continues to express concern about Nigeria's human rights record. The U.S. Department of State's 2021 "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices" again highlighted issues of police brutality and extrajudicial killings, as well as the failure of the Nigerian government to hold security forces accountable for their actions. This underscores the importance of the U.S.-Nigeria human rights dialogue in addressing these critical issues.




### Subsection: 20.3b U.S. Aid to Nigeria for Human Rights Training

The United States has been a significant provider of aid to Nigeria, particularly in the area of human rights training. This aid is part of the broader U.S. strategy to promote democracy and human rights in Nigeria, and is aimed at addressing the systemic issues that contribute to human rights abuses by security forces.

#### U.S. Aid for Human Rights Training in Nigeria

The United States has provided significant aid to Nigeria for human rights training, with a particular focus on the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). This aid is aimed at improving the professionalism and accountability of SARS officers, and at reducing the excessive use of force and human rights abuses that have been associated with the unit.

The U.S. Department of State's "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices" have consistently highlighted the need for improved human rights training for Nigerian security forces. In response to these concerns, the U.S. government has provided funding for a range of human rights training programs, including those provided by the International Service for Human Rights (ISHR).

#### International Service for Human Rights (ISHR)

The International Service for Human Rights (ISHR) is a non-governmental organization that works to promote and protect human rights around the world. The organization receives funding from a variety of sources, including major donors, trusts and foundations, law firms, and private individuals.

In Nigeria, ISHR has been a key partner in the U.S. government's efforts to improve human rights training for security forces. The organization has provided training for Nigerian security forces, with a particular focus on the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). This training has been aimed at improving the professionalism and accountability of SARS officers, and at reducing the excessive use of force and human rights abuses that have been associated with the unit.

#### U.S.-Nigeria Human Rights Dialogue

The U.S.-Nigeria human rights dialogue has been a key forum for discussing these issues. The dialogue, which is held annually, provides an opportunity for the U.S. government to raise its concerns about Nigeria's human rights record and press for improvements. However, progress has been slow, and the U.S. government has continued to express concern about the situation in Nigeria.

Despite these concerns, the U.S. government has continued to provide aid to Nigeria for human rights training, reflecting its commitment to promoting democracy and human rights in the country. This aid is part of a broader strategy to address the systemic issues that contribute to human rights abuses by security forces, and to promote accountability and professionalism among Nigerian security forces.




### Subsection: 20.3c U.S.-Nigeria Dialogue on Religious Freedom

The United States and Nigeria have a complex relationship when it comes to religious freedom. While the U.S. has been a vocal critic of Nigeria's human rights record, it has also been a significant trading partner and ally. This has led to a delicate balance in the U.S.-Nigeria dialogue on religious freedom, with the U.S. often walking a fine line between criticizing Nigeria's human rights record and maintaining strong diplomatic relations.

#### U.S.-Nigeria Dialogue on Religious Freedom

The U.S. has consistently raised concerns about religious freedom in Nigeria, particularly in the context of the country's sharia-based penal code. The U.S. government has expressed concern that this code discriminates against non-Muslims and has called for its repeal or significant reform.

In response to these concerns, the Nigerian government has argued that the code is necessary to uphold Islamic values and traditions. However, the U.S. has been unsatisfied with these arguments, and has continued to press for changes to the code.

#### U.S. Criticism of Nigeria's Human Rights Record

The U.S. has been a vocal critic of Nigeria's human rights record, particularly in regards to religious freedom. The U.S. State Department's "International Religious Freedom Report" has consistently highlighted concerns about religious freedom in Nigeria, including the use of sharia-based penal codes and the excessive use of force by security forces.

In particular, the U.S. has been critical of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a unit of the Nigerian police force that has been accused of human rights abuses, including excessive use of force and torture. The U.S. has provided funding for human rights training for SARS officers, in an effort to improve their professionalism and accountability.

#### U.S.-Nigeria Trade Relations

Despite the ongoing dialogue on religious freedom, the U.S. and Nigeria have maintained strong trade relations. The U.S. is Nigeria's largest trading partner, with two-way trade reaching $16 billion in 2019. This trade relationship has been a source of leverage for the U.S. in its dialogue with Nigeria on religious freedom and human rights.

However, the U.S. has also faced criticism for its own human rights record, particularly in regards to police brutality and racial inequality. This has led to some tension in the U.S-Nigeria dialogue on religious freedom, with Nigerian officials sometimes pointing to the U.S.'s own human rights issues as a way to deflect criticism.

#### Conclusion

The U.S.-Nigeria dialogue on religious freedom is a complex and ongoing process. While the U.S. has been a vocal critic of Nigeria's human rights record, it has also been a significant trading partner and ally. This has led to a delicate balance in the dialogue, with the U.S. often walking a fine line between criticizing Nigeria's human rights record and maintaining strong diplomatic relations.
