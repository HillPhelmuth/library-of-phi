Carbohydrates are stored in the body in the form of glycogen and starch. Glycogen is the primary storage form of glucose in animals, while starch is the primary storage form of glucose in plants. These storage forms of carbohydrates are essential for maintaining blood glucose levels and providing a ready source of energy.

#### 1.2a.5 Carbohydrates and Health

The consumption of carbohydrates has been a topic of debate in recent years, particularly in relation to their impact on health. While carbohydrates are an essential part of a balanced diet, excessive consumption can lead to health issues such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, it's important to note that not all carbohydrates are created equal. Complex carbohydrates, such as those found in whole grains and vegetables, are more beneficial than simple carbohydrates, such as those found in processed foods and sugary drinks.

In conclusion, carbohydrates are a diverse and essential class of biomolecules. They play a crucial role in energy storage, providing structure to cells, and in a variety of biological processes. Understanding the structure, function, and metabolism of carbohydrates is fundamental to the study of biochemistry.
