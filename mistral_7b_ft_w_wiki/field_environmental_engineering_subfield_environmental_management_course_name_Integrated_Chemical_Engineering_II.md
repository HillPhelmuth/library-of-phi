This increase has resulted in global warming, which has caused changes in weather patterns, sea levels, and biodiversity.

One of the main contributors to global warming is the release of CO2 into the atmosphere. CO2 is a potent greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere, leading to an increase in temperature. This increase in temperature has significant consequences for the environment, including melting polar ice caps, rising sea levels, and changes in precipitation patterns.

In this chapter, we will explore the global climate and the CO2 problem in detail. We will discuss the causes and effects of climate change, as well as the role of chemical engineering in addressing this issue. We will also delve into the various methods and technologies used for CO2 capture and power plant retrofitting, which are crucial for reducing CO2 emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change.

As we continue to face the challenges of climate change, it is essential for chemical engineers to play a crucial role in finding solutions to this global problem. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding the global climate and the CO2 problem, and how chemical engineering can contribute to a more sustainable future. So let's dive in and explore this important topic together.

### Subsection 1.1b Basics of Process Design

In this section, we will delve into the basics of process design, which is a crucial aspect of chemical engineering. Process design involves the selection and sequencing of units for desired physical and/or chemical transformation of materials. It is the backbone of chemical engineering, bringing together all the components of the field.

Process design can be applied to the design of new facilities or the modification and expansion of existing facilities. The process starts at a conceptual level and ends in the form of fabrication and construction plans. It is distinct from equipment design, which is closer in spirit to the design of unit operations. Processes often include many unit operations.

Process design documents serve to define the design and ensure that the design components fit together. They are useful in communicating ideas and plans to other engineers involved with the design, to external regulatory agencies, to equipment vendors, and to construction contractors.

In order of increasing detail, process design documents include:

1. Conceptual design: This is the initial stage of process design where the basic principles and concepts are outlined. It involves defining the process objectives, identifying the key process variables, and selecting the appropriate process technology.

2. Detailed design: This stage involves the detailed design of the process, including the selection and sizing of equipment, the design of piping and instrumentation, and the development of operating procedures.

3. Construction and start-up: This stage involves the construction of the process facility and the start-up of the process. It includes the installation of equipment, the commissioning of the process, and the training of operating personnel.

4. Operating manuals: These manuals provide instructions on how to start-up, operate, and shut-down the process. They also include accident plans and projections of process operation on the environment.

5. Maintenance and modifications: These documents are maintained after construction of the process facility for the operating personnel to refer to. They are also useful when modifications to the facility are planned.

A primary method of developing the process documents is process flowsheeting. This involves the use of computer software to model the process and generate the necessary design documents.

In the next section, we will discuss the design considerations that need to be made when designing any chemical process unit. These considerations include safety, environmental impact, economic viability, and process efficiency.

#### 1.1c.2 Safety

Safety is another crucial aspect of process design. The goal is to design a process that is safe for both the workers and the environment. This involves identifying potential hazards and designing the process in a way that minimizes these hazards. For example, in the design of a chemical plant, the process can be designed to minimize the risk of explosions or chemical spills. This can be achieved by using advanced safety engineering techniques such as hazard and operability studies (HAZOP) and failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA).

#### 1.1c.3 Environmental Impact

The environmental impact of a process is a key consideration in process design. The goal is to design a process that minimizes the environmental impact, including emissions of pollutants and consumption of resources. This involves selecting the appropriate process technology and operating conditions. For example, in the design of a power plant, the process can be designed to minimize the emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. This can be achieved by using advanced process design techniques such as life cycle assessment (LCA) and process optimization.

In conclusion, process design is a critical aspect of chemical engineering, as it determines the efficiency, safety, and environmental impact of a chemical process. Therefore, understanding and mastering process design is essential for any chemical engineer.

- Continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs): In CSTRs, reactants are continuously added to the reactor, and the products are continuously removed. The reaction is maintained at a constant concentration and temperature, making it suitable for reactions that require a constant environment.
- Plug flow reactors (PFRs): In PFRs, reactants are added at one end of the reactor and products are removed at the other. The reaction proceeds in a continuous manner, making it suitable for reactions that require a long residence time.
- Tubular reactors: Tubular reactors are a type of PFR that is used for reactions that require a high surface area for mass transfer. They are commonly used in the chemical industry for reactions that involve gas absorption or reaction.

#### 2.2a.2 Key Factors in Reactor Modeling

The behavior of a reactor is influenced by several key factors, including:

- Reaction kinetics: The rate at which a reaction proceeds is determined by the reaction kinetics, which can be described by a rate law. The rate law is influenced by factors such as temperature, pressure, and the concentration of reactants and catalysts.
- Mass transfer: In many reactions, mass transfer is a crucial factor that affects the rate of the reaction. This can include the transfer of reactants, products, or catalysts between different phases or regions of the reactor.
- Heat transfer: Many reactions are exothermic or endothermic, and heat transfer can significantly impact the reaction rate and selectivity. This can be particularly important in large-scale industrial reactors, where heat transfer can be a major challenge.
- Residence time: The residence time of a reactant in a reactor can greatly influence the reaction rate and selectivity. This is particularly important in continuous reactors, where the residence time can be controlled to optimize the reaction.
- Catalysts: Catalysts can greatly enhance the rate of a reaction by providing an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy. The behavior of a catalyst can be complex and can be influenced by factors such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of other species.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these key factors and explore how they can be modeled and optimized for different types of reactors.
