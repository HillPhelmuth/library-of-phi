## Foreward

Welcome to "Understanding Military Operations: A Comprehensive Guide". This book aims to provide a comprehensive overview of military operations, drawing from a wide range of sources and perspectives. As we delve into the complexities of modern warfare, it is important to acknowledge the contributions of various authors and researchers who have contributed to our understanding of this topic.

One such author is John Warden, a retired United States Air Force colonel and author of "The Seven Rules of War". Warden's work has been instrumental in shaping our understanding of modern warfare, particularly in the context of airpower. His book, first published in 1995, has been widely studied and debated by military strategists and scholars alike.

Warden's work is particularly relevant to our study of military operations, as it provides a framework for understanding the role of airpower in modern warfare. His "Seven Rules of War" offer a strategic approach to warfare, emphasizing the importance of air superiority and the need for a cohesive strategy across all domains of warfare.

In addition to Warden's work, we will also be drawing from the research of other scholars and authors, including John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, who have explored the concept of "netwar" and its implications for modern warfare. Their work, along with Warden's, will provide a diverse and comprehensive perspective on military operations.

As we embark on this journey of understanding military operations, it is important to acknowledge the contributions of these authors and researchers. Their work has paved the way for a deeper understanding of modern warfare, and we are grateful for their contributions.

In the military context, doctrine serves as the teaching or instruction that guides the actions of military forces. It is a formal expression of military knowledge and thought, accepted by the military as relevant at a given time. 

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) provides a widely used definition of doctrine: "Fundamental principles by which the military forces guide their actions in support of objectives. It is authoritative but requires judgement in application." This definition highlights the importance of doctrine in guiding military actions and the need for judgement in its application.

The Canadian Army, in its 1998 statement, provides a more detailed definition of doctrine. It states that military doctrine is "a formal expression of military knowledge and thought, that the army accepts as being relevant at a given time, which covers the nature of conflict, the preparation of the army for conflict, and the method of engaging in conflict to achieve success." This definition emphasizes the role of doctrine in preparing the army for conflict and engaging in conflict to achieve success.

The U.S. Air Force Air University, in a 1948 study, defined military doctrine functionally as "those concepts, principles, policies, tactics, techniques, practices, and procedures which are essential to the successful prosecution of war." This definition underscores the practical application of doctrine in warfare.

In summary, military doctrine is a comprehensive guide that outlines the principles, policies, tactics, techniques, and procedures that guide the actions of military forces in support of objectives.

The use of strategic bombing in World War II was a significant development in the evolution of modern warfare. The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) conducted a strategic bombing campaign against Japan, targeting its industrial infrastructure and civilian population. This campaign, known as the "Firebombing of Japan," resulted in the destruction of over 60 cities and the death of an estimated 300,000 civilians.

The USAAF's strategic bombing campaign was made possible by the development of the B-29 Superfortress, a long-range, high-altitude bomber that could carry a heavy payload. The B-29 was equipped with four 2,200 horsepower Wright R-3350 supercharged engines, which allowed it to fly at high altitudes and travel long distances. Its computerized fire-control mechanisms made it exceptionally lethal against fighters.

The USAAF's strategic bombing campaign began in June 1944, with the capture of the Marianas Islands. These islands, especially Saipan and Tinian, provided a close, secure base for the B-29s. The campaign was initially unsatisfactory, as the USAAF had learned too much in Europe and overemphasized self-defense. However, in early 1945, General Curtis LeMay was appointed to lead the campaign. LeMay ordered a radical change in tactics, removing the machine guns and gunners, and flying in low at night. This allowed the B-29s to carry more bombs and evade Japanese radar, fighter, and anti-aircraft systems.

The USAAF's strategic bombing campaign resulted in the destruction of Japan's industrial infrastructure and civilian population. The city of Tokyo was hit repeatedly, with the "Operation Meetinghouse" raid on the night of March 9/10 1945, causing a conflagration that destroyed nearly 270,000 buildings over a 16 square mile area, killing at least 83,000 civilians. This raid, and others like it, are considered by some to be the single most destructive bombing raid in history.

The use of strategic bombing in World War II raised ethical and legal questions about the targeting of civilian populations. However, it also demonstrated the potential of air power as a strategic tool in modern warfare. The development of the B-29 and the tactics employed by the USAAF set the stage for future advancements in strategic bombing, including the development of nuclear weapons and the use of precision-guided munitions.

It allowed for a more organized and coordinated approach to naval combat, with the leading ships engaging the enemy while the trailing ships provided support.

However, the line-ahead formation also had its limitations. As mentioned in the related context, the British and French navies often engaged in battles where the British had a numerical superiority. In these cases, the French preferred to engage to leeward, a position that allowed them to retreat before the wind. This tactic, known as "running before the wind," was a common strategy in the Age of Sail.

The British, on the other hand, preferred to engage the enemy from windward, a position that allowed them to maintain a more organized formation. However, this also meant that the British ships were more vulnerable to damage from the enemy's shot, which tended to fly high due to the ships' leaning position.

The Age of Sail also saw the development of new technologies that greatly influenced naval warfare. One such technology was the use of iron in ship construction. Iron was first used in shipbuilding in the 18th century, and it quickly became a crucial component in naval vessels. Iron was stronger and more durable than wood, making it ideal for use in the harsh conditions of naval warfare.

Another significant development was the introduction of the steam engine. The first steam-powered warship, the HMS Terror, was launched in 1782. While steam power was initially used for auxiliary propulsion, it eventually became the primary means of propulsion for naval vessels. This led to the development of more advanced steam engines and boilers, which greatly improved the speed and maneuverability of naval ships.

In conclusion, the Age of Sail was a pivotal period in naval warfare, marked by significant advancements in tactics and technology. The rise of the line-ahead formation and the introduction of new technologies such as iron and steam power greatly influenced the way naval warfare was conducted. Understanding the history and tactics of the Age of Sail is crucial for understanding modern naval warfare.

HQ-6A is a gun-missile air defense system combining a HQ-64 missile launcher with a LD-2000 close-in weapon system # Collaborative combat aircraft

## List of CCAs

Several CCAs are or have been under development # Electromagnetic attack

## Countermeasures

Several countermeasures against electromagnetic attacks have been proposed, though there is no one perfect solution. Many of the following countermeasures will make electromagnetic attacks harder, not impossible.

### Physical countermeasures

One of the most effective ways to prevent electromagnetic attacks is to make it difficult for an attacker to collect an electromagnetic signal at the physical level. Broadly, the hardware designer could design the encryption hardware to reduce signal strength or to protect the chip. Circuit and wire shielding, such as a Faraday cage, are effective in reducing the signal, as well as filtering the signal or introducing extraneous noise to mask the signal. Additionally, most electromagnetic attacks require attacking equipment to be very close to the target, so distance is an effective countermeasure. Circuit designers can also use certain glues or design components in order to make it difficult or impossible to depackage the chip without destroying it.

Recently, white-box modeling was utilized to develop a low-overhead generic circuit-level countermeasure against both electromagnetic as well as power side-channel attacks. To minimize the effects of the higher-level metal layers in an IC acting as more efficient antennas, the idea is to embed the crypto core with a signature suppression circuit, routed locally within the lower-level metal layers, leading towards both power and electromagnetic side-channel attack immunity.

### Implementation countermeasures

As many electromagnetic attacks, especially SEMA attacks, rely on asymmetric implementations of cryptographic algorithms, an effective countermeasure is to ensure that a given operation performed at a given point in time is indistinguishable from a random operation. This can be achieved by using a randomized algorithm, where the order of operations is randomized. Additionally, implementing a one-time pad can also provide a high level of security against electromagnetic attacks.

The satellites each contained seven Motorola/Freescale PowerPC 603E processors running at roughly 200 MHz, connected by a custom backplane network. One processor was dedicated to each cross-link antenna ("HVARC"), and two processors ("SVARC"s) were dedicated to satellite control, one being a spare. Late in the project an extra processor ("SAC") was added to perform resource management and phone call processing.

The cellular look down antenna had 48 spot beams arranged as 16 beams in three sectors. The four inter-satellite cross links on each satellite operated at 10 Mbit/s. Optical links could have supported a much greater bandwidth and a more aggressive growth path, but microwave cross links were chosen because their bandwidth was more than sufficient for the desired system. Nevertheless, a parallel optical cross link option was carried through a critical design review, and ended when the microwave cross links were shown to support the size, weight and power requirements allocated within the individual satellite's budget. Iridium Satellite LLC stated that their second generation satellites would also use microwave, not optical, inter-satellite communications links. Iridium's cross-links are unique in the satellite telephone industry as other providers do not relay data between satellites; Globalstar and Inmarsat both use a transponder without cross-links.

### Subsection: 15.1a The Need for Counterinsurgency

The need for counterinsurgency arises from the unique challenges posed by insurgent groups. Unlike conventional armies, insurgents operate within a civilian population, often blending in with the local community. This makes it difficult for traditional military tactics to be effective. Insurgents can also exploit the local knowledge and support of the population, making it challenging for external forces to gain a foothold.

Moreover, insurgents often operate in a manner that is not immediately apparent to the external forces. They may engage in hit-and-run tactics, ambushes, and other forms of guerrilla warfare. These tactics can be difficult to counter, especially if the external forces are not familiar with the local terrain and culture.

The need for counterinsurgency is further underscored by the fact that insurgencies can be long-drawn-out affairs. The insurgents may not have the resources or capabilities of a conventional army, but they can sustain their campaign over a long period of time. This can be particularly problematic for external forces, who may not have the same level of commitment or resources to devote to the conflict.

In response to these challenges, counterinsurgency strategies have been developed. These strategies are designed to address the unique characteristics of insurgent warfare, and to provide a comprehensive approach to dealing with insurgencies.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the principles and applications of counterinsurgency, exploring how these strategies can be used to effectively counter insurgent groups. We will also examine the historical evolution of counterinsurgency, tracing its roots back to ancient warfare and its subsequent development in the context of modern military operations.




#### 15.1b Counterinsurgency Tactics

Counterinsurgency tactics are a set of strategies and techniques used to combat insurgent groups. These tactics are designed to address the unique challenges posed by insurgent warfare, and to provide a comprehensive approach to dealing with insurgencies.

##### Small Unit Tactics

Small unit tactics play a crucial role in counterinsurgency operations. These tactics are designed to be flexible and adaptable, capable of responding to the unpredictable nature of insurgent warfare. Two of the most common small unit tactics are bounded fire and advancing under the cover of supporting units.

Bounded fire involves having one element of the squad provide covering fire and field obscuration while the second element maneuvers forward to provide covering fire that allows the first element to leapfrog forward. This process is repeated until the maneuver element is in grenade range of the enemy positions. This tactic is particularly effective in situations where the enemy is well-entrenched and difficult to dislodge.

Advancing under the cover of supporting units, on the other hand, requires the squad to stealthily advance towards the enemy position from a weakly held sector after the enemy has been suppressed by overwhelming fire. Once the squad has closed with the enemy, it uses grenades and squad automatic fire to engage the enemy. This allows sufficient disruption of the enemy's control of their defensive front to allow other squads to advance unopposed.

##### Interim Phase

The interim phase of a counterinsurgency operation is a critical period of consolidation. During this phase, the squad consolidates its position by entrenchment, construction of fortifications, creation of passageways between structures, and forward reconnaissance of surrounding areas. This phase also involves minor chemical decontamination, examination of body armor and equipment, and treatment and evacuation of casualties.

##### Defensive Phase

In the defensive phase, an isolated squad may allow a small element to hold a weak and easily evacuated position behind a remote detonated mine, flanked by a machine gun. As the enemy advances, the squad can use this position to engage the enemy. This tactic is particularly effective in situations where the enemy is advancing in a predictable manner.

In conclusion, counterinsurgency tactics are a crucial component of any counterinsurgency strategy. They provide the means to effectively combat insurgent groups and achieve strategic objectives. However, it is important to note that these tactics must be used in conjunction with a comprehensive understanding of the local terrain, culture, and population. Without this understanding, even the most effective tactics may fail to achieve their intended objectives.

#### 15.1c Case Studies of Counterinsurgency

In this section, we will explore some case studies of counterinsurgency operations to further illustrate the principles and tactics discussed in the previous sections. These case studies will provide real-world examples of how counterinsurgency strategies and tactics are applied in different contexts.

##### Case Study 1: The Malayan Communist Party Insurgency

The Malayan Communist Party (MCP) insurgency, which lasted from 1948 to 1960, provides a classic example of a successful counterinsurgency operation. The British, who were then in control of Malaya, employed a combination of military force and political reform to defeat the MCP.

The British Army used a variety of small unit tactics, including bounded fire and advancing under the cover of supporting units, to dislodge the MCP from their strongholds. They also employed a strategy of "hearts and minds", engaging with the local population to gain their support and intelligence.

The British also implemented a series of political reforms, including the establishment of a representative government and the redistribution of land to the local population. These reforms helped to undermine the MCP's support base and ultimately led to their defeat.

##### Case Study 2: The United States' War in Afghanistan

The United States' war in Afghanistan, which began in 2001, provides a more recent example of a counterinsurgency operation. The US employed a variety of small unit tactics, including bounded fire and advancing under the cover of supporting units, in their efforts to combat the Taliban and Al Qaeda.

However, the US also faced significant challenges in their counterinsurgency efforts. The US Army was not as familiar with the local terrain and culture as the British had been in Malaya, and this lack of knowledge hindered their ability to effectively apply counterinsurgency tactics.

Despite these challenges, the US did implement some successful counterinsurgency strategies. They established a series of base camps in remote areas, similar to the British's use of remote detonated mines in the Malayan insurgency. They also employed a strategy of "clear, hold, and build", attempting to clear insurgents from an area, hold it securely, and then build support among the local population.

However, the US's efforts were ultimately unsuccessful due to a variety of factors, including the complexity of the Afghan conflict, the lack of a clear exit strategy, and the US's failure to fully commit to the "hearts and minds" approach.

These case studies highlight the importance of understanding the local context and implementing a comprehensive counterinsurgency strategy, including both military tactics and political reforms. They also underscore the need for flexibility and adaptability in counterinsurgency operations, as the nature of insurgent warfare is often unpredictable and requires a variety of tactics to be effective.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the complex and multifaceted world of counterinsurgency. We have explored the principles, strategies, and tactics that are employed in counterinsurgency operations, and how these are applied in different contexts.

Humanitarian operations are essential in addressing the immediate needs of populations affected by natural disasters, conflicts, or other crises. These operations are often complex and challenging, requiring a deep understanding of the humanitarian context and the ability to operate in a highly dynamic and unpredictable environment.

The need for humanitarian operations arises from the fact that natural disasters and conflicts often result in large-scale displacement of populations, loss of homes and livelihoods, and disruption of essential services such as healthcare and education. These events can have a profound impact on the affected communities, exacerbating existing social, economic, and political challenges.

In the context of the Global Humanitarian Overview 2020, the need for humanitarian operations is particularly acute. The overview highlights the scale and complexity of humanitarian needs around the world, with 168 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in 2019. This includes 70 million people displaced by conflict, 41 million people affected by natural disasters, and 27 million people facing food insecurity.

The overview also underscores the importance of addressing the root causes of humanitarian needs. It notes that while humanitarian assistance is crucial in addressing immediate needs, it is not a sustainable solution. Long-term solutions require addressing the underlying social, economic, and political factors that contribute to humanitarian needs.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the principles, strategies, and tactics of humanitarian operations. We will explore the challenges and complexities of these operations, and discuss the role of various stakeholders, including military forces, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and local communities. We will also examine the ethical considerations and legal frameworks that govern humanitarian operations.




#### 17.1b Humanitarian Operations Tactics

Humanitarian operations are complex and require a strategic approach to effectively address the needs of affected populations. This section will explore the tactics used in humanitarian operations, focusing on the role of military forces, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and local communities.

#### 17.1b.1 Role of Military Forces

Military forces play a crucial role in humanitarian operations, particularly in situations where there is a need for rapid response and the provision of security. The United States Marine Corps, for instance, has a long history of conducting humanitarian operations, particularly in the Pacific region. These operations often involve the use of small unit tactics, such as squad assaults, to provide security and facilitate the delivery of aid.

The two major techniques of squad assault are bounded fire and advancing under the cover of supporting units. Bounded fire entails having one element of the squad provide covering fire and field obscuration while the second element maneuvers forward to provide covering fire that allows the first element to leapfrog forward. This process is repeated until the maneuver element is in grenade range of the enemy positions. Advancing under the cover of supporting units requires the squad to stealthily advance towards the enemy position from a weakly held sector after the enemy has been suppressed by overwhelming fire. Once the squad has closed with the enemy it uses grenades and squad automatic fire to engage the enemy. This allows sufficient disruption of the enemy's control of their defensive front to allow other squads to advance unopposed.

#### 17.1b.2 Role of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)

NGOs play a crucial role in humanitarian operations, particularly in the provision of aid and the coordination of relief efforts. They often work closely with military forces to ensure the effective delivery of aid and the protection of affected populations.

#### 17.1b.3 Role of Local Communities

Local communities are often the first responders in humanitarian operations, particularly in situations where there is a need for rapid response. They are often the first to be affected by a crisis and are often the most knowledgeable about the local context. Their involvement is crucial in the planning and execution of humanitarian operations.

In conclusion, humanitarian operations require a strategic approach that involves the coordinated efforts of various stakeholders, including military forces, NGOs, and local communities. The use of small unit tactics, such as squad assaults, is often crucial in providing security and facilitating the delivery of aid. The role of NGOs is crucial in the provision of aid and the coordination of relief efforts. Local communities are often the first responders and their involvement is crucial in the planning and execution of humanitarian operations.




#### 17.1c Challenges in Humanitarian Operations

Despite the advancements in humanitarian operations, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed. These challenges can hinder the effectiveness of humanitarian operations and the delivery of aid to affected populations.

#### 17.1c.1 Coordination Challenges

The Humanitarian Cluster System, while effective in some aspects, has been criticized for its lack of coordination between clusters. This can result in duplication of efforts and a compromised response to issues that are relevant to more than one cluster. Additionally, poor coordination of clusters can prevent activities from reaching their maximum potential. Many coordinators working in clusters lack the necessary skills, and coordination between clusters is often absent or weak.

#### 17.1c.2 Localization Challenges

The Humanitarian Cluster System centers around international humanitarian agencies, excluding local and national organizations from coordination activities. This challenges the humanitarian principle of "independence," requiring humanitarian organizations to operate with independence from governments. This can lead to a lack of understanding of the local context and can hinder the effectiveness of humanitarian operations.

#### 17.1c.3 Financial Challenges

Cluster members may face challenges for secured financial independence from cluster or lead organizations. This can hinder the ability of organizations to effectively carry out their tasks and can lead to a lack of resources. Additionally, the maintenance of relationships with various forces and actors involved in conflicts can also be a challenge, particularly in terms of financial support.

#### 17.1c.4 Training Challenges

Inadequate facilitation training of many coordinators, and limited time on coordination at the sub-national level, are reported as some of the issues that could prevent clusters from reaching their full potential. This can lead to a lack of coordination and can hinder the effectiveness of humanitarian operations.

#### 17.1c.5 Security Challenges

The provision of security is a crucial aspect of humanitarian operations. However, maintaining relationships with various forces and actors involved in conflicts can be a challenge. This can lead to a lack of security for humanitarian organizations and can hinder the delivery of aid to affected populations.

In conclusion, while humanitarian operations have made significant advancements, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed. These challenges can hinder the effectiveness of humanitarian operations and the delivery of aid to affected populations. It is crucial for humanitarian organizations to address these challenges and work towards improving the coordination, localization, financial, training, and security aspects of humanitarian operations.

In this chapter, we will explore the various ethical issues that military personnel face in their operations. We will delve into the principles and values that guide their decision-making processes, and how these principles are applied in different situations. We will also examine the role of military ethics in maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of military operations.

The chapter will be divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of military ethics. We will begin by discussing the fundamental principles of military ethics, including the principles of just war, the laws of war, and the principles of human rights. We will then move on to explore the ethical challenges faced by military personnel in their operations, such as the use of force, the treatment of prisoners, and the protection of civilians.

Throughout the chapter, we will also examine the role of military ethics in shaping the culture and values of the military. We will discuss how military ethics are taught and enforced, and how they can be influenced by societal values and beliefs. We will also explore the ethical dilemmas faced by military personnel and how they are resolved.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of military ethics and its importance in military operations. They will also gain insight into the ethical challenges faced by military personnel and the principles and values that guide their decision-making processes. This knowledge will be essential for anyone seeking to understand the complexities of military operations and the ethical considerations that come with them.




### Subsection: 19.1a The Importance of Ethics in the Military

The military is a complex and highly regulated institution, where ethical considerations play a crucial role in shaping the actions of military personnel. Ethics in the military are not just about following a set of rules, but also about making decisions that align with the values and principles of the military. These values and principles are often derived from the society in which the military operates, and they are essential for maintaining the trust and legitimacy of the military in the eyes of the public.

One of the key ethical considerations in the military is the use of force. Military personnel are often faced with situations where they must decide whether to use force to achieve their objectives. This decision is guided by the principles of just war, which outline the conditions under which force can be used. These principles include the principle of proportionality, which states that the use of force should be proportional to the threat posed, and the principle of discrimination, which states that only legitimate targets should be targeted.

Another important ethical consideration in the military is the treatment of prisoners. Military personnel are often responsible for the custody and care of prisoners, and they must make decisions about how to treat these prisoners. These decisions are guided by the principles of human rights, which outline the basic rights and freedoms that all individuals are entitled to. These principles include the right to be treated humanely and the right to be free from torture.

The role of military ethics in shaping the culture and values of the military cannot be overstated. Military ethics are taught and enforced through various means, including training, education, and discipline. These efforts are crucial for instilling a sense of moral responsibility and accountability among military personnel. They also help to ensure that the military operates in a manner that is consistent with the values and beliefs of the society in which it operates.

In conclusion, ethics play a crucial role in the military, guiding the actions of military personnel and shaping the culture and values of the military. Understanding military ethics is essential for anyone seeking to understand the complexities of military operations. It is also crucial for maintaining the trust and legitimacy of the military in the eyes of the public.




### Subsection: 19.1b Ethical Dilemmas in the Military

The military is not immune to ethical dilemmas, and these dilemmas often arise when military personnel are faced with conflicting ethical considerations. These dilemmas can be particularly challenging because they often involve life-or-death decisions, and the consequences of these decisions can be profound.

One of the most common ethical dilemmas in the military is the decision to use force. As mentioned earlier, the use of force is guided by the principles of just war. However, these principles can sometimes conflict with other ethical considerations, such as the principle of human rights. For example, in a situation where the use of force is necessary to protect the lives of military personnel, the principle of proportionality may conflict with the principle of discrimination. In such a situation, military personnel may be faced with the difficult decision of whether to use force that may result in the death of an enemy combatant, even though this may not be strictly necessary to protect their own lives.

Another common ethical dilemma in the military is the treatment of prisoners. The principles of human rights, which guide the treatment of prisoners, can sometimes conflict with the principles of military necessity. For example, in a situation where a prisoner is believed to have information that could be crucial for the success of a military operation, military personnel may be faced with the difficult decision of whether to torture the prisoner to extract this information. This decision is guided by the principle of military necessity, which allows for the use of methods that may be otherwise considered unethical, if these methods are necessary to achieve the military objective.

These ethical dilemmas are not just theoretical constructs, but real-life situations that military personnel are faced with on a regular basis. They require a deep understanding of military ethics, as well as a strong moral character. Military ethics training and education play a crucial role in preparing military personnel for these situations, by instilling a sense of moral responsibility and accountability, and by providing them with the tools to make ethical decisions in complex and challenging situations.




### Subsection: 19.1c The Future of Military Ethics

As technology continues to advance and the nature of warfare evolves, the future of military ethics is likely to be shaped by several key factors.
