### Section: 1.1 Transistor Biasing:

Transistor biasing is a critical aspect of solid-state circuit design. It involves the application of DC voltages to the transistor terminals to ensure that the transistor operates in the desired region of its characteristic curves. The biasing circuit must also provide stability against variations in supply voltage and temperature.

#### 1.1a Introduction to Transistor Biasing

Transistor biasing is a technique used to set the operating point or quiescent point of a transistor. The operating point is the DC voltage and current at the transistor terminals when the transistor is not conducting AC signals. The biasing circuit must provide a stable operating point that is not affected by variations in supply voltage and temperature.

There are several types of biasing circuits, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The choice of biasing circuit depends on the specific requirements of the circuit, including the type of transistor, the required operating point, and the tolerance to variations in supply voltage and temperature.

In the following sections, we will discuss the different types of biasing circuits, including fixed bias, self-bias, and active bias. We will also discuss the design considerations for each type of biasing circuit.

#### 1.1b Fixed Bias (Base Bias)

Fixed bias, also known as base bias or fixed resistance biasing, is a simple and commonly used biasing circuit. In this circuit, the base current is set by a fixed resistor. The common-emitter current gain of a transistor, specified as a range on its data sheet as "`h`"<sub>FE</sub> or "`β`", allows us to obtain the collector current as well.

The operating point (`V_{ce}`, `I_{c}`) for a transistor can be set using the base resistor and the collector resistor. However, due to the inherent drawbacks of fixed bias, it is rarely used in linear circuits. Instead, it is often used in circuits where the transistor is used as a switch.

In the next section, we will discuss another type of biasing circuit, self-bias, which overcomes some of the drawbacks of fixed bias.

#### 1.1b Fixed Bias (Base Bias)

Fixed bias, also known as base bias or fixed resistance biasing, is a simple and commonly used biasing circuit. In this circuit, the base current is set by a fixed resistor. The common-emitter current gain of a transistor, specified as a range on its data sheet as "`h`"<sub>FE</sub> or "`β`", allows us to obtain the collector current as well.

The operating point (`V_{ce}`, `I_{c}`) for a transistor can be set using the base resistor and the collector resistor. However, due to the inherent drawbacks of fixed bias, it is rarely used in linear circuits. Instead, it is often used in circuits where the transistor is used as a switch. However, one application of fixed bias is to achieve crude automatic gain control in the transistor by feeding the base resistor from a DC signal derived from the AC output of a later stage.

#### 1.1c Self-Bias

Self-bias is another common type of biasing circuit. In this circuit, the operating point is set by the transistor itself. The transistor is connected in a common-emitter configuration, and the collector resistor is connected to the supply voltage. The base resistor is chosen such that the transistor is just conducting, i.e., the base-emitter junction is forward biased and the collector-emitter junction is reverse biased.

The operating point (`V_{ce}`, `I_{c}`) for a transistor can be set using the base resistor and the collector resistor. The advantage of self-bias is that it provides a stable operating point that is not affected by variations in supply voltage and temperature. However, the disadvantage is that it requires a careful choice of the base resistor to ensure that the transistor is just conducting.

#### 1.1d Active Bias

Active bias is a more sophisticated type of biasing circuit. In this circuit, the operating point is set by an active device, typically an operational amplifier. The transistor is connected in a common-emitter configuration, and the collector resistor is connected to the supply voltage. The base resistor is connected to the output of the operational amplifier, which is set to a DC voltage that provides the desired operating point for the transistor.

The advantage of active bias is that it provides a stable operating point that is not affected by variations in supply voltage and temperature. The disadvantage is that it requires an additional operational amplifier, which adds complexity and cost to the circuit.

In the next section, we will discuss the design considerations for each type of biasing circuit.

#### 1.1e Active Bias

Active bias is a more sophisticated type of biasing circuit that uses an active device, typically an operational amplifier, to set the operating point of the transistor. This type of biasing is particularly useful in circuits where the transistor is used as a current source, as it provides a stable and accurate current source.

The active bias circuit is shown in the figure below. The transistor is connected in a common-emitter configuration, and the collector resistor is connected to the supply voltage. The base resistor is connected to the output of the operational amplifier, which is set to a DC voltage that provides the desired operating point for the transistor.

The operational amplifier is configured as a voltage-to-current converter. The input to the operational amplifier is set to a DC voltage that provides the desired operating point for the transistor. The output current of the operational amplifier is then used to set the base current of the transistor.

The advantage of active bias is that it provides a stable operating point that is not affected by variations in supply voltage and temperature. The disadvantage is that it requires an additional operational amplifier, which adds complexity and cost to the circuit. However, the accuracy and stability of the active bias make it a popular choice in many applications.

However, one application of fixed bias is to achieve crude automatic gain control in the transistor by feeding the base resistor from a DC signal derived from the AC output of a later stage.

##### Self-Bias

Self-bias is another common type of biasing circuit. In this circuit, the operating point is set by the transistor itself. The transistor is connected in a common-emitter configuration, and the collector resistor is connected to the supply voltage. The base resistor is chosen such that the transistor is just conducting, i.e., the base-emitter junction is forward biased and the collector-emitter junction is reverse biased.

The advantage of self-bias is that it provides a stable operating point that is not affected by variations in supply voltage and temperature. However, the disadvantage is that it requires a careful choice of the base resistor to ensure that the transistor is just conducting.

##### Active Bias

Active bias is a more sophisticated type of biasing circuit that uses an active device, typically an operational amplifier, to set the operating point of the transistor. This type of biasing is particularly useful in circuits where the transistor is used as a current source, as it provides a stable and accurate current source.

The active bias circuit is shown in the figure below. The transistor is connected in a common-emitter configuration, and the collector resistor is connected to the supply voltage. The base resistor is connected to the output of the operational amplifier, which is set to a DC voltage that provides the desired operating point for the transistor.
