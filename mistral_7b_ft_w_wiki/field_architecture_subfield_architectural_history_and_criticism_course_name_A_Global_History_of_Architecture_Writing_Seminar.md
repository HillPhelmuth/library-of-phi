## Chapter 1: Introduction:




### Section: 1.4 Euro-centrism and ethno-centrism:

#### 1.4a Definitions and Examples

Euro-centrism and ethno-centrism are two concepts that have been widely discussed in the field of architectural history. They refer to the tendency to view the world from a European or ethnically-biased perspective, respectively. These biases have had a significant impact on the way architectural history has been studied and written about.

Euro-centrism, also known as Western-centrism, is the belief that European culture, society, and history are the center of the world. This perspective has been dominant in the Western world for centuries, and it has shaped the way we understand and interpret the world. In the context of architectural history, Euro-centrism has led to the overemphasis on European architectural styles and theories, while marginalizing or ignoring non-European architectural traditions.

For example, the book "A History of Architecture" by Nikolaus Pevsner, a renowned architectural historian, is a prime example of Euro-centrism. The book covers the history of architecture from ancient Greece to modern times, but it focuses primarily on European architectural styles and theories. This approach reinforces the idea that European architecture is the most important and influential in the world.

Ethno-centrism, on the other hand, refers to the tendency to view one's own ethnic group as the center of the world. This perspective can be seen in the way architectural history has been written about different ethnic groups. For instance, the book "The Architecture of the American Indian" by John P. Brown focuses solely on the architectural traditions of Native American tribes. While this book provides valuable insights into these traditions, it also reinforces the idea that Native American architecture is separate and distinct from other architectural traditions, rather than being part of a larger global architectural history.

These biases have had a profound impact on the way architectural history has been written and taught. They have led to a narrow and skewed understanding of architectural history, one that is heavily influenced by European and ethnically-biased perspectives. As we move forward in our exploration of global architectural history, it is important to be aware of these biases and strive for a more inclusive and balanced approach to understanding and writing about architectural history.


#### 1.4b Impact on Architectural History

The impact of Euro-centrism and ethno-centrism on architectural history cannot be overstated. These biases have shaped the way we understand and interpret architectural history, and have had a profound impact on the field of architectural history writing.

Euro-centrism has led to the overemphasis on European architectural styles and theories, while marginalizing or ignoring non-European architectural traditions. This has resulted in a skewed understanding of architectural history, one that is heavily influenced by European perspectives. For example, the book "A History of Architecture" by Nikolaus Pevsner, a renowned architectural historian, focuses primarily on European architectural styles and theories. This approach reinforces the idea that European architecture is the most important and influential in the world, and marginalizes non-European architectural traditions.

Ethno-centrism, on the other hand, has led to the perpetuation of stereotypes and generalizations about different ethnic groups and their architectural traditions. This has resulted in a narrow and biased understanding of architectural history. For instance, the book "The Architecture of the American Indian" by John P. Brown focuses solely on the architectural traditions of Native American tribes. While this book provides valuable insights into these traditions, it also reinforces the idea that Native American architecture is separate and distinct from other architectural traditions, rather than being part of a larger global architectural history.

These biases have also had a significant impact on the way architectural history is taught and studied. Euro-centrism and ethno-centrism have shaped the curriculum and pedagogy of architectural history courses, leading to a narrow and skewed understanding of architectural history. This has resulted in a lack of diversity and inclusivity in the field of architectural history, and has limited the ability of students to critically engage with and understand global architectural history.

In order to address these issues, it is crucial for architectural history writing to move beyond Euro-centrism and ethno-centrism. This requires a shift in perspective and a commitment to inclusivity and diversity in the field. By incorporating a global and interdisciplinary approach to architectural history writing, we can challenge and disrupt these biases, and create a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of architectural history.


#### 1.4c Overcoming Biases

Overcoming Euro-centrism and ethno-centrism in architectural history writing is crucial for creating a more inclusive and accurate understanding of global architectural history. This requires a shift in perspective and a commitment to inclusivity and diversity in the field.

One way to overcome Euro-centrism is by incorporating a global and interdisciplinary approach to architectural history writing. This involves studying and analyzing architectural traditions from different regions and cultures, and examining their historical, social, and political contexts. By doing so, we can challenge the dominance of European architectural styles and theories, and create a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of architectural history.

In addition, it is important to critically examine and challenge the stereotypes and generalizations perpetuated by ethno-centrism. This can be achieved by incorporating diverse perspectives and voices in architectural history writing. By including the perspectives of architects, historians, and scholars from different ethnic backgrounds, we can create a more nuanced and accurate understanding of architectural traditions and their significance.

Furthermore, it is crucial to address the impact of Euro-centrism and ethno-centrism on the curriculum and pedagogy of architectural history courses.
